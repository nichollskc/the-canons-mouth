<a id='line_7'>     —Independence Of Britain.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>      The incapacity of a weak and distracted government may often</a>
<a id='line_10'>      assume the appearance, and produce the effects, of a treasonable</a>
<a id='line_11'>      correspondence with the public enemy. If Alaric himself had been</a>
<a id='line_12'>      introduced into the council of Ravenna, he would probably have</a>
<a id='line_13'>      advised the same measures which were actually pursued by the</a>
<a id='line_14'>      ministers of Honorius. 1 The king of the Goths would have</a>
<a id='line_15'>      conspired, perhaps with some reluctance, to destroy the</a>
<a id='line_16'>      formidable adversary, by whose arms, in Italy, as well as in</a>
<a id='line_17'>      Greece, he had been twice overthrown. Their active and interested</a>
<a id='line_18'>      hatred laboriously accomplished the disgrace and ruin of the</a>
<a id='line_19'>      great Stilicho. The valor of Sarus, his fame in arms, and his</a>
<a id='line_20'>      personal, or hereditary, influence over the confederate</a>
<a id='line_21'>      Barbarians, could recommend him only to the friends of their</a>
<a id='line_22'>      country, who despised, or detested, the worthless characters of</a>
<a id='line_23'>      Turpilio, Varanes, and Vigilantius. By the pressing instances of</a>
<a id='line_24'>      the new favorites, these generals, unworthy as they had shown</a>
<a id='line_25'>      themselves of the names of soldiers, 2 were promoted to the</a>
<a id='line_26'>      command of the cavalry, of the infantry, and of the domestic</a>
<a id='line_27'>      troops. The Gothic prince would have subscribed with pleasure the</a>
<a id='line_28'>      edict which the fanaticism of Olympius dictated to the simple and</a>
<a id='line_29'>      devout emperor. Honorius excluded all persons, who were adverse</a>
<a id='line_30'>      to the Catholic church, from holding any office in the state;</a>
<a id='line_31'>      obstinately rejected the service of all those who dissented from</a>
<a id='line_32'>      his religion; and rashly disqualified many of his bravest and</a>
<a id='line_33'>      most skilful officers, who adhered to the Pagan worship, or who</a>
<a id='line_34'>      had imbibed the opinions of Arianism. 3 These measures, so</a>
<a id='line_35'>      advantageous to an enemy, Alaric would have approved, and might</a>
<a id='line_36'>      perhaps have suggested; but it may seem doubtful, whether the</a>
<a id='line_37'>      Barbarian would have promoted his interest at the expense of the</a>
<a id='line_38'>      inhuman and absurd cruelty which was perpetrated by the</a>
<a id='line_39'>      direction, or at least with the connivance of the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_40'>      ministers. The foreign auxiliaries, who had been attached to the</a>
<a id='line_41'>      person of Stilicho, lamented his death; but the desire of revenge</a>
<a id='line_42'>      was checked by a natural apprehension for the safety of their</a>
<a id='line_43'>      wives and children; who were detained as hostages in the strong</a>
<a id='line_44'>      cities of Italy, where they had likewise deposited their most</a>
<a id='line_45'>      valuable effects. At the same hour, and as if by a common signal,</a>
<a id='line_46'>      the cities of Italy were polluted by the same horrid scenes of</a>
<a id='line_47'>      universal massacre and pillage, which involved, in promiscuous</a>
<a id='line_48'>      destruction, the families and fortunes of the Barbarians.</a>
<a id='line_49'>      Exasperated by such an injury, which might have awakened the</a>
<a id='line_50'>      tamest and most servile spirit, they cast a look of indignation</a>
<a id='line_51'>      and hope towards the camp of Alaric, and unanimously swore to</a>
<a id='line_52'>      pursue, with just and implacable war, the perfidious nation who</a>
<a id='line_53'>      had so basely violated the laws of hospitality. By the imprudent</a>
<a id='line_54'>      conduct of the ministers of Honorius, the republic lost the</a>
<a id='line_55'>      assistance, and deserved the enmity, of thirty thousand of her</a>
<a id='line_56'>      bravest soldiers; and the weight of that formidable army, which</a>
<a id='line_57'>      alone might have determined the event of the war, was transferred</a>
<a id='line_58'>      from the scale of the Romans into that of the Goths.</a>

<a id='line_73'></a>
<a id='line_74'>      In the arts of negotiation, as well as in those of war, the</a>
<a id='line_75'>      Gothic king maintained his superior ascendant over an enemy,</a>
<a id='line_76'>      whose seeming changes proceeded from the total want of counsel</a>
<a id='line_77'>      and design. From his camp, on the confines of Italy, Alaric</a>
<a id='line_78'>      attentively observed the revolutions of the palace, watched the</a>
<a id='line_79'>      progress of faction and discontent, disguised the hostile aspect</a>
<a id='line_80'>      of a Barbarian invader, and assumed the more popular appearance</a>
<a id='line_81'>      of the friend and ally of the great Stilicho: to whose virtues,</a>
<a id='line_82'>      when they were no longer formidable, he could pay a just tribute</a>
<a id='line_83'>      of sincere praise and regret. The pressing invitation of the</a>
<a id='line_84'>      malecontents, who urged the king of the Goths to invade Italy,</a>
<a id='line_85'>      was enforced by a lively sense of his personal injuries; and he</a>
<a id='line_86'>      might especially complain, that the Imperial ministers still</a>
<a id='line_87'>      delayed and eluded the payment of the four thousand pounds of</a>
<a id='line_88'>      gold which had been granted by the Roman senate, either to reward</a>
<a id='line_89'>      his services, or to appease his fury. His decent firmness was</a>
<a id='line_90'>      supported by an artful moderation, which contributed to the</a>
<a id='line_91'>      success of his designs. He required a fair and reasonable</a>
<a id='line_92'>      satisfaction; but he gave the strongest assurances, that, as soon</a>
<a id='line_93'>      as he had obtained it, he would immediately retire. He refused to</a>
<a id='line_94'>      trust the faith of the Romans, unless Ætius and Jason, the sons</a>
<a id='line_95'>      of two great officers of state, were sent as hostages to his</a>
<a id='line_96'>      camp; but he offered to deliver, in exchange, several of the</a>
<a id='line_97'>      noblest youths of the Gothic nation. The modesty of Alaric was</a>
<a id='line_98'>      interpreted, by the ministers of Ravenna, as a sure evidence of</a>
<a id='line_99'>      his weakness and fear. They disdained either to negotiate a</a>
<a id='line_100'>      treaty, or to assemble an army; and with a rash confidence,</a>
<a id='line_101'>      derived only from their ignorance of the extreme danger,</a>
<a id='line_102'>      irretrievably wasted the decisive moments of peace and war. While</a>
<a id='line_103'>      they expected, in sullen silence, that the Barbarians would</a>
<a id='line_104'>      evacuate the confines of Italy, Alaric, with bold and rapid</a>
<a id='line_105'>      marches, passed the Alps and the Po; hastily pillaged the cities</a>
<a id='line_106'>      of Aquileia, Altinum, Concordia, and Cremona, which yielded to</a>
<a id='line_107'>      his arms; increased his forces by the accession of thirty</a>
<a id='line_108'>      thousand auxiliaries; and, without meeting a single enemy in the</a>
<a id='line_109'>      field, advanced as far as the edge of the morass which protected</a>
<a id='line_110'>      the impregnable residence of the emperor of the West. Instead of</a>
<a id='line_111'>      attempting the hopeless siege of Ravenna, the prudent leader of</a>
<a id='line_112'>      the Goths proceeded to Rimini, stretched his ravages along the</a>
<a id='line_113'>      sea-coast of the Hadriatic, and meditated the conquest of the</a>
<a id='line_114'>      ancient mistress of the world. An Italian hermit, whose zeal and</a>
<a id='line_115'>      sanctity were respected by the Barbarians themselves, encountered</a>
<a id='line_116'>      the victorious monarch, and boldly denounced the indignation of</a>
<a id='line_117'>      Heaven against the oppressors of the earth; but the saint himself</a>
<a id='line_118'>      was confounded by the solemn asseveration of Alaric, that he felt</a>
<a id='line_119'>      a secret and praeternatural impulse, which directed, and even</a>
<a id='line_120'>      compelled, his march to the gates of Rome. He felt, that his</a>
<a id='line_121'>      genius and his fortune were equal to the most arduous</a>
<a id='line_122'>      enterprises; and the enthusiasm which he communicated to the</a>
<a id='line_123'>      Goths, insensibly removed the popular, and almost superstitious,</a>
<a id='line_124'>      reverence of the nations for the majesty of the Roman name. His</a>
<a id='line_125'>      troops, animated by the hopes of spoil, followed the course of</a>
<a id='line_126'>      the Flaminian way, occupied the unguarded passes of the Apennine,</a>
<a id='line_127'>      4 descended into the rich plains of Umbria; and, as they lay</a>
<a id='line_128'>      encamped on the banks of the Clitumnus, might wantonly slaughter</a>
<a id='line_129'>      and devour the milk-white oxen, which had been so long reserved</a>
<a id='line_130'>      for the use of Roman triumphs. A lofty situation, and a</a>
<a id='line_131'>      seasonable tempest of thunder and lightning, preserved the little</a>
<a id='line_132'>      city of Narni; but the king of the Goths, despising the ignoble</a>
<a id='line_133'>      prey, still advanced with unabated vigor; and after he had passed</a>
<a id='line_134'>      through the stately arches, adorned with the spoils of Barbaric</a>
<a id='line_135'>      victories, he pitched his camp under the walls of Rome. 6</a>

<a id='line_137'>      4 (return) [ Addison (see his Works, vol. ii. p. 54, edit.</a>
<a id='line_138'>      Baskerville) has given a very picturesque description of the road</a>
<a id='line_139'>      through the Apennine. The Goths were not at leisure to observe</a>
<a id='line_140'>      the beauties of the prospect; but they were pleased to find that</a>

<a id='line_158'></a>
<a id='line_159'>      During a period of six hundred and nineteen years, the seat of</a>
<a id='line_160'>      empire had never been violated by the presence of a foreign</a>
<a id='line_161'>      enemy. The unsuccessful expedition of Hannibal 7 served only to</a>
<a id='line_162'>      display the character of the senate and people; of a senate</a>
<a id='line_163'>      degraded, rather than ennobled, by the comparison of an assembly</a>
<a id='line_164'>      of kings; and of a people, to whom the ambassador of Pyrrhus</a>
<a id='line_165'>      ascribed the inexhaustible resources of the Hydra. 8 Each of the</a>
<a id='line_166'>      senators, in the time of the Punic war, had accomplished his term</a>
<a id='line_167'>      of the military service, either in a subordinate or a superior</a>
<a id='line_168'>      station; and the decree, which invested with temporary command</a>
<a id='line_169'>      all those who had been consuls, or censors, or dictators, gave</a>
<a id='line_170'>      the republic the immediate assistance of many brave and</a>
<a id='line_171'>      experienced generals. In the beginning of the war, the Roman</a>
<a id='line_172'>      people consisted of two hundred and fifty thousand citizens of an</a>
<a id='line_173'>      age to bear arms. 9 Fifty thousand had already died in the</a>
<a id='line_174'>      defence of their country; and the twenty-three legions which were</a>
<a id='line_175'>      employed in the different camps of Italy, Greece, Sardinia,</a>
<a id='line_176'>      Sicily, and Spain, required about one hundred thousand men. But</a>
<a id='line_177'>      there still remained an equal number in Rome, and the adjacent</a>
<a id='line_178'>      territory, who were animated by the same intrepid courage; and</a>
<a id='line_179'>      every citizen was trained, from his earliest youth, in the</a>
<a id='line_180'>      discipline and exercises of a soldier. Hannibal was astonished by</a>
<a id='line_181'>      the constancy of the senate, who, without raising the siege of</a>
<a id='line_182'>      Capua, or recalling their scattered forces, expected his</a>
<a id='line_183'>      approach. He encamped on the banks of the Anio, at the distance</a>
<a id='line_184'>      of three miles from the city; and he was soon informed, that the</a>
<a id='line_185'>      ground on which he had pitched his tent, was sold for an adequate</a>
<a id='line_186'>      price at a public auction; 911 and that a body of troops was</a>
<a id='line_187'>      dismissed by an opposite road, to reenforce the legions of Spain.</a>
<a id='line_188'>      10 He led his Africans to the gates of Rome, where he found three</a>
<a id='line_189'>      armies in order of battle, prepared to receive him; but Hannibal</a>
<a id='line_190'>      dreaded the event of a combat, from which he could not hope to</a>
<a id='line_191'>      escape, unless he destroyed the last of his enemies; and his</a>
<a id='line_192'>      speedy retreat confessed the invincible courage of the Romans.</a>

<a id='line_206'>      37:) 270,213, 137,108 214,000. The fall of the second, and the</a>
<a id='line_207'>      rise of the third, appears so enormous, that several critics,</a>
<a id='line_208'>      notwithstanding the unanimity of the Mss., have suspected some</a>

<a id='line_227'>      only of chance and courage. I suspect that they were both managed</a>
<a id='line_228'>      by the admirable policy of the senate.]</a>
<a id='line_229'></a>
<a id='line_230'>      From the time of the Punic war, the uninterrupted succession of</a>
<a id='line_231'>      senators had preserved the name and image of the republic; and</a>
<a id='line_232'>      the degenerate subjects of Honorius ambitiously derived their</a>
<a id='line_233'>      descent from the heroes who had repulsed the arms of Hannibal,</a>
<a id='line_234'>      and subdued the nations of the earth. The temporal honors which</a>
<a id='line_235'>      the devout Paula 11 inherited and despised, are carefully</a>
<a id='line_236'>      recapitulated by Jerom, the guide of her conscience, and the</a>
<a id='line_237'>      historian of her life. The genealogy of her father, Rogatus,</a>
<a id='line_238'>      which ascended as high as Agamemnon, might seem to betray a</a>
<a id='line_239'>      Grecian origin; but her mother, Blaesilla, numbered the Scipios,</a>
<a id='line_240'>      Aemilius Paulus, and the Gracchi, in the list of her ancestors;</a>
<a id='line_241'>      and Toxotius, the husband of Paula, deduced his royal lineage</a>
<a id='line_242'>      from Aeneas, the father of the Julian line. The vanity of the</a>
<a id='line_243'>      rich, who desired to be noble, was gratified by these lofty</a>
<a id='line_244'>      pretensions. Encouraged by the applause of their parasites, they</a>
<a id='line_245'>      easily imposed on the credulity of the vulgar; and were</a>
<a id='line_246'>      countenanced, in some measure, by the custom of adopting the name</a>
<a id='line_247'>      of their patron, which had always prevailed among the freedmen</a>
<a id='line_248'>      and clients of illustrious families. Most of those families,</a>

<a id='line_276'>      In the time of Jerom and Claudian, the senators unanimously</a>

<a id='line_278'>      their history will serve to appreciate the rank and antiquity of</a>
<a id='line_279'>      the noble families, which contended only for the second place. 13</a>
<a id='line_280'>      During the five first ages of the city, the name of the Anicians</a>
<a id='line_281'>      was unknown; they appear to have derived their origin from</a>
<a id='line_282'>      Praeneste; and the ambition of those new citizens was long</a>
<a id='line_283'>      satisfied with the Plebeian honors of tribunes of the people. 14</a>
<a id='line_284'>      One hundred and sixty-eight years before the Christian era, the</a>
<a id='line_285'>      family was ennobled by the Prætorship of Anicius, who gloriously</a>
<a id='line_286'>      terminated the Illyrian war, by the conquest of the nation, and</a>
<a id='line_287'>      the captivity of their king. 15 From the triumph of that general,</a>
<a id='line_288'>      three consulships, in distant periods, mark the succession of the</a>
<a id='line_289'>      Anician name. 16 From the reign of Diocletian to the final</a>
<a id='line_290'>      extinction of the Western empire, that name shone with a lustre</a>
<a id='line_291'>      which was not eclipsed, in the public estimation, by the majesty</a>
<a id='line_292'>      of the Imperial purple. 17 The several branches, to whom it was</a>
<a id='line_293'>      communicated, united, by marriage or inheritance, the wealth and</a>
<a id='line_294'>      titles of the Annian, the Petronian, and the Olybrian houses; and</a>
<a id='line_295'>      in each generation the number of consulships was multiplied by an</a>
<a id='line_296'>      hereditary claim. 18 The Anician family excelled in faith and in</a>
<a id='line_297'>      riches: they were the first of the Roman senate who embraced</a>
<a id='line_298'>      Christianity; and it is probable that Anicius Julian, who was</a>

<a id='line_300'>      attachment to the party of Maxentius, by the readiness with which</a>
<a id='line_301'>      he accepted the religion of Constantine. 19 Their ample patrimony</a>
<a id='line_302'>      was increased by the industry of Probus, the chief of the Anician</a>
<a id='line_303'>      family; who shared with Gratian the honors of the consulship, and</a>
<a id='line_304'>      exercised, four times, the high office of Prætorian præfect. 20</a>

<a id='line_310'>      respect entertained for his memory, that the two sons of Probus,</a>
<a id='line_311'>      in their earliest youth, and at the request of the senate, were</a>

<a id='line_394'>      illustrious family. The accurate description of the city, which</a>
<a id='line_395'>      was composed in the Theodosian age, enumerates one thousand seven</a>
<a id='line_396'>      hundred and eighty houses, the residence of wealthy and honorable</a>
<a id='line_397'>      citizens. 24 Many of these stately mansions might almost excuse</a>
<a id='line_398'>      the exaggeration of the poet; that Rome contained a multitude of</a>
<a id='line_399'>      palaces, and that each palace was equal to a city: since it</a>
<a id='line_400'>      included within its own precincts every thing which could be</a>
<a id='line_401'>      subservient either to use or luxury; markets, hippodromes,</a>
<a id='line_402'>      temples, fountains, baths, porticos, shady groves, and artificial</a>
<a id='line_403'>      aviaries. 25 The historian Olympiodorus, who represents the state</a>
<a id='line_404'>      of Rome when it was besieged by the Goths, 26 continues to</a>
<a id='line_405'>      observe, that several of the richest senators received from their</a>
<a id='line_406'>      estates an annual income of four thousand pounds of gold, above</a>
<a id='line_407'>      one hundred and sixty thousand pounds sterling; without computing</a>
<a id='line_408'>      the stated provision of corn and wine, which, had they been sold,</a>
<a id='line_409'>      might have equalled in value one third of the money. Compared to</a>
<a id='line_410'>      this immoderate wealth, an ordinary revenue of a thousand or</a>
<a id='line_411'>      fifteen hundred pounds of gold might be considered as no more</a>
<a id='line_412'>      than adequate to the dignity of the senatorian rank, which</a>
<a id='line_413'>      required many expenses of a public and ostentatious kind. Several</a>
<a id='line_414'>      examples are recorded, in the age of Honorius, of vain and</a>
<a id='line_415'>      popular nobles, who celebrated the year of their praetorship by a</a>
<a id='line_416'>      festival, which lasted seven days, and cost above one hundred</a>
<a id='line_417'>      thousand pounds sterling. 27 The estates of the Roman senators,</a>
<a id='line_418'>      which so far exceeded the proportion of modern wealth, were not</a>
<a id='line_419'>      confined to the limits of Italy. Their possessions extended far</a>
<a id='line_420'>      beyond the Ionian and Aegean Seas, to the most distant provinces:</a>
<a id='line_421'>      the city of Nicopolis, which Augustus had founded as an eternal</a>
<a id='line_422'>      monument of the Actian victory, was the property of the devout</a>
<a id='line_423'>      Paula; 28 and it is observed by Seneca, that the rivers, which</a>
<a id='line_424'>      had divided hostile nations, now flowed through the lands of</a>
<a id='line_425'>      private citizens. 29 According to their temper and circumstances,</a>
<a id='line_426'>      the estates of the Romans were either cultivated by the labor of</a>
<a id='line_427'>      their slaves, or granted, for a certain and stipulated rent, to</a>
<a id='line_428'>      the industrious farmer. The economical writers of antiquity</a>

<a id='line_504'>      interest of both parties. 31 A considerable mass of treasure must</a>
<a id='line_505'>      always have existed at Rome, either in the current coin of the</a>
<a id='line_506'>      empire, or in the form of gold and silver plate; and there were</a>
<a id='line_507'>      many sideboards in the time of Pliny which contained more solid</a>
<a id='line_508'>      silver, than had been transported by Scipio from vanquished</a>
<a id='line_509'>      Carthage. 32 The greater part of the nobles, who dissipated their</a>
<a id='line_510'>      fortunes in profuse luxury, found themselves poor in the midst of</a>
<a id='line_511'>      wealth, and idle in a constant round of dissipation. Their</a>
<a id='line_512'>      desires were continually gratified by the labor of a thousand</a>
<a id='line_513'>      hands; of the numerous train of their domestic slaves, who were</a>
<a id='line_514'>      actuated by the fear of punishment; and of the various</a>
<a id='line_515'>      professions of artificers and merchants, who were more powerfully</a>
<a id='line_516'>      impelled by the hopes of gain. The ancients were destitute of</a>
<a id='line_517'>      many of the conveniences of life, which have been invented or</a>
<a id='line_518'>      improved by the progress of industry; and the plenty of glass and</a>
<a id='line_519'>      linen has diffused more real comforts among the modern nations of</a>
<a id='line_520'>      Europe, than the senators of Rome could derive from all the</a>
<a id='line_521'>      refinements of pompous or sensual luxury. 33 Their luxury, and</a>
<a id='line_522'>      their manners, have been the subject of minute and laborious</a>
<a id='line_523'>      disposition: but as such inquiries would divert me too long from</a>
<a id='line_524'>      the design of the present work, I shall produce an authentic</a>
<a id='line_525'>      state of Rome and its inhabitants, which is more peculiarly</a>
<a id='line_526'>      applicable to the period of the Gothic invasion. Ammianus</a>
<a id='line_527'>      Marcellinus, who prudently chose the capital of the empire as the</a>
<a id='line_528'>      residence the best adapted to the historian of his own times, has</a>
<a id='line_529'>      mixed with the narrative of public events a lively representation</a>
<a id='line_530'>      of the scenes with which he was familiarly conversant. The</a>
<a id='line_531'>      judicious reader will not always approve of the asperity of</a>
<a id='line_532'>      censure, the choice of circumstances, or the style of expression;</a>
<a id='line_533'>      he will perhaps detect the latent prejudices, and personal</a>
<a id='line_534'>      resentments, which soured the temper of Ammianus himself; but he</a>
<a id='line_535'>      will surely observe, with philosophic curiosity, the interesting</a>
<a id='line_536'>      and original picture of the manners of Rome. 34</a>

<a id='line_541'>      (see Godefroy ad l. ii. tit. xxxiii. tom. i. p. 230-289,) that</a>

<a id='line_568'>      exact.]</a>
<a id='line_569'></a>
<a id='line_570'>      “The greatness of Rome”—such is the language of the</a>
<a id='line_571'>      historian—“was founded on the rare, and almost incredible,</a>
<a id='line_572'>      alliance of virtue and of fortune. The long period of her infancy</a>
<a id='line_573'>      was employed in a laborious struggle against the tribes of Italy,</a>
<a id='line_574'>      the neighbors and enemies of the rising city. In the strength and</a>
<a id='line_575'>      ardor of youth, she sustained the storms of war; carried her</a>
<a id='line_576'>      victorious arms beyond the seas and the mountains; and brought</a>
<a id='line_577'>      home triumphal laurels from every country of the globe. At</a>
<a id='line_578'>      length, verging towards old age, and sometimes conquering by the</a>
<a id='line_579'>      terror only of her name, she sought the blessings of ease and</a>
<a id='line_580'>      tranquillity. The venerable city, which had trampled on the necks</a>
<a id='line_581'>      of the fiercest nations, and established a system of laws, the</a>
<a id='line_582'>      perpetual guardians of justice and freedom, was content, like a</a>
<a id='line_583'>      wise and wealthy parent, to devolve on the Caesars, her favorite</a>
<a id='line_584'>      sons, the care of governing her ample patrimony. 35 A secure and</a>
<a id='line_585'>      profound peace, such as had been once enjoyed in the reign of</a>
<a id='line_586'>      Numa, succeeded to the tumults of a republic; while Rome was</a>
<a id='line_587'>      still adored as the queen of the earth; and the subject nations</a>
<a id='line_588'>      still reverenced the name of the people, and the majesty of the</a>
<a id='line_589'>      senate. But this native splendor,” continues Ammianus, “is</a>
<a id='line_590'>      degraded, and sullied, by the conduct of some nobles, who,</a>
<a id='line_591'>      unmindful of their own dignity, and of that of their country,</a>
<a id='line_592'>      assume an unbounded license of vice and folly. They contend with</a>
<a id='line_593'>      each other in the empty vanity of titles and surnames; and</a>
<a id='line_594'>      curiously select, or invent, the most lofty and sonorous</a>
<a id='line_595'>      appellations, Reburrus, or Fabunius, Pagonius, or Tarasius, 36</a>
<a id='line_596'>      which may impress the ears of the vulgar with astonishment and</a>
<a id='line_597'>      respect. From a vain ambition of perpetuating their memory, they</a>
<a id='line_598'>      affect to multiply their likeness, in statues of bronze and</a>
<a id='line_599'>      marble; nor are they satisfied, unless those statues are covered</a>
<a id='line_600'>      with plates of gold; an honorable distinction, first granted to</a>
<a id='line_601'>      Acilius the consul, after he had subdued, by his arms and</a>
<a id='line_602'>      counsels, the power of King Antiochus. The ostentation of</a>
<a id='line_603'>      displaying, of magnifying, perhaps, the rent-roll of the estates</a>
<a id='line_604'>      which they possess in all the provinces, from the rising to the</a>
<a id='line_605'>      setting sun, provokes the just resentment of every man, who</a>
<a id='line_606'>      recollects, that their poor and invincible ancestors were not</a>
<a id='line_607'>      distinguished from the meanest of the soldiers, by the delicacy</a>
<a id='line_608'>      of their food, or the splendor of their apparel. But the modern</a>
<a id='line_609'>      nobles measure their rank and consequence according to the</a>
<a id='line_610'>      loftiness of their chariots, 37 and the weighty magnificence of</a>
<a id='line_611'>      their dress. Their long robes of silk and purple float in the</a>
<a id='line_612'>      wind; and as they are agitated, by art or accident, they</a>
<a id='line_613'>      occasionally discover the under garments, the rich tunics,</a>
<a id='line_614'>      embroidered with the figures of various animals. 38 Followed by a</a>
<a id='line_615'>      train of fifty servants, and tearing up the pavement, they move</a>
<a id='line_616'>      along the streets with the same impetuous speed as if they</a>
<a id='line_617'>      travelled with post-horses; and the example of the senators is</a>
<a id='line_618'>      boldly imitated by the matrons and ladies, whose covered</a>
<a id='line_619'>      carriages are continually driving round the immense space of the</a>
<a id='line_620'>      city and suburbs. Whenever these persons of high distinction</a>
<a id='line_621'>      condescend to visit the public baths, they assume, on their</a>
<a id='line_622'>      entrance, a tone of loud and insolent command, and appropriate to</a>
<a id='line_623'>      their own use the conveniences which were designed for the Roman</a>
<a id='line_624'>      people. If, in these places of mixed and general resort, they</a>
<a id='line_625'>      meet any of the infamous ministers of their pleasures, they</a>
<a id='line_626'>      express their affection by a tender embrace; while they proudly</a>
<a id='line_627'>      decline the salutations of their fellow-citizens, who are not</a>
<a id='line_628'>      permitted to aspire above the honor of kissing their hands, or</a>
<a id='line_629'>      their knees. As soon as they have indulged themselves in the</a>
<a id='line_630'>      refreshment of the bath, they resume their rings, and the other</a>
<a id='line_631'>      ensigns of their dignity, select from their private wardrobe of</a>
<a id='line_632'>      the finest linen, such as might suffice for a dozen persons, the</a>
<a id='line_633'>      garments the most agreeable to their fancy, and maintain till</a>
<a id='line_634'>      their departure the same haughty demeanor; which perhaps might</a>
<a id='line_635'>      have been excused in the great Marcellus, after the conquest of</a>
<a id='line_636'>      Syracuse. Sometimes, indeed, these heroes undertake more arduous</a>
<a id='line_637'>      achievements; they visit their estates in Italy, and procure</a>
<a id='line_638'>      themselves, by the toil of servile hands, the amusements of the</a>
<a id='line_639'>      chase. 39 If at any time, but more especially on a hot day, they</a>
<a id='line_640'>      have courage to sail, in their painted galleys, from the Lucrine</a>
<a id='line_641'>      Lake 40 to their elegant villas on the seacoast of Puteoli and</a>
<a id='line_642'>      Cayeta, 41 they compare their own expeditions to the marches of</a>
<a id='line_643'>      Caesar and Alexander. Yet should a fly presume to settle on the</a>
<a id='line_644'>      silken folds of their gilded umbrellas; should a sunbeam</a>
<a id='line_645'>      penetrate through some unguarded and imperceptible chink, they</a>
<a id='line_646'>      deplore their intolerable hardships, and lament, in affected</a>
<a id='line_647'>      language, that they were not born in the land of the Cimmerians,</a>
<a id='line_648'>      42 the regions of eternal darkness. In these journeys into the</a>
<a id='line_649'>      country, 43 the whole body of the household marches with their</a>
<a id='line_650'>      master. In the same manner as the cavalry and infantry, the heavy</a>
<a id='line_651'>      and the light armed troops, the advanced guard and the rear, are</a>
<a id='line_652'>      marshalled by the skill of their military leaders; so the</a>
<a id='line_653'>      domestic officers, who bear a rod, as an ensign of authority,</a>
<a id='line_654'>      distribute and arrange the numerous train of slaves and</a>
<a id='line_655'>      attendants. The baggage and wardrobe move in the front; and are</a>
<a id='line_656'>      immediately followed by a multitude of cooks, and inferior</a>
<a id='line_657'>      ministers, employed in the service of the kitchens, and of the</a>
<a id='line_658'>      table. The main body is composed of a promiscuous crowd of</a>
<a id='line_659'>      slaves, increased by the accidental concourse of idle or</a>
<a id='line_660'>      dependent plebeians. The rear is closed by the favorite band of</a>
<a id='line_661'>      eunuchs, distributed from age to youth, according to the order of</a>
<a id='line_662'>      seniority. Their numbers and their deformity excite the horror of</a>
<a id='line_663'>      the indignant spectators, who are ready to execrate the memory of</a>
<a id='line_664'>      Semiramis, for the cruel art which she invented, of frustrating</a>
<a id='line_665'>      the purposes of nature, and of blasting in the bud the hopes of</a>
<a id='line_666'>      future generations. In the exercise of domestic jurisdiction, the</a>
<a id='line_667'>      nobles of Rome express an exquisite sensibility for any personal</a>
<a id='line_668'>      injury, and a contemptuous indifference for the rest of the human</a>
<a id='line_669'>      species. When they have called for warm water, if a slave has</a>
<a id='line_670'>      been tardy in his obedience, he is instantly chastised with three</a>
<a id='line_671'>      hundred lashes: but should the same slave commit a wilful murder,</a>
<a id='line_672'>      the master will mildly observe, that he is a worthless fellow;</a>
<a id='line_673'>      but that, if he repeats the offence, he shall not escape</a>
<a id='line_674'>      punishment. Hospitality was formerly the virtue of the Romans;</a>
<a id='line_675'>      and every stranger, who could plead either merit or misfortune,</a>
<a id='line_676'>      was relieved, or rewarded by their generosity. At present, if a</a>
<a id='line_677'>      foreigner, perhaps of no contemptible rank, is introduced to one</a>
<a id='line_678'>      of the proud and wealthy senators, he is welcomed indeed in the</a>
<a id='line_679'>      first audience, with such warm professions, and such kind</a>
<a id='line_680'>      inquiries, that he retires, enchanted with the affability of his</a>
<a id='line_681'>      illustrious friend, and full of regret that he had so long</a>
<a id='line_682'>      delayed his journey to Rome, the active seat of manners, as well</a>
<a id='line_683'>      as of empire. Secure of a favorable reception, he repeats his</a>
<a id='line_684'>      visit the ensuing day, and is mortified by the discovery, that</a>
<a id='line_685'>      his person, his name, and his country, are already forgotten. If</a>
<a id='line_686'>      he still has resolution to persevere, he is gradually numbered in</a>
<a id='line_687'>      the train of dependants, and obtains the permission to pay his</a>
<a id='line_688'>      assiduous and unprofitable court to a haughty patron, incapable</a>
<a id='line_689'>      of gratitude or friendship; who scarcely deigns to remark his</a>
<a id='line_690'>      presence, his departure, or his return. Whenever the rich prepare</a>
<a id='line_691'>      a solemn and popular entertainment; 44 whenever they celebrate,</a>
<a id='line_692'>      with profuse and pernicious luxury, their private banquets; the</a>
<a id='line_693'>      choice of the guests is the subject of anxious deliberation. The</a>
<a id='line_694'>      modest, the sober, and the learned, are seldom preferred; and the</a>
<a id='line_695'>      nomenclators, who are commonly swayed by interested motives, have</a>
<a id='line_696'>      the address to insert, in the list of invitations, the obscure</a>
<a id='line_697'>      names of the most worthless of mankind. But the frequent and</a>
<a id='line_698'>      familiar companions of the great, are those parasites, who</a>
<a id='line_699'>      practise the most useful of all arts, the art of flattery; who</a>
<a id='line_700'>      eagerly applaud each word, and every action, of their immortal</a>
<a id='line_701'>      patron; gaze with rapture on his marble columns and variegated</a>
<a id='line_702'>      pavements; and strenuously praise the pomp and elegance which he</a>
<a id='line_703'>      is taught to consider as a part of his personal merit. At the</a>
<a id='line_704'>      Roman tables, the birds, the squirrels, 45 or the fish, which</a>
<a id='line_705'>      appear of an uncommon size, are contemplated with curious</a>
<a id='line_706'>      attention; a pair of scales is accurately applied, to ascertain</a>
<a id='line_707'>      their real weight; and, while the more rational guests are</a>
<a id='line_708'>      disgusted by the vain and tedious repetition, notaries are</a>
<a id='line_709'>      summoned to attest, by an authentic record, the truth of such a</a>
<a id='line_710'>      marvelous event. Another method of introduction into the houses</a>
<a id='line_711'>      and society of the great, is derived from the profession of</a>
<a id='line_712'>      gaming, or, as it is more politely styled, of play. The</a>
<a id='line_713'>      confederates are united by a strict and indissoluble bond of</a>
<a id='line_714'>      friendship, or rather of conspiracy; a superior degree of skill</a>
<a id='line_715'>      in the Tesserarian art (which may be interpreted the game of dice</a>
<a id='line_716'>      and tables) 46 is a sure road to wealth and reputation. A master</a>
<a id='line_717'>      of that sublime science, who in a supper, or assembly, is placed</a>
<a id='line_718'>      below a magistrate, displays in his countenance the surprise and</a>
<a id='line_719'>      indignation which Cato might be supposed to feel, when he was</a>
<a id='line_720'>      refused the praetorship by the votes of a capricious people. The</a>
<a id='line_721'>      acquisition of knowledge seldom engages the curiosity of nobles,</a>
<a id='line_722'>      who abhor the fatigue, and disdain the advantages, of study; and</a>
<a id='line_723'>      the only books which they peruse are the Satires of Juvenal, and</a>
<a id='line_724'>      the verbose and fabulous histories of Marius Maximus. 47 The</a>
<a id='line_725'>      libraries, which they have inherited from their fathers, are</a>
<a id='line_726'>      secluded, like dreary sepulchres, from the light of day. 48 But</a>
<a id='line_727'>      the costly instruments of the theatre, flutes, and enormous</a>
<a id='line_728'>      lyres, and hydraulic organs, are constructed for their use; and</a>
<a id='line_729'>      the harmony of vocal and instrumental music is incessantly</a>
<a id='line_730'>      repeated in the palaces of Rome. In those palaces, sound is</a>
<a id='line_731'>      preferred to sense, and the care of the body to that of the</a>
<a id='line_732'>      mind.”</a>
<a id='line_733'></a>
<a id='line_734'>      It is allowed as a salutary maxim, that the light and frivolous</a>
<a id='line_735'>      suspicion of a contagious malady, is of sufficient weight to</a>
<a id='line_736'>      excuse the visits of the most intimate friends; and even the</a>
<a id='line_737'>      servants, who are despatched to make the decent inquiries, are</a>
<a id='line_738'>      not suffered to return home, till they have undergone the</a>
<a id='line_739'>      ceremony of a previous ablution. Yet this selfish and unmanly</a>
<a id='line_740'>      delicacy occasionally yields to the more imperious passion of</a>
<a id='line_741'>      avarice. The prospect of gain will urge a rich and gouty senator</a>
<a id='line_742'>      as far as Spoleto; every sentiment of arrogance and dignity is</a>
<a id='line_743'>      subdued by the hopes of an inheritance, or even of a legacy; and</a>
<a id='line_744'>      a wealthy childless citizen is the most powerful of the Romans.</a>
<a id='line_745'>      The art of obtaining the signature of a favorable testament, and</a>
<a id='line_746'>      sometimes of hastening the moment of its execution, is perfectly</a>
<a id='line_747'>      understood; and it has happened, that in the same house, though</a>
<a id='line_748'>      in different apartments, a husband and a wife, with the laudable</a>
<a id='line_749'>      design of overreaching each other, have summoned their respective</a>
<a id='line_750'>      lawyers, to declare, at the same time, their mutual, but</a>
<a id='line_751'>      contradictory, intentions. The distress which follows and</a>

<a id='line_1184'>      the populousness of ancient Rome. I. When the capital of the</a>

<a id='line_1186'>      accurately measured, by Ammonius, the mathematician, who found it</a>
<a id='line_1187'>      equal to twenty-one miles. 67 It should not be forgotten that the</a>
<a id='line_1188'>      form of the city was almost that of a circle; the geometrical</a>
<a id='line_1189'>      figure which is known to contain the largest space within any</a>
<a id='line_1190'>      given circumference. II. The architect Vitruvius, who flourished</a>
<a id='line_1191'>      in the Augustan age, and whose evidence, on this occasion, has</a>
<a id='line_1192'>      peculiar weight and authority, observes, that the innumerable</a>
<a id='line_1193'>      habitations of the Roman people would have spread themselves far</a>
<a id='line_1194'>      beyond the narrow limits of the city; and that the want of</a>
<a id='line_1195'>      ground, which was probably contracted on every side by gardens</a>
<a id='line_1196'>      and villas, suggested the common, though inconvenient, practice</a>
<a id='line_1197'>      of raising the houses to a considerable height in the air. 68 But</a>
<a id='line_1198'>      the loftiness of these buildings, which often consisted of hasty</a>
<a id='line_1199'>      work and insufficient materials, was the cause of frequent and</a>
<a id='line_1200'>      fatal accidents; and it was repeatedly enacted by Augustus, as</a>
<a id='line_1201'>      well as by Nero, that the height of private edifices within the</a>
<a id='line_1202'>      walls of Rome, should not exceed the measure of seventy feet from</a>
<a id='line_1203'>      the ground. 69 III. Juvenal 70 laments, as it should seem from</a>
<a id='line_1204'>      his own experience, the hardships of the poorer citizens, to whom</a>
<a id='line_1205'>      he addresses the salutary advice of emigrating, without delay,</a>
<a id='line_1206'>      from the smoke of Rome, since they might purchase, in the little</a>
<a id='line_1207'>      towns of Italy, a cheerful commodious dwelling, at the same price</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      which they annually paid for a dark and miserable lodging.</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      House-rent was therefore immoderately dear: the rich acquired, at</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      an enormous expense, the ground, which they covered with palaces</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      and gardens; but the body of the Roman people was crowded into a</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      narrow space; and the different floors, and apartments, of the</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      same house, were divided, as it is still the custom of Paris, and</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      other cities, among several families of plebeians. IV. The total</a>

<a id='line_1216'>      accurately stated in the description of Rome, composed under the</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      reign of Theodosius, and they amount to forty-eight thousand</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      three hundred and eighty-two. 71 The two classes of domus and of</a>

<a id='line_1302'>      that it was impossible to trace them. There was no certain limit,</a>

<a id='line_1308'>      accurately the inhabited area of the city. Though no doubt the</a>
<a id='line_1309'>      city, as reconstructed by Nero, was much less closely built and</a>
<a id='line_1310'>      with many more open spaces for palaces, temples, and other public</a>
<a id='line_1311'>      edifices, yet many passages seem to prove that the laws</a>

<a id='line_1337'></a>
<a id='line_1338'>      Such was the state of Rome under the reign of Honorius; at the</a>
<a id='line_1339'>      time when the Gothic army formed the siege, or rather the</a>
<a id='line_1340'>      blockade, of the city. 74 By a skilful disposition of his</a>
<a id='line_1341'>      numerous forces, who impatiently watched the moment of an</a>
<a id='line_1342'>      assault, Alaric encompassed the walls, commanded the twelve</a>
<a id='line_1343'>      principal gates, intercepted all communication with the adjacent</a>
<a id='line_1344'>      country, and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the Tyber, from</a>
<a id='line_1345'>      which the Romans derived the surest and most plentiful supply of</a>
<a id='line_1346'>      provisions. The first emotions of the nobles, and of the people,</a>
<a id='line_1347'>      were those of surprise and indignation, that a vile Barbarian</a>
<a id='line_1348'>      should dare to insult the capital of the world: but their</a>
<a id='line_1349'>      arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage,</a>
<a id='line_1350'>      instead of being directed against an enemy in arms, was meanly</a>
<a id='line_1351'>      exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim. Perhaps in the</a>
<a id='line_1352'>      person of Serena, the Romans might have respected the niece of</a>
<a id='line_1353'>      Theodosius, the aunt, nay, even the adoptive mother, of the</a>
<a id='line_1354'>      reigning emperor: but they abhorred the widow of Stilicho; and</a>
<a id='line_1355'>      they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny,</a>
<a id='line_1356'>      which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal</a>
<a id='line_1357'>      correspondence with the Gothic invader. Actuated, or overawed, by</a>
<a id='line_1358'>      the same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any</a>
<a id='line_1359'>      evidence of his guilt, pronounced the sentence of her death.</a>
<a id='line_1360'>      Serena was ignominiously strangled; and the infatuated multitude</a>
<a id='line_1361'>      were astonished to find, that this cruel act of injustice did not</a>
<a id='line_1362'>      immediately produce the retreat of the Barbarians, and the</a>
<a id='line_1363'>      deliverance of the city. That unfortunate city gradually</a>
<a id='line_1364'>      experienced the distress of scarcity, and at length the horrid</a>
<a id='line_1365'>      calamities of famine. The daily allowance of three pounds of</a>
<a id='line_1366'>      bread was reduced to one half, to one third, to nothing; and the</a>
<a id='line_1367'>      price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant</a>
<a id='line_1368'>      proportion. The poorer citizens, who were unable to purchase the</a>
<a id='line_1369'>      necessaries of life, solicited the precarious charity of the</a>
<a id='line_1370'>      rich; and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the</a>
<a id='line_1371'>      humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratian, who had</a>
<a id='line_1372'>      fixed her residence at Rome, and consecrated to the use of the</a>
<a id='line_1373'>      indigent the princely revenue which she annually received from</a>
<a id='line_1374'>      the grateful successors of her husband. 75 But these private and</a>
<a id='line_1375'>      temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a</a>
<a id='line_1376'>      numerous people; and the progress of famine invaded the marble</a>
<a id='line_1377'>      palaces of the senators themselves. The persons of both sexes,</a>
<a id='line_1378'>      who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury,</a>
<a id='line_1379'>      discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of</a>
<a id='line_1380'>      nature; and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and</a>
<a id='line_1381'>      silver, to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they</a>
<a id='line_1382'>      would formerly have rejected with disdain. The food the most</a>
<a id='line_1383'>      repugnant to sense or imagination, the aliments the most</a>
<a id='line_1384'>      unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution, were eagerly</a>
<a id='line_1385'>      devoured, and fiercely disputed, by the rage of hunger. A dark</a>
<a id='line_1386'>      suspicion was entertained, that some desperate wretches fed on</a>
<a id='line_1387'>      the bodies of their fellow-creatures, whom they had secretly</a>
<a id='line_1388'>      murdered; and even mothers, (such was the horrid conflict of the</a>
<a id='line_1389'>      two most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the human</a>
<a id='line_1390'>      breast,) even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their</a>
<a id='line_1391'>      slaughtered infants! 76 Many thousands of the inhabitants of Rome</a>
<a id='line_1392'>      expired in their houses, or in the streets, for want of</a>
<a id='line_1393'>      sustenance; and as the public sepulchres without the walls were</a>
<a id='line_1394'>      in the power of the enemy the stench, which arose from so many</a>
<a id='line_1395'>      putrid and unburied carcasses, infected the air; and the miseries</a>
<a id='line_1396'>      of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a</a>
<a id='line_1397'>      pestilential disease. The assurances of speedy and effectual</a>
<a id='line_1398'>      relief, which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of</a>
<a id='line_1399'>      Ravenna, supported for some time, the fainting resolution of the</a>
<a id='line_1400'>      Romans, till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them</a>
<a id='line_1401'>      to accept the offers of a praeternatural deliverance. Pompeianus,</a>
<a id='line_1402'>      præfect of the city, had been persuaded, by the art or</a>

<a id='line_1405'>      the clouds, and point those celestial fires against the camp of</a>
<a id='line_1406'>      the Barbarians. 77 The important secret was communicated to</a>

<a id='line_1491'>      suppliant tone, “If such, O king, are your demands, what do you</a>
<a id='line_1492'>      intend to leave us?” “Your Lives!” replied the haughty conqueror:</a>
<a id='line_1493'>      they trembled, and retired. Yet, before they retired, a short</a>
<a id='line_1494'>      suspension of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a</a>
<a id='line_1495'>      more temperate negotiation. The stern features of Alaric were</a>
<a id='line_1496'>      insensibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigor of his terms; and</a>
<a id='line_1497'>      at length consented to raise the siege, on the immediate payment</a>
<a id='line_1498'>      of five thousand pounds of gold, of thirty thousand pounds of</a>
<a id='line_1499'>      silver, of four thousand robes of silk, of three thousand pieces</a>
<a id='line_1500'>      of fine scarlet cloth, and of three thousand pounds weight of</a>
<a id='line_1501'>      pepper. 79 But the public treasury was exhausted; the annual</a>
<a id='line_1502'>      rents of the great estates in Italy and the provinces, had been</a>
<a id='line_1503'>      exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the</a>
<a id='line_1504'>      hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of</a>
<a id='line_1505'>      avarice; and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only</a>
<a id='line_1506'>      resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city. As soon</a>
<a id='line_1507'>      as the Romans had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they</a>
<a id='line_1508'>      were restored, in some measure, to the enjoyment of peace and</a>
<a id='line_1509'>      plenty. Several of the gates were cautiously opened; the</a>
<a id='line_1510'>      importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country</a>
<a id='line_1511'>      was no longer obstructed by the Goths; the citizens resorted in</a>
<a id='line_1512'>      crowds to the free market, which was held during three days in</a>
<a id='line_1513'>      the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful</a>
<a id='line_1514'>      trade made a considerable profit, the future subsistence of the</a>
<a id='line_1515'>      city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in</a>
<a id='line_1516'>      the public and private granaries. A more regular discipline than</a>
<a id='line_1517'>      could have been expected, was maintained in the camp of Alaric;</a>
<a id='line_1518'>      and the wise Barbarian justified his regard for the faith of</a>
<a id='line_1519'>      treaties, by the just severity with which he chastised a party of</a>
<a id='line_1520'>      licentious Goths, who had insulted some Roman citizens on the</a>
<a id='line_1521'>      road to Ostia. His army, enriched by the contributions of the</a>
<a id='line_1522'>      capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of</a>
<a id='line_1523'>      Tuscany, where he proposed to establish his winter quarters; and</a>
<a id='line_1524'>      the Gothic standard became the refuge of forty thousand Barbarian</a>

<a id='line_1567'>      In the midst of his apparent prosperity, Alaric was conscious,</a>

<a id='line_1570'>      deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of</a>
<a id='line_1571'>      Honorius. The king of the Goths repeatedly declared, that it was</a>
<a id='line_1572'>      his desire to be considered as the friend of peace, and of the</a>
<a id='line_1573'>      Romans. Three senators, at his earnest request, were sent</a>
<a id='line_1574'>      ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of</a>
<a id='line_1575'>      hostages, and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals,</a>
<a id='line_1576'>      which he more clearly expressed during the course of the</a>
<a id='line_1577'>      negotiations, could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as</a>
<a id='line_1578'>      they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune. The</a>
<a id='line_1579'>      Barbarian still aspired to the rank of master-general of the</a>
<a id='line_1580'>      armies of the West; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and</a>
<a id='line_1581'>      money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum, and</a>
<a id='line_1582'>      Venetia, for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have</a>
<a id='line_1583'>      commanded the important communication between Italy and the</a>
<a id='line_1584'>      Danube. If these modest terms should be rejected, Alaric showed a</a>
<a id='line_1585'>      disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to</a>
<a id='line_1586'>      content himself with the possession of Noricum; an exhausted and</a>
<a id='line_1587'>      impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the</a>
<a id='line_1588'>      Barbarians of Germany. 82 But the hopes of peace were</a>
<a id='line_1589'>      disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the</a>
<a id='line_1590'>      minister Olympius. Without listening to the salutary</a>
<a id='line_1591'>      remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under</a>
<a id='line_1592'>      the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of</a>
<a id='line_1593'>      honor, and too feeble for any army of defence. Six thousand</a>

<a id='line_1595'>      march from Ravenna to Rome, through an open country which was</a>
<a id='line_1596'>      occupied by the formidable myriads of the Barbarians. These brave</a>
<a id='line_1597'>      legionaries, encompassed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice to</a>
<a id='line_1598'>      ministerial folly; their general, Valens, with a hundred</a>

<a id='line_1619'>      Honorius, and the empire, to Jovius, the Prætorian præfect; an</a>
<a id='line_1620'>      unworthy servant, who did not atone, by the merit of personal</a>
<a id='line_1621'>      attachment, for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.</a>

<a id='line_1626'>      under the lash; and his ignominious death afforded a grateful</a>
<a id='line_1627'>      spectacle to the friends of Stilicho. After the removal of</a>
<a id='line_1628'>      Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious</a>
<a id='line_1629'>      fanaticism, the Pagans and heretics were delivered from the</a>
<a id='line_1630'>      impolitic proscription, which excluded them from the dignities of</a>
<a id='line_1631'>      the state. The brave Gennerid, 85 a soldier of Barbarian origin,</a>
<a id='line_1632'>      who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been</a>
<a id='line_1633'>      obliged to lay aside the military belt: and though he was</a>
<a id='line_1634'>      repeatedly assured by the emperor himself, that laws were not</a>
<a id='line_1635'>      made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any</a>
<a id='line_1636'>      partial dispensation, and persevered in honorable disgrace, till</a>
<a id='line_1637'>      he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the</a>
<a id='line_1638'>      Roman government. The conduct of Gennerid in the important</a>
<a id='line_1639'>      station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general</a>
<a id='line_1640'>      of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the</a>
<a id='line_1641'>      discipline and spirit of the republic. From a life of idleness</a>
<a id='line_1642'>      and want, his troops were soon habituated to severe exercise and</a>
<a id='line_1643'>      plentiful subsistence; and his private generosity often supplied</a>
<a id='line_1644'>      the rewards, which were denied by the avarice, or poverty, of the</a>
<a id='line_1645'>      court of Ravenna. The valor of Gennerid, formidable to the</a>
<a id='line_1646'>      adjacent Barbarians, was the firmest bulwark of the Illyrian</a>
<a id='line_1647'>      frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a</a>
<a id='line_1648'>      reenforcement of ten thousand Huns, who arrived on the confines</a>
<a id='line_1649'>      of Italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a</a>
<a id='line_1650'>      numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient,</a>
<a id='line_1651'>      not only for the march of an army, but for the settlement of a</a>
<a id='line_1652'>      colony. But the court and councils of Honorius still remained a</a>
<a id='line_1653'>      scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.</a>
<a id='line_1654'>      Instigated by the præfect Jovius, the guards rose in furious</a>
<a id='line_1655'>      mutiny, and demanded the heads of two generals, and of the two</a>
<a id='line_1656'>      principal eunuchs. The generals, under a perfidious promise of</a>
<a id='line_1657'>      safety, were sent on shipboard, and privately executed; while the</a>
<a id='line_1658'>      favor of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at</a>
<a id='line_1659'>      Milan and Constantinople. Eusebius the eunuch, and the Barbarian</a>
<a id='line_1660'>      Allobich, succeeded to the command of the bed-chamber and of the</a>
<a id='line_1661'>      guards; and the mutual jealousy of these subordinate ministers</a>
<a id='line_1662'>      was the cause of their mutual destruction. By the insolent order</a>
<a id='line_1663'>      of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was</a>
<a id='line_1664'>      shamefully beaten to death with sticks, before the eyes of the</a>
<a id='line_1665'>      astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich,</a>
<a id='line_1666'>      in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of</a>
<a id='line_1667'>      his life, in which Honorius discovered the faintest symptom of</a>
<a id='line_1668'>      courage or resentment. Yet before they fell, Eusebius and</a>
<a id='line_1669'>      Allobich had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire, by</a>
<a id='line_1670'>      opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish,</a>
<a id='line_1671'>      and perhaps a criminal, motive, had negotiated with Alaric, in a</a>
<a id='line_1672'>      personal interview under the walls of Rimini. During the absence</a>
<a id='line_1673'>      of Jovius, the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of</a>
<a id='line_1674'>      inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation, nor his</a>
<a id='line_1675'>      character, could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with</a>
<a id='line_1676'>      the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the</a>
<a id='line_1677'>      Prætorian præfect, granting him a free permission to dispose of</a>
<a id='line_1678'>      the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military</a>
<a id='line_1679'>      honors of Rome to the proud demands of a Barbarian. This letter</a>
<a id='line_1680'>      was imprudently communicated to Alaric himself; and the Goth, who</a>
<a id='line_1681'>      in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency,</a>
<a id='line_1682'>      expressed, in the most outrageous language, his lively sense of</a>
<a id='line_1683'>      the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.</a>
<a id='line_1684'>      The conference of Rimini was hastily interrupted; and the</a>
<a id='line_1685'>      præfect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to</a>
<a id='line_1686'>      adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the</a>
<a id='line_1687'>      court. By his advice and example, the principal officers of the</a>
<a id='line_1688'>      state and army were obliged to swear, that, without listening, in</a>
<a id='line_1689'>      any circumstances, to any conditions of peace, they would still</a>
<a id='line_1690'>      persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of</a>
<a id='line_1691'>      the republic. This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to</a>
<a id='line_1692'>      all future negotiation. The ministers of Honorius were heard to</a>
<a id='line_1693'>      declare, that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity,</a>
<a id='line_1694'>      they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to</a>

<a id='line_1697'>      august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their</a>

<a id='line_1736'>      Instead of assaulting the capital, he successfully directed his</a>

<a id='line_1739'>      the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      a winter navigation, and an open road, had suggested to the</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      genius of the first Caesar the useful design, which was executed</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      under the reign of Claudius. The artificial moles, which formed</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      the narrow entrance, advanced far into the sea, and firmly</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      securely rode at anchor within three deep and capacious basins,</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      which received the northern branch of the Tyber, about two miles</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      from the ancient colony of Ostia. 89 The Roman Port insensibly</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      swelled to the size of an episcopal city, 90 where the corn of</a>
<a id='line_1749'>      Africa was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the</a>
<a id='line_1750'>      capital. As soon as Alaric was in possession of that important</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      place, he summoned the city to surrender at discretion; and his</a>

<a id='line_1892'>      committed the walls and gates of the city; and the slumbers of</a>
<a id='line_1893'>      the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of</a>

<a id='line_1899'>      that of his people. The faithful count of Africa transmitted a</a>

<a id='line_1902'>      and oil, introduced famine, tumult, and discontent, into the</a>

<a id='line_1904'>      source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of</a>
<a id='line_1905'>      Attalus; and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated</a>
<a id='line_1906'>      from the interest of a prince, who wanted spirit to command, or</a>
<a id='line_1907'>      docility to obey. The most imprudent measures were adopted,</a>
<a id='line_1908'>      without the knowledge, or against the advice, of Alaric; and the</a>
<a id='line_1909'>      obstinate refusal of the senate, to allow, in the embarkation,</a>
<a id='line_1910'>      the mixture even of five hundred Goths, betrayed a suspicious and</a>
<a id='line_1911'>      distrustful temper, which, in their situation, was neither</a>
<a id='line_1912'>      generous nor prudent. The resentment of the Gothic king was</a>
<a id='line_1913'>      exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised</a>
<a id='line_1914'>      to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double</a>

<a id='line_2087'>      they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.</a>
<a id='line_2088'>      Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely</a>
<a id='line_2089'>      common. The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites,</a>
<a id='line_2090'>      without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their</a>

<a id='line_2095'>      Their were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind, and</a>
<a id='line_2096'>      more general concern. It cannot be presumed, that all the</a>
<a id='line_2097'>      Barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous</a>
<a id='line_2098'>      outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity,</a>
<a id='line_2099'>      protected the greatest part of the Roman women from the danger of</a>

<a id='line_2104'>      preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the</a>
<a id='line_2105'>      greatest value in the smallest compass and weight: but, after</a>
<a id='line_2106'>      these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent</a>
<a id='line_2107'>      robbers, the palaces of Rome were rudely stripped of their</a>
<a id='line_2108'>      splendid and costly furniture. The sideboards of massy plate, and</a>
<a id='line_2109'>      the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly</a>
<a id='line_2110'>      piled in the wagons, that always followed the march of a Gothic</a>
<a id='line_2111'>      army. The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled, or</a>
<a id='line_2112'>      wantonly destroyed; many a statue was melted for the sake of the</a>

<a id='line_2115'></a>
<a id='line_2116'>      The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of</a>
<a id='line_2117'>      the rapacious Barbarians, who proceeded, by threats, by blows,</a>
<a id='line_2118'>      and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of</a>
<a id='line_2119'>      hidden treasure. 104 Visible splendor and expense were alleged as</a>
<a id='line_2120'>      the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was</a>
<a id='line_2121'>      imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some</a>
<a id='line_2122'>      misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would</a>
<a id='line_2123'>      discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many</a>
<a id='line_2124'>      unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash, for refusing to</a>

<a id='line_2127'>      the violence of the Goths. At their entrance through the Salarian</a>

<a id='line_2129'>      distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which</a>
<a id='line_2130'>      encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed</a>

<a id='line_2219'>      Barbarians.—Part V.</a>
<a id='line_2220'></a>
<a id='line_2221'>      Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank, who</a>
<a id='line_2222'>      perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that</a>
<a id='line_2223'>      only one senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy. 108 But</a>
<a id='line_2224'>      it was not easy to compute the multitudes, who, from an honorable</a>
<a id='line_2225'>      station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the</a>
<a id='line_2226'>      miserable condition of captives and exiles. As the Barbarians had</a>
<a id='line_2227'>      more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate</a>
<a id='line_2228'>      price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom</a>
<a id='line_2229'>      was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the</a>
<a id='line_2230'>      charity of strangers. 109 The captives, who were regularly sold,</a>
<a id='line_2231'>      either in open market, or by private contract, would have legally</a>
<a id='line_2232'>      regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a</a>
<a id='line_2233'>      citizen to lose, or to alienate. 110 But as it was soon</a>
<a id='line_2234'>      discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger</a>
<a id='line_2235'>      their lives; and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to</a>
<a id='line_2236'>      sell, might be provoked to murder, their useless prisoners; the</a>
<a id='line_2237'>      civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise</a>
<a id='line_2238'>      regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate</a>
<a id='line_2239'>      term of five years, till they had discharged by their labor the</a>
<a id='line_2240'>      price of their redemption. 111 The nations who invaded the Roman</a>
<a id='line_2241'>      empire, had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of</a>
<a id='line_2242'>      hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude</a>
<a id='line_2243'>      than of famine. The calamities of Rome and Italy dispersed the</a>
<a id='line_2244'>      inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant</a>
<a id='line_2245'>      places of refuge. While the Gothic cavalry spread terror and</a>
<a id='line_2246'>      desolation along the sea-coast of Campania and Tuscany, the</a>
<a id='line_2247'>      little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the</a>
<a id='line_2248'>      Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile</a>
<a id='line_2249'>      attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of</a>
<a id='line_2250'>      citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that</a>
<a id='line_2251'>      sequestered spot. 112 The ample patrimonies, which many</a>
<a id='line_2252'>      senatorian families possessed in Africa, invited them, if they</a>
<a id='line_2253'>      had time, and prudence, to escape from the ruin of their country,</a>
<a id='line_2254'>      to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province. The most</a>
<a id='line_2255'>      illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba, 113</a>
<a id='line_2256'>      the widow of the præfect Petronius. After the death of her</a>
<a id='line_2257'>      husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at</a>
<a id='line_2258'>      the head of the Anician family, and successively supplied, from</a>
<a id='line_2259'>      her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her three</a>
<a id='line_2260'>      sons. When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, Proba</a>
<a id='line_2261'>      supported, with Christian resignation, the loss of immense</a>
<a id='line_2262'>      riches; embarked in a small vessel, from whence she beheld, at</a>
<a id='line_2263'>      sea, the flames of her burning palace, and fled with her daughter</a>
<a id='line_2264'>      Laeta, and her granddaughter, the celebrated virgin, Demetrias,</a>
<a id='line_2265'>      to the coast of Africa. The benevolent profusion with which the</a>
<a id='line_2266'>      matron distributed the fruits, or the price, of her estates,</a>
<a id='line_2267'>      contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.</a>
<a id='line_2268'>      But even the family of Proba herself was not exempt from the</a>
<a id='line_2269'>      rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in</a>
<a id='line_2270'>      matrimonial prostitution, the noblest maidens of Rome to the lust</a>
<a id='line_2271'>      or avarice of the Syrian merchants. The Italian fugitives were</a>
<a id='line_2272'>      dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of Egypt and</a>
<a id='line_2273'>      Asia, as far as Constantinople and Jerusalem; and the village of</a>
<a id='line_2274'>      Bethlem, the solitary residence of St. Jerom and his female</a>
<a id='line_2275'>      converts, was crowded with illustrious beggars of either sex, and</a>
<a id='line_2276'>      every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance</a>
<a id='line_2277'>      of their past fortune. 114 This awful catastrophe of Rome filled</a>
<a id='line_2278'>      the astonished empire with grief and terror. So interesting a</a>
<a id='line_2279'>      contrast of greatness and ruin, disposed the fond credulity of</a>
<a id='line_2280'>      the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of</a>
<a id='line_2281'>      the queen of cities. The clergy, who applied to recent events the</a>

<a id='line_2348'>      much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that</a>
<a id='line_2349'>      the ravages of the Barbarians, whom Alaric had led from the banks</a>
<a id='line_2350'>      of the Danube, were less destructive than the hostilities</a>

<a id='line_2354'>      months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was</a>
<a id='line_2355'>      stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine. The</a>

<a id='line_2358'>      king; but the constable of Bourbon had gloriously fallen in the</a>

<a id='line_2361'>      independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the</a>
<a id='line_2362'>      Germans. In the beginning of the sixteenth century, the manners</a>
<a id='line_2363'>      of Italy exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of</a>
<a id='line_2364'>      mankind. They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an</a>
<a id='line_2365'>      unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring</a>
<a id='line_2366'>      from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who</a>
<a id='line_2367'>      had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to</a>
<a id='line_2368'>      assault the palace of the Roman pontiff, must deserve to be</a>
<a id='line_2369'>      considered as the most profligate of the Italians. At the same</a>
<a id='line_2370'>      era, the Spaniards were the terror both of the Old and New</a>
<a id='line_2371'>      World: but their high-spirited valor was disgraced by gloomy</a>
<a id='line_2372'>      pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty. Indefatigable</a>
<a id='line_2373'>      in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated</a>
<a id='line_2374'>      practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing</a>
<a id='line_2375'>      their prisoners: many of the Castilians, who pillaged Rome, were</a>
<a id='line_2376'>      familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps,</a>

<a id='line_2595'>      understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen</a>

<a id='line_2597'>      related it to St. Jerom, in the presence of the historian</a>
<a id='line_2598'>      Orosius. “In the full confidence of valor and victory, I once</a>
<a id='line_2599'>      aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to</a>
<a id='line_2600'>      obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion</a>
<a id='line_2601'>      of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of</a>
<a id='line_2602'>      the founder of a new empire. By repeated experiments, I was</a>
<a id='line_2603'>      gradually convinced, that laws are essentially necessary to</a>
<a id='line_2604'>      maintain and regulate a well-constituted state; and that the</a>
<a id='line_2605'>      fierce, untractable humor of the Goths was incapable of bearing</a>
<a id='line_2606'>      the salutary yoke of laws and civil government. From that moment</a>
<a id='line_2607'>      I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition;</a>
<a id='line_2608'>      and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages</a>
<a id='line_2609'>      should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the</a>
<a id='line_2610'>      sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain,</a>
<a id='line_2611'>      the prosperity of the Roman empire.” 130 With these pacific</a>
<a id='line_2612'>      views, the successor of Alaric suspended the operations of war;</a>
<a id='line_2613'>      and seriously negotiated with the Imperial court a treaty of</a>
<a id='line_2614'>      friendship and alliance. It was the interest of the ministers of</a>
<a id='line_2615'>      Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their</a>
<a id='line_2616'>      extravagant oath, to deliver Italy from the intolerable weight of</a>
<a id='line_2617'>      the Gothic powers; and they readily accepted their service</a>
<a id='line_2618'>      against the tyrants and Barbarians who infested the provinces</a>
<a id='line_2619'>      beyond the Alps. 131 Adolphus, assuming the character of a Roman</a>
<a id='line_2620'>      general, directed his march from the extremity of Campania to the</a>
<a id='line_2621'>      southern provinces of Gaul. His troops, either by force or</a>
<a id='line_2622'>      agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne,</a>
<a id='line_2623'>      Thoulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count</a>
<a id='line_2624'>      Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their</a>
<a id='line_2625'>      quarters from the Mediterranean to the Ocean.</a>
<a id='line_2626'></a>

<a id='line_2673'>      circumstances of the action, may be aggravated, or excused, by</a>
<a id='line_2674'>      the consideration of her tender age. 134 The victorious</a>
<a id='line_2675'>      Barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive, 135 the</a>
<a id='line_2676'>      sister of Honorius; but, while she was exposed to the disgrace of</a>
<a id='line_2677'>      following round Italy the motions of a Gothic camp, she</a>
<a id='line_2678'>      experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment. The</a>
<a id='line_2679'>      authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may</a>
<a id='line_2680'>      perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive</a>
<a id='line_2681'>      silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendor of her birth, the</a>
<a id='line_2682'>      bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous</a>
<a id='line_2683'>      insinuation which she condescended to employ, made a deep</a>
<a id='line_2684'>      impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the Gothic king aspired</a>
<a id='line_2685'>      to call himself the brother of the emperor. The ministers of</a>
<a id='line_2686'>      Honorius rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so</a>
<a id='line_2687'>      injurious to every sentiment of Roman pride; and repeatedly urged</a>
<a id='line_2688'>      the restitution of Placidia, as an indispensable condition of the</a>
<a id='line_2689'>      treaty of peace. But the daughter of Theodosius submitted,</a>
<a id='line_2690'>      without reluctance, to the desires of the conqueror, a young and</a>
<a id='line_2691'>      valiant prince, who yielded to Alaric in loftiness of stature,</a>
<a id='line_2692'>      but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and</a>
<a id='line_2693'>      beauty. The marriage of Adolphus and Placidia 136 was consummated</a>
<a id='line_2694'>      before the Goths retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the</a>

<a id='line_2696'>      the house of Ingenuus, one of the most illustrious citizens of</a>
<a id='line_2697'>      Narbonne in Gaul. The bride, attired and adorned like a Roman</a>

<a id='line_2704'>      in each hand; and one of these basins was filled with pieces of</a>

<a id='line_2885'>      which might have subverted, or restored, the greatest empires of</a>

<a id='line_2890'>      captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune</a>
<a id='line_2891'>      and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship. 147 When</a>

<a id='line_2893'>      whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned</a>

<a id='line_2896'>      his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of four</a>

<a id='line_2898'>      who had already defended the throne, which he afterwards shared</a>
<a id='line_2899'>      with his feeble sovereign. Honorius viewed, with supine</a>

<a id='line_2901'>      rebellious attempts of Attalus and Heraclian, against his</a>

<a id='line_2948'>      The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the</a>
<a id='line_2949'>      legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.</a>
<a id='line_2950'>      His title was acknowledged, from the wall of Antoninus to the</a>
<a id='line_2951'>      columns of Hercules; and, in the midst of the public disorder he</a>
<a id='line_2952'>      shared the dominion, and the plunder, of Gaul and Spain, with the</a>
<a id='line_2953'>      tribes of Barbarians, whose destructive progress was no longer</a>
<a id='line_2954'>      checked by the Rhine or Pyrenees. Stained with the blood of the</a>
<a id='line_2955'>      kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted, from the court of Ravenna, with</a>
<a id='line_2956'>      which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his</a>
<a id='line_2957'>      rebellious claims. Constantine engaged himself, by a solemn</a>
<a id='line_2958'>      promise, to deliver Italy from the Goths; advanced as far as the</a>
<a id='line_2959'>      banks of the Po; and after alarming, rather than assisting, his</a>
<a id='line_2960'>      pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to</a>
<a id='line_2961'>      celebrate, with intemperate luxury, his vain and ostentatious</a>
<a id='line_2962'>      triumph. But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and</a>
<a id='line_2963'>      destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his</a>
<a id='line_2964'>      generals; who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince</a>
<a id='line_2965'>      already invested with the Imperial purple, had been left to</a>
<a id='line_2966'>      command in the provinces of Spain. From some reason, of which we</a>
<a id='line_2967'>      are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed</a>
<a id='line_2968'>      it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at</a>
<a id='line_2969'>      Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards, through the</a>
<a id='line_2970'>      Pyrenees, to surprise the two emperors, Constantine and Constans,</a>
<a id='line_2971'>      before they could prepare for their defence. The son was made</a>
<a id='line_2972'>      prisoner at Vienna, and immediately put to death: and the</a>
<a id='line_2973'>      unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation</a>
<a id='line_2974'>      of his family; which had tempted, or compelled him,</a>
<a id='line_2975'>      sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic</a>
<a id='line_2976'>      life. The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles;</a>
<a id='line_2977'>      but those walls must have yielded to the assailants, had not the</a>
<a id='line_2978'>      city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an Italian</a>
<a id='line_2979'>      army. The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor,</a>
<a id='line_2980'>      astonished the contending parties of the rebels. Gerontius,</a>
<a id='line_2981'>      abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain;</a>
<a id='line_2982'>      and rescued his name from oblivion, by the Roman courage which</a>
<a id='line_2983'>      appeared to animate the last moments of his life. In the middle</a>
<a id='line_2984'>      of the night, a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded</a>
<a id='line_2985'>      and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded. His</a>
<a id='line_2986'>      wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some</a>
<a id='line_2987'>      faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used,</a>
<a id='line_2988'>      with so much skill and resolution, a large magazine of darts and</a>
<a id='line_2989'>      arrows, that above three hundred of the assailants lost their</a>
<a id='line_2990'>      lives in the attempt. His slaves when all the missile weapons</a>
<a id='line_2991'>      were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not</a>
<a id='line_2992'>      been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their</a>
<a id='line_2993'>      example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate</a>
<a id='line_2994'>      resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house. In this fatal</a>
<a id='line_2995'>      extremity, he complied with the request of his Barbarian friend,</a>
<a id='line_2996'>      and cut off his head. The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not</a>
<a id='line_2997'>      to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly</a>
<a id='line_2998'>      presented her neck to his sword; and the tragic scene was</a>
<a id='line_2999'>      terminated by the death of the count himself, who, after three</a>
<a id='line_3000'>      ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger, and sheathed it in his</a>
<a id='line_3001'>      heart. 151 The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the</a>
<a id='line_3002'>      purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was</a>
<a id='line_3003'>      entertained of his power and abilities. The caprice of the</a>
<a id='line_3004'>      Barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this Imperial</a>
<a id='line_3005'>      phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice</a>
<a id='line_3006'>      of Honorius; and the tyrant Maximus, after he had been shown to</a>
<a id='line_3007'>      the people of Ravenna and Rome, was publicly executed.</a>

<a id='line_3010'>      of despair, appear strange and scandalous in the mouth of an</a>
<a id='line_3011'>      ecclesiastical historian. He observes (p. 379) that the wife of</a>
<a id='line_3012'>      Gerontius was a Christian; and that her death was worthy of her</a>
<a id='line_3013'>      religion, and of immortal fame.]</a>

<a id='line_3015'>      The general, (Constantius was his name,) who raised by his</a>
<a id='line_3016'>      approach the siege of Arles, and dissipated the troops of</a>
<a id='line_3017'>      Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is</a>
<a id='line_3018'>      strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the</a>
<a id='line_3019'>      subjects of the empire. The strength and majesty which were</a>
<a id='line_3020'>      conspicuous in the person of that general, 152 marked him, in the</a>
<a id='line_3021'>      popular opinion, as a candidate worthy of the throne, which he</a>
<a id='line_3022'>      afterwards ascended. In the familiar intercourse of private life,</a>
<a id='line_3023'>      his manners were cheerful and engaging; nor would he sometimes</a>
<a id='line_3024'>      disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the</a>
<a id='line_3025'>      pantomimes themselves, in the exercises of their ridiculous</a>
<a id='line_3026'>      profession. But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he</a>
<a id='line_3027'>      mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular</a>
<a id='line_3028'>      practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large</a>
<a id='line_3029'>      animated eyes round the field, Constantius then struck terror</a>
<a id='line_3030'>      into his foes, and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of</a>
<a id='line_3031'>      victory. He had received from the court of Ravenna the important</a>
<a id='line_3032'>      commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West;</a>
<a id='line_3033'>      and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and</a>
<a id='line_3034'>      anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of</a>
<a id='line_3035'>      a more formidable enemy. Yet this interval allowed time for a</a>
<a id='line_3036'>      successful negotiation with the Franks and Alemanni and his</a>
<a id='line_3037'>      ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army, to</a>
<a id='line_3038'>      disturb the operations of the siege of Arles. The Roman general,</a>
<a id='line_3039'>      instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly and perhaps</a>
<a id='line_3040'>      wisely, resolved to pass the Rhone, and to meet the Barbarians.</a>
<a id='line_3041'>      His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that,</a>
<a id='line_3042'>      while they engaged the infantry of Constantius in the front, they</a>
<a id='line_3043'>      were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed, by the cavalry</a>
<a id='line_3044'>      of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an</a>
<a id='line_3045'>      advantageous post in their rear. The remains of the army of</a>
<a id='line_3046'>      Edobic were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader</a>
<a id='line_3047'>      escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless</a>
<a id='line_3048'>      friend; who too clearly understood, that the head of his</a>
<a id='line_3049'>      obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for</a>
<a id='line_3050'>      the Imperial general. On this occasion, Constantius behaved with</a>
<a id='line_3051'>      the magnanimity of a genuine Roman. Subduing, or suppressing,</a>
<a id='line_3052'>      every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit</a>
<a id='line_3053'>      and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the</a>
<a id='line_3054'>      assassin of Edobic; and sternly intimated his commands, that the</a>
<a id='line_3055'>      camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an</a>
<a id='line_3056'>      ungrateful wretch, who had violated the laws of friendship and</a>
<a id='line_3057'>      hospitality. The usurper, who beheld, from the walls of Arles,</a>
<a id='line_3058'>      the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence</a>
<a id='line_3059'>      in so generous a conqueror. He required a solemn promise for his</a>
<a id='line_3060'>      security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the</a>
<a id='line_3061'>      sacred character of a Christian Presbyter, he ventured to open</a>
<a id='line_3062'>      the gates of the city. But he soon experienced that the</a>
<a id='line_3063'>      principles of honor and integrity, which might regulate the</a>
<a id='line_3064'>      ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose</a>
<a id='line_3065'>      doctrines of political morality. The Roman general, indeed,</a>
<a id='line_3066'>      refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but</a>
<a id='line_3067'>      the abdicated emperor, and his son Julian, were sent under a</a>
<a id='line_3068'>      strong guard into Italy; and before they reached the palace of</a>
<a id='line_3069'>      Ravenna, they met the ministers of death.</a>

<a id='line_3074'>      ii. p. 443, ver 38.) This allusion may prove, that the ancient</a>
<a id='line_3075'>      tragic poets were still familiar to the Greeks of the fifth</a>
<a id='line_3076'>      century.]</a>
<a id='line_3077'></a>
<a id='line_3078'>      At a time when it was universally confessed, that almost every</a>
<a id='line_3079'>      man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes</a>
<a id='line_3080'>      whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a</a>
<a id='line_3081'>      rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their</a>
<a id='line_3082'>      predecessors, still continued to arise. This mischief was</a>
<a id='line_3083'>      peculiarly felt in the provinces of Spain and Gaul, where the</a>
<a id='line_3084'>      principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war</a>
<a id='line_3085'>      and rebellion. Before Constantine resigned the purple, and in the</a>
<a id='line_3086'>      fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in</a>
<a id='line_3087'>      the Imperial camp, that Jovinus has assumed the diadem at Mentz,</a>
<a id='line_3088'>      in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the</a>
<a id='line_3089'>      Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the</a>
<a id='line_3090'>      candidate, on whom they had bestowed the empire, advanced with a</a>
<a id='line_3091'>      formidable host of Barbarians, from the banks of the Rhine to</a>
<a id='line_3092'>      those of the Rhone. Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary</a>
<a id='line_3093'>      in the short history of the reign of Jovinus. It was natural to</a>
<a id='line_3094'>      expect, that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a</a>
<a id='line_3095'>      victorious army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the</a>
<a id='line_3096'>      justice of the cause of Honorius. The hasty retreat of</a>
<a id='line_3097'>      Constantius might be justified by weighty reasons; but he</a>
<a id='line_3098'>      resigned, without a struggle, the possession of Gaul; and</a>
<a id='line_3099'>      Dardanus, the Prætorian præfect, is recorded as the only</a>
<a id='line_3100'>      magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper. 153</a>
<a id='line_3101'>      When the Goths, two years after the siege of Rome, established</a>
<a id='line_3102'>      their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their</a>
<a id='line_3103'>      inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius,</a>
<a id='line_3104'>      with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded</a>
<a id='line_3105'>      Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional</a>
<a id='line_3106'>      purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch. Yet in a</a>
<a id='line_3107'>      moment of disgust, (for which it is not easy to assign a cause,</a>
<a id='line_3108'>      or a date,) Adolphus connected himself with the usurper of Gaul;</a>
<a id='line_3109'>      and imposed on Attalus the ignominious task of negotiating the</a>
<a id='line_3110'>      treaty, which ratified his own disgrace. We are again surprised</a>
<a id='line_3111'>      to read, that, instead of considering the Gothic alliance as the</a>
<a id='line_3112'>      firmest support of his throne, Jovinus upbraided, in dark and</a>
<a id='line_3113'>      ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that,</a>
<a id='line_3114'>      scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the</a>
<a id='line_3115'>      purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently</a>
<a id='line_3116'>      accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the</a>
<a id='line_3117'>      soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a</a>
<a id='line_3118'>      prince, who knew not how to reward or punish. Adolphus, educated</a>
<a id='line_3119'>      among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the</a>
<a id='line_3120'>      most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced</a>
<a id='line_3121'>      with a body of ten thousand Goths to encounter the hereditary</a>
<a id='line_3122'>      enemy of the house of Balti. He attacked Sarus at an unguarded</a>
<a id='line_3123'>      moment, when he was accompanied only by eighteen or twenty of his</a>
<a id='line_3124'>      valiant followers. United by friendship, animated by despair, but</a>
<a id='line_3125'>      at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved</a>
<a id='line_3126'>      the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies;</a>
<a id='line_3127'>      and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils, 154 than he was</a>
<a id='line_3128'>      instantly despatched. The death of Sarus dissolved the loose</a>
<a id='line_3129'>      alliance which Adolphus still maintained with the usurpers of</a>
<a id='line_3130'>      Gaul. He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and</a>
<a id='line_3131'>      soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he</a>
<a id='line_3132'>      would immediately transmit to the palace of Ravenna the heads of</a>
<a id='line_3133'>      the two tyrants, Jovinus and Sebastian. The king of the Goths</a>
<a id='line_3134'>      executed his promise without difficulty or delay; the helpless</a>
<a id='line_3135'>      brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by</a>
<a id='line_3136'>      their Barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of Valentia</a>
<a id='line_3137'>      was expiated by the ruin of one of the noblest cities of Gaul.</a>
<a id='line_3138'>      The emperor, chosen by the Roman senate, who had been promoted,</a>
<a id='line_3139'>      degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted,</a>
<a id='line_3140'>      was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the Gothic king</a>
<a id='line_3141'>      withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt,</a>
<a id='line_3142'>      from offering any violence to the person of Attalus. The</a>
<a id='line_3143'>      unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies,</a>
<a id='line_3144'>      embarked in one of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure</a>
<a id='line_3145'>      and solitary retreat: but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to</a>
<a id='line_3146'>      the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of</a>
<a id='line_3147'>      Rome or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on</a>
<a id='line_3148'>      the second step of the throne of his invincible conqueror. The</a>
<a id='line_3149'>      same measure of punishment, with which, in the days of his</a>
<a id='line_3150'>      prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted</a>
<a id='line_3151'>      on Attalus himself; he was condemned, after the amputation of two</a>
<a id='line_3152'>      fingers, to a perpetual exile in the Isle of Lipari, where he was</a>
<a id='line_3153'>      supplied with the decent necessaries of life. The remainder of</a>
<a id='line_3154'>      the reign of Honorius was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be</a>
<a id='line_3155'>      observed, that, in the space of five years, seven usurpers had</a>
<a id='line_3156'>      yielded to the fortune of a prince, who was himself incapable</a>

<a id='line_3187'>      of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate</a>

<a id='line_3189'>      sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of</a>
<a id='line_3190'>      domestic happiness, that, in a period of four hundred years,</a>
<a id='line_3191'>      Spain furnished very few materials to the history of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_3192'>      empire. The footsteps of the Barbarians, who, in the reign of</a>
<a id='line_3193'>      Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon</a>
<a id='line_3194'>      obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of</a>
<a id='line_3195'>      the Christian era, the cities of Emerita, or Merida, of Corduba,</a>
<a id='line_3196'>      Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most</a>
<a id='line_3197'>      illustrious of the Roman world. The various plenty of the animal,</a>
<a id='line_3198'>      the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and</a>
<a id='line_3199'>      manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the</a>
<a id='line_3200'>      peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an</a>
<a id='line_3201'>      extensive and profitable trade. 155 The arts and sciences</a>
<a id='line_3202'>      flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the</a>
<a id='line_3203'>      character of the Spaniards was enfeebled by peace and servitude,</a>
<a id='line_3204'>      the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and</a>
<a id='line_3205'>      desolation from the Rhine to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle</a>
<a id='line_3206'>      some sparks of military ardor. As long as the defence of the</a>
<a id='line_3207'>      mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the</a>
<a id='line_3208'>      country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the</a>
<a id='line_3209'>      Barbarians. But no sooner had the national troops been compelled</a>
<a id='line_3210'>      to resign their post to the Honorian bands, in the service of</a>
<a id='line_3211'>      Constantine, than the gates of Spain were treacherously betrayed</a>
<a id='line_3212'>      to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of Rome by</a>
<a id='line_3213'>      the Goths. 156 The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of</a>
<a id='line_3214'>      rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the Pyrenees to desert</a>
<a id='line_3215'>      their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and</a>
<a id='line_3216'>      the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with</a>
<a id='line_3217'>      irresistible violence from the frontiers of Gaul to the sea of</a>
<a id='line_3218'>      Africa. The misfortunes of Spain may be described in the language</a>
<a id='line_3219'>      of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the</a>
<a id='line_3220'>      passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary</a>
<a id='line_3221'>      writers. 157 “The irruption of these nations was followed by the</a>
<a id='line_3222'>      most dreadful calamities; as the Barbarians exercised their</a>
<a id='line_3223'>      indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the Romans and the</a>
<a id='line_3224'>      Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open</a>
<a id='line_3225'>      country. The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants</a>
<a id='line_3226'>      to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild</a>
<a id='line_3227'>      beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were</a>
<a id='line_3228'>      exasperated, by the taste of blood, and the impatience of hunger,</a>

<a id='line_3230'>      appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion</a>
<a id='line_3231'>      of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited</a>
<a id='line_3232'>      only the envy of their surviving friends. At length the</a>
<a id='line_3233'>      Barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by</a>
<a id='line_3234'>      the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed</a>

<a id='line_3240'>      territory of Boetica was allotted to the Silingi, another branch</a>

<a id='line_3242'>      conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal</a>
<a id='line_3243'>      engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again</a>
<a id='line_3244'>      cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a</a>
<a id='line_3245'>      captive people. The greatest part of the Spaniards was even</a>
<a id='line_3246'>      disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism,</a>

<a id='line_3341'>      and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign,</a>

<a id='line_3346'>      now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the</a>

<a id='line_3350'>      the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply</a>

<a id='line_3354'>      the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the</a>
<a id='line_3355'>      conduct of the brave Constantius. A solemn treaty was stipulated</a>

<a id='line_3357'>      hundred thousand measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry</a>
<a id='line_3358'>      Goths; 164 and Wallia engaged to draw his sword in the service of</a>

<a id='line_3361'>      addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages,</a>
<a id='line_3362'>      to the throne of the Western emperor, exhorting him to remain a</a>
<a id='line_3363'>      tranquil spectator of their contest; the events of which must be</a>
<a id='line_3364'>      favorable to the Romans, by the mutual slaughter of their common</a>
<a id='line_3365'>      enemies. 165 The Spanish war was obstinately supported, during</a>
<a id='line_3366'>      three campaigns, with desperate valor, and various success; and</a>
<a id='line_3367'>      the martial achievements of Wallia diffused through the empire</a>
<a id='line_3368'>      the superior renown of the Gothic hero. He exterminated the</a>
<a id='line_3369'>      Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the</a>
<a id='line_3370'>      province of Boetica. He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani;</a>
<a id='line_3371'>      and the remains of those Scythian wanderers, who escaped from the</a>
<a id='line_3372'>      field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge</a>
<a id='line_3373'>      under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever</a>
<a id='line_3374'>      afterwards confounded. The Vandals themselves, and the Suevi,</a>
<a id='line_3375'>      yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths. The promiscuous</a>
<a id='line_3376'>      multitude of Barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were</a>
<a id='line_3377'>      driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still</a>
<a id='line_3378'>      continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise</a>
<a id='line_3379'>      their domestic and implacable hostilities. In the pride of</a>
<a id='line_3380'>      victory, Wallia was faithful to his engagements: he restored his</a>
<a id='line_3381'>      Spanish conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny</a>
<a id='line_3382'>      of the Imperial officers soon reduced an oppressed people to</a>

<a id='line_3803'>      been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the</a>

<a id='line_3805'>      would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of</a>
<a id='line_3806'>      natives and freemen. Under the mild and generous influence of</a>
<a id='line_3807'>      liberty, the Roman empire might have remained invincible and</a>
