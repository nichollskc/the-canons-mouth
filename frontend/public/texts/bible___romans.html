                    <a id='line_0'>The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,</a>
<a id='line_4'>separated unto the gospel of God, 1:2 (Which he had promised afore by</a>
<a id='line_5'>his prophets in the holy scriptures,) 1:3 Concerning his Son Jesus</a>
<a id='line_6'>Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the</a>
<a id='line_7'>flesh; 1:4 And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to</a>
<a id='line_8'>the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: 1:5 By whom</a>
<a id='line_9'>we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith</a>
<a id='line_10'>among all nations, for his name: 1:6 Among whom are ye also the called</a>
<a id='line_11'>of Jesus Christ: 1:7 To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to</a>
<a id='line_12'>be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord</a>
<a id='line_13'>Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_14'></a>
<a id='line_15'>1:8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your</a>
<a id='line_16'>faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</a>
<a id='line_17'></a>
<a id='line_18'>1:9 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel</a>
<a id='line_19'>of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my</a>
<a id='line_20'>prayers; 1:10 Making request, if by any means now at length I might</a>
<a id='line_21'>have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</a>
<a id='line_22'></a>
<a id='line_23'>1:11 For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual</a>
<a id='line_24'>gift, to the end ye may be established; 1:12 That is, that I may be</a>
<a id='line_25'>comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</a>
<a id='line_26'></a>
<a id='line_27'>1:13 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I</a>
<a id='line_28'>purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have</a>
<a id='line_29'>some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</a>
<a id='line_30'></a>
<a id='line_31'>1:14 I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to</a>
<a id='line_32'>the wise, and to the unwise.</a>
<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'>1:15 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you</a>
<a id='line_35'>that are at Rome also.</a>
<a id='line_36'></a>
<a id='line_37'>1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power</a>
<a id='line_38'>of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first,</a>
<a id='line_39'>and also to the Greek.</a>
<a id='line_40'></a>
<a id='line_41'>1:17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to</a>
<a id='line_42'>faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</a>
<a id='line_43'></a>
<a id='line_44'>1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all</a>
<a id='line_45'>ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in</a>
<a id='line_46'>unrighteousness; 1:19 Because that which may be known of God is</a>
<a id='line_47'>manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.</a>
<a id='line_48'></a>
<a id='line_49'>1:20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world</a>
<a id='line_50'>are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even</a>
<a id='line_51'>his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: 1:21</a>
<a id='line_52'>Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God,</a>
<a id='line_53'>neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and</a>
<a id='line_54'>their foolish heart was darkened.</a>
<a id='line_55'></a>
<a id='line_56'>1:22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 1:23 And</a>
<a id='line_57'>changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to</a>
<a id='line_58'>corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping</a>
<a id='line_59'>things.</a>
<a id='line_60'></a>
<a id='line_61'>1:24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts</a>
<a id='line_62'>of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</a>
<a id='line_63'>1:25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and</a>
<a id='line_64'>served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.</a>
<a id='line_65'>Amen.</a>
<a id='line_66'></a>
<a id='line_67'>1:26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even</a>
<a id='line_68'>their women did change the natural use into that which is against</a>
<a id='line_69'>nature: 1:27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the</a>
<a id='line_70'>woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working</a>
<a id='line_71'>that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of</a>
<a id='line_72'>their error which was meet.</a>
<a id='line_73'></a>
<a id='line_74'>1:28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge,</a>
<a id='line_75'>God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are</a>
<a id='line_76'>not convenient; 1:29 Being filled with all unrighteousness,</a>
<a id='line_77'>fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy,</a>
<a id='line_78'>murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, 1:30 Backbiters, haters</a>
<a id='line_79'>of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things,</a>
<a id='line_80'>disobedient to parents, 1:31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers,</a>
<a id='line_81'>without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: 1:32 Who knowing</a>
<a id='line_82'>the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of</a>
<a id='line_83'>death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</a>
<a id='line_84'></a>
<a id='line_85'>2:1 Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that</a>
<a id='line_86'>judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself;</a>
<a id='line_87'>for thou that judgest doest the same things.</a>
<a id='line_88'></a>
<a id='line_89'>2:2 But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth</a>
<a id='line_90'>against them which commit such things.</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>2:3 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such</a>
<a id='line_93'>things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of</a>
<a id='line_94'>God?  2:4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance</a>
<a id='line_95'>and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee</a>
<a id='line_96'>to repentance?  2:5 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart</a>
<a id='line_97'>treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and</a>
<a id='line_98'>revelation of the righteous judgment of God; 2:6 Who will render to</a>
<a id='line_99'>every man according to his deeds: 2:7 To them who by patient</a>
<a id='line_100'>continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality,</a>
<a id='line_101'>eternal life: 2:8 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey</a>
<a id='line_102'>the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, 2:9</a>
<a id='line_103'>Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of</a>
<a id='line_104'>the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; 2:10 But glory, honour, and</a>
<a id='line_105'>peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to</a>
<a id='line_106'>the Gentile: 2:11 For there is no respect of persons with God.</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'>2:12 For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without</a>
<a id='line_109'>law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;</a>
<a id='line_110'>2:13 (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the</a>
<a id='line_111'>doers of the law shall be justified.</a>
<a id='line_112'></a>
<a id='line_113'>2:14 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the</a>
<a id='line_114'>things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto</a>
<a id='line_115'>themselves: 2:15 Which shew the work of the law written in their</a>
<a id='line_116'>hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the</a>
<a id='line_117'>mean while accusing or else excusing one another;) 2:16 In the day</a>
<a id='line_118'>when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to</a>
<a id='line_119'>my gospel.</a>
<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>2:17 Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest</a>
<a id='line_122'>thy boast of God, 2:18 And knowest his will, and approvest the things</a>
<a id='line_123'>that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law; 2:19 And art</a>
<a id='line_124'>confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them</a>
<a id='line_125'>which are in darkness, 2:20 An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of</a>
<a id='line_126'>babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>2:21 Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself?</a>
<a id='line_129'>thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?  2:22</a>
<a id='line_130'>Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit</a>
<a id='line_131'>adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?  2:23</a>
<a id='line_132'>Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law</a>
<a id='line_133'>dishonourest thou God?  2:24 For the name of God is blasphemed among</a>
<a id='line_134'>the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>2:25 For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if</a>
<a id='line_137'>thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</a>
<a id='line_138'></a>
<a id='line_139'>2:26 Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the</a>
<a id='line_140'>law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?  2:27</a>
<a id='line_141'>And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law,</a>
<a id='line_142'>judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the</a>
<a id='line_143'>law?  2:28 For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is</a>
<a id='line_144'>that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: 2:29 But he is a</a>
<a id='line_145'>Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in</a>
<a id='line_146'>the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of</a>
<a id='line_147'>God.</a>
<a id='line_148'></a>
<a id='line_149'>3:1 What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of</a>
<a id='line_150'>circumcision?  3:2 Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them</a>
<a id='line_151'>were committed the oracles of God.</a>
<a id='line_152'></a>
<a id='line_153'>3:3 For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the</a>
<a id='line_154'>faith of God without effect?  3:4 God forbid: yea, let God be true,</a>
<a id='line_155'>but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be</a>
<a id='line_156'>justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</a>
<a id='line_157'></a>
<a id='line_158'>3:5 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what</a>
<a id='line_159'>shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a</a>
<a id='line_160'>man) 3:6 God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?  3:7 For</a>
<a id='line_161'>if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory;</a>
<a id='line_162'>why yet am I also judged as a sinner?  3:8 And not rather, (as we be</a>
<a id='line_163'>slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do</a>
<a id='line_164'>evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</a>
<a id='line_165'></a>
<a id='line_166'>3:9 What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have</a>
<a id='line_167'>before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</a>
<a id='line_168'>3:10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: 3:11</a>
<a id='line_169'>There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after</a>
<a id='line_170'>God.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>3:12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become</a>
<a id='line_173'>unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>3:13 Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have</a>
<a id='line_176'>used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: 3:14 Whose mouth</a>
<a id='line_177'>is full of cursing and bitterness: 3:15 Their feet are swift to shed</a>
<a id='line_178'>blood: 3:16 Destruction and misery are in their ways: 3:17 And the way</a>
<a id='line_179'>of peace have they not known: 3:18 There is no fear of God before</a>
<a id='line_180'>their eyes.</a>
<a id='line_181'></a>
<a id='line_182'>3:19 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to</a>
<a id='line_183'>them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all</a>
<a id='line_184'>the world may become guilty before God.</a>
<a id='line_185'></a>
<a id='line_186'>3:20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be</a>
<a id='line_187'>justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>3:21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested,</a>
<a id='line_190'>being witnessed by the law and the prophets; 3:22 Even the</a>
<a id='line_191'>righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and</a>
<a id='line_192'>upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 3:23 For all</a>
<a id='line_193'>have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 3:24 Being justified</a>
<a id='line_194'>freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</a>
<a id='line_195'>3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his</a>
<a id='line_196'>blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are</a>
<a id='line_197'>past, through the forbearance of God; 3:26 To declare, I say, at this</a>
<a id='line_198'>time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of</a>
<a id='line_199'>him which believeth in Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_200'></a>
<a id='line_201'>3:27 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works?</a>
<a id='line_202'>Nay: but by the law of faith.</a>
<a id='line_203'></a>
<a id='line_204'>3:28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without</a>
<a id='line_205'>the deeds of the law.</a>
<a id='line_206'></a>
<a id='line_207'>3:29 Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles?</a>
<a id='line_208'>Yes, of the Gentiles also: 3:30 Seeing it is one God, which shall</a>
<a id='line_209'>justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</a>
<a id='line_210'></a>
<a id='line_211'>3:31 Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we</a>
<a id='line_212'>establish the law.</a>
<a id='line_213'></a>
<a id='line_214'>4:1 What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to</a>
<a id='line_215'>the flesh, hath found?  4:2 For if Abraham were justified by works, he</a>
<a id='line_216'>hath whereof to glory; but not before God.</a>
<a id='line_217'></a>
<a id='line_218'>4:3 For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was</a>
<a id='line_219'>counted unto him for righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_220'></a>
<a id='line_221'>4:4 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but</a>
<a id='line_222'>of debt.</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>4:5 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth</a>
<a id='line_225'>the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>4:6 Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto</a>
<a id='line_228'>whom God imputeth righteousness without works, 4:7 Saying, Blessed are</a>
<a id='line_229'>they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>4:8 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</a>
<a id='line_232'></a>
<a id='line_233'>4:9 Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon</a>
<a id='line_234'>the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham</a>
<a id='line_235'>for righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>4:10 How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in</a>
<a id='line_238'>uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>4:11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the</a>
<a id='line_241'>righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that</a>
<a id='line_242'>he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not</a>
<a id='line_243'>circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: 4:12</a>
<a id='line_244'>And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision</a>
<a id='line_245'>only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father</a>
<a id='line_246'>Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.</a>
<a id='line_247'></a>
<a id='line_248'>4:13 For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not</a>
<a id='line_249'>to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the</a>
<a id='line_250'>righteousness of faith.</a>
<a id='line_251'></a>
<a id='line_252'>4:14 For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void,</a>
<a id='line_253'>and the promise made of none effect: 4:15 Because the law worketh</a>
<a id='line_254'>wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.</a>
<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'>4:16 Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end</a>
<a id='line_257'>the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is</a>
<a id='line_258'>of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is</a>
<a id='line_259'>the father of us all, 4:17 (As it is written, I have made thee a</a>
<a id='line_260'>father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who</a>
<a id='line_261'>quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though</a>
<a id='line_262'>they were.</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>4:18 Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the</a>
<a id='line_265'>father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall</a>
<a id='line_266'>thy seed be.</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>4:19 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now</a>
<a id='line_269'>dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness</a>
<a id='line_270'>of Sarah’s womb: 4:20 He staggered not at the promise of God through</a>
<a id='line_271'>unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; 4:21 And being</a>
<a id='line_272'>fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to</a>
<a id='line_273'>perform.</a>
<a id='line_274'></a>
<a id='line_275'>4:22 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_276'></a>
<a id='line_277'>4:23 Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to</a>
<a id='line_278'>him; 4:24 But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe</a>
<a id='line_279'>on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; 4:25 Who was</a>
<a id='line_280'>delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our</a>
<a id='line_281'>justification.</a>
<a id='line_282'></a>
<a id='line_283'>5:1 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through</a>
<a id='line_284'>our Lord Jesus Christ: 5:2 By whom also we have access by faith into</a>
<a id='line_285'>this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</a>
<a id='line_286'></a>
<a id='line_287'>5:3 And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that</a>
<a id='line_288'>tribulation worketh patience; 5:4 And patience, experience; and</a>
<a id='line_289'>experience, hope: 5:5 And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of</a>
<a id='line_290'>God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto</a>
<a id='line_291'>us.</a>
<a id='line_292'></a>
<a id='line_293'>5:6 For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for</a>
<a id='line_294'>the ungodly.</a>
<a id='line_295'></a>
<a id='line_296'>5:7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure</a>
<a id='line_297'>for a good man some would even dare to die.</a>
<a id='line_298'></a>
<a id='line_299'>5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet</a>
<a id='line_300'>sinners, Christ died for us.</a>
<a id='line_301'></a>
<a id='line_302'>5:9 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be</a>
<a id='line_303'>saved from wrath through him.</a>
<a id='line_304'></a>
<a id='line_305'>5:10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the</a>
<a id='line_306'>death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by</a>
<a id='line_307'>his life.</a>
<a id='line_308'></a>
<a id='line_309'>5:11 And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus</a>
<a id='line_310'>Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</a>
<a id='line_311'></a>
<a id='line_312'>5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by</a>
<a id='line_313'>sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: 5:13</a>
<a id='line_314'>(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when</a>
<a id='line_315'>there is no law.</a>
<a id='line_316'></a>
<a id='line_317'>5:14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them</a>
<a id='line_318'>that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who</a>
<a id='line_319'>is the figure of him that was to come.</a>
<a id='line_320'></a>
<a id='line_321'>5:15 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through</a>
<a id='line_322'>the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the</a>
<a id='line_323'>gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto</a>
<a id='line_324'>many.</a>
<a id='line_325'></a>
<a id='line_326'>5:16 And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the</a>
<a id='line_327'>judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many</a>
<a id='line_328'>offences unto justification.</a>
<a id='line_329'></a>
<a id='line_330'>5:17 For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they</a>
<a id='line_331'>which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness</a>
<a id='line_332'>shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)  5:18 Therefore as by the</a>
<a id='line_333'>offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by</a>
<a id='line_334'>the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto</a>
<a id='line_335'>justification of life.</a>
<a id='line_336'></a>
<a id='line_337'>5:19 For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by</a>
<a id='line_338'>the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</a>
<a id='line_339'></a>
<a id='line_340'>5:20 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But</a>
<a id='line_341'>where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: 5:21 That as sin hath</a>
<a id='line_342'>reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness</a>
<a id='line_343'>unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</a>
<a id='line_344'></a>
<a id='line_345'>6:1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may</a>
<a id='line_346'>abound?  6:2 God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any</a>
<a id='line_347'>longer therein?  6:3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized</a>
<a id='line_348'>into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?  6:4 Therefore we are</a>
<a id='line_349'>buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised</a>
<a id='line_350'>up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should</a>
<a id='line_351'>walk in newness of life.</a>
<a id='line_352'></a>
<a id='line_353'>6:5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death,</a>
<a id='line_354'>we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: 6:6 Knowing</a>
<a id='line_355'>this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin</a>
<a id='line_356'>might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</a>
<a id='line_357'></a>
<a id='line_358'>6:7 For he that is dead is freed from sin.</a>
<a id='line_359'></a>
<a id='line_360'>6:8 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live</a>
<a id='line_361'>with him: 6:9 Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no</a>
<a id='line_362'>more; death hath no more dominion over him.</a>
<a id='line_363'></a>
<a id='line_364'>6:10 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he</a>
<a id='line_365'>liveth, he liveth unto God.</a>
<a id='line_366'></a>
<a id='line_367'>6:11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin,</a>
<a id='line_368'>but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</a>
<a id='line_369'></a>
<a id='line_370'>6:12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should</a>
<a id='line_371'>obey it in the lusts thereof.</a>
<a id='line_372'></a>
<a id='line_373'>6:13 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness</a>
<a id='line_374'>unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from</a>
<a id='line_375'>the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.</a>
<a id='line_376'></a>
<a id='line_377'>6:14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under</a>
<a id='line_378'>the law, but under grace.</a>
<a id='line_379'></a>
<a id='line_380'>6:15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but</a>
<a id='line_381'>under grace? God forbid.</a>
<a id='line_382'></a>
<a id='line_383'>6:16 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey,</a>
<a id='line_384'>his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of</a>
<a id='line_385'>obedience unto righteousness?  6:17 But God be thanked, that ye were</a>
<a id='line_386'>the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of</a>
<a id='line_387'>doctrine which was delivered you.</a>
<a id='line_388'></a>
<a id='line_389'>6:18 Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of</a>
<a id='line_390'>righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_391'></a>
<a id='line_392'>6:19 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your</a>
<a id='line_393'>flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and</a>
<a id='line_394'>to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to</a>
<a id='line_395'>righteousness unto holiness.</a>
<a id='line_396'></a>
<a id='line_397'>6:20 For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from</a>
<a id='line_398'>righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_399'></a>
<a id='line_400'>6:21 What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now</a>
<a id='line_401'>ashamed?  for the end of those things is death.</a>
<a id='line_402'></a>
<a id='line_403'>6:22 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye</a>
<a id='line_404'>have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</a>
<a id='line_405'></a>
<a id='line_406'>6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal</a>
<a id='line_407'>life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</a>
<a id='line_408'></a>
<a id='line_409'>7:1 Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,)</a>
<a id='line_410'>how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?  7:2</a>
<a id='line_411'>For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband</a>
<a id='line_412'>so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from</a>
<a id='line_413'>the law of her husband.</a>
<a id='line_414'></a>
<a id='line_415'>7:3 So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another</a>
<a id='line_416'>man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead,</a>
<a id='line_417'>she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be</a>
<a id='line_418'>married to another man.</a>
<a id='line_419'></a>
<a id='line_420'>7:4 Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the</a>
<a id='line_421'>body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who</a>
<a id='line_422'>is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</a>
<a id='line_423'></a>
<a id='line_424'>7:5 For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by</a>
<a id='line_425'>the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</a>
<a id='line_426'></a>
<a id='line_427'>7:6 But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we</a>
<a id='line_428'>were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the</a>
<a id='line_429'>oldness of the letter.</a>
<a id='line_430'></a>
<a id='line_431'>7:7 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not</a>
<a id='line_432'>known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law</a>
<a id='line_433'>had said, Thou shalt not covet.</a>
<a id='line_434'></a>
<a id='line_435'>7:8 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all</a>
<a id='line_436'>manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.</a>
<a id='line_437'></a>
<a id='line_438'>7:9 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment</a>
<a id='line_439'>came, sin revived, and I died.</a>
<a id='line_440'></a>
<a id='line_441'>7:10 And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be</a>
<a id='line_442'>unto death.</a>
<a id='line_443'></a>
<a id='line_444'>7:11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by</a>
<a id='line_445'>it slew me.</a>
<a id='line_446'></a>
<a id='line_447'>7:12 Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,</a>
<a id='line_448'>and good.</a>
<a id='line_449'></a>
<a id='line_450'>7:13 Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But</a>
<a id='line_451'>sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is</a>
<a id='line_452'>good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</a>
<a id='line_453'></a>
<a id='line_454'>7:14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold</a>
<a id='line_455'>under sin.</a>
<a id='line_456'></a>
<a id='line_457'>7:15 For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not;</a>
<a id='line_458'>but what I hate, that do I.</a>
<a id='line_459'></a>
<a id='line_460'>7:16 If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that</a>
<a id='line_461'>it is good.</a>
<a id='line_462'></a>
<a id='line_463'>7:17 Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</a>
<a id='line_464'></a>
<a id='line_465'>7:18 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good</a>
<a id='line_466'>thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which</a>
<a id='line_467'>is good I find not.</a>
<a id='line_468'></a>
<a id='line_469'>7:19 For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would</a>
<a id='line_470'>not, that I do.</a>
<a id='line_471'></a>
<a id='line_472'>7:20 Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin</a>
<a id='line_473'>that dwelleth in me.</a>
<a id='line_474'></a>
<a id='line_475'>7:21 I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present</a>
<a id='line_476'>with me.</a>
<a id='line_477'></a>
<a id='line_478'>7:22 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: 7:23 But I</a>
<a id='line_479'>see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and</a>
<a id='line_480'>bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</a>
<a id='line_481'></a>
<a id='line_482'>7:24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of</a>
<a id='line_483'>this death?  7:25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then</a>
<a id='line_484'>with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the</a>
<a id='line_485'>law of sin.</a>
<a id='line_486'></a>
<a id='line_487'>8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ</a>
<a id='line_488'>Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</a>
<a id='line_489'></a>
<a id='line_490'>8:2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me</a>
<a id='line_491'>free from the law of sin and death.</a>
<a id='line_492'></a>
<a id='line_493'>8:3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the</a>
<a id='line_494'>flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and</a>
<a id='line_495'>for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: 8:4 That the righteousness of the</a>
<a id='line_496'>law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after</a>
<a id='line_497'>the Spirit.</a>
<a id='line_498'></a>
<a id='line_499'>8:5 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh;</a>
<a id='line_500'>but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.</a>
<a id='line_501'></a>
<a id='line_502'>8:6 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded</a>
<a id='line_503'>is life and peace.</a>
<a id='line_504'></a>
<a id='line_505'>8:7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not</a>
<a id='line_506'>subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</a>
<a id='line_507'></a>
<a id='line_508'>8:8 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</a>
<a id='line_509'></a>
<a id='line_510'>8:9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the</a>
<a id='line_511'>Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of</a>
<a id='line_512'>Christ, he is none of his.</a>
<a id='line_513'></a>
<a id='line_514'>8:10 And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the</a>
<a id='line_515'>Spirit is life because of righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_516'></a>
<a id='line_517'>8:11 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell</a>
<a id='line_518'>in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your</a>
<a id='line_519'>mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</a>
<a id='line_520'></a>
<a id='line_521'>8:12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live</a>
<a id='line_522'>after the flesh.</a>
<a id='line_523'></a>
<a id='line_524'>8:13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through</a>
<a id='line_525'>the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</a>
<a id='line_526'></a>
<a id='line_527'>8:14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of</a>
<a id='line_528'>God.</a>
<a id='line_529'></a>
<a id='line_530'>8:15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but</a>
<a id='line_531'>ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</a>
<a id='line_532'></a>
<a id='line_533'>8:16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are</a>
<a id='line_534'>the children of God: 8:17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God,</a>
<a id='line_535'>and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we</a>
<a id='line_536'>may be also glorified together.</a>
<a id='line_537'></a>
<a id='line_538'>8:18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not</a>
<a id='line_539'>worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</a>
<a id='line_540'></a>
<a id='line_541'>8:19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the</a>
<a id='line_542'>manifestation of the sons of God.</a>
<a id='line_543'></a>
<a id='line_544'>8:20 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but</a>
<a id='line_545'>by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope, 8:21 Because the</a>
<a id='line_546'>creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption</a>
<a id='line_547'>into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</a>
<a id='line_548'></a>
<a id='line_549'>8:22 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in</a>
<a id='line_550'>pain together until now.</a>
<a id='line_551'></a>
<a id='line_552'>8:23 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits</a>
<a id='line_553'>of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for</a>
<a id='line_554'>the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</a>
<a id='line_555'></a>
<a id='line_556'>8:24 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for</a>
<a id='line_557'>what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?  8:25 But if we hope for</a>
<a id='line_558'>that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</a>
<a id='line_559'></a>
<a id='line_560'>8:26 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not</a>
<a id='line_561'>what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh</a>
<a id='line_562'>intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</a>
<a id='line_563'></a>
<a id='line_564'>8:27 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the</a>
<a id='line_565'>Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the</a>
<a id='line_566'>will of God.</a>
<a id='line_567'></a>
<a id='line_568'>8:28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that</a>
<a id='line_569'>love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</a>
<a id='line_570'></a>
<a id='line_571'>8:29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be</a>
<a id='line_572'>conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn</a>
<a id='line_573'>among many brethren.</a>
<a id='line_574'></a>
<a id='line_575'>8:30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom</a>
<a id='line_576'>he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also</a>
<a id='line_577'>glorified.</a>
<a id='line_578'></a>
<a id='line_579'>8:31 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can</a>
<a id='line_580'>be against us?  8:32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him</a>
<a id='line_581'>up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all</a>
<a id='line_582'>things?  8:33 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It</a>
<a id='line_583'>is God that justifieth.</a>
<a id='line_584'></a>
<a id='line_585'>8:34 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather,</a>
<a id='line_586'>that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also</a>
<a id='line_587'>maketh intercession for us.</a>
<a id='line_588'></a>
<a id='line_589'>8:35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation,</a>
<a id='line_590'>or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or</a>
<a id='line_591'>sword?  8:36 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day</a>
<a id='line_592'>long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</a>
<a id='line_593'></a>
<a id='line_594'>8:37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him</a>
<a id='line_595'>that loved us.</a>
<a id='line_596'></a>
<a id='line_597'>8:38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor</a>
<a id='line_598'>principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</a>
<a id='line_599'>8:39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to</a>
<a id='line_600'>separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</a>
<a id='line_601'></a>
<a id='line_602'>9:1 I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing</a>
<a id='line_603'>me witness in the Holy Ghost, 9:2 That I have great heaviness and</a>
<a id='line_604'>continual sorrow in my heart.</a>
<a id='line_605'></a>
<a id='line_606'>9:3 For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my</a>
<a id='line_607'>brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: 9:4 Who are Israelites;</a>
<a id='line_608'>to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and</a>
<a id='line_609'>the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; 9:5</a>
<a id='line_610'>Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ</a>
<a id='line_611'>came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_612'></a>
<a id='line_613'>9:6 Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are</a>
<a id='line_614'>not all Israel, which are of Israel: 9:7 Neither, because they are the</a>
<a id='line_615'>seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed</a>
<a id='line_616'>be called.</a>
<a id='line_617'></a>
<a id='line_618'>9:8 That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not</a>
<a id='line_619'>the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for</a>
<a id='line_620'>the seed.</a>
<a id='line_621'></a>
<a id='line_622'>9:9 For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and</a>
<a id='line_623'>Sarah shall have a son.</a>
<a id='line_624'></a>
<a id='line_625'>9:10 And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one,</a>
<a id='line_626'>even by our father Isaac; 9:11 (For the children being not yet born,</a>
<a id='line_627'>neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God</a>
<a id='line_628'>according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that</a>
<a id='line_629'>calleth;) 9:12 It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the</a>
<a id='line_630'>younger.</a>
<a id='line_631'></a>
<a id='line_632'>9:13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</a>
<a id='line_633'></a>
<a id='line_634'>9:14 What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God</a>
<a id='line_635'>forbid.</a>
<a id='line_636'></a>
<a id='line_637'>9:15 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have</a>
<a id='line_638'>mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</a>
<a id='line_639'></a>
<a id='line_640'>9:16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,</a>
<a id='line_641'>but of God that sheweth mercy.</a>
<a id='line_642'></a>
<a id='line_643'>9:17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose</a>
<a id='line_644'>have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my</a>
<a id='line_645'>name might be declared throughout all the earth.</a>
<a id='line_646'></a>
<a id='line_647'>9:18 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he</a>
<a id='line_648'>will he hardeneth.</a>
<a id='line_649'></a>
<a id='line_650'>9:19 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who</a>
<a id='line_651'>hath resisted his will?  9:20 Nay but, O man, who art thou that</a>
<a id='line_652'>repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed</a>
<a id='line_653'>it, Why hast thou made me thus?  9:21 Hath not the potter power over</a>
<a id='line_654'>the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another</a>
<a id='line_655'>unto dishonour?  9:22 What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to</a>
<a id='line_656'>make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of</a>
<a id='line_657'>wrath fitted to destruction: 9:23 And that he might make known the</a>
<a id='line_658'>riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore</a>
<a id='line_659'>prepared unto glory, 9:24 Even us, whom he hath called, not of the</a>
<a id='line_660'>Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?  9:25 As he saith also in Osee, I</a>
<a id='line_661'>will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved,</a>
<a id='line_662'>which was not beloved.</a>
<a id='line_663'></a>
<a id='line_664'>9:26 And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said</a>
<a id='line_665'>unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the</a>
<a id='line_666'>children of the living God.</a>
<a id='line_667'></a>
<a id='line_668'>9:27 Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the</a>
<a id='line_669'>children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be</a>
<a id='line_670'>saved: 9:28 For he will finish the work, and cut it short in</a>
<a id='line_671'>righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_672'></a>
<a id='line_673'>9:29 And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us</a>
<a id='line_674'>a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.</a>
<a id='line_675'></a>
<a id='line_676'>9:30 What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not</a>
<a id='line_677'>after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the</a>
<a id='line_678'>righteousness which is of faith.</a>
<a id='line_679'></a>
<a id='line_680'>9:31 But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath</a>
<a id='line_681'>not attained to the law of righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_682'></a>
<a id='line_683'>9:32 Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by</a>
<a id='line_684'>the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; 9:33</a>
<a id='line_685'>As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of</a>
<a id='line_686'>offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</a>
<a id='line_687'></a>
<a id='line_688'>10:1 Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that</a>
<a id='line_689'>they might be saved.</a>
<a id='line_690'></a>
<a id='line_691'>10:2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not</a>
<a id='line_692'>according to knowledge.</a>
<a id='line_693'></a>
<a id='line_694'>10:3 For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about</a>
<a id='line_695'>to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves</a>
<a id='line_696'>unto the righteousness of God.</a>
<a id='line_697'></a>
<a id='line_698'>10:4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one</a>
<a id='line_699'>that believeth.</a>
<a id='line_700'></a>
<a id='line_701'>10:5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That</a>
<a id='line_702'>the man which doeth those things shall live by them.</a>
<a id='line_703'></a>
<a id='line_704'>10:6 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,</a>
<a id='line_705'>Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to</a>
<a id='line_706'>bring Christ down from above:) 10:7 Or, Who shall descend into the</a>
<a id='line_707'>deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)  10:8 But</a>
<a id='line_708'>what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy</a>
<a id='line_709'>heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; 10:9 That if thou</a>
<a id='line_710'>shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in</a>
<a id='line_711'>thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be</a>
<a id='line_712'>saved.</a>
<a id='line_713'></a>
<a id='line_714'>10:10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with</a>
<a id='line_715'>the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</a>
<a id='line_716'></a>
<a id='line_717'>10:11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be</a>
<a id='line_718'>ashamed.</a>
<a id='line_719'></a>
<a id='line_720'>10:12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for</a>
<a id='line_721'>the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.</a>
<a id='line_722'></a>
<a id='line_723'>10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be</a>
<a id='line_724'>saved.</a>
<a id='line_725'></a>
<a id='line_726'>10:14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?</a>
<a id='line_727'>and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how</a>
<a id='line_728'>shall they hear without a preacher?  10:15 And how shall they preach,</a>
<a id='line_729'>except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of</a>
<a id='line_730'>them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good</a>
<a id='line_731'>things!  10:16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias</a>
<a id='line_732'>saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?  10:17 So then faith cometh</a>
<a id='line_733'>by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</a>
<a id='line_734'></a>
<a id='line_735'>10:18 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went</a>
<a id='line_736'>into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.</a>
<a id='line_737'></a>
<a id='line_738'>10:19 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will</a>
<a id='line_739'>provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish</a>
<a id='line_740'>nation I will anger you.</a>
<a id='line_741'></a>
<a id='line_742'>10:20 But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that</a>
<a id='line_743'>sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.</a>
<a id='line_744'></a>
<a id='line_745'>10:21 But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my</a>
<a id='line_746'>hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.</a>
<a id='line_747'></a>
<a id='line_748'>11:1 I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also</a>
<a id='line_749'>am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</a>
<a id='line_750'></a>
<a id='line_751'>11:2 God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not</a>
<a id='line_752'>what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God</a>
<a id='line_753'>against Israel saying, 11:3 Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and</a>
<a id='line_754'>digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</a>
<a id='line_755'></a>
<a id='line_756'>11:4 But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to</a>
<a id='line_757'>myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of</a>
<a id='line_758'>Baal.</a>
<a id='line_759'></a>
<a id='line_760'>11:5 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant</a>
<a id='line_761'>according to the election of grace.</a>
<a id='line_762'></a>
<a id='line_763'>11:6 And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is</a>
<a id='line_764'>no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace:</a>
<a id='line_765'>otherwise work is no more work.</a>
<a id='line_766'></a>
<a id='line_767'>11:7 What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for;</a>
<a id='line_768'>but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.</a>
<a id='line_769'></a>
<a id='line_770'>11:8 (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of</a>
<a id='line_771'>slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not</a>
<a id='line_772'>hear;) unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_773'></a>
<a id='line_774'>11:9 And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and</a>
<a id='line_775'>a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them: 11:10 Let their eyes be</a>
<a id='line_776'>darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</a>
<a id='line_777'></a>
<a id='line_778'>11:11 I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God</a>
<a id='line_779'>forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the</a>
<a id='line_780'>Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</a>
<a id='line_781'></a>
<a id='line_782'>11:12 Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the</a>
<a id='line_783'>diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their</a>
<a id='line_784'>fulness?  11:13 For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the</a>
<a id='line_785'>apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office: 11:14 If by any means</a>
<a id='line_786'>I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save</a>
<a id='line_787'>some of them.</a>
<a id='line_788'></a>
<a id='line_789'>11:15 For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world,</a>
<a id='line_790'>what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?  11:16</a>
<a id='line_791'>For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root</a>
<a id='line_792'>be holy, so are the branches.</a>
<a id='line_793'></a>
<a id='line_794'>11:17 And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a</a>
<a id='line_795'>wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest</a>
<a id='line_796'>of the root and fatness of the olive tree; 11:18 Boast not against the</a>
<a id='line_797'>branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root</a>
<a id='line_798'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_799'></a>
<a id='line_800'>11:19 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might</a>
<a id='line_801'>be graffed in.</a>
<a id='line_802'></a>
<a id='line_803'>11:20 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou</a>
<a id='line_804'>standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear: 11:21 For if God</a>
<a id='line_805'>spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not</a>
<a id='line_806'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_807'></a>
<a id='line_808'>11:22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which</a>
<a id='line_809'>fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his</a>
<a id='line_810'>goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</a>
<a id='line_811'></a>
<a id='line_812'>11:23 And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be</a>
<a id='line_813'>graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.</a>
<a id='line_814'></a>
<a id='line_815'>11:24 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by</a>
<a id='line_816'>nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree:</a>
<a id='line_817'>how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed</a>
<a id='line_818'>into their own olive tree?  11:25 For I would not, brethren, that ye</a>
<a id='line_819'>should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own</a>
<a id='line_820'>conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the</a>
<a id='line_821'>fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</a>
<a id='line_822'></a>
<a id='line_823'>11:26 And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall</a>
<a id='line_824'>come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from</a>
<a id='line_825'>Jacob: 11:27 For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away</a>
<a id='line_826'>their sins.</a>
<a id='line_827'></a>
<a id='line_828'>11:28 As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but</a>
<a id='line_829'>as touching the election, they are beloved for the father’s sakes.</a>
<a id='line_830'></a>
<a id='line_831'>11:29 For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</a>
<a id='line_832'></a>
<a id='line_833'>11:30 For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now</a>
<a id='line_834'>obtained mercy through their unbelief: 11:31 Even so have these also</a>
<a id='line_835'>now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</a>
<a id='line_836'></a>
<a id='line_837'>11:32 For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have</a>
<a id='line_838'>mercy upon all.</a>
<a id='line_839'></a>
<a id='line_840'>11:33 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of</a>
<a id='line_841'>God!  how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding</a>
<a id='line_842'>out!  11:34 For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been</a>
<a id='line_843'>his counsellor?  11:35 Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be</a>
<a id='line_844'>recompensed unto him again?  11:36 For of him, and through him, and to</a>
<a id='line_845'>him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_846'></a>
<a id='line_847'>12:1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye</a>
<a id='line_848'>present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,</a>
<a id='line_849'>which is your reasonable service.</a>
<a id='line_850'></a>
<a id='line_851'>12:2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the</a>
<a id='line_852'>renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and</a>
<a id='line_853'>acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</a>
<a id='line_854'></a>
<a id='line_855'>12:3 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is</a>
<a id='line_856'>among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think;</a>
<a id='line_857'>but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the</a>
<a id='line_858'>measure of faith.</a>
<a id='line_859'></a>
<a id='line_860'>12:4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not</a>
<a id='line_861'>the same office: 12:5 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and</a>
<a id='line_862'>every one members one of another.</a>
<a id='line_863'></a>
<a id='line_864'>12:6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given</a>
<a id='line_865'>to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion</a>
<a id='line_866'>of faith; 12:7 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that</a>
<a id='line_867'>teacheth, on teaching; 12:8 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he</a>
<a id='line_868'>that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with</a>
<a id='line_869'>diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.</a>
<a id='line_870'></a>
<a id='line_871'>12:9 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil;</a>
<a id='line_872'>cleave to that which is good.</a>
<a id='line_873'></a>
<a id='line_874'>12:10 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in</a>
<a id='line_875'>honour preferring one another; 12:11 Not slothful in business; fervent</a>
<a id='line_876'>in spirit; serving the Lord; 12:12 Rejoicing in hope; patient in</a>
<a id='line_877'>tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; 12:13 Distributing to the</a>
<a id='line_878'>necessity of saints; given to hospitality.</a>
<a id='line_879'></a>
<a id='line_880'>12:14 Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.</a>
<a id='line_881'></a>
<a id='line_882'>12:15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</a>
<a id='line_883'></a>
<a id='line_884'>12:16 Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things,</a>
<a id='line_885'>but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.</a>
<a id='line_886'></a>
<a id='line_887'>12:17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the</a>
<a id='line_888'>sight of all men.</a>
<a id='line_889'></a>
<a id='line_890'>12:18 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with</a>
<a id='line_891'>all men.</a>
<a id='line_892'></a>
<a id='line_893'>12:19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place</a>
<a id='line_894'>unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith</a>
<a id='line_895'>the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_896'></a>
<a id='line_897'>12:20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give</a>
<a id='line_898'>him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.</a>
<a id='line_899'></a>
<a id='line_900'>12:21 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</a>
<a id='line_901'></a>
<a id='line_902'>13:1 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no</a>
<a id='line_903'>power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.</a>
<a id='line_904'></a>
<a id='line_905'>13:2 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance</a>
<a id='line_906'>of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.</a>
<a id='line_907'></a>
<a id='line_908'>13:3 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt</a>
<a id='line_909'>thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou</a>
<a id='line_910'>shalt have praise of the same: 13:4 For he is the minister of God to</a>
<a id='line_911'>thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he</a>
<a id='line_912'>beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a</a>
<a id='line_913'>revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</a>
<a id='line_914'></a>
<a id='line_915'>13:5 Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also</a>
<a id='line_916'>for conscience sake.</a>
<a id='line_917'></a>
<a id='line_918'>13:6 For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s</a>
<a id='line_919'>ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.</a>
<a id='line_920'></a>
<a id='line_921'>13:7 Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is</a>
<a id='line_922'>due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.</a>
<a id='line_923'></a>
<a id='line_924'>13:8 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth</a>
<a id='line_925'>another hath fulfilled the law.</a>
<a id='line_926'></a>
<a id='line_927'>13:9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill,</a>
<a id='line_928'>Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_929'>not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly</a>
<a id='line_930'>comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as</a>
<a id='line_931'>thyself.</a>
<a id='line_932'></a>
<a id='line_933'>13:10 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the</a>
<a id='line_934'>fulfilling of the law.</a>
<a id='line_935'></a>
<a id='line_936'>13:11 And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake</a>
<a id='line_937'>out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.</a>
<a id='line_938'></a>
<a id='line_939'>13:12 The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore</a>
<a id='line_940'>cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.</a>
<a id='line_941'></a>
<a id='line_942'>13:13 Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and</a>
<a id='line_943'>drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and</a>
<a id='line_944'>envying.</a>
<a id='line_945'></a>
<a id='line_946'>13:14 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for</a>
<a id='line_947'>the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.</a>
<a id='line_948'></a>
<a id='line_949'>14:1 Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful</a>
<a id='line_950'>disputations.</a>
<a id='line_951'></a>
<a id='line_952'>14:2 For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is</a>
<a id='line_953'>weak, eateth herbs.</a>
<a id='line_954'></a>
<a id='line_955'>14:3 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not</a>
<a id='line_956'>him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.</a>
<a id='line_957'></a>
<a id='line_958'>14:4 Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own</a>
<a id='line_959'>master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is</a>
<a id='line_960'>able to make him stand.</a>
<a id='line_961'></a>
<a id='line_962'>14:5 One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every</a>
<a id='line_963'>day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</a>
<a id='line_964'></a>
<a id='line_965'>14:6 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he</a>
<a id='line_966'>that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that</a>
<a id='line_967'>eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that</a>
<a id='line_968'>eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</a>
<a id='line_969'></a>
<a id='line_970'>14:7 For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</a>
<a id='line_971'></a>
<a id='line_972'>14:8 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die,</a>
<a id='line_973'>we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the</a>
<a id='line_974'>Lord’s.</a>
<a id='line_975'></a>
<a id='line_976'>14:9 For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he</a>
<a id='line_977'>might be Lord both of the dead and living.</a>
<a id='line_978'></a>
<a id='line_979'>14:10 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at</a>
<a id='line_980'>nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of</a>
<a id='line_981'>Christ.</a>
<a id='line_982'></a>
<a id='line_983'>14:11 For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall</a>
<a id='line_984'>bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</a>
<a id='line_985'></a>
<a id='line_986'>14:12 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</a>
<a id='line_987'></a>
<a id='line_988'>14:13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this</a>
<a id='line_989'>rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his</a>
<a id='line_990'>brother’s way.</a>
<a id='line_991'></a>
<a id='line_992'>14:14 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is</a>
<a id='line_993'>nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be</a>
<a id='line_994'>unclean, to him it is unclean.</a>
<a id='line_995'></a>
<a id='line_996'>14:15 But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou</a>
<a id='line_997'>not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</a>
<a id='line_998'></a>
<a id='line_999'>14:16 Let not then your good be evil spoken of: 14:17 For the kingdom</a>
<a id='line_1000'>of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in</a>
<a id='line_1001'>the Holy Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_1002'></a>
<a id='line_1003'>14:18 For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God,</a>
<a id='line_1004'>and approved of men.</a>
<a id='line_1005'></a>
<a id='line_1006'>14:19 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace,</a>
<a id='line_1007'>and things wherewith one may edify another.</a>
<a id='line_1008'></a>
<a id='line_1009'>14:20 For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are</a>
<a id='line_1010'>pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</a>
<a id='line_1011'></a>
<a id='line_1012'>14:21 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any</a>
<a id='line_1013'>thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</a>
<a id='line_1014'></a>
<a id='line_1015'>14:22 Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that</a>
<a id='line_1016'>condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.</a>
<a id='line_1017'></a>
<a id='line_1018'>14:23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not</a>
<a id='line_1019'>of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</a>
<a id='line_1020'></a>
<a id='line_1021'>15:1 We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the</a>
<a id='line_1022'>weak, and not to please ourselves.</a>
<a id='line_1023'></a>
<a id='line_1024'>15:2 Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to</a>
<a id='line_1025'>edification.</a>
<a id='line_1026'></a>
<a id='line_1027'>15:3 For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The</a>
<a id='line_1028'>reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.</a>
<a id='line_1029'></a>
<a id='line_1030'>15:4 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our</a>
<a id='line_1031'>learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might</a>
<a id='line_1032'>have hope.</a>
<a id='line_1033'></a>
<a id='line_1034'>15:5 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be</a>
<a id='line_1035'>likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus: 15:6 That ye</a>
<a id='line_1036'>may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our</a>
<a id='line_1037'>Lord Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1038'></a>
<a id='line_1039'>15:7 Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to</a>
<a id='line_1040'>the glory of God.</a>
<a id='line_1041'></a>
<a id='line_1042'>15:8 Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision</a>
<a id='line_1043'>for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:</a>
<a id='line_1044'>15:9 And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is</a>
<a id='line_1045'>written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and</a>
<a id='line_1046'>sing unto thy name.</a>
<a id='line_1047'></a>
<a id='line_1048'>15:10 And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.</a>
<a id='line_1049'></a>
<a id='line_1050'>15:11 And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all</a>
<a id='line_1051'>ye people.</a>
<a id='line_1052'></a>
<a id='line_1053'>15:12 And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he</a>
<a id='line_1054'>that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles</a>
<a id='line_1055'>trust.</a>
<a id='line_1056'></a>
<a id='line_1057'>15:13 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in</a>
<a id='line_1058'>believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy</a>
<a id='line_1059'>Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_1060'></a>
<a id='line_1061'>15:14 And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also</a>
<a id='line_1062'>are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish</a>
<a id='line_1063'>one another.</a>
<a id='line_1064'></a>
<a id='line_1065'>15:15 Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you</a>
<a id='line_1066'>in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is</a>
<a id='line_1067'>given to me of God, 15:16 That I should be the minister of Jesus</a>
<a id='line_1068'>Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the</a>
<a id='line_1069'>offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by</a>
<a id='line_1070'>the Holy Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_1071'></a>
<a id='line_1072'>15:17 I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in</a>
<a id='line_1073'>those things which pertain to God.</a>
<a id='line_1074'></a>
<a id='line_1075'>15:18 For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ</a>
<a id='line_1076'>hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and</a>
<a id='line_1077'>deed, 15:19 Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the</a>
<a id='line_1078'>Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum,</a>
<a id='line_1079'>I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1080'></a>
<a id='line_1081'>15:20 Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ</a>
<a id='line_1082'>was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation: 15:21</a>
<a id='line_1083'>But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see:</a>
<a id='line_1084'>and they that have not heard shall understand.</a>
<a id='line_1085'></a>
<a id='line_1086'>15:22 For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to</a>
<a id='line_1087'>you.</a>
<a id='line_1088'></a>
<a id='line_1089'>15:23 But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great</a>
<a id='line_1090'>desire these many years to come unto you; 15:24 Whensoever I take my</a>
<a id='line_1091'>journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my</a>
<a id='line_1092'>journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be</a>
<a id='line_1093'>somewhat filled with your company.</a>
<a id='line_1094'></a>
<a id='line_1095'>15:25 But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.</a>
<a id='line_1096'></a>
<a id='line_1097'>15:26 For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a</a>
<a id='line_1098'>certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1099'></a>
<a id='line_1100'>15:27 It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if</a>
<a id='line_1101'>the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their</a>
<a id='line_1102'>duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.</a>
<a id='line_1103'></a>
<a id='line_1104'>15:28 When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them</a>
<a id='line_1105'>this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.</a>
<a id='line_1106'></a>
<a id='line_1107'>15:29 And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the</a>
<a id='line_1108'>fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1109'></a>
<a id='line_1110'>15:30 Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake,</a>
<a id='line_1111'>and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in</a>
<a id='line_1112'>your prayers to God for me; 15:31 That I may be delivered from them</a>
<a id='line_1113'>that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for</a>
<a id='line_1114'>Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints; 15:32 That I may come unto</a>
<a id='line_1115'>you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.</a>
<a id='line_1116'></a>
<a id='line_1117'>15:33 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_1118'></a>
<a id='line_1119'>16:1 I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the</a>
<a id='line_1120'>church which is at Cenchrea: 16:2 That ye receive her in the Lord, as</a>
<a id='line_1121'>becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she</a>
<a id='line_1122'>hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself</a>
<a id='line_1123'>also.</a>
<a id='line_1124'></a>
<a id='line_1125'>16:3 Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus: 16:4 Who</a>
<a id='line_1126'>have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give</a>
<a id='line_1127'>thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.</a>
<a id='line_1128'></a>
<a id='line_1129'>16:5 Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my</a>
<a id='line_1130'>well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1131'></a>
<a id='line_1132'>16:6 Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.</a>
<a id='line_1133'></a>
<a id='line_1134'>16:7 Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners,</a>
<a id='line_1135'>who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.</a>
<a id='line_1136'></a>
<a id='line_1137'>16:8 Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_1138'></a>
<a id='line_1139'>16:9 Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.</a>
<a id='line_1140'></a>
<a id='line_1141'>16:10 Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of</a>
<a id='line_1142'>Aristobulus’ household.</a>
<a id='line_1143'></a>
<a id='line_1144'>16:11 Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household</a>
<a id='line_1145'>of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_1146'></a>
<a id='line_1147'>16:12 Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the</a>
<a id='line_1148'>beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_1149'></a>
<a id='line_1150'>16:13 Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.</a>
<a id='line_1151'></a>
<a id='line_1152'>16:14 Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the</a>
<a id='line_1153'>brethren which are with them.</a>
<a id='line_1154'></a>
<a id='line_1155'>16:15 Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and</a>
<a id='line_1156'>Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.</a>
<a id='line_1157'></a>
<a id='line_1158'>16:16 Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ</a>
<a id='line_1159'>salute you.</a>
<a id='line_1160'></a>
<a id='line_1161'>16:17 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and</a>
<a id='line_1162'>offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid</a>
<a id='line_1163'>them.</a>
<a id='line_1164'></a>
<a id='line_1165'>16:18 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but</a>
<a id='line_1166'>their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the</a>
<a id='line_1167'>hearts of the simple.</a>
<a id='line_1168'></a>
<a id='line_1169'>16:19 For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad</a>

<a id='line_1171'>which is good, and simple concerning evil.</a>
<a id='line_1172'></a>
<a id='line_1173'>16:20 And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.</a>
<a id='line_1174'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_1175'></a>
<a id='line_1176'>16:21 Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater,</a>
<a id='line_1177'>my kinsmen, salute you.</a>
<a id='line_1178'></a>
<a id='line_1179'>16:22 I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.</a>

<a id='line_1186'>16:25 Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my</a>
<a id='line_1187'>gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation</a>
<a id='line_1188'>of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began, 16:26 But</a>
<a id='line_1189'>now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according</a>
<a id='line_1190'>to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations</a>
