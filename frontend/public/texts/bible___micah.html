<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the</a>
<a id='line_4'>days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw</a>
<a id='line_5'>concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>1:2 Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is:</a>
<a id='line_8'>and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the LORD from his holy</a>
<a id='line_9'>temple.</a>
<a id='line_10'></a>
<a id='line_11'>1:3 For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come</a>
<a id='line_12'>down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_13'></a>
<a id='line_14'>1:4 And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall</a>
<a id='line_15'>be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured</a>
<a id='line_16'>down a steep place.</a>
<a id='line_17'></a>
<a id='line_18'>1:5 For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of</a>
<a id='line_19'>the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not</a>
<a id='line_20'>Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not</a>
<a id='line_21'>Jerusalem?  1:6 Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field,</a>
<a id='line_22'>and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones</a>
<a id='line_23'>thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'>1:7 And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and</a>
<a id='line_26'>all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols</a>
<a id='line_27'>thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an</a>
<a id='line_28'>harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>1:8 Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I</a>
<a id='line_31'>will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.</a>
<a id='line_32'></a>
<a id='line_33'>1:9 For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come</a>
<a id='line_34'>unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_35'></a>
<a id='line_36'>1:10 Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of</a>
<a id='line_37'>Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.</a>
<a id='line_38'></a>
<a id='line_39'>1:11 Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked:</a>
<a id='line_40'>the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel;</a>
<a id='line_41'>he shall receive of you his standing.</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>1:12 For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil</a>
<a id='line_44'>came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_45'></a>
<a id='line_46'>1:13 O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift</a>
<a id='line_47'>beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for</a>
<a id='line_48'>the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.</a>
<a id='line_49'></a>
<a id='line_50'>1:14 Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses</a>
<a id='line_51'>of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>1:15 Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he</a>
<a id='line_54'>shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_55'></a>
<a id='line_56'>1:16 Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge</a>
<a id='line_57'>thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.</a>
<a id='line_58'></a>
<a id='line_59'>2:1 Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds!</a>
<a id='line_60'>when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the</a>
<a id='line_61'>power of their hand.</a>
<a id='line_62'></a>
<a id='line_63'>2:2 And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and</a>
<a id='line_64'>take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and</a>
<a id='line_65'>his heritage.</a>
<a id='line_66'></a>
<a id='line_67'>2:3 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I</a>
<a id='line_68'>devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither</a>
<a id='line_69'>shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.</a>
<a id='line_70'></a>
<a id='line_71'>2:4 In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament</a>
<a id='line_72'>with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath</a>
<a id='line_73'>changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me!</a>
<a id='line_74'>turning away he hath divided our fields.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>2:5 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in</a>
<a id='line_77'>the congregation of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>2:6 Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not</a>
<a id='line_80'>prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.</a>
<a id='line_81'></a>
<a id='line_82'>2:7 O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the</a>
<a id='line_83'>LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him</a>
<a id='line_84'>that walketh uprightly?  2:8 Even of late my people is risen up as an</a>
<a id='line_85'>enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by</a>
<a id='line_86'>securely as men averse from war.</a>
<a id='line_87'></a>
<a id='line_88'>2:9 The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant</a>
<a id='line_89'>houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.</a>
<a id='line_90'></a>
<a id='line_91'>2:10 Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is</a>
<a id='line_92'>polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>2:11 If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I</a>
<a id='line_95'>will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be</a>
<a id='line_96'>the prophet of this people.</a>
<a id='line_97'></a>
<a id='line_98'>2:12 I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely</a>
<a id='line_99'>gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of</a>
<a id='line_100'>Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great</a>
<a id='line_101'>noise by reason of the multitude of men.</a>
<a id='line_102'></a>
<a id='line_103'>2:13 The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have</a>
<a id='line_104'>passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall</a>
<a id='line_105'>pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.</a>
<a id='line_106'></a>
<a id='line_107'>3:1 And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of</a>
<a id='line_108'>the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment?  3:2 Who hate</a>
<a id='line_109'>the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them,</a>
<a id='line_110'>and their flesh from off their bones; 3:3 Who also eat the flesh of my</a>
<a id='line_111'>people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones,</a>
<a id='line_112'>and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the</a>
<a id='line_113'>caldron.</a>
<a id='line_114'></a>
<a id='line_115'>3:4 Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he</a>
<a id='line_116'>will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved</a>
<a id='line_117'>themselves ill in their doings.</a>
<a id='line_118'></a>
<a id='line_119'>3:5 Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people</a>
<a id='line_120'>err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth</a>
<a id='line_121'>not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.</a>
<a id='line_122'></a>
<a id='line_123'>3:6 Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a</a>
<a id='line_124'>vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and</a>
<a id='line_125'>the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark</a>
<a id='line_126'>over them.</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>3:7 Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea,</a>
<a id='line_129'>they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.</a>
<a id='line_130'></a>
<a id='line_131'>3:8 But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of</a>
<a id='line_132'>judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and</a>
<a id='line_133'>to Israel his sin.</a>
<a id='line_134'></a>
<a id='line_135'>3:9 Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes</a>
<a id='line_136'>of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.</a>
<a id='line_137'></a>
<a id='line_138'>3:10 They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_139'></a>
<a id='line_140'>3:11 The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach</a>
<a id='line_141'>for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they</a>
<a id='line_142'>lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us? none evil can</a>
<a id='line_143'>come upon us.</a>
<a id='line_144'></a>
<a id='line_145'>3:12 Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and</a>
<a id='line_146'>Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the</a>
<a id='line_147'>high places of the forest.</a>
<a id='line_148'></a>
<a id='line_149'>4:1 But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of</a>
<a id='line_150'>the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the</a>
<a id='line_151'>mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall</a>
<a id='line_152'>flow unto it.</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>4:2 And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to</a>
<a id='line_155'>the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he</a>
<a id='line_156'>will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law</a>
<a id='line_157'>shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_158'></a>
<a id='line_159'>4:3 And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations</a>
<a id='line_160'>afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their</a>
<a id='line_161'>spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against</a>
<a id='line_162'>nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>4:4 But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig</a>
<a id='line_165'>tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of</a>
<a id='line_166'>hosts hath spoken it.</a>
<a id='line_167'></a>
<a id='line_168'>4:5 For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we</a>
<a id='line_169'>will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.</a>
<a id='line_170'></a>
<a id='line_171'>4:6 In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth, and</a>
<a id='line_172'>I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;</a>
<a id='line_173'>4:7 And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast</a>
<a id='line_174'>far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount</a>
<a id='line_175'>Zion from henceforth, even for ever.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>4:8 And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of</a>
<a id='line_178'>Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom</a>
<a id='line_179'>shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>4:9 Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is thy</a>
<a id='line_182'>counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>4:10 Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a</a>
<a id='line_185'>woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and</a>
<a id='line_186'>thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go even to Babylon;</a>
<a id='line_187'>there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from</a>
<a id='line_188'>the hand of thine enemies.</a>
<a id='line_189'></a>
<a id='line_190'>4:11 Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let</a>
<a id='line_191'>her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.</a>
<a id='line_192'></a>
<a id='line_193'>4:12 But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand</a>
<a id='line_194'>they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the</a>
<a id='line_195'>floor.</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>4:13 Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn</a>
<a id='line_198'>iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces</a>
<a id='line_199'>many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their</a>
<a id='line_200'>substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>5:1 Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid</a>
<a id='line_203'>siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon</a>
<a id='line_204'>the cheek.</a>
<a id='line_205'></a>
<a id='line_206'>5:2 But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the</a>
<a id='line_207'>thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that</a>
<a id='line_208'>is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old,</a>
<a id='line_209'>from everlasting.</a>
<a id='line_210'></a>
<a id='line_211'>5:3 Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which</a>
<a id='line_212'>travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall</a>
<a id='line_213'>return unto the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_214'></a>
<a id='line_215'>5:4 And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the</a>
<a id='line_216'>majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now</a>
<a id='line_217'>shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_218'></a>
<a id='line_219'>5:5 And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into</a>
<a id='line_220'>our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise</a>
<a id='line_221'>against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.</a>
<a id='line_222'></a>
<a id='line_223'>5:6 And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the</a>
<a id='line_224'>land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from</a>
<a id='line_225'>the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth</a>
<a id='line_226'>within our borders.</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>5:7 And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a</a>
<a id='line_229'>dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not</a>
<a id='line_230'>for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.</a>
<a id='line_231'></a>
<a id='line_232'>5:8 And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst</a>
<a id='line_233'>of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young</a>
<a id='line_234'>lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth</a>
<a id='line_235'>down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>5:9 Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all</a>
<a id='line_238'>thine enemies shall be cut off.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>5:10 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I</a>
<a id='line_241'>will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy</a>
<a id='line_242'>thy chariots: 5:11 And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and</a>
<a id='line_243'>throw down all thy strong holds: 5:12 And I will cut off witchcrafts</a>
<a id='line_244'>out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers: 5:13 Thy</a>
<a id='line_245'>graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the</a>
<a id='line_246'>midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.</a>
<a id='line_247'></a>
<a id='line_248'>5:14 And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will</a>
<a id='line_249'>I destroy thy cities.</a>
<a id='line_250'></a>
<a id='line_251'>5:15 And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen,</a>
<a id='line_252'>such as they have not heard.</a>
<a id='line_253'></a>
<a id='line_254'>6:1 Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the</a>
<a id='line_255'>mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.</a>
<a id='line_256'></a>
<a id='line_257'>6:2 Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD’s controversy, and ye strong</a>
<a id='line_258'>foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his</a>
<a id='line_259'>people, and he will plead with Israel.</a>
<a id='line_260'></a>
<a id='line_261'>6:3 O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I</a>
<a id='line_262'>wearied thee? testify against me.</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>6:4 For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee</a>
<a id='line_265'>out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and</a>
<a id='line_266'>Miriam.</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>6:5 O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and</a>
<a id='line_269'>what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal;</a>
<a id='line_270'>that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_271'></a>
<a id='line_272'>6:6 Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the</a>
<a id='line_273'>high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of</a>
<a id='line_274'>a year old?  6:7 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or</a>
<a id='line_275'>with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my</a>
<a id='line_276'>transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?  6:8 He</a>
<a id='line_277'>hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require</a>
<a id='line_278'>of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with</a>
<a id='line_279'>thy God?  6:9 The LORD’s voice crieth unto the city, and the man of</a>
<a id='line_280'>wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</a>
<a id='line_281'></a>
<a id='line_282'>6:10 Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the</a>
<a id='line_283'>wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?  6:11 Shall I count</a>
<a id='line_284'>them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful</a>
<a id='line_285'>weights?  6:12 For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the</a>
<a id='line_286'>inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in</a>
<a id='line_287'>their mouth.</a>
<a id='line_288'></a>
<a id='line_289'>6:13 Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in making</a>
<a id='line_290'>thee desolate because of thy sins.</a>
<a id='line_291'></a>
<a id='line_292'>6:14 Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down shall</a>
<a id='line_293'>be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not</a>
<a id='line_294'>deliver; and that which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.</a>
<a id='line_295'></a>
<a id='line_296'>6:15 Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the</a>
<a id='line_297'>olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but</a>
<a id='line_298'>shalt not drink wine.</a>
<a id='line_299'></a>
<a id='line_300'>6:16 For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house</a>
<a id='line_301'>of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a</a>
<a id='line_302'>desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall</a>
<a id='line_303'>bear the reproach of my people.</a>
<a id='line_304'></a>
<a id='line_305'>7:1 Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits,</a>
<a id='line_306'>as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my</a>
<a id='line_307'>soul desired the firstripe fruit.</a>
<a id='line_308'></a>
<a id='line_309'>7:2 The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none</a>
<a id='line_310'>upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man</a>
<a id='line_311'>his brother with a net.</a>
<a id='line_312'></a>
<a id='line_313'>7:3 That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince</a>
<a id='line_314'>asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he</a>

<a id='line_316'></a>
<a id='line_317'>7:4 The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a</a>
<a id='line_318'>thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh; now</a>
<a id='line_319'>shall be their perplexity.</a>
<a id='line_320'></a>
<a id='line_321'>7:5 Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep</a>
<a id='line_322'>the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.</a>

<a id='line_324'>7:6 For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up</a>
<a id='line_325'>against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a</a>
<a id='line_326'>man’s enemies are the men of his own house.</a>
<a id='line_327'></a>
<a id='line_328'>7:7 Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my</a>

<a id='line_332'>when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me.</a>
<a id='line_333'></a>
<a id='line_334'>7:9 I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned</a>
<a id='line_335'>against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he</a>
<a id='line_336'>will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his</a>
<a id='line_337'>righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_338'></a>
<a id='line_339'>7:10 Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover</a>
<a id='line_340'>her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall</a>

<a id='line_348'>and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.</a>
