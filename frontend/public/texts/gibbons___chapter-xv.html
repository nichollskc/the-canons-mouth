<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'>     The Progress Of The Christian Religion, And The Sentiments,</a>
<a id='line_3'>     Manners, Numbers, And Condition Of The Primitive Christians. 101</a>
<a id='line_4'></a>
<a id='line_5'>      101 (return) [ In spite of my resolution, Lardner led me to look</a>
<a id='line_6'>      through the famous fifteenth and sixteenth chapters of Gibbon. I</a>
<a id='line_7'>      could not lay them down without finishing them. The causes</a>
<a id='line_8'>      assigned, in the fifteenth chapter, for the diffusion of</a>
<a id='line_9'>      Christianity, must, no doubt, have contributed to it materially;</a>
<a id='line_10'>      but I doubt whether he saw them all. Perhaps those which he</a>
<a id='line_11'>      enumerates are among the most obvious. They might all be safely</a>
<a id='line_12'>      adopted by a Christian writer, with some change in the language</a>
<a id='line_13'>      and manner. Mackintosh see Life, i. p. 244.—M.]</a>
<a id='line_14'></a>
<a id='line_15'>      A candid but rational inquiry into the progress and establishment</a>
<a id='line_16'>      of Christianity may be considered as a very essential part of the</a>
<a id='line_17'>      history of the Roman empire. While that great body was invaded by</a>
<a id='line_18'>      open violence, or undermined by slow decay, a pure and humble</a>
<a id='line_19'>      religion gently insinuated itself into the minds of men, grew up</a>
<a id='line_20'>      in silence and obscurity, derived new vigor from opposition, and</a>
<a id='line_21'>      finally erected the triumphant banner of the Cross on the ruins</a>
<a id='line_22'>      of the Capitol. Nor was the influence of Christianity confined to</a>
<a id='line_23'>      the period or to the limits of the Roman empire. After a</a>
<a id='line_24'>      revolution of thirteen or fourteen centuries, that religion is</a>
<a id='line_25'>      still professed by the nations of Europe, the most distinguished</a>
<a id='line_26'>      portion of human kind in arts and learning as well as in arms. By</a>
<a id='line_27'>      the industry and zeal of the Europeans, it has been widely</a>
<a id='line_28'>      diffused to the most distant shores of Asia and Africa; and by</a>
<a id='line_29'>      the means of their colonies has been firmly established from</a>
<a id='line_30'>      Canada to Chili, in a world unknown to the ancients.</a>
<a id='line_31'></a>
<a id='line_32'>      But this inquiry, however useful or entertaining, is attended</a>
<a id='line_33'>      with two peculiar difficulties. The scanty and suspicious</a>
<a id='line_34'>      materials of ecclesiastical history seldom enable us to dispel</a>
<a id='line_35'>      the dark cloud that hangs over the first age of the church. The</a>
<a id='line_36'>      great law of impartiality too often obliges us to reveal the</a>
<a id='line_37'>      imperfections of the uninspired teachers and believers of the</a>
<a id='line_38'>      gospel; and, to a careless observer, _their_ faults may seem to</a>
<a id='line_39'>      cast a shade on the faith which they professed. But the scandal</a>
<a id='line_40'>      of the pious Christian, and the fallacious triumph of the</a>
<a id='line_41'>      Infidel, should cease as soon as they recollect not only _by</a>
<a id='line_42'>      whom_, but likewise _to whom_, the Divine Revelation was given.</a>
<a id='line_43'>      The theologian may indulge the pleasing task of describing</a>
<a id='line_44'>      Religion as she descended from Heaven, arrayed in her native</a>
<a id='line_45'>      purity. A more melancholy duty is imposed on the historian. He</a>
<a id='line_46'>      must discover the inevitable mixture of error and corruption,</a>
<a id='line_47'>      which she contracted in a long residence upon earth, among a weak</a>
<a id='line_48'>      and degenerate race of beings. 102</a>
<a id='line_49'></a>
<a id='line_50'>      102 (return) [ The art of Gibbon, or at least the unfair</a>
<a id='line_51'>      impression produced by these two memorable chapters, consists in</a>
<a id='line_52'>      confounding together, in one undistinguishable mass, the origin</a>
<a id='line_53'>      and apostolic propagation of the Christian religion with its</a>
<a id='line_54'>      later progress. The main question, the divine origin of the</a>
<a id='line_55'>      religion, is dexterously eluded or speciously conceded; his plan</a>
<a id='line_56'>      enables him to commence his account, in most parts, below the</a>
<a id='line_57'>      apostolic times; and it is only by the strength of the dark</a>
<a id='line_58'>      coloring with which he has brought out the failings and the</a>
<a id='line_59'>      follies of succeeding ages, that a shadow of doubt and suspicion</a>
<a id='line_60'>      is thrown back on the primitive period of Christianity. Divest</a>
<a id='line_61'>      this whole passage of the latent sarcasm betrayed by the</a>
<a id='line_62'>      subsequent one of the whole disquisition, and it might commence a</a>
<a id='line_63'>      Christian history, written in the most Christian spirit of</a>
<a id='line_64'>      candor.—M.]</a>
<a id='line_65'></a>
<a id='line_66'>      Our curiosity is naturally prompted to inquire by what means the</a>
<a id='line_67'>      Christian faith obtained so remarkable a victory over the</a>
<a id='line_68'>      established religions of the earth. To this inquiry, an obvious</a>
<a id='line_69'>      but satisfactory answer may be returned; that it was owing to the</a>
<a id='line_70'>      convincing evidence of the doctrine itself, and to the ruling</a>
<a id='line_71'>      providence of its great Author. But as truth and reason seldom</a>
<a id='line_72'>      find so favorable a reception in the world, and as the wisdom of</a>
<a id='line_73'>      Providence frequently condescends to use the passions of the</a>
<a id='line_74'>      human heart, and the general circumstances of mankind, as</a>
<a id='line_75'>      instruments to execute its purpose, we may still be permitted,</a>
<a id='line_76'>      though with becoming submission, to ask, not indeed what were the</a>
<a id='line_77'>      first, but what were the secondary causes of the rapid growth of</a>
<a id='line_78'>      the Christian church. It will, perhaps, appear, that it was most</a>
<a id='line_79'>      effectually favored and assisted by the five following causes:</a>
<a id='line_80'></a>
<a id='line_81'>      I. The inflexible, and if we may use the expression, the</a>
<a id='line_82'>      intolerant zeal of the Christians, derived, it is true, from the</a>
<a id='line_83'>      Jewish religion, but purified from the narrow and unsocial</a>
<a id='line_84'>      spirit, which, instead of inviting, had deterred the Gentiles</a>
<a id='line_85'>      from embracing the law of Moses.1023</a>
<a id='line_86'></a>
<a id='line_87'>      II. The doctrine of a future life, improved by every additional</a>
<a id='line_88'>      circumstance which could give weight and efficacy to that</a>
<a id='line_89'>      important truth. III. The miraculous powers ascribed to the</a>
<a id='line_90'>      primitive church. IV. The pure and austere morals of the</a>
<a id='line_91'>      Christians.</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>      V. The union and discipline of the Christian republic, which</a>
<a id='line_94'>      gradually formed an independent and increasing state in the heart</a>
<a id='line_95'>      of the Roman empire.</a>
<a id='line_96'></a>
<a id='line_97'>      1023 (return) [Though we are thus far agreed with respect to the</a>
<a id='line_98'>      inflexibility and intolerance of Christian zeal, yet as to the</a>
<a id='line_99'>      principle from which it was derived, we are, toto cœlo, divided</a>
<a id='line_100'>      in opinion. You deduce it from the Jewish religion; I would refer</a>
<a id='line_101'>      it to a more adequate and a more obvious source, a full</a>
<a id='line_102'>      persuasion of the truth of Christianity. Watson. Letters Gibbon,</a>
<a id='line_103'>      i. 9.—M.]</a>
<a id='line_104'></a>
<a id='line_105'>      I. We have already described the religious harmony of the ancient</a>
<a id='line_106'>      world, and the facility with which the most different and even</a>
<a id='line_107'>      hostile nations embraced, or at least respected, each other’s</a>
<a id='line_108'>      superstitions. A single people refused to join in the common</a>
<a id='line_109'>      intercourse of mankind. The Jews, who, under the Assyrian and</a>
<a id='line_110'>      Persian monarchies, had languished for many ages the most</a>
<a id='line_111'>      despised portion of their slaves, 1 emerged from obscurity under</a>
<a id='line_112'>      the successors of Alexander; and as they multiplied to a</a>
<a id='line_113'>      surprising degree in the East, and afterwards in the West, they</a>
<a id='line_114'>      soon excited the curiosity and wonder of other nations. 2 The</a>
<a id='line_115'>      sullen obstinacy with which they maintained their peculiar rites</a>
<a id='line_116'>      and unsocial manners seemed to mark them out as a distinct</a>
<a id='line_117'>      species of men, who boldly professed, or who faintly disguised,</a>
<a id='line_118'>      their implacable habits to the rest of human kind. 3 Neither the</a>
<a id='line_119'>      violence of Antiochus, nor the arts of Herod, nor the example of</a>
<a id='line_120'>      the circumjacent nations, could ever persuade the Jews to</a>
<a id='line_121'>      associate with the institutions of Moses the elegant mythology of</a>
<a id='line_122'>      the Greeks. 4 According to the maxims of universal toleration,</a>
<a id='line_123'>      the Romans protected a superstition which they despised. 5 The</a>
<a id='line_124'>      polite Augustus condescended to give orders, that sacrifices</a>
<a id='line_125'>      should be offered for his prosperity in the temple of Jerusalem;</a>
<a id='line_126'>      6 whilst the meanest of the posterity of Abraham, who should have</a>
<a id='line_127'>      paid the same homage to the Jupiter of the Capitol, would have</a>
<a id='line_128'>      been an object of abhorrence to himself and to his brethren.</a>
<a id='line_129'></a>
<a id='line_130'>      But the moderation of the conquerors was insufficient to appease</a>
<a id='line_131'>      the jealous prejudices of their subjects, who were alarmed and</a>
<a id='line_132'>      scandalized at the ensigns of paganism, which necessarily</a>
<a id='line_133'>      introduced themselves into a Roman province. 7 The mad attempt of</a>
<a id='line_134'>      Caligula to place his own statue in the temple of Jerusalem was</a>
<a id='line_135'>      defeated by the unanimous resolution of a people who dreaded</a>
<a id='line_136'>      death much less than such an idolatrous profanation. 8 Their</a>
<a id='line_137'>      attachment to the law of Moses was equal to their detestation of</a>
<a id='line_138'>      foreign religions. The current of zeal and devotion, as it was</a>
<a id='line_139'>      contracted into a narrow channel, ran with the strength, and</a>
<a id='line_140'>      sometimes with the fury, of a torrent. This facility has not</a>
<a id='line_141'>      always prevented intolerance, which seems inherent in the</a>
<a id='line_142'>      religious spirit, when armed with authority. The separation of</a>
<a id='line_143'>      the ecclesiastical and civil power, appears to be the only means</a>
<a id='line_144'>      of at once maintaining religion and tolerance: but this is a very</a>
<a id='line_145'>      modern notion. The passions, which mingle themselves with</a>
<a id='line_146'>      opinions, made the Pagans very often intolerant and persecutors;</a>
<a id='line_147'>      witness the Persians, the Egyptians even the Greeks and Romans.</a>
<a id='line_148'></a>
<a id='line_149'>      1st. The Persians.—Cambyses, conqueror of the Egyptians,</a>
<a id='line_150'>      condemned to death the magistrates of Memphis, because they had</a>
<a id='line_151'>      offered divine honors to their god. Apis: he caused the god to be</a>
<a id='line_152'>      brought before him, struck him with his dagger, commanded the</a>
<a id='line_153'>      priests to be scourged, and ordered a general massacre of all the</a>
<a id='line_154'>      Egyptians who should be found celebrating the festival of the</a>
<a id='line_155'>      statues of the gods to be burnt. Not content with this</a>
<a id='line_156'>      intolerance, he sent an army to reduce the Ammonians to slavery,</a>
<a id='line_157'>      and to set on fire the temple in which Jupiter delivered his</a>
<a id='line_158'>      oracles. See Herod. iii. 25—29, 37. Xerxes, during his invasion</a>
<a id='line_159'>      of Greece, acted on the same principles: l c destroyed all the</a>
<a id='line_160'>      temples of Greece and Ionia, except that of Ephesus. See Paus. l.</a>
<a id='line_161'>      vii. p. 533, and x. p. 887.</a>
<a id='line_162'></a>
<a id='line_163'>      Strabo, l. xiv. b. 941. 2d. The Egyptians.—They thought</a>
<a id='line_164'>      themselves defiled when they had drunk from the same cup or eaten</a>
<a id='line_165'>      at the same table with a man of a different belief from their</a>
<a id='line_166'>      own. “He who has voluntarily killed any sacred animal is punished</a>
<a id='line_167'>      with death; but if any one, even involuntarily, has killed a cat</a>
<a id='line_168'>      or an ibis, he cannot escape the extreme penalty: the people drag</a>
<a id='line_169'>      him away, treat him in the most cruel manner, sometimes without</a>
<a id='line_170'>      waiting for a judicial sentence. * * * Even at the time when King</a>
<a id='line_171'>      Ptolemy was not yet the acknowledged friend of the Roman people,</a>
<a id='line_172'>      while the multitude were paying court with all possible attention</a>
<a id='line_173'>      to the strangers who came from Italy * * a Roman having killed a</a>
<a id='line_174'>      cat, the people rushed to his house, and neither the entreaties</a>
<a id='line_175'>      of the nobles, whom the king sent to them, nor the terror of the</a>
<a id='line_176'>      Roman name, were sufficiently powerful to rescue the man from</a>
<a id='line_177'>      punishment, though he had committed the crime involuntarily.”</a>
<a id='line_178'>      Diod. Sic. i 83. Juvenal, in his 13th Satire, describes the</a>
<a id='line_179'>      sanguinary conflict between the inhabitants of Ombos and of</a>
<a id='line_180'>      Tentyra, from religious animosity. The fury was carried so far,</a>
<a id='line_181'>      that the conquerors tore and devoured the quivering limbs of the</a>
<a id='line_182'>      conquered.</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>      Ardet adhuc Ombos et Tentyra, summus utrinque Inde furor vulgo,</a>
<a id='line_185'>      quod numina vicinorum Odit uterque locus; quum solos credat</a>
<a id='line_186'>      habendos Esse Deos quos ipse colit. Sat. xv. v. 85.</a>
<a id='line_187'></a>
<a id='line_188'>      3d. The Greeks.—“Let us not here,” says the Abbé Guénée, “refer</a>
<a id='line_189'>      to the cities of Peloponnesus and their severity against atheism;</a>
<a id='line_190'>      the Ephesians prosecuting Heraclitus for impiety; the Greeks</a>
<a id='line_191'>      armed one against the other by religious zeal, in the</a>
<a id='line_192'>      Amphictyonic war. Let us say nothing either of the frightful</a>
<a id='line_193'>      cruelties inflicted by three successors of Alexander upon the</a>
<a id='line_194'>      Jews, to force them to abandon their religion, nor of Antiochus</a>
<a id='line_195'>      expelling the philosophers from his states. Let us not seek our</a>
<a id='line_196'>      proofs of intolerance so far off. Athens, the polite and learned</a>
<a id='line_197'>      Athens, will supply us with sufficient examples. Every citizen</a>
<a id='line_198'>      made a public and solemn vow to conform to the religion of his</a>
<a id='line_199'>      country, to defend it, and to cause it to be respected. An</a>
<a id='line_200'>      express law severely punished all discourses against the gods,</a>
<a id='line_201'>      and a rigid decree ordered the denunciation of all who should</a>
<a id='line_202'>      deny their existence. * * * The practice was in unison with the</a>
<a id='line_203'>      severity of the law. The proceedings commenced against</a>
<a id='line_204'>      Protagoras; a price set upon the head of Diagoras; the danger of</a>
<a id='line_205'>      Alcibiades; Aristotle obliged to fly; Stilpo banished; Anaxagoras</a>
<a id='line_206'>      hardly escaping death; Pericles himself, after all his services</a>
<a id='line_207'>      to his country, and all the glory he had acquired, compelled to</a>
<a id='line_208'>      appear before the tribunals and make his defence; * * a priestess</a>
<a id='line_209'>      executed for having introduced strange gods; Socrates condemned</a>
<a id='line_210'>      and drinking the hemlock, because he was accused of not</a>
<a id='line_211'>      recognizing those of his country, &c.; these facts attest too</a>
<a id='line_212'>      loudly, to be called in question, the religious intolerance of</a>
<a id='line_213'>      the most humane and enlightened people in Greece.” Lettres de</a>
<a id='line_214'>      quelques Juifs a Mons. Voltaire, i. p. 221. (Compare Bentley on</a>
<a id='line_215'>      Freethinking, from which much of this is derived.)—M.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>      4th. The Romans.—The laws of Rome were not less express and</a>
<a id='line_218'>      severe. The intolerance of foreign religions reaches, with the</a>
<a id='line_219'>      Romans, as high as the laws of the twelve tables; the</a>
<a id='line_220'>      prohibitions were afterwards renewed at different times.</a>
<a id='line_221'>      Intolerance did not discontinue under the emperors; witness the</a>
<a id='line_222'>      counsel of Mæcenas to Augustus. This counsel is so remarkable,</a>
<a id='line_223'>      that I think it right to insert it entire. “Honor the gods</a>
<a id='line_224'>      yourself,” says Mæcenas to Augustus, “in every way according to</a>
<a id='line_225'>      the usage of your ancestors, and compel others to worship them.</a>
<a id='line_226'>      Hate and punish those who introduce strange gods, not only for</a>
<a id='line_227'>      the sake of the gods, (he who despises them will respect no one,)</a>
<a id='line_228'>      but because those who introduce new gods engage a multitude of</a>
<a id='line_229'>      persons in foreign laws and customs. From hence arise unions</a>
<a id='line_230'>      bound by oaths and confederacies, and associations, things</a>
<a id='line_231'>      dangerous to a monarchy.” Dion Cass. l. ii. c. 36. (But, though</a>
<a id='line_232'>      some may differ from it, see Gibbon’s just observation on this</a>
<a id='line_233'>      passage in Dion Cassius, ch. xvi. note 117; impugned, indeed, by</a>
<a id='line_234'>      M. Guizot, note in loc.)—M.</a>
<a id='line_235'></a>
<a id='line_236'>      Even the laws which the philosophers of Athens and of Rome wrote</a>
<a id='line_237'>      for their imaginary republics are intolerant. Plato does not</a>
<a id='line_238'>      leave to his citizens freedom of religious worship; and Cicero</a>
<a id='line_239'>      expressly prohibits them from having other gods than those of the</a>
<a id='line_240'>      state. Lettres de quelques Juifs a Mons. Voltaire, i. p. 226.—G.</a>
<a id='line_241'></a>
<a id='line_242'>      According to M. Guizot’s just remarks, religious intolerance will</a>
<a id='line_243'>      always ally itself with the passions of man, however different</a>
<a id='line_244'>      those passions may be. In the instances quoted above, with the</a>
<a id='line_245'>      Persians it was the pride of despotism; to conquer the gods of a</a>
<a id='line_246'>      country was the last mark of subjugation. With the Egyptians, it</a>
<a id='line_247'>      was the gross Fetichism of the superstitious populace, and the</a>
<a id='line_248'>      local jealousy of neighboring towns. In Greece, persecution was</a>
<a id='line_249'>      in general connected with political party; in Rome, with the</a>
<a id='line_250'>      stern supremacy of the law and the interests of the state. Gibbon</a>
<a id='line_251'>      has been mistaken in attributing to the tolerant spirit of</a>
<a id='line_252'>      Paganism that which arose out of the peculiar circumstances of</a>
<a id='line_253'>      the times. 1st. The decay of the old Polytheism, through the</a>
<a id='line_254'>      progress of reason and intelligence, and the prevalence of</a>
<a id='line_255'>      philosophical opinions among the higher orders.</a>
<a id='line_256'></a>

<a id='line_383'>      The Jewish religion was admirably fitted for defence, but it was</a>

<a id='line_385'>      number of proselytes was never much superior to that of</a>

<a id='line_388'>      family. When the posterity of Abraham had multiplied like the</a>

<a id='line_391'>      it were the national God of Israel; and with the most jealous</a>

<a id='line_395'>      victorious Jews were left in a state of irreconcilable hostility</a>
<a id='line_396'>      with all their neighbors. They had been commanded to extirpate</a>
<a id='line_397'>      some of the most idolatrous tribes, and the execution of the</a>

<a id='line_399'></a>
<a id='line_400'>      With the other nations they were forbidden to contract any</a>

<a id='line_403'>      always extended to the third, to the seventh, or even to the</a>
<a id='line_404'>      tenth generation. The obligation of preaching to the Gentiles the</a>
<a id='line_405'>      faith of Moses had never been inculcated as a precept of the law,</a>
<a id='line_406'>      nor were the Jews inclined to impose it on themselves as a</a>

<a id='line_412'>      flattered by the opinion that they alone were the heirs of the</a>
<a id='line_413'>      covenant, and they were apprehensive of diminishing the value of</a>
<a id='line_414'>      their inheritance by sharing it too easily with the strangers of</a>
<a id='line_415'>      the earth. A larger acquaintance with mankind extended their</a>
<a id='line_416'>      knowledge without correcting their prejudices; and whenever the</a>
<a id='line_417'>      God of Israel acquired any new votaries, he was much more</a>
<a id='line_418'>      indebted to the inconstant humor of polytheism than to the active</a>
<a id='line_419'>      zeal of his own missionaries. 11 The religion of Moses seems to</a>
<a id='line_420'>      be instituted for a particular country as well as for a single</a>
<a id='line_421'>      nation; and if a strict obedience had been paid to the order,</a>
<a id='line_422'>      that every male, three times in the year, should present himself</a>
<a id='line_423'>      before the Lord Jehovah, it would have been impossible that the</a>
<a id='line_424'>      Jews could ever have spread themselves beyond the narrow limits</a>
<a id='line_425'>      of the promised land. 12 That obstacle was indeed removed by the</a>
<a id='line_426'>      destruction of the temple of Jerusalem; but the most considerable</a>
<a id='line_427'>      part of the Jewish religion was involved in its destruction; and</a>
<a id='line_428'>      the Pagans, who had long wondered at the strange report of an</a>

<a id='line_432'></a>
<a id='line_433'>      Yet even in their fallen state, the Jews, still asserting their</a>
<a id='line_434'>      lofty and exclusive privileges, shunned, instead of courting, the</a>

<a id='line_478'>      expiatory sacrifice, the imperfect sacrifices of the temple were</a>
<a id='line_479'>      at once consummated and abolished. The ceremonial law, which</a>

<a id='line_561'>      after the death of Christ, and was governed almost as many years</a>

<a id='line_570'>      converts, or, as they were afterwards called, the Nazarenes, who</a>
<a id='line_571'>      had laid the foundations of the church, soon found themselves</a>

<a id='line_573'>      various religions of polytheism enlisted under the banner of</a>
<a id='line_574'>      Christ: and the Gentiles, who, with the approbation of their</a>
<a id='line_575'>      peculiar apostle, had rejected the intolerable weight of the</a>
<a id='line_576'>      Mosaic ceremonies, at length refused to their more scrupulous</a>
<a id='line_577'>      brethren the same toleration which at first they had humbly</a>
<a id='line_578'>      solicited for their own practice. The ruin of the temple of the</a>
<a id='line_579'>      city, and of the public religion of the Jews, was severely felt</a>
<a id='line_580'>      by the Nazarenes; as in their manners, though not in their faith,</a>
<a id='line_581'>      they maintained so intimate a connection with their impious</a>
<a id='line_582'>      countrymen, whose misfortunes were attributed by the Pagans to</a>
<a id='line_583'>      the contempt, and more justly ascribed by the Christians to the</a>
<a id='line_584'>      wrath, of the Supreme Deity. The Nazarenes retired from the ruins</a>

<a id='line_586'>      where that ancient church languished above sixty years in</a>
<a id='line_587'>      solitude and obscurity. 19 They still enjoyed the comfort of</a>

<a id='line_589'>      hope of being one day restored to those seats which both nature</a>
<a id='line_590'>      and religion taught them to love as well as to revere. But at</a>
<a id='line_591'>      length, under the reign of Hadrian, the desperate fanaticism of</a>
<a id='line_592'>      the Jews filled up the measure of their calamities; and the</a>
<a id='line_593'>      Romans, exasperated by their repeated rebellions, exercised the</a>
<a id='line_594'>      rights of victory with unusual rigor. The emperor founded, under</a>
<a id='line_595'>      the name of Ælia Capitolina, a new city on Mount Sion, 20 to</a>
<a id='line_596'>      which he gave the privileges of a colony; and denouncing the</a>
<a id='line_597'>      severest penalties against any of the Jewish people who should</a>
<a id='line_598'>      dare to approach its precincts, he fixed a vigilant garrison of a</a>

<a id='line_652'>      of Nazarenes was deemed too honorable for those Christian Jews,</a>
<a id='line_653'>      and they soon received, from the supposed poverty of their</a>
<a id='line_654'>      understanding, as well as of their condition, the contemptuous</a>

<a id='line_664'>      pretending to assert their general use or necessity. But when</a>

<a id='line_669'>      in the common offices of friendship, hospitality, and social</a>
<a id='line_670'>      life. 24 The more rigorous opinion prevailed, as it was natural</a>
<a id='line_671'>      to expect, over the milder; and an eternal bar of separation was</a>

<a id='line_869'>      Basilidians, the Valentinians, the Marcionites, and, in a still</a>

<a id='line_874'>      and discourses of Christ and of his apostles were adapted to</a>
<a id='line_875'>      their respective tenets. 35 The success of the Gnostics was rapid</a>

<a id='line_1205'>      field, or to suppose that a being, for whose dignity they</a>
<a id='line_1206'>      entertained the most sincere admiration, could be limited to a</a>
<a id='line_1207'>      spot of earth, and to a few years of duration. With this</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      favorable prepossession they summoned to their aid the science,</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      or rather the language, of Metaphysics. They soon discovered,</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      that as none of the properties of matter will apply to the</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      operations of the mind, the human soul must consequently be a</a>

<a id='line_1271'>      future state was scarcely considered among the devout polytheists</a>
<a id='line_1272'>      of Greece and Rome as a fundamental article of faith. The</a>

<a id='line_1783'>      conduced to their own comfort, and very frequently to the</a>
<a id='line_1784'>      conviction of infidels. Besides the occasional prodigies, which</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      might sometimes be effected by the immediate interposition of the</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      Deity when he suspended the laws of Nature for the service of</a>
<a id='line_1787'>      religion, the Christian church, from the time of the apostles and</a>
<a id='line_1788'>      their first disciples, 73 has claimed an uninterrupted succession</a>
<a id='line_1789'>      of miraculous powers, the gift of tongues, of vision, and of</a>
<a id='line_1790'>      prophecy, the power of expelling dæmons, of healing the sick, and</a>
<a id='line_1791'>      of raising the dead. The knowledge of foreign languages was</a>
<a id='line_1792'>      frequently communicated to the contemporaries of Irenæus, though</a>
<a id='line_1793'>      Irenæus himself was left to struggle with the difficulties of a</a>
<a id='line_1794'>      barbarous dialect, whilst he preached the gospel to the natives</a>
<a id='line_1795'>      of Gaul. 74 The divine inspiration, whether it was conveyed in</a>
<a id='line_1796'>      the form of a waking or of a sleeping vision, is described as a</a>
<a id='line_1797'>      favor very liberally bestowed on all ranks of the faithful, on</a>
<a id='line_1798'>      women as on elders, on boys as well as upon bishops. When their</a>
<a id='line_1799'>      devout minds were sufficiently prepared by a course of prayer, of</a>
<a id='line_1800'>      fasting, and of vigils, to receive the extraordinary impulse,</a>
<a id='line_1801'>      they were transported out of their senses, and delivered in</a>
<a id='line_1802'>      ecstasy what was inspired, being mere organs of the Holy Spirit,</a>
<a id='line_1803'>      just as a pipe or flute is of him who blows into it. 75 We may</a>
<a id='line_1804'>      add, that the design of these visions was, for the most part,</a>
<a id='line_1805'>      either to disclose the future history, or to guide the present</a>
<a id='line_1806'>      administration, of the church. The expulsion of the dæmons from</a>
<a id='line_1807'>      the bodies of those unhappy persons whom they had been permitted</a>
<a id='line_1808'>      to torment, was considered as a signal though ordinary triumph of</a>
<a id='line_1809'>      religion, and is repeatedly alleged by the ancient apoligists, as</a>
<a id='line_1810'>      the most convincing evidence of the truth of Christianity. The</a>
<a id='line_1811'>      awful ceremony was usually performed in a public manner, and in</a>
<a id='line_1812'>      the presence of a great number of spectators; the patient was</a>
<a id='line_1813'>      relieved by the power or skill of the exorcist, and the</a>
<a id='line_1814'>      vanquished dæmon was heard to confess that he was one of the</a>
<a id='line_1815'>      fabled gods of antiquity, who had impiously usurped the adoration</a>
<a id='line_1816'>      of mankind. 76 But the miraculous cure of diseases of the most</a>
<a id='line_1817'>      inveterate or even preternatural kind can no longer occasion any</a>
<a id='line_1818'>      surprise, when we recollect, that in the days of Irenæus, about</a>
<a id='line_1819'>      the end of the second century, the resurrection of the dead was</a>
<a id='line_1820'>      very far from being esteemed an uncommon event; that the miracle</a>
<a id='line_1821'>      was frequently performed on necessary occasions, by great fasting</a>
<a id='line_1822'>      and the joint supplication of the church of the place, and that</a>
<a id='line_1823'>      the persons thus restored to their prayers had lived afterwards</a>
<a id='line_1824'>      among them many years. 77 At such a period, when faith could</a>
<a id='line_1825'>      boast of so many wonderful victories over death, it seems</a>
<a id='line_1826'>      difficult to account for the scepticism of those philosophers,</a>
<a id='line_1827'>      who still rejected and derided the doctrine of the resurrection.</a>

<a id='line_1918'>      which, in the second century, we had so liberally granted to</a>
<a id='line_1919'>      Justin or to Irenæus. 81 If the truth of any of those miracles is</a>
<a id='line_1920'>      appreciated by their apparent use and propriety, every age had</a>
<a id='line_1921'>      unbelievers to convince, heretics to confute, and idolatrous</a>

<a id='line_1925'>      reasonable man is convinced of the cessation, of miraculous</a>

<a id='line_2172'>      much stronger and more doubtful nature. It often leads to anger,</a>
<a id='line_2173'>      to ambition, and to revenge; but when it is guided by the sense</a>
<a id='line_2174'>      of propriety and benevolence, it becomes the parent of every</a>

<a id='line_2273'>      circumstantially imposed on the marriage-bed, would force a smile</a>
<a id='line_2274'>      from the young and a blush from the fair. It was their unanimous</a>
<a id='line_2275'>      sentiment that a first marriage was adequate to all the purposes</a>
<a id='line_2276'>      of nature and of society. The sensual connection was refined into</a>
<a id='line_2277'>      a resemblance of the mystic union of Christ with his church, and</a>
<a id='line_2278'>      was pronounced to be indissoluble either by divorce or by death.</a>
<a id='line_2279'>      The practice of second nuptials was branded with the name of a</a>
<a id='line_2280'>      legal adultery; and the persons who were guilty of so scandalous</a>
<a id='line_2281'>      an offence against Christian purity, were soon excluded from the</a>
<a id='line_2282'>      honors, and even from the alms, of the church. 93 Since desire</a>
<a id='line_2283'>      was imputed as a crime, and marriage was tolerated as a defect,</a>
<a id='line_2284'>      it was consistent with the same principles to consider a state of</a>
<a id='line_2285'>      celibacy as the nearest approach to the divine perfection. It was</a>
<a id='line_2286'>      with the utmost difficulty that ancient Rome could support the</a>
<a id='line_2287'>      institution of six vestals; 94 but the primitive church was</a>
<a id='line_2288'>      filled with a number of persons of either sex, who had devoted</a>
<a id='line_2289'>      themselves to the profession of perpetual chastity. 95 A few of</a>
<a id='line_2290'>      these, among whom we may reckon the learned Origen, judged it the</a>
<a id='line_2291'>      most prudent to disarm the tempter. 96 Some were insensible and</a>
<a id='line_2292'>      some were invincible against the assaults of the flesh.</a>
<a id='line_2293'>      Disdaining an ignominious flight, the virgins of the warm climate</a>
<a id='line_2294'>      of Africa encountered the enemy in the closest engagement; they</a>

<a id='line_2296'>      amidst the flames in their unsullied purity. But insulted Nature</a>
<a id='line_2297'>      sometimes vindicated her rights, and this new species of</a>
<a id='line_2298'>      martyrdom served only to introduce a new scandal into the church.</a>
<a id='line_2299'>      97 Among the Christian ascetics, however, (a name which they soon</a>
<a id='line_2300'>      acquired from their painful exercise,) many, as they were less</a>

<a id='line_2302'>      pleasure was supplied and compensated by spiritual pride. Even</a>
<a id='line_2303'>      the multitude of Pagans were inclined to estimate the merit of</a>
<a id='line_2304'>      the sacrifice by its apparent difficulty; and it was in the</a>

<a id='line_2488'>      devoting to the public benefit the power and consideration,</a>

<a id='line_2498'>      insensibly corrupted, by the habits of government. In the church</a>
<a id='line_2499'>      as well as in the world, the persons who were placed in any</a>

<a id='line_2524'>      faith and charity. Independence and equality formed the basis of</a>
<a id='line_2525'>      their internal constitution. The want of discipline and human</a>
<a id='line_2526'>      learning was supplied by the occasional assistance of the</a>
<a id='line_2527'>      _prophets_, 106 who were called to that function without</a>
<a id='line_2528'>      distinction of age, of sex, 1061 or of natural abilities, and</a>
<a id='line_2529'>      who, as often as they felt the divine impulse, poured forth the</a>
<a id='line_2530'>      effusions of the Spirit in the assembly of the faithful. But</a>
<a id='line_2531'>      these extraordinary gifts were frequently abused or misapplied by</a>
<a id='line_2532'>      the prophetic teachers. They displayed them at an improper</a>
<a id='line_2533'>      season, presumptuously disturbed the service of the assembly,</a>
<a id='line_2534'>      and, by their pride or mistaken zeal, they introduced,</a>
<a id='line_2535'>      particularly into the apostolic church of Corinth, a long and</a>
<a id='line_2536'>      melancholy train of disorders. 107 As the institution of prophets</a>
<a id='line_2537'>      became useless, and even pernicious, their powers were withdrawn,</a>

<a id='line_2542'>      the same order of persons. The name of Presbyter was expressive</a>
<a id='line_2543'>      of their age, or rather of their gravity and wisdom. The title of</a>
<a id='line_2544'>      Bishop denoted their inspection over the faith and manners of the</a>

<a id='line_2769'>      represented in the episcopal office, of which every bishop</a>
<a id='line_2770'>      enjoyed an equal and undivided portion. 117 Princes and</a>
<a id='line_2771'>      magistrates, it was often repeated, might boast an earthly claim</a>
<a id='line_2772'>      to a transitory dominion; it was the episcopal authority alone</a>
<a id='line_2773'>      which was derived from the Deity, and extended itself over this</a>
<a id='line_2774'>      and over another world. The bishops were the vicegerents of</a>
<a id='line_2775'>      Christ, the successors of the apostles, and the mystic</a>
<a id='line_2776'>      substitutes of the high priest of the Mosaic law. Their exclusive</a>
<a id='line_2777'>      privilege of conferring the sacerdotal character invaded the</a>
<a id='line_2778'>      freedom both of clerical and of popular elections; and if, in the</a>
<a id='line_2779'>      administration of the church, they still consulted the judgment</a>
<a id='line_2780'>      of the presbyters, or the inclination of the people, they most</a>
<a id='line_2781'>      carefully inculcated the merit of such a voluntary condescension.</a>
<a id='line_2782'>      The bishops acknowledged the supreme authority which resided in</a>
<a id='line_2783'>      the assembly of their brethren; but in the government of his</a>
<a id='line_2784'>      peculiar diocese, each of them exacted from his _flock_ the same</a>
<a id='line_2785'>      implicit obedience as if that favorite metaphor had been</a>
<a id='line_2786'>      literally just, and as if the shepherd had been of a more exalted</a>

<a id='line_2788'>      not imposed without some efforts on one side, and some resistance</a>
<a id='line_2789'>      on the other. The democratical part of the constitution was, in</a>
<a id='line_2790'>      many places, very warmly supported by the zealous or interested</a>
<a id='line_2791'>      opposition of the inferior clergy. But their patriotism received</a>
<a id='line_2792'>      the ignominious epithets of faction and schism; and the episcopal</a>
<a id='line_2793'>      cause was indebted for its rapid progress to the labors of many</a>
<a id='line_2794'>      active prelates, who, like Cyprian of Carthage, could reconcile</a>

<a id='line_2818'>      members of the assembly, and the multitude was governed by the</a>

<a id='line_2820'>      proceedings required a more regular and less invidious</a>
<a id='line_2821'>      distinction; the office of perpetual presidents in the councils</a>
<a id='line_2822'>      of each province was conferred on the bishops of the principal</a>
<a id='line_2823'>      city; and these aspiring prelates, who soon acquired the lofty</a>
<a id='line_2824'>      titles of Metropolitans and Primates, secretly prepared</a>

<a id='line_2832'>      Christians who were subject to their pastoral care; the saints</a>
<a id='line_2833'>      and martyrs who had arisen among them; and the purity with which</a>
<a id='line_2834'>      they preserved the tradition of the faith, as it had been</a>
<a id='line_2835'>      transmitted through a series of orthodox bishops from the apostle</a>
<a id='line_2836'>      or the apostolic disciple, to whom the foundation of their church</a>
<a id='line_2837'>      was ascribed. 121 From every cause, either of a civil or of an</a>
<a id='line_2838'>      ecclesiastical nature, it was easy to foresee that Rome must</a>
<a id='line_2839'>      enjoy the respect, and would soon claim the obedience, of the</a>
<a id='line_2840'>      provinces. The society of the faithful bore a just proportion to</a>
<a id='line_2841'>      the capital of the empire; and the Roman church was the greatest,</a>
<a id='line_2842'>      the most numerous, and, in regard to the West, the most ancient</a>
<a id='line_2843'>      of all the Christian establishments, many of which had received</a>
<a id='line_2844'>      their religion from the pious labors of her missionaries. Instead</a>
<a id='line_2845'>      of one apostolic founder, the utmost boast of Antioch, of</a>

<a id='line_2848'>      most eminent among the apostles; 122 and the bishops of Rome very</a>
<a id='line_2849'>      prudently claimed the inheritance of whatsoever prerogatives were</a>
<a id='line_2850'>      attributed either to the person or to the office of St. Peter.</a>
<a id='line_2851'>      123 The bishops of Italy and of the provinces were disposed to</a>
<a id='line_2852'>      allow them a primacy of order and association (such was their</a>
<a id='line_2853'>      very accurate expression) in the Christian aristocracy. 124 But</a>
<a id='line_2854'>      the power of a monarch was rejected with abhorrence, and the</a>
<a id='line_2855'>      aspiring genius of Rome experienced from the nations of Asia and</a>
<a id='line_2856'>      Africa a more vigorous resistance to her spiritual, than she had</a>
<a id='line_2857'>      formerly done to her temporal, dominion. The patriotic Cyprian,</a>
<a id='line_2858'>      who ruled with the most absolute sway the church of Carthage and</a>
<a id='line_2859'>      the provincial synods, opposed with resolution and success the</a>
<a id='line_2860'>      ambition of the Roman pontiff, artfully connected his own cause</a>
<a id='line_2861'>      with that of the eastern bishops, and, like Hannibal, sought out</a>
<a id='line_2862'>      new allies in the heart of Asia. 125 If this Punic war was</a>
<a id='line_2863'>      carried on without any effusion of blood, it was owing much less</a>
<a id='line_2864'>      to the moderation than to the weakness of the contending</a>

<a id='line_2953'>      short time in the primitive church. The fervor of the first</a>
<a id='line_2954'>      proselytes prompted them to sell those worldly possessions, which</a>
<a id='line_2955'>      they despised, to lay the price of them at the feet of the</a>
<a id='line_2956'>      apostles, and to content themselves with receiving an equal share</a>
<a id='line_2957'>      out of the general distribution. 130 The progress of the</a>
<a id='line_2958'>      Christian religion relaxed, and gradually abolished, this</a>
<a id='line_2959'>      generous institution, which, in hands less pure than those of the</a>

<a id='line_2964'>      increase their separate property by all the lawful means of trade</a>
<a id='line_2965'>      and industry. Instead of an absolute sacrifice, a moderate</a>
<a id='line_2966'>      proportion was accepted by the ministers of the gospel; and in</a>

<a id='line_2968'>      the exigency of the occasion, and the measure of his wealth and</a>
<a id='line_2969'>      piety, presented his voluntary offering for the use of the common</a>
<a id='line_2970'>      fund. 131 Nothing, however inconsiderable, was refused; but it</a>
<a id='line_2971'>      was diligently inculcated that, in the article of Tithes, the</a>
<a id='line_2972'>      Mosaic law was still of divine obligation; and that since the</a>
<a id='line_2973'>      Jews, under a less perfect discipline, had been commanded to pay</a>
<a id='line_2974'>      a tenth part of all that they possessed, it would become the</a>
<a id='line_2975'>      disciples of Christ to distinguish themselves by a superior</a>
<a id='line_2976'>      degree of liberality, 132 and to acquire some merit by resigning</a>
<a id='line_2977'>      a superfluous treasure, which must so soon be annihilated with</a>
<a id='line_2978'>      the world itself. 133 It is almost unnecessary to observe, that</a>
<a id='line_2979'>      the revenue of each particular church, which was of so uncertain</a>
<a id='line_2980'>      and fluctuating a nature, must have varied with the poverty or</a>
<a id='line_2981'>      the opulence of the faithful, as they were dispersed in obscure</a>
<a id='line_2982'>      villages, or collected in the great cities of the empire. In the</a>
<a id='line_2983'>      time of the emperor Decius, it was the opinion of the</a>
<a id='line_2984'>      magistrates, that the Christians of Rome were possessed of very</a>
<a id='line_2985'>      considerable wealth; that vessels of gold and silver were used in</a>
<a id='line_2986'>      their religious worship, and that many among their proselytes had</a>
<a id='line_2987'>      sold their lands and houses to increase the public riches of the</a>
<a id='line_2988'>      sect, at the expense, indeed, of their unfortunate children, who</a>
<a id='line_2989'>      found themselves beggars, because their parents had been saints.</a>
<a id='line_2990'>      134 We should listen with distrust to the suspicions of strangers</a>

<a id='line_2993'>      the only ones that have reached our knowledge, which define any</a>
<a id='line_2994'>      precise sums, or convey any distinct idea. Almost at the same</a>
<a id='line_2995'>      period, the bishop of Carthage, from a society less opulent than</a>
<a id='line_2996'>      that of Rome, collected a hundred thousand sesterces, (above</a>
<a id='line_2997'>      eight hundred and fifty pounds sterling,) on a sudden call of</a>
<a id='line_2998'>      charity to redeem the brethren of Numidia, who had been carried</a>
<a id='line_2999'>      away captives by the barbarians of the desert. 135 About a</a>
<a id='line_3000'>      hundred years before the reign of Decius, the Roman church had</a>
<a id='line_3001'>      received, in a single donation, the sum of two hundred thousand</a>
<a id='line_3002'>      sesterces from a stranger of Pontus, who proposed to fix his</a>
<a id='line_3003'>      residence in the capital. 136 These oblations, for the most part,</a>
<a id='line_3004'>      were made in money; nor was the society of Christians either</a>
<a id='line_3005'>      desirous or capable of acquiring, to any considerable degree, the</a>
<a id='line_3006'>      encumbrance of landed property. It had been provided by several</a>
<a id='line_3007'>      laws, which were enacted with the same design as our statutes of</a>
<a id='line_3008'>      mortmain, that no real estates should be given or bequeathed to</a>
<a id='line_3009'>      any corporate body, without either a special privilege or a</a>
<a id='line_3010'>      particular dispensation from the emperor or from the senate; 137</a>
<a id='line_3011'>      who were seldom disposed to grant them in favor of a sect, at</a>
<a id='line_3012'>      first the object of their contempt, and at last of their fears</a>
<a id='line_3013'>      and jealousy. A transaction, however, is related under the reign</a>
<a id='line_3014'>      of Alexander Severus, which discovers that the restraint was</a>

<a id='line_3161'>      The consequences of excommunication were of a temporal as well as</a>
<a id='line_3162'>      a spiritual nature. The Christian against whom it was pronounced</a>
<a id='line_3163'>      was deprived of any part in the oblations of the faithful. The</a>
<a id='line_3164'>      ties both of religious and of private friendship were dissolved:</a>
<a id='line_3165'>      he found himself a profane object of abhorrence to the persons</a>
<a id='line_3166'>      whom he the most esteemed, or by whom he had been the most</a>
<a id='line_3167'>      tenderly beloved; and as far as an expulsion from a respectable</a>
<a id='line_3168'>      society could imprint on his character a mark of disgrace, he was</a>
<a id='line_3169'>      shunned or suspected by the generality of mankind. The situation</a>
<a id='line_3170'>      of these unfortunate exiles was in itself very painful and</a>
<a id='line_3171'>      melancholy; but, as it usually happens, their apprehensions far</a>

<a id='line_3173'>      communion were those of eternal life; nor could they erase from</a>
<a id='line_3174'>      their minds the awful opinion, that to those ecclesiastical</a>
<a id='line_3175'>      governors by whom they were condemned, the Deity had committed</a>
<a id='line_3176'>      the keys of Hell and of Paradise. The heretics, indeed, who might</a>
<a id='line_3177'>      be supported by the consciousness of their intentions, and by the</a>
<a id='line_3178'>      flattering hope that they alone had discovered the true path of</a>
<a id='line_3179'>      salvation, endeavored to regain, in their separate assemblies,</a>
<a id='line_3180'>      those comforts, temporal as well as spiritual, which they no</a>
<a id='line_3181'>      longer derived from the great society of Christians. But almost</a>
<a id='line_3182'>      all those who had reluctantly yielded to the power of vice or</a>
<a id='line_3183'>      idolatry were sensible of their fallen condition, and anxiously</a>
<a id='line_3184'>      desirous of being restored to the benefits of the Christian</a>
<a id='line_3185'>      communion.</a>
<a id='line_3186'></a>
<a id='line_3187'>      With regard to the treatment of these penitents, two opposite</a>
<a id='line_3188'>      opinions, the one of justice, the other of mercy, divided the</a>
<a id='line_3189'>      primitive church. The more rigid and inflexible casuists refused</a>
<a id='line_3190'>      them forever, and without exception, the meanest place in the</a>
<a id='line_3191'>      holy community, which they had disgraced or deserted; and leaving</a>
<a id='line_3192'>      them to the remorse of a guilty conscience, indulged them only</a>
<a id='line_3193'>      with a faint ray of hope that the contrition of their life and</a>
<a id='line_3194'>      death might possibly be accepted by the Supreme Being. 145 A</a>
<a id='line_3195'>      milder sentiment was embraced, in practice as well as in theory,</a>
<a id='line_3196'>      by the purest and most respectable of the Christian churches. 146</a>
<a id='line_3197'>      The gates of reconciliation and of heaven were seldom shut</a>
<a id='line_3198'>      against the returning penitent; but a severe and solemn form of</a>
<a id='line_3199'>      discipline was instituted, which, while it served to expiate his</a>
<a id='line_3200'>      crime, might powerfully deter the spectators from the imitation</a>
<a id='line_3201'>      of his example. Humbled by a public confession, emaciated by</a>
<a id='line_3202'>      fasting and clothed in sackcloth, the penitent lay prostrate at</a>
<a id='line_3203'>      the door of the assembly, imploring with tears the pardon of his</a>
<a id='line_3204'>      offences, and soliciting the prayers of the faithful. 147 If the</a>
<a id='line_3205'>      fault was of a very heinous nature, whole years of penance were</a>
<a id='line_3206'>      esteemed an inadequate satisfaction to the divine justice; and it</a>
<a id='line_3207'>      was always by slow and painful gradations that the sinner, the</a>
<a id='line_3208'>      heretic, or the apostate, was readmitted into the bosom of the</a>
<a id='line_3209'>      church. A sentence of perpetual excommunication was, however,</a>
<a id='line_3210'>      reserved for some crimes of an extraordinary magnitude, and</a>
<a id='line_3211'>      particularly for the inexcusable relapses of those penitents who</a>
<a id='line_3212'>      had already experienced and abused the clemency of their</a>
<a id='line_3213'>      ecclesiastical superiors. According to the circumstances or the</a>
<a id='line_3214'>      number of the guilty, the exercise of the Christian discipline</a>
<a id='line_3215'>      was varied by the discretion of the bishops. The councils of</a>
<a id='line_3216'>      Ancyra and Illiberis were held about the same time, the one in</a>
<a id='line_3217'>      Galatia, the other in Spain; but their respective canons, which</a>
<a id='line_3218'>      are still extant, seem to breathe a very different spirit. The</a>
<a id='line_3219'>      Galatian, who after his baptism had repeatedly sacrificed to</a>
<a id='line_3220'>      idols, might obtain his pardon by a penance of seven years; and</a>
<a id='line_3221'>      if he had seduced others to imitate his example, only three years</a>
<a id='line_3222'>      more were added to the term of his exile. But the unhappy</a>
<a id='line_3223'>      Spaniard, who had committed the same offence, was deprived of the</a>
<a id='line_3224'>      hope of reconciliation, even in the article of death; and his</a>
<a id='line_3225'>      idolatry was placed at the head of a list of seventeen other</a>
<a id='line_3226'>      crimes, against which a sentence no less terrible was pronounced.</a>
<a id='line_3227'>      Among these we may distinguish the inexpiable guilt of</a>

<a id='line_3253'>      these prerogatives; and covering their ambition with the fair</a>

<a id='line_3340'>      irresistible weight, which even a small band of well-trained and</a>

<a id='line_3342'>      multitude, ignorant of the subject and careless of the event of</a>

<a id='line_3348'>      by a personal concern for the safety or prosperity of their</a>
<a id='line_3349'>      tutelar deities. The ministers of Polytheism, both in Rome and in</a>
<a id='line_3350'>      the provinces, were, for the most part, men of a noble birth, and</a>
<a id='line_3351'>      of an affluent fortune, who received, as an honorable</a>

<a id='line_3410'>      danger of a painful and comfortless situation. A state of</a>
<a id='line_3411'>      scepticism and suspense may amuse a few inquisitive minds. But</a>
<a id='line_3412'>      the practice of superstition is so congenial to the multitude,</a>
<a id='line_3413'>      that if they are forcibly awakened, they still regret the loss of</a>
<a id='line_3414'>      their pleasing vision. Their love of the marvellous and</a>
<a id='line_3415'>      supernatural, their curiosity with regard to future events, and</a>
<a id='line_3416'>      their strong propensity to extend their hopes and fears beyond</a>
<a id='line_3417'>      the limits of the visible world, were the principal causes which</a>
<a id='line_3418'>      favored the establishment of Polytheism. So urgent on the vulgar</a>
<a id='line_3419'>      is the necessity of believing, that the fall of any system of</a>
<a id='line_3420'>      mythology will most probably be succeeded by the introduction of</a>
<a id='line_3421'>      some other mode of superstition. Some deities of a more recent</a>
<a id='line_3422'>      and fashionable cast might soon have occupied the deserted</a>
<a id='line_3423'>      temples of Jupiter and Apollo, if, in the decisive moment, the</a>
<a id='line_3424'>      wisdom of Providence had not interposed a genuine revelation,</a>
<a id='line_3425'>      fitted to inspire the most rational esteem and conviction,</a>
<a id='line_3426'>      whilst, at the same time, it was adorned with all that could</a>
<a id='line_3427'>      attract the curiosity, the wonder, and the veneration of the</a>
<a id='line_3428'>      people. In their actual disposition, as many were almost</a>
<a id='line_3429'>      disengaged from their artificial prejudices, but equally</a>
<a id='line_3430'>      susceptible and desirous of a devout attachment; an object much</a>

<a id='line_3432'>      place in their hearts, and to gratify the uncertain eagerness of</a>
<a id='line_3433'>      their passions. Those who are inclined to pursue this reflection,</a>
<a id='line_3434'>      instead of viewing with astonishment the rapid progress of</a>
<a id='line_3435'>      Christianity, will perhaps be surprised that its success was not</a>
<a id='line_3436'>      still more rapid and still more universal. It has been observed,</a>
<a id='line_3437'>      with truth as well as propriety, that the conquests of Rome</a>
<a id='line_3438'>      prepared and facilitated those of Christianity. In the second</a>
<a id='line_3439'>      chapter of this work we have attempted to explain in what manner</a>
<a id='line_3440'>      the most civilized provinces of Europe, Asia, and Africa were</a>
<a id='line_3441'>      united under the dominion of one sovereign, and gradually</a>
<a id='line_3442'>      connected by the most intimate ties of laws, of manners, and of</a>
<a id='line_3443'>      language. The Jews of Palestine, who had fondly expected a</a>
<a id='line_3444'>      temporal deliverer, gave so cold a reception to the miracles of</a>
<a id='line_3445'>      the divine prophet, that it was found unnecessary to publish, or</a>
<a id='line_3446'>      at least to preserve, any Hebrew gospel. 152 The authentic</a>
<a id='line_3447'>      histories of the actions of Christ were composed in the Greek</a>
<a id='line_3448'>      language, at a considerable distance from Jerusalem, and after</a>
<a id='line_3449'>      the Gentile converts were grown extremely numerous. 153 As soon</a>
<a id='line_3450'>      as those histories were translated into the Latin tongue, they</a>
<a id='line_3451'>      were perfectly intelligible to all the subjects of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_3452'>      excepting only to the peasants of Syria and Egypt, for whose</a>
<a id='line_3453'>      benefit particular versions were afterwards made. The public</a>
<a id='line_3454'>      highways, which had been constructed for the use of the legions,</a>
<a id='line_3455'>      opened an easy passage for the Christian missionaries from</a>
<a id='line_3456'>      Damascus to Corinth, and from Italy to the extremity of Spain or</a>
<a id='line_3457'>      Britain; nor did those spiritual conquerors encounter any of the</a>
<a id='line_3458'>      obstacles which usually retard or prevent the introduction of a</a>
<a id='line_3459'>      foreign religion into a distant country. There is the strongest</a>
<a id='line_3460'>      reason to believe, that before the reigns of Diocletian and</a>
<a id='line_3461'>      Constantine, the faith of Christ had been preached in every</a>
<a id='line_3462'>      province, and in all the great cities of the empire; but the</a>
<a id='line_3463'>      foundation of the several congregations, the numbers of the</a>
<a id='line_3464'>      faithful who composed them, and their proportion to the</a>
<a id='line_3465'>      unbelieving multitude, are now buried in obscurity, or disguised</a>
<a id='line_3466'>      by fiction and declamation. Such imperfect circumstances,</a>
<a id='line_3467'>      however, as have reached our knowledge concerning the increase of</a>
<a id='line_3468'>      the Christian name in Asia and Greece, in Egypt, in Italy, and in</a>
<a id='line_3469'>      the West, we shall now proceed to relate, without neglecting the</a>

<a id='line_3482'>      Eusebius, Jerome, Epiphanius, confirm this statement. Jesus</a>
<a id='line_3483'>      Christ preached himself in Syro-Chaldaic, as is proved by many</a>
<a id='line_3484'>      words which he used, and which the Evangelists have taken the</a>

<a id='line_3517'>      The rich provinces that extend from the Euphrates to the Ionian</a>
<a id='line_3518'>      Sea were the principal theatre on which the apostle of the</a>
<a id='line_3519'>      Gentiles displayed his zeal and piety. The seeds of the gospel,</a>
<a id='line_3520'>      which he had scattered in a fertile soil, were diligently</a>
<a id='line_3521'>      cultivated by his disciples; and it should seem that, during the</a>
<a id='line_3522'>      two first centuries, the most considerable body of Christians was</a>
<a id='line_3523'>      contained within those limits. Among the societies which were</a>
<a id='line_3524'>      instituted in Syria, none were more ancient or more illustrious</a>
<a id='line_3525'>      than those of Damascus, of Berea or Aleppo, and of Antioch. The</a>
<a id='line_3526'>      prophetic introduction of the Apocalypse has described and</a>
<a id='line_3527'>      immortalized the seven churches of Asia; Ephesus, Smyrna,</a>
<a id='line_3528'>      Pergamus, Thyatira, 154 Sardes, Laodicea, and Philadelphia; and</a>
<a id='line_3529'>      their colonies were soon diffused over that populous country. In</a>
<a id='line_3530'>      a very early period, the islands of Cyprus and Crete, the</a>
<a id='line_3531'>      provinces of Thrace and Macedonia, gave a favorable reception to</a>
<a id='line_3532'>      the new religion; and Christian republics were soon founded in</a>
<a id='line_3533'>      the cities of Corinth, of Sparta, and of Athens. 155 The</a>
<a id='line_3534'>      antiquity of the Greek and Asiatic churches allowed a sufficient</a>
<a id='line_3535'>      space of time for their increase and multiplication; and even the</a>
<a id='line_3536'>      swarms of Gnostics and other heretics serve to display the</a>
<a id='line_3537'>      flourishing condition of the orthodox church, since the</a>
<a id='line_3538'>      appellation of heretics has always been applied to the less</a>
<a id='line_3539'>      numerous party. To these domestic testimonies we may add the</a>
<a id='line_3540'>      confession, the complaints, and the apprehensions of the Gentiles</a>
<a id='line_3541'>      themselves. From the writings of Lucian, a philosopher who had</a>
<a id='line_3542'>      studied mankind, and who describes their manners in the most</a>
<a id='line_3543'>      lively colors, we may learn that, under the reign of Commodus,</a>
<a id='line_3544'>      his native country of Pontus was filled with Epicureans and</a>
<a id='line_3545'>      _Christians_. 156 Within fourscore years after the death of</a>
<a id='line_3546'>      Christ, 157 the humane Pliny laments the magnitude of the evil</a>
<a id='line_3547'>      which he vainly attempted to eradicate. In his very curious</a>
<a id='line_3548'>      epistle to the emperor Trajan, he affirms that the temples were</a>
<a id='line_3549'>      almost deserted, that the sacred victims scarcely found any</a>
<a id='line_3550'>      purchasers, and that the superstition had not only infected the</a>
<a id='line_3551'>      cities, but had even spread itself into the villages and the open</a>
<a id='line_3552'>      country of Pontus and Bithynia. 158</a>

<a id='line_3592'>      sixty years, the sunshine of Imperial favor, the ancient and</a>
<a id='line_3593'>      illustrious church of Antioch consisted of one hundred thousand</a>

<a id='line_3596'>      the acknowledged populousness of Cæsarea, Seleucia, and</a>

<a id='line_3598'>      souls in the earthquake which afflicted Antioch under the elder</a>
<a id='line_3599'>      Justin, 160 are so many convincing proofs that the whole number</a>
<a id='line_3600'>      of its inhabitants was not less than half a million, and that the</a>
<a id='line_3601'>      Christians, however multiplied by zeal and power, did not exceed</a>
<a id='line_3602'>      a fifth part of that great city. How different a proportion must</a>

<a id='line_3611'>      this apparent difficulty is easy and obvious. The eloquent</a>

<a id='line_3636'></a>
<a id='line_3637'>      The extensive commerce of Alexandria, and its proximity to</a>
<a id='line_3638'>      Palestine, gave an easy entrance to the new religion. It was at</a>
<a id='line_3639'>      first embraced by great numbers of the Theraputæ, or Essenians,</a>
<a id='line_3640'>      of the Lake Mareotis, a Jewish sect which had abated much of its</a>
<a id='line_3641'>      reverence for the Mosaic ceremonies. The austere life of the</a>
<a id='line_3642'>      Essenians, their fasts and excommunications, the community of</a>
<a id='line_3643'>      goods, the love of celibacy, their zeal for martyrdom, and the</a>
<a id='line_3644'>      warmth though not the purity of their faith, already offered a</a>
<a id='line_3645'>      very lively image of the primitive discipline. 162 It was in the</a>
<a id='line_3646'>      school of Alexandria that the Christian theology appears to have</a>
<a id='line_3647'>      assumed a regular and scientific form; and when Hadrian visited</a>
<a id='line_3648'>      Egypt, he found a church composed of Jews and of Greeks,</a>
<a id='line_3649'>      sufficiently important to attract the notice of that inquisitive</a>
<a id='line_3650'>      prince. 163 But the progress of Christianity was for a long time</a>
<a id='line_3651'>      confined within the limits of a single city, which was itself a</a>
<a id='line_3652'>      foreign colony, and till the close of the second century the</a>
<a id='line_3653'>      predecessors of Demetrius were the only prelates of the Egyptian</a>
<a id='line_3654'>      church. Three bishops were consecrated by the hands of Demetrius,</a>
<a id='line_3655'>      and the number was increased to twenty by his successor Heraclas.</a>
<a id='line_3656'>      164 The body of the natives, a people distinguished by a sullen</a>
<a id='line_3657'>      inflexibility of temper, 165 entertained the new doctrine with</a>
<a id='line_3658'>      coldness and reluctance; and even in the time of Origen, it was</a>
<a id='line_3659'>      rare to meet with an Egyptian who had surmounted his early</a>
<a id='line_3660'>      prejudices in favor of the sacred animals of his country. 166 As</a>
<a id='line_3661'>      soon, indeed, as Christianity ascended the throne, the zeal of</a>
<a id='line_3662'>      those barbarians obeyed the prevailing impulsion; the cities of</a>
<a id='line_3663'>      Egypt were filled with bishops, and the deserts of Thebais</a>

<a id='line_3700'>      very great multitude, 167 and the language of that great</a>
<a id='line_3701'>      historian is almost similar to the style employed by Livy, when</a>
<a id='line_3702'>      he relates the introduction and the suppression of the rites of</a>
<a id='line_3703'>      Bacchus. After the Bacchanals had awakened the severity of the</a>
