<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>      The divided provinces of the empire were again united by the</a>
<a id='line_8'>      victory of Constantius; but as that feeble prince was destitute</a>
<a id='line_9'>      of personal merit, either in peace or war; as he feared his</a>
<a id='line_10'>      generals, and distrusted his ministers; the triumph of his arms</a>
<a id='line_11'>      served only to establish the reign of the _eunuchs_ over the</a>
<a id='line_12'>      Roman world. Those unhappy beings, the ancient production of</a>
<a id='line_13'>      Oriental jealousy and despotism, 1 were introduced into Greece</a>
<a id='line_14'>      and Rome by the contagion of Asiatic luxury. 2 Their progress was</a>
<a id='line_15'>      rapid; and the eunuchs, who, in the time of Augustus, had been</a>
<a id='line_16'>      abhorred, as the monstrous retinue of an Egyptian queen, 3 were</a>
<a id='line_17'>      gradually admitted into the families of matrons, of senators, and</a>
<a id='line_18'>      of the emperors themselves. 4 Restrained by the severe edicts of</a>
<a id='line_19'>      Domitian and Nerva, cherished by the pride of Diocletian, reduced</a>
<a id='line_20'>      to an humble station by the prudence of Constantine, 6 they</a>
<a id='line_21'>      multiplied in the palaces of his degenerate sons, and insensibly</a>
<a id='line_22'>      acquired the knowledge, and at length the direction, of the</a>
<a id='line_23'>      secret councils of Constantius. The aversion and contempt which</a>
<a id='line_24'>      mankind had so uniformly entertained for that imperfect species,</a>
<a id='line_25'>      appears to have degraded their character, and to have rendered</a>
<a id='line_26'>      them almost as incapable as they were supposed to be, of</a>
<a id='line_27'>      conceiving any generous sentiment, or of performing any worthy</a>
<a id='line_28'>      action. 7 But the eunuchs were skilled in the arts of flattery</a>
<a id='line_29'>      and intrigue; and they alternately governed the mind of</a>
<a id='line_30'>      Constantius by his fears, his indolence, and his vanity. 8 Whilst</a>
<a id='line_31'>      he viewed in a deceitful mirror the fair appearance of public</a>
<a id='line_32'>      prosperity, he supinely permitted them to intercept the</a>
<a id='line_33'>      complaints of the injured provinces, to accumulate immense</a>
<a id='line_34'>      treasures by the sale of justice and of honors; to disgrace the</a>
<a id='line_35'>      most important dignities, by the promotion of those who had</a>
<a id='line_36'>      purchased at their hands the powers of oppression, 9 and to</a>
<a id='line_37'>      gratify their resentment against the few independent spirits, who</a>
<a id='line_38'>      arrogantly refused to solicit the protection of slaves. Of these</a>
<a id='line_39'>      slaves the most distinguished was the chamberlain Eusebius, who</a>
<a id='line_40'>      ruled the monarch and the palace with such absolute sway, that</a>
<a id='line_41'>      Constantius, according to the sarcasm of an impartial historian,</a>
<a id='line_42'>      possessed some credit with this haughty favorite. 10 By his</a>
<a id='line_43'>      artful suggestions, the emperor was persuaded to subscribe the</a>
<a id='line_44'>      condemnation of the unfortunate Gallus, and to add a new crime to</a>
<a id='line_45'>      the long list of unnatural murders which pollute the honor of the</a>

<a id='line_87'>      specious reasons which engaged Cyrus to intrust his person to the</a>

<a id='line_90'>      it did not diminish their strength or spirit; and he persuaded</a>

<a id='line_115'></a>
<a id='line_116'>      When the two nephews of Constantine, Gallus and Julian, were</a>
<a id='line_117'>      saved from the fury of the soldiers, the former was about twelve,</a>
<a id='line_118'>      and the latter about six, years of age; and, as the eldest was</a>
<a id='line_119'>      thought to be of a sickly constitution, they obtained with the</a>
<a id='line_120'>      less difficulty a precarious and dependent life, from the</a>
<a id='line_121'>      affected pity of Constantius, who was sensible that the execution</a>
<a id='line_122'>      of these helpless orphans would have been esteemed, by all</a>
<a id='line_123'>      mankind, an act of the most deliberate cruelty. 11 Different</a>
<a id='line_124'>      cities of Ionia and Bithynia were assigned for the places of</a>
<a id='line_125'>      their exile and education; but as soon as their growing years</a>
<a id='line_126'>      excited the jealousy of the emperor, he judged it more prudent to</a>
<a id='line_127'>      secure those unhappy youths in the strong castle of Macellum,</a>
<a id='line_128'>      near C¾sarea. The treatment which they experienced during a six</a>
<a id='line_129'>      yearsÕ confinement, was partly such as they could hope from a</a>
<a id='line_130'>      careful guardian, and partly such as they might dread from a</a>
<a id='line_131'>      suspicious tyrant. 12 Their prison was an ancient palace, the</a>
<a id='line_132'>      residence of the kings of Cappadocia; the situation was pleasant,</a>
<a id='line_133'>      the buildings stately, the enclosure spacious. They pursued their</a>
<a id='line_134'>      studies, and practised their exercises, under the tuition of the</a>
<a id='line_135'>      most skilful masters; and the numerous household appointed to</a>
<a id='line_136'>      attend, or rather to guard, the nephews of Constantine, was not</a>
<a id='line_137'>      unworthy of the dignity of their birth. But they could not</a>
<a id='line_138'>      disguise to themselves that they were deprived of fortune, of</a>
<a id='line_139'>      freedom, and of safety; secluded from the society of all whom</a>
<a id='line_140'>      they could trust or esteem, and condemned to pass their</a>
<a id='line_141'>      melancholy hours in the company of slaves devoted to the commands</a>
<a id='line_142'>      of a tyrant who had already injured them beyond the hope of</a>
<a id='line_143'>      reconciliation. At length, however, the emergencies of the state</a>
<a id='line_144'>      compelled the emperor, or rather his eunuchs, to invest Gallus,</a>
<a id='line_145'>      in the twenty-fifth year of his age, with the title of C¾sar, and</a>
<a id='line_146'>      to cement this political connection by his marriage with the</a>
<a id='line_147'>      princess Constantina. After a formal interview, in which the two</a>
<a id='line_148'>      princes mutually engaged their faith never to undertake any thing</a>
<a id='line_149'>      to the prejudice of each other, they repaired without delay to</a>
<a id='line_150'>      their respective stations. Constantius continued his march</a>
<a id='line_151'>      towards the West, and Gallus fixed his residence at Antioch; from</a>
<a id='line_152'>      whence, with a delegated authority, he administered the five</a>
<a id='line_153'>      great dioceses of the eastern pr¾fecture. 13 In this fortunate</a>
<a id='line_154'>      change, the new C¾sar was not unmindful of his brother Julian,</a>
<a id='line_155'>      who obtained the honors of his rank, the appearances of liberty,</a>
<a id='line_156'>      and the restitution of an ample patrimony. 14</a>

<a id='line_189'></a>
<a id='line_190'>      The writers the most indulgent to the memory of Gallus, and even</a>
<a id='line_191'>      Julian himself, though he wished to cast a veil over the</a>
<a id='line_192'>      frailties of his brother, are obliged to confess that the C¾sar</a>
<a id='line_193'>      was incapable of reigning. Transported from a prison to a throne,</a>
<a id='line_194'>      he possessed neither genius nor application, nor docility to</a>
<a id='line_195'>      compensate for the want of knowledge and experience. A temper</a>
<a id='line_196'>      naturally morose and violent, instead of being corrected, was</a>
<a id='line_197'>      soured by solitude and adversity; the remembrance of what he had</a>
<a id='line_198'>      endured disposed him to retaliation rather than to sympathy; and</a>
<a id='line_199'>      the ungoverned sallies of his rage were often fatal to those who</a>
<a id='line_200'>      approached his person, or were subject to his power. 15</a>
<a id='line_201'>      Constantina, his wife, is described, not as a woman, but as one</a>
<a id='line_202'>      of the infernal furies tormented with an insatiate thirst of</a>
<a id='line_203'>      human blood. 16 Instead of employing her influence to insinuate</a>
<a id='line_204'>      the mild counsels of prudence and humanity, she exasperated the</a>
<a id='line_205'>      fierce passions of her husband; and as she retained the vanity,</a>
<a id='line_206'>      though she had renounced, the gentleness of her sex, a pearl</a>
<a id='line_207'>      necklace was esteemed an equivalent price for the murder of an</a>
<a id='line_208'>      innocent and virtuous nobleman. 17 The cruelty of Gallus was</a>
<a id='line_209'>      sometimes displayed in the undissembled violence of popular or</a>
<a id='line_210'>      military executions; and was sometimes disguised by the abuse of</a>
<a id='line_211'>      law, and the forms of judicial proceedings. The private houses of</a>
<a id='line_212'>      Antioch, and the places of public resort, were besieged by spies</a>
<a id='line_213'>      and informers; and the C¾sar himself, concealed in a a plebeian</a>
<a id='line_214'>      habit, very frequently condescended to assume that odious</a>
<a id='line_215'>      character. Every apartment of the palace was adorned with the</a>
<a id='line_216'>      instruments of death and torture, and a general consternation was</a>

<a id='line_218'>      if he had been conscious how much he had to fear, and how little</a>

<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'>      As long as the civil war suspended the fate of the Roman world,</a>
<a id='line_257'>      Constantius dissembled his knowledge of the weak and cruel</a>
<a id='line_258'>      administration to which his choice had subjected the East; and</a>
<a id='line_259'>      the discovery of some assassins, secretly despatched to Antioch</a>
<a id='line_260'>      by the tyrant of Gaul, was employed to convince the public, that</a>
<a id='line_261'>      the emperor and the C¾sar were united by the same interest, and</a>
<a id='line_262'>      pursued by the same enemies. 19 But when the victory was decided</a>
<a id='line_263'>      in favor of Constantius, his dependent colleague became less</a>
<a id='line_264'>      useful and less formidable. Every circumstance of his conduct was</a>
<a id='line_265'>      severely and suspiciously examined, and it was privately</a>
<a id='line_266'>      resolved, either to deprive Gallus of the purple, or at least to</a>
<a id='line_267'>      remove him from the indolent luxury of Asia to the hardships and</a>
<a id='line_268'>      dangers of a German war. The death of Theophilus, consular of the</a>
<a id='line_269'>      province of Syria, who in a time of scarcity had been massacred</a>
<a id='line_270'>      by the people of Antioch, with the connivance, and almost at the</a>
<a id='line_271'>      instigation, of Gallus, was justly resented, not only as an act</a>
<a id='line_272'>      of wanton cruelty, but as a dangerous insult on the supreme</a>
<a id='line_273'>      majesty of Constantius. Two ministers of illustrious rank,</a>
<a id='line_274'>      Domitian the Oriental pr¾fect, and Montius, qu¾stor of the</a>
<a id='line_275'>      palace, were empowered by a special commission 1911 to visit and</a>
<a id='line_276'>      reform the state of the East. They were instructed to behave</a>
<a id='line_277'>      towards Gallus with moderation and respect, and, by the gentlest</a>
<a id='line_278'>      arts of persuasion, to engage him to comply with the invitation</a>
<a id='line_279'>      of his brother and colleague. The rashness of the pr¾fect</a>
<a id='line_280'>      disappointed these prudent measures, and hastened his own ruin,</a>
<a id='line_281'>      as well as that of his enemy. On his arrival at Antioch, Domitian</a>
<a id='line_282'>      passed disdainfully before the gates of the palace, and alleging</a>
<a id='line_283'>      a slight pretence of indisposition, continued several days in</a>
<a id='line_284'>      sullen retirement, to prepare an inflammatory memorial, which he</a>
<a id='line_285'>      transmitted to the Imperial court. Yielding at length to the</a>
<a id='line_286'>      pressing solicitations of Gallus, the pr¾fect condescended to</a>
<a id='line_287'>      take his seat in council; but his first step was to signify a</a>
<a id='line_288'>      concise and haughty mandate, importing that the C¾sar should</a>
<a id='line_289'>      immediately repair to Italy, and threatening that he himself</a>
<a id='line_290'>      would punish his delay or hesitation, by suspending the usual</a>
<a id='line_291'>      allowance of his household. The nephew and daughter of</a>
<a id='line_292'>      Constantine, who could ill brook the insolence of a subject,</a>
<a id='line_293'>      expressed their resentment by instantly delivering Domitian to</a>
<a id='line_294'>      the custody of a guard. The quarrel still admitted of some terms</a>
<a id='line_295'>      of accommodation. They were rendered impracticable by the</a>
<a id='line_296'>      imprudent behavior of Montius, a statesman whose arts and</a>
<a id='line_297'>      experience were frequently betrayed by the levity of his</a>
<a id='line_298'>      disposition. 20 The qu¾stor reproached Gallus in a haughty</a>
<a id='line_299'>      language, that a prince who was scarcely authorized to remove a</a>
<a id='line_300'>      municipal magistrate, should presume to imprison a Pr¾torian</a>
<a id='line_301'>      pr¾fect; convoked a meeting of the civil and military officers;</a>
<a id='line_302'>      and required them, in the name of their sovereign, to defend the</a>
<a id='line_303'>      person and dignity of his representatives. By this rash</a>
<a id='line_304'>      declaration of war, the impatient temper of Gallus was provoked</a>
<a id='line_305'>      to embrace the most desperate counsels. He ordered his guards to</a>
<a id='line_306'>      stand to their arms, assembled the populace of Antioch, and</a>
<a id='line_307'>      recommended to their zeal the care of his safety and revenge. His</a>
<a id='line_308'>      commands were too fatally obeyed. They rudely seized the pr¾fect</a>
<a id='line_309'>      and the qu¾stor, and tying their legs together with ropes, they</a>
<a id='line_310'>      dragged them through the streets of the city, inflicted a</a>
<a id='line_311'>      thousand insults and a thousand wounds on these unhappy victims,</a>
<a id='line_312'>      and at last precipitated their mangled and lifeless bodies into</a>

<a id='line_342'>      innocence with any hope of success. But the mind of that prince</a>
<a id='line_343'>      was formed of an equal mixture of violence and weakness. Instead</a>
<a id='line_344'>      of assuming the title of Augustus, instead of employing in his</a>

<a id='line_347'>      leaving him the vain pageantry of a court, imperceptibly recalled</a>
<a id='line_348'>      the veteran legions from the provinces of Asia. But as it still</a>
<a id='line_349'>      appeared dangerous to arrest Gallus in his capital, the slow and</a>
<a id='line_350'>      safer arts of dissimulation were practised with success. The</a>
<a id='line_351'>      frequent and pressing epistles of Constantius were filled with</a>

<a id='line_375'>      After a long delay, the reluctant C¾sar set forwards on his</a>
<a id='line_376'>      journey to the Imperial court. From Antioch to Hadrianople, he</a>
<a id='line_377'>      traversed the wide extent of his dominions with a numerous and</a>
<a id='line_378'>      stately train; and as he labored to conceal his apprehensions</a>

<a id='line_382'>      him of the impending danger. In all the principal cities he was</a>
<a id='line_383'>      met by ministers of confidence, commissioned to seize the offices</a>
<a id='line_384'>      of government, to observe his motions, and to prevent the hasty</a>
<a id='line_385'>      sallies of his despair. The persons despatched to secure the</a>
<a id='line_386'>      provinces which he left behind, passed him with cold salutations,</a>
<a id='line_387'>      or affected disdain; and the troops, whose station lay along the</a>

<a id='line_389'>      might be tempted to offer their swords for the service of a civil</a>
<a id='line_390'>      war. 23 After Gallus had been permitted to repose himself a few</a>
<a id='line_391'>      days at Hadrianople, he received a mandate, expressed in the most</a>
<a id='line_392'>      haughty and absolute style, that his splendid retinue should halt</a>
<a id='line_393'>      in that city, while the C¾sar himself, with only ten</a>
<a id='line_394'>      post-carriages, should hasten to the Imperial residence at Milan.</a>
<a id='line_395'></a>
<a id='line_396'>      In this rapid journey, the profound respect which was due to the</a>
<a id='line_397'>      brother and colleague of Constantius, was insensibly changed into</a>
<a id='line_398'>      rude familiarity; and Gallus, who discovered in the countenances</a>
<a id='line_399'>      of the attendants that they already considered themselves as his</a>
<a id='line_400'>      guards, and might soon be employed as his executioners, began to</a>
<a id='line_401'>      accuse his fatal rashness, and to recollect, with terror and</a>
<a id='line_402'>      remorse, the conduct by which he had provoked his fate. The</a>
<a id='line_403'>      dissimulation which had hitherto been preserved, was laid aside</a>
<a id='line_404'>      at Petovio, 2311 in Pannonia. He was conducted to a palace in the</a>
<a id='line_405'>      suburbs, where the general Barbatio, with a select band of</a>
<a id='line_406'>      soldiers, who could neither be moved by pity, nor corrupted by</a>
<a id='line_407'>      rewards, expected the arrival of his illustrious victim. In the</a>
<a id='line_408'>      close of the evening he was arrested, ignominiously stripped of</a>
<a id='line_409'>      the ensigns of C¾sar, and hurried away to Pola, [23b] in Istria,</a>
<a id='line_410'>      a sequestered prison, which had been so recently polluted with</a>
<a id='line_411'>      royal blood. The horror which he felt was soon increased by the</a>
<a id='line_412'>      appearance of his implacable enemy the eunuch Eusebius, who, with</a>
<a id='line_413'>      the assistance of a notary and a tribune, proceeded to</a>
<a id='line_414'>      interrogate him concerning the administration of the East. The</a>
<a id='line_415'>      C¾sar sank under the weight of shame and guilt, confessed all the</a>
<a id='line_416'>      criminal actions and all the treasonable designs with which he</a>
<a id='line_417'>      was charged; and by imputing them to the advice of his wife,</a>
<a id='line_418'>      exasperated the indignation of Constantius, who reviewed with</a>
<a id='line_419'>      partial prejudice the minutes of the examination. The emperor was</a>
<a id='line_420'>      easily convinced, that his own safety was incompatible with the</a>
<a id='line_421'>      life of his cousin: the sentence of death was signed, despatched,</a>

<a id='line_423'>      behind his back, was beheaded in prison like the vilest</a>
<a id='line_424'>      malefactor. 24 Those who are inclined to palliate the cruelties</a>
<a id='line_425'>      of Constantius, assert that he soon relented, and endeavored to</a>
<a id='line_426'>      recall the bloody mandate; but that the second messenger,</a>
<a id='line_427'>      intrusted with the reprieve, was detained by the eunuchs, who</a>
<a id='line_428'>      dreaded the unforgiving temper of Gallus, and were desirous of</a>

<a id='line_458'>      retirement in the happy country of Ionia, he was conveyed under a</a>

<a id='line_460'>      seven months, in the continual apprehension of suffering the same</a>
<a id='line_461'>      ignominious death, which was daily inflicted almost before his</a>
<a id='line_462'>      eyes, on the friends and adherents of his persecuted family. His</a>
<a id='line_463'>      looks, his gestures, his silence, were scrutinized with malignant</a>
<a id='line_464'>      curiosity, and he was perpetually assaulted by enemies whom he</a>
<a id='line_465'>      had never offended, and by arts to which he was a stranger. 26</a>
<a id='line_466'>      But in the school of adversity, Julian insensibly acquired the</a>
<a id='line_467'>      virtues of firmness and discretion. He defended his honor, as</a>
<a id='line_468'>      well as his life, against the insnaring subtleties of the</a>
<a id='line_469'>      eunuchs, who endeavored to extort some declaration of his</a>
<a id='line_470'>      sentiments; and whilst he cautiously suppressed his grief and</a>
<a id='line_471'>      resentment, he nobly disdained to flatter the tyrant, by any</a>
<a id='line_472'>      seeming approbation of his brotherÕs murder. Julian most devoutly</a>
<a id='line_473'>      ascribes his miraculous deliverance to the protection of the</a>
<a id='line_474'>      gods, who had exempted his innocence from the sentence of</a>
<a id='line_475'>      destruction pronounced by their justice against the impious house</a>
<a id='line_476'>      of Constantine. 27 As the most effectual instrument of their</a>
<a id='line_477'>      providence, he gratefully acknowledges the steady and generous</a>
<a id='line_478'>      friendship of the empress Eusebia, 28 a woman of beauty and</a>
<a id='line_479'>      merit, who, by the ascendant which she had gained over the mind</a>
<a id='line_480'>      of her husband, counterbalanced, in some measure, the powerful</a>
<a id='line_481'>      conspiracy of the eunuchs. By the intercession of his patroness,</a>
<a id='line_482'>      Julian was admitted into the Imperial presence: he pleaded his</a>
<a id='line_483'>      cause with a decent freedom, he was heard with favor; and,</a>
<a id='line_484'>      notwithstanding the efforts of his enemies, who urged the danger</a>
<a id='line_485'>      of sparing an avenger of the blood of Gallus, the milder</a>
<a id='line_486'>      sentiment of Eusebia prevailed in the council. But the effects of</a>
<a id='line_487'>      a second interview were dreaded by the eunuchs; and Julian was</a>
<a id='line_488'>      advised to withdraw for a while into the neighborhood of Milan,</a>
<a id='line_489'>      till the emperor thought proper to assign the city of Athens for</a>
<a id='line_490'>      the place of his honorable exile. As he had discovered, from his</a>
<a id='line_491'>      earliest youth, a propensity, or rather passion, for the</a>
<a id='line_492'>      language, the manners, the learning, and the religion of the</a>
<a id='line_493'>      Greeks, he obeyed with pleasure an order so agreeable to his</a>
<a id='line_494'>      wishes. Far from the tumult of arms, and the treachery of courts,</a>
<a id='line_495'>      he spent six months under the groves of the academy, in a free</a>
<a id='line_496'>      intercourse with the philosophers of the age, who studied to</a>
<a id='line_497'>      cultivate the genius, to encourage the vanity, and to inflame the</a>
<a id='line_498'>      devotion of their royal pupil. Their labors were not</a>
<a id='line_499'>      unsuccessful; and Julian inviolably preserved for Athens that</a>
<a id='line_500'>      tender regard which seldom fails to arise in a liberal mind, from</a>
<a id='line_501'>      the recollection of the place where it has discovered and</a>
<a id='line_502'>      exercised its growing powers. The gentleness and affability of</a>
<a id='line_503'>      manners, which his temper suggested and his situation imposed,</a>
<a id='line_504'>      insensibly engaged the affections of the strangers, as well as</a>
<a id='line_505'>      citizens, with whom he conversed. Some of his fellow-students</a>

<a id='line_685'>      instructions which regulated the service of his table, and the</a>
<a id='line_686'>      distribution of his hours, were adapted to a youth still under</a>
<a id='line_687'>      the discipline of his preceptors, rather than to the situation of</a>
<a id='line_688'>      a prince intrusted with the conduct of an important war. If he</a>
<a id='line_689'>      aspired to deserve the esteem of his subjects, he was checked by</a>
<a id='line_690'>      the fear of displeasing his sovereign; and even the fruits of his</a>
<a id='line_691'>      marriage-bed were blasted by the jealous artifices of Eusebia 39</a>
<a id='line_692'>      herself, who, on this occasion alone, seems to have been</a>
<a id='line_693'>      unmindful of the tenderness of her sex, and the generosity of her</a>
<a id='line_694'>      character. The memory of his father and of his brothers reminded</a>
<a id='line_695'>      Julian of his own danger, and his apprehensions were increased by</a>
<a id='line_696'>      the recent and unworthy fate of Sylvanus. In the summer which</a>
<a id='line_697'>      preceded his own elevation, that general had been chosen to</a>
<a id='line_698'>      deliver Gaul from the tyranny of the Barbarians; but Sylvanus</a>
<a id='line_699'>      soon discovered that he had left his most dangerous enemies in</a>
<a id='line_700'>      the Imperial court. A dexterous informer, countenanced by several</a>
<a id='line_701'>      of the principal ministers, procured from him some recommendatory</a>
<a id='line_702'>      letters; and erasing the whole of the contents, except the</a>
<a id='line_703'>      signature, filled up the vacant parchment with matters of high</a>
<a id='line_704'>      and treasonable import. By the industry and courage of his</a>
<a id='line_705'>      friends, the fraud was however detected, and in a great council</a>
<a id='line_706'>      of the civil and military officers, held in the presence of the</a>
<a id='line_707'>      emperor himself, the innocence of Sylvanus was publicly</a>
<a id='line_708'>      acknowledged. But the discovery came too late; the report of the</a>
<a id='line_709'>      calumny, and the hasty seizure of his estate, had already</a>
<a id='line_710'>      provoked the indignant chief to the rebellion of which he was so</a>

<a id='line_712'>      Cologne, and his active powers appeared to menace Italy with an</a>
<a id='line_713'>      invasion, and Milan with a siege. In this emergency, Ursicinus, a</a>

<a id='line_761'>      the ancient capital. 41 He proceeded from Milan to Rome along the</a>
<a id='line_762'>      ®milian and Flaminian ways, and as soon as he approached within</a>
<a id='line_763'>      forty miles of the city, the march of a prince who had never</a>
<a id='line_764'>      vanquished a foreign enemy, assumed the appearance of a triumphal</a>
<a id='line_765'>      procession. His splendid train was composed of all the ministers</a>
<a id='line_766'>      of luxury; but in a time of profound peace, he was encompassed by</a>
<a id='line_767'>      the glittering arms of the numerous squadrons of his guards and</a>
<a id='line_768'>      cuirassiers. Their streaming banners of silk, embossed with gold,</a>
<a id='line_769'>      and shaped in the form of dragons, waved round the person of the</a>
<a id='line_770'>      emperor. Constantius sat alone in a lofty car, resplendent with</a>
<a id='line_771'>      gold and precious gems; and, except when he bowed his head to</a>
<a id='line_772'>      pass under the gates of the cities, he affected a stately</a>
<a id='line_773'>      demeanor of inflexible, and, as it might seem, of insensible</a>
<a id='line_774'>      gravity. The severe discipline of the Persian youth had been</a>
<a id='line_775'>      introduced by the eunuchs into the Imperial palace; and such were</a>
<a id='line_776'>      the habits of patience which they had inculcated, that during a</a>
<a id='line_777'>      slow and sultry march, he was never seen to move his hand towards</a>
<a id='line_778'>      his face, or to turn his eyes either to the right or to the left.</a>
<a id='line_779'>      He was received by the magistrates and senate of Rome; and the</a>
<a id='line_780'>      emperor surveyed, with attention, the civil honors of the</a>
<a id='line_781'>      republic, and the consular images of the noble families. The</a>
<a id='line_782'>      streets were lined with an innumerable multitude. Their repeated</a>
<a id='line_783'>      acclamations expressed their joy at beholding, after an absence</a>
<a id='line_784'>      of thirty-two years, the sacred person of their sovereign, and</a>
<a id='line_785'>      Constantius himself expressed, with some pleasantry, he affected</a>
<a id='line_786'>      surprise that the human race should thus suddenly be collected on</a>
<a id='line_787'>      the same spot. The son of Constantine was lodged in the ancient</a>
<a id='line_788'>      palace of Augustus: he presided in the senate, harangued the</a>
<a id='line_789'>      people from the tribunal which Cicero had so often ascended,</a>
<a id='line_790'>      assisted with unusual courtesy at the games of the Circus, and</a>
<a id='line_791'>      accepted the crowns of gold, as well as the Panegyrics which had</a>
<a id='line_792'>      been prepared for the ceremony by the deputies of the principal</a>
<a id='line_793'>      cities. His short visit of thirty days was employed in viewing</a>
<a id='line_794'>      the monuments of art and power which were scattered over the</a>
<a id='line_795'>      seven hills and the interjacent valleys. He admired the awful</a>
<a id='line_796'>      majesty of the Capitol, the vast extent of the baths of Caracalla</a>
<a id='line_797'>      and Diocletian, the severe simplicity of the Pantheon, the massy</a>
<a id='line_798'>      greatness of the amphitheatre of Titus, the elegant architecture</a>

<a id='line_820'>      the difficulties of the execution, 42 he chose rather to</a>
<a id='line_821'>      embellish the capital by the gift of an Egyptian obelisk. In a</a>
<a id='line_822'>      remote but polished age, which seems to have preceded the</a>
<a id='line_823'>      invention of alphabetical writing, a great number of these</a>

<a id='line_826'>      confidence that the simplicity of their form, and the hardness of</a>
<a id='line_827'>      their substance, would resist the injuries of time and violence.</a>

<a id='line_831'>      obelisk, which, from its size or sanctity, escaped for a long</a>

<a id='line_834'>      his order from the pedestal where it stood before the Temple of</a>

<a id='line_836'>      The death of Constantine suspended the execution of his purpose,</a>
<a id='line_837'>      and this obelisk was destined by his son to the ancient capital</a>

<a id='line_894'>      exchanged the institutions of Germany for the arms and military</a>
<a id='line_895'>      arts of their Sarmatian allies. 47 The garrisons of the frontiers</a>
<a id='line_896'>      were insufficient to check their progress; and the indolent</a>
<a id='line_897'>      monarch was at length compelled to assemble, from the extremities</a>

<a id='line_900'>      preceding autumn and the ensuing spring, in the serious</a>
<a id='line_901'>      prosecution of the war. The emperor passed the Danube on a bridge</a>
<a id='line_902'>      of boats, cut in pieces all that encountered his march,</a>
<a id='line_903'>      penetrated into the heart of the country of the Quadi, and</a>
<a id='line_904'>      severely retaliated the calamities which they had inflicted on</a>
<a id='line_905'>      the Roman province. The dismayed Barbarians were soon reduced to</a>
<a id='line_906'>      sue for peace: they offered the restitution of his captive</a>
<a id='line_907'>      subjects as an atonement for the past, and the noblest hostages</a>
<a id='line_908'>      as a pledge of their future conduct. The generous courtesy which</a>
<a id='line_909'>      was shown to the first among their chieftains who implored the</a>
<a id='line_910'>      clemency of Constantius, encouraged the more timid, or the more</a>
<a id='line_911'>      obstinate, to imitate their example; and the Imperial camp was</a>
<a id='line_912'>      crowded with the princes and ambassadors of the most distant</a>
<a id='line_913'>      tribes, who occupied the plains of the Lesser Poland, and who</a>
<a id='line_914'>      might have deemed themselves secure behind the lofty ridge of the</a>
<a id='line_915'>      Carpathian Mountains. While Constantius gave laws to the</a>
<a id='line_916'>      Barbarians beyond the Danube, he distinguished, with specious</a>
<a id='line_917'>      compassion, the Sarmatian exiles, who had been expelled from</a>
<a id='line_918'>      their native country by the rebellion of their slaves, and who</a>
<a id='line_919'>      formed a very considerable accession to the power of the Quadi.</a>
<a id='line_920'>      The emperor, embracing a generous but artful system of policy,</a>
<a id='line_921'>      released the Sarmatians from the bands of this humiliating</a>
<a id='line_922'>      dependence, and restored them, by a separate treaty, to the</a>
<a id='line_923'>      dignity of a nation united under the government of a king, the</a>
<a id='line_924'>      friend and ally of the republic. He declared his resolution of</a>
<a id='line_925'>      asserting the justice of their cause, and of securing the peace</a>
<a id='line_926'>      of the provinces by the extirpation, or at least the banishment,</a>
<a id='line_927'>      of the Limigantes, whose manners were still infected with the</a>
<a id='line_928'>      vices of their servile origin. The execution of this design was</a>
<a id='line_929'>      attended with more difficulty than glory. The territory of the</a>
<a id='line_930'>      Limigantes was protected against the Romans by the Danube,</a>
<a id='line_931'>      against the hostile Barbarians by the Teyss. The marshy lands</a>
<a id='line_932'>      which lay between those rivers, and were often covered by their</a>
<a id='line_933'>      inundations, formed an intricate wilderness, pervious only to the</a>
<a id='line_934'>      inhabitants, who were acquainted with its secret paths and</a>
<a id='line_935'>      inaccessible fortresses. On the approach of Constantius, the</a>
<a id='line_936'>      Limigantes tried the efficacy of prayers, of fraud, and of arms;</a>
<a id='line_937'>      but he sternly rejected their supplications, defeated their rude</a>
<a id='line_938'>      stratagems, and repelled with skill and firmness the efforts of</a>
<a id='line_939'>      their irregular valor. One of their most warlike tribes,</a>
<a id='line_940'>      established in a small island towards the conflux of the Teyss</a>
<a id='line_941'>      and the Danube, consented to pass the river with the intention of</a>
<a id='line_942'>      surprising the emperor during the security of an amicable</a>
<a id='line_943'>      conference. They soon became the victims of the perfidy which</a>
<a id='line_944'>      they meditated. Encompassed on every side, trampled down by the</a>
<a id='line_945'>      cavalry, slaughtered by the swords of the legions, they disdained</a>
<a id='line_946'>      to ask for mercy; and with an undaunted countenance, still</a>
<a id='line_947'>      grasped their weapons in the agonies of death. After this</a>
<a id='line_948'>      victory, a considerable body of Romans was landed on the opposite</a>
<a id='line_949'>      banks of the Danube; the Taifal¾, a Gothic tribe engaged in the</a>
<a id='line_950'>      service of the empire, invaded the Limigantes on the side of the</a>
<a id='line_951'>      Teyss; and their former masters, the free Sarmatians, animated by</a>
<a id='line_952'>      hope and revenge, penetrated through the hilly country, into the</a>
<a id='line_953'>      heart of their ancient possessions. A general conflagration</a>
<a id='line_954'>      revealed the huts of the Barbarians, which were seated in the</a>
<a id='line_955'>      depth of the wilderness; and the soldier fought with confidence</a>
<a id='line_956'>      on marshy ground, which it was dangerous for him to tread. In</a>
<a id='line_957'>      this extremity, the bravest of the Limigantes were resolved to</a>
<a id='line_958'>      die in arms, rather than to yield: but the milder sentiment,</a>
<a id='line_959'>      enforced by the authority of their elders, at length prevailed;</a>
<a id='line_960'>      and the suppliant crowd, followed by their wives and children,</a>
<a id='line_961'>      repaired to the Imperial camp, to learn their fate from the mouth</a>
<a id='line_962'>      of the conqueror. After celebrating his own clemency, which was</a>
<a id='line_963'>      still inclined to pardon their repeated crimes, and to spare the</a>
<a id='line_964'>      remnant of a guilty nation, Constantius assigned for the place of</a>
<a id='line_965'>      their exile a remote country, where they might enjoy a safe and</a>
<a id='line_966'>      honorable repose. The Limigantes obeyed with reluctance; but</a>
<a id='line_967'>      before they could reach, at least before they could occupy, their</a>
<a id='line_968'>      destined habitations, they returned to the banks of the Danube,</a>
<a id='line_969'>      exaggerating the hardships of their situation, and requesting,</a>
<a id='line_970'>      with fervent professions of fidelity, that the emperor would</a>
<a id='line_971'>      grant them an undisturbed settlement within the limits of the</a>
<a id='line_972'>      Roman provinces. Instead of consulting his own experience of</a>
<a id='line_973'>      their incurable perfidy, Constantius listened to his flatterers,</a>
<a id='line_974'>      who were ready to represent the honor and advantage of accepting</a>
<a id='line_975'>      a colony of soldiers, at a time when it was much easier to obtain</a>
<a id='line_976'>      the pecuniary contributions than the military service of the</a>
<a id='line_977'>      subjects of the empire. The Limigantes were permitted to pass the</a>
<a id='line_978'>      Danube; and the emperor gave audience to the multitude in a large</a>
<a id='line_979'>      plain near the modern city of Buda. They surrounded the tribunal,</a>
<a id='line_980'>      and seemed to hear with respect an oration full of mildness and</a>
<a id='line_981'>      dignity when one of the Barbarians, casting his shoe into the</a>
<a id='line_982'>      air, exclaimed with a loud voice, _Marha! Marha!_ 4711 a word of</a>
<a id='line_983'>      defiance, which was received as a signal of the tumult. They</a>
<a id='line_984'>      rushed with fury to seize the person of the emperor; his royal</a>
<a id='line_985'>      throne and golden couch were pillaged by these rude hands; but</a>
<a id='line_986'>      the faithful defence of his guards, who died at his feet, allowed</a>
<a id='line_987'>      him a moment to mount a fleet horse, and to escape from the</a>
<a id='line_988'>      confusion. The disgrace which had been incurred by a treacherous</a>
<a id='line_989'>      surprise was soon retrieved by the numbers and discipline of the</a>
<a id='line_990'>      Romans; and the combat was only terminated by the extinction of</a>
<a id='line_991'>      the name and nation of the Limigantes. The free Sarmatians were</a>
<a id='line_992'>      reinstated in the possession of their ancient seats; and although</a>
<a id='line_993'>      Constantius distrusted the levity of their character, he</a>
<a id='line_994'>      entertained some hopes that a sense of gratitude might influence</a>
<a id='line_995'>      their future conduct. He had remarked the lofty stature and</a>
<a id='line_996'>      obsequious demeanor of Zizais, one of the noblest of their</a>
<a id='line_997'>      chiefs. He conferred on him the title of King; and Zizais proved</a>
<a id='line_998'>      that he was not unworthy to reign, by a sincere and lasting</a>
<a id='line_999'>      attachment to the interests of his benefactor, who, after this</a>
<a id='line_1000'>      splendid success, received the name of _Sarmaticus_ from the</a>

<a id='line_1029'>      peace, translated into the servile and flattering language of</a>

<a id='line_1035'>      after a long journey, and, at his first audience, respectfully</a>
<a id='line_1036'>      unfolded the silken veil which covered the haughty epistle of his</a>

<a id='line_1038'>      (such were the lofty titles affected by Oriental vanity,)</a>
<a id='line_1039'>      expressed his satisfaction that his brother, Constantius C¾sar,</a>
<a id='line_1040'>      had been taught wisdom by adversity. As the lawful successor of</a>
<a id='line_1041'>      Darius Hystaspes, Sapor asserted, that the River Strymon, in</a>
<a id='line_1042'>      Macedonia, was the true and ancient boundary of his empire;</a>
<a id='line_1043'>      declaring, however, that as an evidence of his moderation, he</a>
<a id='line_1044'>      would content himself with the provinces of Armenia and</a>
<a id='line_1045'>      Mesopotamia, which had been fraudulently extorted from his</a>
<a id='line_1046'>      ancestors. He alleged, that, without the restitution of these</a>
<a id='line_1047'>      disputed countries, it was impossible to establish any treaty on</a>
<a id='line_1048'>      a solid and permanent basis; and he arrogantly threatened, that</a>
<a id='line_1049'>      if his ambassador returned in vain, he was prepared to take the</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      field in the spring, and to support the justice of his cause by</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      the strength of his invincible arms. Narses, who was endowed with</a>
<a id='line_1052'>      the most polite and amiable manners, endeavored, as far as was</a>
<a id='line_1053'>      consistent with his duty, to soften the harshness of the message.</a>
<a id='line_1054'>      50 Both the style and substance were maturely weighed in the</a>

<a id='line_1059'>      treaty; but it was highly indecent, as well as absurd, to propose</a>
<a id='line_1060'>      to the sole and victorious emperor of the Roman world, the same</a>
<a id='line_1061'>      conditions of peace which he had indignantly rejected at the time</a>
<a id='line_1062'>      when his power was contracted within the narrow limits of the</a>
<a id='line_1063'>      East: the chance of arms was uncertain; and Sapor should</a>
<a id='line_1064'>      recollect, that if the Romans had sometimes been vanquished in</a>
<a id='line_1065'>      battle, they had almost always been successful in the event of</a>
<a id='line_1066'>      the war.Ó A few days after the departure of Narses, three</a>
<a id='line_1067'>      ambassadors were sent to the court of Sapor, who was already</a>
<a id='line_1068'>      returned from the Scythian expedition to his ordinary residence</a>
<a id='line_1069'>      of Ctesiphon. A count, a notary, and a sophist, had been selected</a>
<a id='line_1070'>      for this important commission; and Constantius, who was secretly</a>
<a id='line_1071'>      anxious for the conclusion of the peace, entertained some hopes</a>
<a id='line_1072'>      that the dignity of the first of these ministers, the dexterity</a>
<a id='line_1073'>      of the second, and the rhetoric of the third, 51 would persuade</a>
<a id='line_1074'>      the Persian monarch to abate of the rigor of his demands. But the</a>
<a id='line_1075'>      progress of their negotiation was opposed and defeated by the</a>
<a id='line_1076'>      hostile arts of Antoninus, 52 a Roman subject of Syria, who had</a>
<a id='line_1077'>      fled from oppression, and was admitted into the councils of</a>
<a id='line_1078'>      Sapor, and even to the royal table, where, according to the</a>
<a id='line_1079'>      custom of the Persians, the most important business was</a>
<a id='line_1080'>      frequently discussed. 53 The dexterous fugitive promoted his</a>
<a id='line_1081'>      interest by the same conduct which gratified his revenge. He</a>
<a id='line_1082'>      incessantly urged the ambition of his new master to embrace the</a>
<a id='line_1083'>      favorable opportunity when the bravest of the Palatine troops</a>

<a id='line_1131'>      Chionites, displayed the stern countenance of an aged and</a>

<a id='line_1146'>      progress, or defeat their design. The inhabitants, with their</a>

<a id='line_1148'>      throughout the country was set on fire, the fords of the rivers</a>

<a id='line_1150'>      the opposite banks, and a seasonable swell of the waters of the</a>
<a id='line_1151'>      Euphrates deterred the Barbarians from attempting the ordinary</a>
<a id='line_1152'>      passage of the bridge of Thapsacus. Their skilful guide, changing</a>

<a id='line_1158'>      he resolved to try whether the majesty of his presence would not</a>
<a id='line_1159'>      awe the garrison into immediate submission. The sacrilegious</a>
<a id='line_1160'>      insult of a random dart, which glanced against the royal tiara,</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      convinced him of his error; and the indignant monarch listened</a>

<a id='line_1199'>      to the amount of seven legions, when the place was invested by</a>
<a id='line_1200'>      the arms of Sapor. 57 His first and most sanguine hopes depended</a>
<a id='line_1201'>      on the success of a general assault. To the several nations which</a>
<a id='line_1202'>      followed his standard, their respective posts were assigned; the</a>

<a id='line_1205'>      Segestans, the bravest of his warriors, who covered their front</a>
<a id='line_1206'>      with a formidable line of Indian elephants. 58 The Persians, on</a>
<a id='line_1207'>      every side, supported their efforts, and animated their courage;</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      and the monarch himself, careless of his rank and safety,</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      displayed, in the prosecution of the siege, the ardor of a</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      youthful soldier. After an obstinate combat, the Barbarians were</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      repulsed; they incessantly returned to the charge; they were</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      again driven back with a dreadful slaughter, and two rebel</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      legions of Gauls, who had been banished into the East, signalized</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      their undisciplined courage by a nocturnal sally into the heart</a>
<a id='line_1215'>      of the Persian camp. In one of the fiercest of these repeated</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      assaults, Amida was betrayed by the treachery of a deserter, who</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      indicated to the Barbarians a secret and neglected staircase,</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      scooped out of the rock that hangs over the stream of the Tigris.</a>
<a id='line_1219'>      Seventy chosen archers of the royal guard ascended in silence to</a>
<a id='line_1220'>      the third story of a lofty tower, which commanded the precipice;</a>
<a id='line_1221'>      they elevated on high the Persian banner, the signal of</a>
<a id='line_1222'>      confidence to the assailants, and of dismay to the besieged; and</a>
<a id='line_1223'>      if this devoted band could have maintained their post a few</a>
<a id='line_1224'>      minutes longer, the reduction of the place might have been</a>
<a id='line_1225'>      purchased by the sacrifice of their lives. After Sapor had tried,</a>
<a id='line_1226'>      without success, the efficacy of force and of stratagem, he had</a>
<a id='line_1227'>      recourse to the slower but more certain operations of a regular</a>
<a id='line_1228'>      siege, in the conduct of which he was instructed by the skill of</a>
<a id='line_1229'>      the Roman deserters. The trenches were opened at a convenient</a>
<a id='line_1230'>      distance, and the troops destined for that service advanced under</a>
<a id='line_1231'>      the portable cover of strong hurdles, to fill up the ditch, and</a>

<a id='line_1234'>      soldiers, who were provided with every species of missile</a>

<a id='line_1508'>      Under these melancholy circumstances, an unexperienced youth was</a>
<a id='line_1509'>      appointed to save and to govern the provinces of Gaul, or rather,</a>
<a id='line_1510'>      as he expressed it himself, to exhibit the vain image of Imperial</a>
<a id='line_1511'>      greatness. The retired scholastic education of Julian, in which</a>
<a id='line_1512'>      he had been more conversant with books than with arms, with the</a>
<a id='line_1513'>      dead than with the living, left him in profound ignorance of the</a>
<a id='line_1514'>      practical arts of war and government; and when he awkwardly</a>
<a id='line_1515'>      repeated some military exercise which it was necessary for him to</a>
<a id='line_1516'>      learn, he exclaimed with a sigh, ÒO Plato, Plato, what a task for</a>
<a id='line_1517'>      a philosopher!Ó Yet even this speculative philosophy, which men</a>
<a id='line_1518'>      of business are too apt to despise, had filled the mind of Julian</a>
<a id='line_1519'>      with the noblest precepts and the most shining examples; had</a>
<a id='line_1520'>      animated him with the love of virtue, the desire of fame, and the</a>
<a id='line_1521'>      contempt of death. The habits of temperance recommended in the</a>
<a id='line_1522'>      schools, are still more essential in the severe discipline of a</a>
<a id='line_1523'>      camp. The simple wants of nature regulated the measure of his</a>
<a id='line_1524'>      food and sleep. Rejecting with disdain the delicacies provided</a>
<a id='line_1525'>      for his table, he satisfied his appetite with the coarse and</a>
<a id='line_1526'>      common fare which was allotted to the meanest soldiers. During</a>
<a id='line_1527'>      the rigor of a Gallic winter, he never suffered a fire in his</a>
<a id='line_1528'>      bed-chamber; and after a short and interrupted slumber, he</a>
<a id='line_1529'>      frequently rose in the middle of the night from a carpet spread</a>
<a id='line_1530'>      on the floor, to despatch any urgent business, to visit his</a>
<a id='line_1531'>      rounds, or to steal a few moments for the prosecution of his</a>
<a id='line_1532'>      favorite studies. 67 The precepts of eloquence, which he had</a>
<a id='line_1533'>      hitherto practised on fancied topics of declamation, were more</a>
<a id='line_1534'>      usefully applied to excite or to assuage the passions of an armed</a>
<a id='line_1535'>      multitude: and although Julian, from his early habits of</a>
<a id='line_1536'>      conversation and literature, was more familiarly acquainted with</a>
<a id='line_1537'>      the beauties of the Greek language, he had attained a competent</a>
<a id='line_1538'>      knowledge of the Latin tongue. 68 Since Julian was not originally</a>
<a id='line_1539'>      designed for the character of a legislator, or a judge, it is</a>
<a id='line_1540'>      probable that the civil jurisprudence of the Romans had not</a>
<a id='line_1541'>      engaged any considerable share of his attention: but he derived</a>
<a id='line_1542'>      from his philosophic studies an inflexible regard for justice,</a>
<a id='line_1543'>      tempered by a disposition to clemency; the knowledge of the</a>
<a id='line_1544'>      general principles of equity and evidence, and the faculty of</a>
<a id='line_1545'>      patiently investigating the most intricate and tedious questions</a>
<a id='line_1546'>      which could be proposed for his discussion. The measures of</a>
<a id='line_1547'>      policy, and the operations of war, must submit to the various</a>
<a id='line_1548'>      accidents of circumstance and character, and the unpractised</a>

<a id='line_1552'>      But in the acquisition of this important science, Julian was</a>

<a id='line_1580'>      Immediately after Julian had received the purple at Milan, he was</a>
<a id='line_1581'>      sent into Gaul with a feeble retinue of three hundred and sixty</a>
<a id='line_1582'>      soldiers. At Vienna, where he passed a painful and anxious winter</a>
<a id='line_1583'>      in the hands of those ministers to whom Constantius had intrusted</a>
<a id='line_1584'>      the direction of his conduct, the C¾sar was informed of the siege</a>
<a id='line_1585'>      and deliverance of Autun. That large and ancient city, protected</a>
<a id='line_1586'>      only by a ruined wall and pusillanimous garrison, was saved by</a>
<a id='line_1587'>      the generous resolution of a few veterans, who resumed their arms</a>
<a id='line_1588'>      for the defence of their country. In his march from Autun,</a>
<a id='line_1589'>      through the heart of the Gallic provinces, Julian embraced with</a>
<a id='line_1590'>      ardor the earliest opportunity of signalizing his courage. At the</a>
<a id='line_1591'>      head of a small body of archers and heavy cavalry, he preferred</a>
<a id='line_1592'>      the shorter but the more dangerous of two roads; 6911 and</a>
<a id='line_1593'>      sometimes eluding, and sometimes resisting, the attacks of the</a>
<a id='line_1594'>      Barbarians, who were masters of the field, he arrived with honor</a>
<a id='line_1595'>      and safety at the camp near Rheims, where the Roman troops had</a>
<a id='line_1596'>      been ordered to assemble. The aspect of their young prince</a>
<a id='line_1597'>      revived the drooping spirits of the soldiers, and they marched</a>
<a id='line_1598'>      from Rheims in search of the enemy, with a confidence which had</a>
<a id='line_1599'>      almost proved fatal to them. The Alemanni, familiarized to the</a>
<a id='line_1600'>      knowledge of the country, secretly collected their scattered</a>
<a id='line_1601'>      forces, and seizing the opportunity of a dark and rainy day,</a>
<a id='line_1602'>      poured with unexpected fury on the rear-guard of the Romans.</a>
<a id='line_1603'>      Before the inevitable disorder could be remedied, two legions</a>
<a id='line_1604'>      were destroyed; and Julian was taught by experience that caution</a>
<a id='line_1605'>      and vigilance are the most important lessons of the art of war.</a>
<a id='line_1606'>      In a second and more successful action, he recovered and</a>
<a id='line_1607'>      established his military fame; but as the agility of the</a>
<a id='line_1608'>      Barbarians saved them from the pursuit, his victory was neither</a>
<a id='line_1609'>      bloody nor decisive. He advanced, however, to the banks of the</a>
<a id='line_1610'>      Rhine, surveyed the ruins of Cologne, convinced himself of the</a>

<a id='line_1636'>      The conscious pride of Julian, who was indebted only to his sword</a>

<a id='line_1645'>      dangerous an insult, his person and authority would have been</a>
<a id='line_1646'>      exposed to the contempt of the world; and if an action so</a>

<a id='line_1653'>      fidelity, who could advise with respect, and execute with zeal;</a>
<a id='line_1654'>      and who submitted, without reluctance to the supreme command</a>
<a id='line_1655'>      which Julian, by the inrerest of his patroness Eusebia, at length</a>
<a id='line_1656'>      obtained over the armies of Gaul. 72 A very judicious plan of</a>
<a id='line_1657'>      operations was adopted for the approaching campaign. Julian</a>
<a id='line_1658'>      himself, at the head of the remains of the veteran bands, and of</a>
<a id='line_1659'>      some new levies which he had been permitted to form, boldly</a>
<a id='line_1660'>      penetrated into the centre of the German cantonments, and</a>
<a id='line_1661'>      carefully reestablished the fortifications of Saverne, in an</a>
<a id='line_1662'>      advantageous post, which would either check the incursions, or</a>
<a id='line_1663'>      intercept the retreat, of the enemy. At the same time, Barbatio,</a>
<a id='line_1664'>      general of the infantry, advanced from Milan with an army of</a>
<a id='line_1665'>      thirty thousand men, and passing the mountains, prepared to throw</a>
<a id='line_1666'>      a bridge over the Rhine, in the neighborhood of Basil. It was</a>
<a id='line_1667'>      reasonable to expect that the Alemanni, pressed on either side by</a>
<a id='line_1668'>      the Roman arms, would soon be forced to evacuate the provinces of</a>
<a id='line_1669'>      Gaul, and to hasten to the defence of their native country. But</a>
<a id='line_1670'>      the hopes of the campaign were defeated by the incapacity, or the</a>
<a id='line_1671'>      envy, or the secret instructions, of Barbatio; who acted as if he</a>
<a id='line_1672'>      had been the enemy of the C¾sar, and the secret ally of the</a>
<a id='line_1673'>      Barbarians. The negligence with which he permitted a troop of</a>
<a id='line_1674'>      pillagers freely to pass, and to return almost before the gates</a>
<a id='line_1675'>      of his camp, may be imputed to his want of abilities; but the</a>
<a id='line_1676'>      treasonable act of burning a number of boats, and a superfluous</a>
<a id='line_1677'>      stock of provisions, which would have been of the most essential</a>

<a id='line_1711'>      inspired. 74 He was followed by six other kings, by ten princes</a>

<a id='line_1713'>      by thirty-five thousand of the bravest warriors of the tribes of</a>

<a id='line_1724'>      the day was so far spent when they appeared in sight of the</a>

<a id='line_1726'>      next morning, and of allowing his troops to recruit their</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      exhausted strength by the necessary refreshments of sleep and</a>

<a id='line_1729'>      the soldiers, and even to the opinion of his council, he exhorted</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      them to justify by their valor the eager impatience, which, in</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      case of a defeat, would be universally branded with the epithets</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      of rashness and presumption. The trumpets sounded, the military</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      shout was heard through the field, and the two armies rushed with</a>
<a id='line_1734'>      equal fury to the charge. The C¾sar, who conducted in person his</a>
<a id='line_1735'>      right wing, depended on the dexterity of his archers, and the</a>
<a id='line_1736'>      weight of his cuirassiers. But his ranks were instantly broken by</a>
<a id='line_1737'>      an irregular mixture of light horse and of light infantry, and he</a>
<a id='line_1738'>      had the mortification of beholding the flight of six hundred of</a>
<a id='line_1739'>      his most renowned cuirassiers. 75 The fugitives were stopped and</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      rallied by the presence and authority of Julian, who, careless of</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      his own safety, threw himself before them, and urging every</a>

<a id='line_1744'>      obstinate and bloody. The Germans possessed the superiority of</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      strength and stature, the Romans that of discipline and temper;</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      and as the Barbarians, who served under the standard of the</a>

<a id='line_1748'>      strenuous efforts, guided by a skilful leader, at length</a>

<a id='line_1751'>      battle of Strasburgh, so glorious to the C¾sar, 76 and so</a>
<a id='line_1752'>      salutary to the afflicted provinces of Gaul. Six thousand of the</a>

<a id='line_1754'>      were drowned in the Rhine, or transfixed with darts while they</a>

<a id='line_1762'>      vanquished king of the Alemanni, as a grateful spectacle to the</a>
<a id='line_1763'>      cities of Gaul, he respectfully laid at the feet of the emperor</a>

<a id='line_1812'>      them as the flowers of spring. In the month of December, which</a>

<a id='line_1814'>      hundred Franks, who had thrown themselves into two castles on the</a>
<a id='line_1815'>      Meuse. 80 In the midst of that severe season they sustained, with</a>
<a id='line_1816'>      inflexible constancy, a siege of fifty-four days; till at length,</a>
<a id='line_1817'>      exhausted by hunger, and satisfied that the vigilance of the</a>
<a id='line_1818'>      enemy, in breaking the ice of the river, left them no hopes of</a>
<a id='line_1819'>      escape, the Franks consented, for the first time, to dispense</a>

<a id='line_1821'>      The C¾sar immediately sent his captives to the court of</a>
<a id='line_1822'>      Constantius, who, accepting them as a valuable present, 81</a>
<a id='line_1823'>      rejoiced in the opportunity of adding so many heroes to the</a>
<a id='line_1824'>      choicest troops of his domestic guards. The obstinate resistance</a>
<a id='line_1825'>      of this handful of Franks apprised Julian of the difficulties of</a>
<a id='line_1826'>      the expedition which he meditated for the ensuing spring, against</a>
<a id='line_1827'>      the whole body of the nation. His rapid diligence surprised and</a>
<a id='line_1828'>      astonished the active Barbarians. Ordering his soldiers to</a>
<a id='line_1829'>      provide themselves with biscuit for twenty days, he suddenly</a>
<a id='line_1830'>      pitched his camp near Tongres, while the enemy still supposed him</a>
<a id='line_1831'>      in his winter quarters of Paris, expecting the slow arrival of</a>
<a id='line_1832'>      his convoys from Aquitain. Without allowing the Franks to unite</a>
<a id='line_1833'>      or deliberate, he skilfully spread his legions from Cologne to</a>
<a id='line_1834'>      the ocean; and by the terror, as well as by the success, of his</a>
<a id='line_1835'>      arms, soon reduced the suppliant tribes to implore the clemency,</a>
<a id='line_1836'>      and to obey the commands, of their conqueror. The Chamavians</a>
<a id='line_1837'>      submissively retired to their former habitations beyond the</a>
<a id='line_1838'>      Rhine; but the Salians were permitted to possess their new</a>
<a id='line_1839'>      establishment of Toxandria, as the subjects and auxiliaries of</a>
<a id='line_1840'>      the Roman empire. 82 The treaty was ratified by solemn oaths; and</a>
<a id='line_1841'>      perpetual inspectors were appointed to reside among the Franks,</a>
<a id='line_1842'>      with the authority of enforcing the strict observance of the</a>
<a id='line_1843'>      conditions. An incident is related, interesting enough in itself,</a>

<a id='line_1845'>      ingeniously contrived both the plot and the catastrophe of the</a>
<a id='line_1846'>      tragedy. When the Chamavians sued for peace, he required the son</a>
<a id='line_1847'>      of their king, as the only hostage on whom he could rely. A</a>
<a id='line_1848'>      mournful silence, interrupted by tears and groans, declared the</a>
<a id='line_1849'>      sad perplexity of the Barbarians; and their aged chief lamented</a>
<a id='line_1850'>      in pathetic language, that his private loss was now imbittered by</a>
<a id='line_1851'>      a sense of public calamity. While the Chamavians lay prostrate at</a>
<a id='line_1852'>      the foot of his throne, the royal captive, whom they believed to</a>
<a id='line_1853'>      have been slain, unexpectedly appeared before their eyes; and as</a>
<a id='line_1854'>      soon as the tumult of joy was hushed into attention, the C¾sar</a>
<a id='line_1855'>      addressed the assembly in the following terms: ÒBehold the son,</a>

<a id='line_1902'>      It was not enough for Julian to have delivered the provinces of</a>

<a id='line_1910'>      85 The consternation of the Germans, after the battle of</a>

<a id='line_1913'>      of a leader, who shared the fatigues and dangers which he imposed</a>
<a id='line_1914'>      on the meanest of the soldiers. The villages on either side of</a>
<a id='line_1915'>      the Meyn, which were plentifully stored with corn and cattle,</a>

<a id='line_1917'>      constructed with some imitation of Roman elegance, were consumed</a>
<a id='line_1918'>      by the flames; and the C¾sar boldly advanced about ten miles,</a>
<a id='line_1919'>      till his progress was stopped by a dark and impenetrable forest,</a>
<a id='line_1920'>      undermined by subterraneous passages, which threatened with</a>
<a id='line_1921'>      secret snares and ambush every step of the assailants. The ground</a>
<a id='line_1922'>      was already covered with snow; and Julian, after repairing an</a>
<a id='line_1923'>      ancient castle which had been erected by Trajan, granted a truce</a>
<a id='line_1924'>      of ten months to the submissive Barbarians. At the expiration of</a>
<a id='line_1925'>      the truce, Julian undertook a second expedition beyond the Rhine,</a>
<a id='line_1926'>      to humble the pride of Surmar and Hortaire, two of the kings of</a>
<a id='line_1927'>      the Alemanni, who had been present at the battle of Strasburgh.</a>
<a id='line_1928'>      They promised to restore all the Roman captives who yet remained</a>
<a id='line_1929'>      alive; and as the C¾sar had procured an exact account from the</a>
<a id='line_1930'>      cities and villages of Gaul, of the inhabitants whom they had</a>
<a id='line_1931'>      lost, he detected every attempt to deceive him, with a degree of</a>
<a id='line_1932'>      readiness and accuracy, which almost established the belief of</a>
<a id='line_1933'>      his supernatural knowledge. His third expedition was still more</a>
<a id='line_1934'>      splendid and important than the two former. The Germans had</a>
<a id='line_1935'>      collected their military powers, and moved along the opposite</a>
<a id='line_1936'>      banks of the river, with a design of destroying the bridge, and</a>
<a id='line_1937'>      of preventing the passage of the Romans. But this judicious plan</a>
<a id='line_1938'>      of defence was disconcerted by a skilful diversion. Three hundred</a>
<a id='line_1939'>      light-armed and active soldiers were detached in forty small</a>
<a id='line_1940'>      boats, to fall down the stream in silence, and to land at some</a>
<a id='line_1941'>      distance from the posts of the enemy. They executed their orders</a>
<a id='line_1942'>      with so much boldness and celerity, that they had almost</a>
<a id='line_1943'>      surprised the Barbarian chiefs, who returned in the fearless</a>

<a id='line_1945'>      Without repeating the uniform and disgusting tale of slaughter</a>
<a id='line_1946'>      and devastation, it is sufficient to observe, that Julian</a>

<a id='line_1973'>      had submitted to the just but humiliating condition of preparing</a>
<a id='line_1974'>      and conveying the necessary materials. The active zeal of Julian</a>
<a id='line_1975'>      urged the prosecution of the work; and such was the spirit which</a>

<a id='line_1978'>      contended in the most servile labors with the diligence of the</a>

<a id='line_1989'>      the Rhine, and distributed their cargoes to the several towns and</a>

<a id='line_2046'>      defrauded him of any part of the tribute which he extorted from</a>
<a id='line_2047'>      an oppressed and exhausted country. The prince who was invested</a>

<a id='line_2055'>      himself was rather inclined to censure the weakness of his own</a>
<a id='line_2056'>      behavior. The C¾sar had rejected, with abhorrence, a mandate for</a>
<a id='line_2057'>      the levy of an extraordinary tax; a new superindiction, which the</a>
<a id='line_2058'>      pr¾fect had offered for his signature; and the faithful picture</a>
<a id='line_2059'>      of the public misery, by which he had been obliged to justify his</a>
<a id='line_2060'>      refusal, offended the court of Constantius. We may enjoy the</a>
<a id='line_2061'>      pleasure of reading the sentiments of Julian, as he expresses</a>
<a id='line_2062'>      them with warmth and freedom in a letter to one of his most</a>

<a id='line_2064'>      the following terms: ÒWas it possible for the disciple of Plato</a>

<a id='line_2068'>      robbers? A tribune who deserts his post is punished with death,</a>

<a id='line_2070'>      pronounce _his_ sentence, if, in the hour of danger, I myself</a>
<a id='line_2071'>      neglected a duty far more sacred and far more important? God has</a>

<a id='line_2080'>      displayed his virtues and concealed his defects. The young hero</a>
<a id='line_2081'>      who supported, in Gaul, the throne of Constantius, was not</a>
<a id='line_2082'>      permitted to reform the vices of the government; but he had</a>
<a id='line_2083'>      courage to alleviate or to pity the distress of the people.</a>
<a id='line_2084'>      Unless he had been able to revive the martial spirit of the</a>
<a id='line_2085'>      Romans, or to introduce the arts of industry and refinement among</a>
<a id='line_2086'>      their savage enemies, he could not entertain any rational hopes</a>
<a id='line_2087'>      of securing the public tranquillity, either by the peace or</a>
<a id='line_2088'>      conquest of Germany. Yet the victories of Julian suspended, for a</a>
<a id='line_2089'>      short time, the inroads of the Barbarians, and delayed the ruin</a>

<a id='line_2112'>      like that of Julian must have felt the general happiness of which</a>
<a id='line_2113'>      he was the author; but he viewed, with particular satisfaction</a>
<a id='line_2114'>      and complacency, the city of Paris; the seat of his winter</a>
<a id='line_2115'>      residence, and the object even of his partial affection. 92 That</a>
<a id='line_2116'>      splendid capital, which now embraces an ample territory on either</a>
<a id='line_2117'>      side of the Seine, was originally confined to the small island in</a>
<a id='line_2118'>      the midst of the river, from whence the inhabitants derived a</a>
<a id='line_2119'>      supply of pure and salubrious water. The river bathed the foot of</a>
<a id='line_2120'>      the walls; and the town was accessible only by two wooden</a>
<a id='line_2121'>      bridges. A forest overspread the northern side of the Seine, but</a>
<a id='line_2122'>      on the south, the ground, which now bears the name of the</a>
<a id='line_2123'>      University, was insensibly covered with houses, and adorned with</a>
<a id='line_2124'>      a palace and amphitheatre, baths, an aqueduct, and a field of</a>
<a id='line_2125'>      Mars for the exercise of the Roman troops. The severity of the</a>
<a id='line_2126'>      climate was tempered by the neighborhood of the ocean; and with</a>
<a id='line_2127'>      some precautions, which experience had taught, the vine and</a>
<a id='line_2128'>      fig-tree were successfully cultivated. But in remarkable winters,</a>
<a id='line_2129'>      the Seine was deeply frozen; and the huge pieces of ice that</a>
<a id='line_2130'>      floated down the stream, might be compared, by an Asiatic, to the</a>
<a id='line_2131'>      blocks of white marble which were extracted from the quarries of</a>
<a id='line_2132'>      Phrygia. The licentiousness and corruption of Antioch recalled to</a>
<a id='line_2133'>      the memory of Julian the severe and simple manners of his beloved</a>
<a id='line_2134'>      Lutetia; 93 where the amusements of the theatre were unknown or</a>
<a id='line_2135'>      despised. He indignantly contrasted the effeminate Syrians with</a>

<a id='line_2137'>      the intemperance, which was the only stain of the Celtic</a>

<a id='line_2142'>      martial spirit has never been enervated by the indulgence of</a>
