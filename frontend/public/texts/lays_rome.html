<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>That what is called the history of the Kings and early Consuls of</a>
<a id='line_23'>Rome is to a great extent fabulous, few scholars have, since the</a>
<a id='line_24'>time of Beaufort, ventured to deny. It is certain that, more than</a>
<a id='line_25'>three hundred and sixty years after the date ordinarily assigned</a>
<a id='line_26'>for the foundation of the city, the public records were, with</a>
<a id='line_27'>scarcely an exception, destroyed by the Gauls. It is certain that</a>
<a id='line_28'>the oldest annals of the commonwealth were compiled more than a</a>
<a id='line_29'>century and a half after this destruction of the records. It is</a>
<a id='line_30'>certain, therefore, that the great Latin writers of the Augustan</a>
<a id='line_31'>age did not possess those materials, without which a trustworthy</a>
<a id='line_32'>account of the infancy of the republic could not possibly be</a>
<a id='line_33'>framed. Those writers own, indeed, that the chronicles to which</a>
<a id='line_34'>they had access were filled with battles that were never fought,</a>
<a id='line_35'>and Consuls that were never inaugurated; and we have abundant</a>
<a id='line_36'>proof that, in these chronicles, events of the greatest</a>
<a id='line_37'>importance, such as the issue of the war with Porsena and the</a>
<a id='line_38'>issue of the war with Brennus, were grossly misrepresented. Under</a>
<a id='line_39'>these circumstances a wise man will look with great suspicion on</a>
<a id='line_40'>the legend which has come down to us. He will perhaps be inclined</a>
<a id='line_41'>to regard the princes who are said to have founded the civil and</a>
<a id='line_42'>religious institutions of Rome, the sons of Mars, and the husband</a>
<a id='line_43'>of Egeria, as mere mythological personages, of the same class</a>
<a id='line_44'>with Perseus and Ixion. As he draws nearer to the confines of</a>
<a id='line_45'>authentic history, he will become less and less hard of belief.</a>
<a id='line_46'>He will admit that the most important parts of the narrative have</a>
<a id='line_47'>some foundation in truth. But he will distrust almost all the</a>
<a id='line_48'>details, not only because they seldom rest on any solid evidence,</a>
<a id='line_49'>but also because he will constantly detect in them, even when</a>
<a id='line_50'>they are within the limits of physical possibility, that peculiar</a>
<a id='line_51'>character, more easily understood than defined, which</a>
<a id='line_52'>distinguishes the creations of the imagination from the realities</a>
<a id='line_53'>of the world in which we live.</a>
<a id='line_54'></a>
<a id='line_55'>The early history of Rome is indeed far more poetical than</a>
<a id='line_56'>anything else in Latin literature. The loves of the Vestal and</a>
<a id='line_57'>the God of War, the cradle laid among the reeds of Tiber, the</a>
<a id='line_58'>fig-tree, the she-wolf, the shepherd's cabin, the recognition,</a>
<a id='line_59'>the fratricide, the rape of the Sabines, the death of Tarpeia,</a>
<a id='line_60'>the fall of Hostus Hostilius, the struggle of Mettus Curtius</a>
<a id='line_61'>through the marsh, the women rushing with torn raiment and</a>
<a id='line_62'>dishevelled hair between their fathers and their husbands, the</a>
<a id='line_63'>nightly meetings of Numa and the Nymph by the well in the sacred</a>
<a id='line_64'>grove, the fight of the three Romans and the three Albans, the</a>
<a id='line_65'>purchase of the Sibylline books, the crime of Tullia, the</a>
<a id='line_66'>simulated madness of Brutus, the ambiguous reply of the Delphian</a>
<a id='line_67'>oracle to the Tarquins, the wrongs of Lucretia, the heroic</a>
<a id='line_68'>actions of Horatius Cocles, of Scaevola, and of Cloelia, the</a>
<a id='line_69'>battle of Regillus won by the aid of Castor and Pollux, the</a>
<a id='line_70'>defense of Cremera, the touching story of Coriolanus, the still</a>
<a id='line_71'>more touching story of Virginia, the wild legend about the</a>
<a id='line_72'>draining of the Alban lake, the combat between Valerius Corvus</a>
<a id='line_73'>and the gigantic Gaul, are among the many instances which will at</a>
<a id='line_74'>once suggest themselves to every reader.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>In the narrative of Livy, who was a man of fine imagination,</a>
<a id='line_77'>these stories retain much of their genuine character. Nor could</a>
<a id='line_78'>even the tasteless Dionysius distort and mutilate them into mere</a>
<a id='line_79'>prose. The poetry shines, in spite of him, through the dreary</a>
<a id='line_80'>pedantry of his eleven books. It is discernible in the most</a>
<a id='line_81'>tedious and in the most superficial modern works on the early</a>
<a id='line_82'>times of Rome. It enlivens the dulness of the Universal History,</a>
<a id='line_83'>and gives a charm to the most meagre abridgements of Goldsmith.</a>
<a id='line_84'></a>
<a id='line_85'>Even in the age of Plutarch there were discerning men who</a>
<a id='line_86'>rejected the popular account of the foundation of Rome, because</a>
<a id='line_87'>that account appeared to them to have the air, not of a history,</a>
<a id='line_88'>but of a romance or a drama. Plutarch, who was displeased at</a>
<a id='line_89'>their incredulity, had nothing better to say in reply to their</a>
<a id='line_90'>arguments than that chance sometimes turns poet, and produces</a>
<a id='line_91'>trains of events not to be distinguished from the most elaborate</a>
<a id='line_92'>plots which are constructed by art. But though the existence of a</a>
<a id='line_93'>poetical element in the early history of the Great City was</a>
<a id='line_94'>detected so many ages ago, the first critic who distinctly saw</a>
<a id='line_95'>from what source that poetical element had been derived was James</a>
<a id='line_96'>Perizonius, one of the most acute and learned antiquaries of the</a>
<a id='line_97'>seventeenth century. His theory, which in his own days attracted</a>
<a id='line_98'>little or no notice, was revived in the present generation by</a>
<a id='line_99'>Niebuhr, a man who would have been the first writer of his time,</a>
<a id='line_100'>if his talent for communicating truths had borne any proportion</a>
<a id='line_101'>to his talent for investigating them. That theory has been</a>
<a id='line_102'>adopted by several eminent scholars of our own country,</a>
<a id='line_103'>particularly by the Bishop of St. David's, by Professor Malde,</a>
<a id='line_104'>and by the lamented Arnold. It appears to be now generally</a>
<a id='line_105'>received by men conversant with classical antiquity; and indeed</a>
<a id='line_106'>it rests on such strong proofs, both internal and external, that</a>
<a id='line_107'>it will not be easily subverted. A popular exposition of this</a>
<a id='line_108'>theory, and of the evidence by which it is supported, may not be</a>
<a id='line_109'>without interest even for readers who are unacquainted with the</a>
<a id='line_110'>ancient languages.</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'>The Latin literature which has come down to us is of later date</a>
<a id='line_113'>than the commencement of the Second Punic War, and consists</a>
<a id='line_114'>almost exclusively of works fashioned on Greek models. The Latin</a>
<a id='line_115'>metres, heroic, elegiac, lyric, and dramatic, are of Greek</a>
<a id='line_116'>origin. The best Latin epic poetry is the feeble echo of the</a>
<a id='line_117'>Iliad and Odyssey. The best Latin eclogues are imitations of</a>
<a id='line_118'>Theocritus. The plan of the most finished didactic poem in the</a>
<a id='line_119'>Latin tongue was taken from Hesiod. The Latin tragedies are bad</a>
<a id='line_120'>copies of the masterpieces of Sophocles and Euripides. The Latin</a>
<a id='line_121'>philosophy was borrowed, without alteration, from the Portico and</a>
<a id='line_122'>the Academy; and the great Latin orators constantly proposed to</a>
<a id='line_123'>themselves as patterns the speeches of Demosthenes and Lysias.</a>
<a id='line_124'></a>
<a id='line_125'>But there was an earlier Latin literature, a literature truly</a>
<a id='line_126'>Latin, which has wholly perished, which had, indeed almost wholly</a>
<a id='line_127'>perished long before those whom we are in the habit of regarding</a>
<a id='line_128'>as the greatest Latin writers were born. That literature abounded</a>
<a id='line_129'>with metrical romances, such as are found in every country where</a>
<a id='line_130'>there is much curiosity and intelligence, but little reading and</a>
<a id='line_131'>writing. All human beings, not utterly savage, long for some</a>
<a id='line_132'>information about past times, and are delighted by narratives</a>
<a id='line_133'>which present pictures to the eye of the mind. But it is only in</a>
<a id='line_134'>very enlightened communities that books are readily accessible.</a>
<a id='line_135'>Metrical composition, therefore, which, in a highly civilized</a>
<a id='line_136'>nation, is a mere luxury, is, in nations imperfectly civilized,</a>
<a id='line_137'>almost a necessary of life, and is valued less on account of the</a>
<a id='line_138'>pleasure which it gives to the ear, than on account of the help</a>
<a id='line_139'>which it gives to the memory. A man who can invent or embellish</a>
<a id='line_140'>an interesting story, and put it into a form which others may</a>
<a id='line_141'>easily retain in their recollection, will always be highly</a>
<a id='line_142'>esteemed by a people eager for amusement and information, but</a>
<a id='line_143'>destitute of libraries. Such is the origin of ballad-poetry, a</a>
<a id='line_144'>species of composition which scarcely ever fails to spring up and</a>
<a id='line_145'>flourish in every society, at a certain point in the progress</a>
<a id='line_146'>towards refinement. Tacitus informs us that songs were the only</a>
<a id='line_147'>memorials of the past which the ancient Germans possessed. We</a>
<a id='line_148'>learn from Lucan and from Ammianus Marcellinus that the brave</a>
<a id='line_149'>actions of the ancient Gauls were commemorated in the verses of</a>
<a id='line_150'>Bards. During many ages, and through many revolution, minstrelsy</a>
<a id='line_151'>retained its influence over both the Teutonic and the Celtic</a>
<a id='line_152'>race. The vengeance exacted by the spouse of Attila for the</a>
<a id='line_153'>murder of Siegfried was celebrated in rhymes, of which Germany is</a>
<a id='line_154'>still justly proud. The exploits of Athelstane were commemorated</a>
<a id='line_155'>by the Anglo-Saxons and those of Canute by the Danes, in rude</a>
<a id='line_156'>poems, of which a few fragments have come down to us. The chants</a>
<a id='line_157'>of the Welsh harpers preserved, through ages of darkness, a faint</a>
<a id='line_158'>and doubtful memory of Arthur. In the Highlands of Scotland may</a>
<a id='line_159'>still be gleaned some relics of the old songs about Cuthullin and</a>
<a id='line_160'>Fingal. The long struggle of the Servians against the Ottoman</a>
<a id='line_161'>power was recorded in lays full of martial spirit. We learn from</a>
<a id='line_162'>Herrera that, when a Peruvian Inca died, men of skill were</a>
<a id='line_163'>appointed to celebrate him in verses, which all the people</a>
<a id='line_164'>learned by heart, and sang in public on days of festival. The</a>
<a id='line_165'>feats of Kurroglou, the great freebooter of Turkistan, recounted</a>
<a id='line_166'>in ballads composed by himself, are known in every village of</a>
<a id='line_167'>northern Persia. Captain Beechey heard the bards of the Sandwich</a>
<a id='line_168'>Islands recite the heroic achievements of Tamehameha, the most</a>
<a id='line_169'>illustrious of their kings. Mungo Park found in the heart of</a>
<a id='line_170'>Africa a class of singing men, the only annalists of their rude</a>
<a id='line_171'>tribes, and heard them tell the story of the victory which Damel,</a>
<a id='line_172'>the negro prince of the Jaloffs, won over Abdulkader, the</a>
<a id='line_173'>Mussulman tyrant of Foota Torra. This species of poetry attained</a>
<a id='line_174'>a high degree of excellence among the Castilians, before they</a>
<a id='line_175'>began to copy Tuscan patterns. It attained a still higher degree</a>
<a id='line_176'>of excellence among the English and the Lowland Scotch, during</a>
<a id='line_177'>the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries. But it</a>
<a id='line_178'>reached its full perfection in ancient Greece; for there can be</a>
<a id='line_179'>no doubt that the great Homeric poems are generically ballads,</a>
<a id='line_180'>though widely distinguished from all other ballads, and indeed</a>
<a id='line_181'>from almost all other human composition, by transcendent</a>
<a id='line_182'>sublimity and beauty.</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>As it is agreeable to general experience that, at a certain stage</a>
<a id='line_185'>in the progress of society, ballad-poetry should flourish, so is</a>
<a id='line_186'>it also agreeable to general experience that, at a subsequent</a>
<a id='line_187'>stage in the progress of society, ballad-poetry should be</a>
<a id='line_188'>undervalued and neglected. Knowledge advances; manners change;</a>
<a id='line_189'>great foreign models of composition are studied and imitated. The</a>
<a id='line_190'>phraseology of the old minstrels becomes obsolete. Their</a>
<a id='line_191'>versification, which, having received its laws only from the ear,</a>
<a id='line_192'>abounds in irregularities, seems licentious and uncouth. Their</a>
<a id='line_193'>simplicity appears beggarly when compared with the quaint forms</a>
<a id='line_194'>and gaudy coloring of such artists as Cowley and Gongora. The</a>
<a id='line_195'>ancient lays, unjustly despised by the learned and polite, linger</a>
<a id='line_196'>for a time in the memory of the vulgar, and are at length too</a>
<a id='line_197'>often irretrievably lost. We cannot wonder that the ballads of</a>
<a id='line_198'>Rome should have altogether disappeared, when we remember how</a>
<a id='line_199'>very narrowly, in spite of the invention of printing, those of</a>
<a id='line_200'>our own country and those of Spain escaped the same fate. There</a>
<a id='line_201'>is indeed little doubt that oblivion covers many English songs</a>
<a id='line_202'>equal to any that were published by Bishop Percy, and many</a>
<a id='line_203'>Spanish songs as good as the best of those which have been so</a>
<a id='line_204'>happily translated by Mr. Lockhart. Eighty years ago England</a>
<a id='line_205'>possessed only one tattered copy of Childe Waters and Sir</a>
<a id='line_206'>Cauline, and Spain only one tattered copy of the noble poem of</a>
<a id='line_207'>the Cid. The snuff of a candle, or a mischievous dog, might in a</a>
<a id='line_208'>moment have deprived the world forever of any of those fine</a>
<a id='line_209'>compositions. Sir Walter Scott, who united to the fire of a great</a>
<a id='line_210'>poet the minute curiosity and patient diligence of a great</a>
<a id='line_211'>antiquary, was but just in time to save the precious relics of</a>
<a id='line_212'>the Minstrelsy of the Border. In Germany, the lay of the</a>
<a id='line_213'>Nibelungs had been long utterly forgotten, when, in the</a>
<a id='line_214'>eighteenth century, it was, for the first time, printed from a</a>
<a id='line_215'>manuscript in the old library of a noble family. In truth, the</a>
<a id='line_216'>only people who, through their whole passage from simplicity to</a>
<a id='line_217'>the highest civilization, never for a moment ceased to love and</a>
<a id='line_218'>admire their old ballads, were the Greeks.</a>
<a id='line_219'></a>
<a id='line_220'>That the early Romans should have had ballad-poetry, and that</a>
<a id='line_221'>this poetry should have perished, is therefore not strange. It</a>
<a id='line_222'>would, on the contrary, have been strange if these things had not</a>
<a id='line_223'>come to pass; and we should be justified in pronouncing them</a>
<a id='line_224'>highly probable even if we had no direct evidence on the subject.</a>
<a id='line_225'>But we have direct evidence of unquestionable authority.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>Ennius, who flourished in the time of the Second Punic War, was</a>
<a id='line_228'>regarded in the Augustan age as the father of Latin poetry. He</a>
<a id='line_229'>was, in truth, the father of the second school of Latin poetry,</a>
<a id='line_230'>the only school of which the works have descended to us. But from</a>
<a id='line_231'>Ennius himself we learn that there were poets who stood to him in</a>
<a id='line_232'>the same relation in which the author of the romance of Count</a>
<a id='line_233'>Alarcos stood to Garcilaso, or the author of the Lytell Geste of</a>
<a id='line_234'>Robyn Hode to Lord Surrey. Ennius speaks of verses which the</a>
<a id='line_235'>Fauns and the Bards were wont to chant in the old time, when none</a>
<a id='line_236'>had yet studied the graces of speech, when none had yet climbed</a>
<a id='line_237'>the peaks sacred to the Goddesses of Grecian song. "Where,"</a>
<a id='line_238'>Cicero mournfully asks, "are those old verses now?"</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>Contemporary with Ennius was Quintus Fabius Pactor, the earliest</a>
<a id='line_241'>of the Roman annalists. His account of the infancy and youth of</a>
<a id='line_242'>Romulus and Remus has been preserved by Dionysius, and contains a</a>
<a id='line_243'>very remarkable reference to the ancient Latin poetry. Fabius</a>
<a id='line_244'>says that, in his time, his countrymen were still in the habit of</a>
<a id='line_245'>singing ballads about the Twins. "Even in the hut of</a>
<a id='line_246'>Faustulus,"--so these old lays appear to have run,--"the</a>
<a id='line_247'>children of Rhea and Mars were, in port and in spirit, not like</a>
<a id='line_248'>unto swineherds or cowherds, but such that men might well guess</a>
<a id='line_249'>them to be of the blood of kings and gods."</a>
<a id='line_250'></a>
<a id='line_251'>Cato the Censor, who also lived in the days of he Second Punic</a>
<a id='line_252'>War, mentioned this lost literature in his lost work on the</a>
<a id='line_253'>antiquities of his country. Many ages, he said, before his time,</a>
<a id='line_254'>there were ballads in praise of illustrious men; and these</a>
<a id='line_255'>ballads it was the fashion for the guests at banquets to sing in</a>
<a id='line_256'>turn while the piper played. "Would," exclaims Cicero, "that</a>
<a id='line_257'>we still had the old ballads of which Cato speaks!"</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>Valerius Maximus gives us exactly similar information, without</a>
<a id='line_260'>mentioning his authority, and observes that the ancient Roman</a>
<a id='line_261'>ballads were probably of more benefit to the young than all the</a>
<a id='line_262'>lectures of the Athenian schools, and that to the influence of</a>
<a id='line_263'>the national poetry were to be ascribed the virtues of such men</a>
<a id='line_264'>as Camillus and Fabricus.</a>
<a id='line_265'></a>
<a id='line_266'>Varro, whose authority on all questions connected with the</a>
<a id='line_267'>antiquities of his country is entitled to the greatest respect,</a>
<a id='line_268'>tells us that at banquets it was once the fashion for boys to</a>
<a id='line_269'>sing, sometimes with and sometimes without instrumental music,</a>
<a id='line_270'>ancient ballads in praise of men of former times. These young</a>
<a id='line_271'>performers, he observes, were of unblemished character, a</a>
<a id='line_272'>circumstance which he probably mentioned because, among the</a>
<a id='line_273'>Greeks, and indeed, in his time among the Romans also, the morals</a>
<a id='line_274'>of singing boys were in no high repute.</a>
<a id='line_275'></a>
<a id='line_276'>The testimony of Horace, though given incidentally, confirms the</a>
<a id='line_277'>statements of Cato, Valerius Maximus, and Varro. The poet</a>
<a id='line_278'>predicts that, under the peaceful administration of Augustus, the</a>
<a id='line_279'>Romans will, over their full goblets, sing to the pipe, after the</a>
<a id='line_280'>fashion of their fathers, the deeds of brave captains, and the</a>
<a id='line_281'>ancient legends touching the origin of the city.</a>
<a id='line_282'></a>
<a id='line_283'>The proposition, then, that Rome had ballad-poetry is not merely</a>
<a id='line_284'>in itself highly probable, but is fully proved by direct evidence</a>
<a id='line_285'>of the greatest weight.</a>
<a id='line_286'></a>
<a id='line_287'>This proposition being established, it becomes easy to understand</a>
<a id='line_288'>why the early history of the city is unlike almost everything</a>
<a id='line_289'>else in Latin literature, native where almost everything else is</a>
<a id='line_290'>borrowed, imaginative where almost everything else is prosaic. We</a>
<a id='line_291'>can scarcely hesitate to pronounce that the magnificent,</a>
<a id='line_292'>pathetic, and truly national legends, which present so striking a</a>
<a id='line_293'>contrast to all that surrounds them, are broken and defaced</a>
<a id='line_294'>fragments of that early poetry which, even in the age of Cato the</a>
<a id='line_295'>Censor, had become antiquated, and of which Tully had never heard</a>
<a id='line_296'>a line.</a>
<a id='line_297'></a>
<a id='line_298'>That this poetry should have been suffered to perish will not</a>
<a id='line_299'>appear strange when we consider how complete was the triumph of</a>
<a id='line_300'>the Greek genius over the public mind of Italy. It is probable</a>
<a id='line_301'>that, at an early period, Homer and Herodotus furnished some</a>
<a id='line_302'>hints to the Latin Minstrels; but it was not till after the war</a>
<a id='line_303'>with Pyrrhus that the poetry of Rome began to put off its old</a>
<a id='line_304'>Ausonian character. The transformation was soon consummated. The</a>
<a id='line_305'>conquered, says Horace, led captive the conquerors. It was</a>
<a id='line_306'>precisely at the time at which the Roman people rose to</a>
<a id='line_307'>unrivalled political ascendency that they stooped to pass under</a>
<a id='line_308'>the intellectual yoke. It was precisely at the time at which the</a>
<a id='line_309'>sceptre departed from Greece that the empire of her language and</a>
<a id='line_310'>of her arts became universal and despotic. The revolution indeed</a>
<a id='line_311'>was not effected without a struggle. Naevius seems to have been</a>
<a id='line_312'>the last of the ancient line of poets. Ennius was the founder of</a>
<a id='line_313'>a new dynasty. Naevius celebrated the First Punic War in</a>
<a id='line_314'>Saturnian verse, the old national verse of Italy. Ennius sang the</a>
<a id='line_315'>Second Punic War in numbers borrowed from the Iliad. The elder</a>
<a id='line_316'>poet, in the epitaph which he wrote for himself, and which is a</a>
<a id='line_317'>fine specimen of the early Roman diction and versification,</a>
<a id='line_318'>plaintively boasted that the Latin language had died with him.</a>
<a id='line_319'>Thus what to Horace appeared to be the first faint dawn of Roman</a>
<a id='line_320'>literature appeared to Naevius to be its hopeless setting. In</a>
<a id='line_321'>truth, one literature was setting, and another dawning.</a>
<a id='line_322'></a>
<a id='line_323'>The victory of the foreign taste was decisive; and indeed we can</a>
<a id='line_324'>hardly blame the Romans for turning away with contempt from the</a>
<a id='line_325'>rude lays which had delighted their fathers, and giving their</a>
<a id='line_326'>whole admiration to the immortal productions of Greece. The</a>
<a id='line_327'>national romances, neglected by the great and the refined whose</a>
<a id='line_328'>education had been finished at Rhodes or Athens, continued, it</a>
<a id='line_329'>may be supposed, during some generations to delight the vulgar.</a>
<a id='line_330'>While Virgil, in hexameters of exquisite modulation, described</a>
<a id='line_331'>the sports of rustics, those rustics were still singing their</a>
<a id='line_332'>wild Saturnian ballads. It is not improbable that, at the time</a>
<a id='line_333'>when Cicero lamented the irreparable loss of the poems mentioned</a>
<a id='line_334'>by Cato, a search among the nooks of the Appenines, as active as</a>
<a id='line_335'>the search which Sir Walter Scott made among the descendents of</a>
<a id='line_336'>the mosstroopers of Liddesdale, might have brought to light many</a>
<a id='line_337'>fine remains of ancient minstrelsy. No such search was made. The</a>
<a id='line_338'>Latin ballads perished forever. Yet discerning critics have</a>
<a id='line_339'>thought that they could still perceive in the early history of</a>
<a id='line_340'>Rome numerous fragments of this lost poetry, as the traveller on</a>
<a id='line_341'>classic ground sometimes finds, built into the heavy wall of a</a>
<a id='line_342'>fort or convent, a pillar rich with acanthus leaves, or a frieze</a>
<a id='line_343'>where the Amazons and Bacchanals seem to live. The theatres and</a>
<a id='line_344'>temples of the Greek and the Roman were degraded into the</a>
<a id='line_345'>quarries of the Turk and the Goth. Even so did the ancient</a>
<a id='line_346'>Saturnian poetry become the quarry in which a crowd of orators</a>
<a id='line_347'>and annalists found the materials for their prose.</a>
<a id='line_348'></a>
<a id='line_349'>It is not difficult to trace the process by which the old songs</a>
<a id='line_350'>were transmuted into the form which they now wear. Funeral</a>
<a id='line_351'>panegyric and chronicle appear to have been the intermediate</a>
<a id='line_352'>links which connected the lost ballads with the histories now</a>
<a id='line_353'>extant. From a very early period it was the usage that an oration</a>
<a id='line_354'>should be pronounced over the remains of a noble Roman. The</a>
<a id='line_355'>orator, as we learn from Polybius, was expected, on such</a>
<a id='line_356'>occasions, to recapitulate all the services which the ancestors</a>
<a id='line_357'>of the deceased had, from the earliest time, rendered to the</a>
<a id='line_358'>commonwealth. There can be little doubt that the speaker on whom</a>
<a id='line_359'>this duty was imposed would make use of all the stories suited to</a>
<a id='line_360'>his purpose which were to be found in the popular lays. There can</a>
<a id='line_361'>be as little doubt that the family of an eminent man would</a>
<a id='line_362'>preserve a copy of the speech which had been pronounced over his</a>
<a id='line_363'>corpse. The compilers of the early chronicles would have recourse</a>
<a id='line_364'>to these speeches; and the great historians of a later period</a>
<a id='line_365'>would have recourse to the chronicles.</a>
<a id='line_366'></a>
<a id='line_367'>It may be worth while to select a particular story, and to trace</a>
<a id='line_368'>its probable progress through these stages. The description of</a>
<a id='line_369'>the migration of the Fabian house to Cremera is one of the finest</a>
<a id='line_370'>of the many fine passages which lie thick in the earlier books of</a>
<a id='line_371'>Livy. The Consul, clad in his military garb, stands in the</a>
<a id='line_372'>vestibule of his house, marshalling his clan, three hundred and</a>
<a id='line_373'>six fighting men, all of the same proud patrician blood, all</a>
<a id='line_374'>worthy to be attended by the fasces, and to command the legions.</a>
<a id='line_375'>A sad and anxious retinue of friends accompanies the adventurers</a>
<a id='line_376'>through the streets; but the voice of lamentation is drowned by</a>
<a id='line_377'>the shouts of admiring thousands. As the procession passes the</a>
<a id='line_378'>Capitol, prayers and vows are poured forth, but in vain. The</a>
<a id='line_379'>devoted band, leaving Janus on the right, marches to its doom,</a>
<a id='line_380'>through the Gate of Evil Luck. After achieving high deeds of</a>
<a id='line_381'>valor against overwhelming numbers, all perish save one child,</a>
<a id='line_382'>the stock from which the great Fabian race was destined again to</a>
<a id='line_383'>spring, for the safety and glory of the commonwealth. That this</a>
<a id='line_384'>fine romance, the details of which are so full of poetical truth,</a>
<a id='line_385'>and so utterly destitute of all show of historical truth, came</a>
<a id='line_386'>originally from some lay which had often been sung with great</a>
<a id='line_387'>applause at banquets is in the highest degree probable. Nor is it</a>
<a id='line_388'>difficult to imagine a mode in which the transmission might have</a>
<a id='line_389'>taken place. The celebrated Quintus Fabius Maximus, who died</a>
<a id='line_390'>about twenty years before the First Punic War, and more than</a>
<a id='line_391'>forty years before Ennius was born, is said to have been interred</a>
<a id='line_392'>with extraordinary pomp. In the eulogy pronounced over his body</a>
<a id='line_393'>all the great exploits of his ancestors were doubtless recounted</a>
<a id='line_394'>and exaggerated. If there were then extant songs which gave a</a>
<a id='line_395'>vivid and touching description of an event, the saddest and the</a>
<a id='line_396'>most glorious in the long history of the Fabian house, nothing</a>
<a id='line_397'>could be more natural than that the panegyrist should borrow from</a>
<a id='line_398'>such songs their finest touches, in order to adorn his speech. A</a>
<a id='line_399'>few generations later the songs would perhaps be forgotten, or</a>
<a id='line_400'>remembered only by shepherds and vinedressers. But the speech</a>
<a id='line_401'>would certainly be preserved in the archives of the Fabian</a>
<a id='line_402'>nobles. Fabius Pictor would be well acquainted with a document so</a>
<a id='line_403'>interesting to his personal feelings, and would insert large</a>
<a id='line_404'>extracts from it in his rude chronicle. That chronicle, as we</a>
<a id='line_405'>know, was the oldest to which Livy had access. Livy would at a</a>
<a id='line_406'>glance distinguish the bold strokes of the forgotten poet from</a>
<a id='line_407'>the dull and feeble narrative by which they were surrounded,</a>
<a id='line_408'>would retouch them with a delicate and powerful pencil, and would</a>
<a id='line_409'>make them immortal.</a>
<a id='line_410'></a>
<a id='line_411'>That this might happen at Rome can scarcely be doubted; for</a>
<a id='line_412'>something very like this has happened in several countries, and,</a>
<a id='line_413'>among others, in our own. Perhaps the theory of Perizonius cannot</a>
<a id='line_414'>be better illustrated than by showing that what he supposes to</a>
<a id='line_415'>have taken place in ancient times has, beyond all doubt, taken</a>
<a id='line_416'>place in modern times.</a>
<a id='line_417'></a>
<a id='line_418'>"History," says Hume with the utmost gravity, "has preserved</a>
<a id='line_419'>some instances of Edgar's amours, from which, as from a specimen,</a>
<a id='line_420'>we may form a conjecture of the rest." He then tells very</a>
<a id='line_421'>agreeably the stories of Elfleda and Elfrida, two stories which</a>
<a id='line_422'>have a most suspicious air of romance, ad which, indeed, greatly</a>
<a id='line_423'>resemble, in their character, some of the legends of early Rome.</a>
<a id='line_424'>He cites, as his authority for these two tales, the chronicle of</a>
<a id='line_425'>William of Malmesbury, who lived in the time of King Stephen. The</a>
<a id='line_426'>great majority of readers suppose that the device by which</a>
<a id='line_427'>Elfleda was substituted for her young mistress, the artifice by</a>
<a id='line_428'>which Athelwold obtained the hand of Elfrida, the detection of</a>
<a id='line_429'>that artifice, the hunting party, and the vengeance of the</a>
<a id='line_430'>amorous king, are things about which there is no more doubt than</a>
<a id='line_431'>about the execution of Anne Boleyn, or the slitting of Sir John</a>
<a id='line_432'>Coventry's nose. But when we turn to William of Malmesbury, we</a>
<a id='line_433'>find that Hume, in his eagerness to relate these pleasant fables,</a>
<a id='line_434'>has overlooked one very important circumstance. William does</a>
<a id='line_435'>indeed tell both the stories; but he gives us distinct notice</a>
<a id='line_436'>that he does not warrant their truth, and that they rest on no</a>
<a id='line_437'>better authority than that of ballads.</a>
<a id='line_438'></a>
<a id='line_439'>Such is the way in which these two well-known tales have been</a>
<a id='line_440'>handed down. They originally appeared in a poetical form. They</a>
<a id='line_441'>found their way from ballads into an old chronicle. The ballads</a>
<a id='line_442'>perished; the chronicle remained. A great historian, some</a>
<a id='line_443'>centuries after the ballads had been altogether forgotten,</a>
<a id='line_444'>consulted the chronicle. He was struck by the lively coloring of</a>
<a id='line_445'>these ancient fictions: he transferred them to his pages; and</a>
<a id='line_446'>thus we find inserted, as unquestionable facts, in a narrative</a>
<a id='line_447'>which is likely to last as long as the English tongue, the</a>
<a id='line_448'>inventions of some minstrel whose works were probably never</a>
<a id='line_449'>committed to writing, whose name is buried in oblivion, and whose</a>
<a id='line_450'>dialect has become obsolete. It must, then, be admitted to be</a>
<a id='line_451'>possible, or rather highly probable, that the stories of Romulus</a>
<a id='line_452'>and Remus, and of the Horatii and Curiatti, may have had a</a>
<a id='line_453'>similar origin.</a>
<a id='line_454'></a>
<a id='line_455'>Castilian literature will furnish us with another parallel case.</a>
<a id='line_456'>Mariana, the classical historian of Spain, tells the story of the</a>
<a id='line_457'>ill-starred marriage which the King Don Alonso brought about</a>
<a id='line_458'>between the heirs of Carrion and the two daughters of the Cid.</a>
<a id='line_459'>The Cid bestowed a princely dower on the sons-in-law. But the</a>
<a id='line_460'>young men were base and proud, cowardly and cruel. They were</a>
<a id='line_461'>tried in danger, and found wanting. They fled before the Moors,</a>
<a id='line_462'>and once, when a lion broke out of his den, they ran and crouched</a>
<a id='line_463'>in an unseemly hiding-place. They knew that they were despised,</a>
<a id='line_464'>and took counsel how they might be avenged. They parted from</a>
<a id='line_465'>their father-in-law with many signs of love, and set forth on a</a>
<a id='line_466'>journey with Doña Elvira and Doña Sol. In a solitary place the</a>
<a id='line_467'>bridegrooms seized their brides, stripped them, scourged them,</a>
<a id='line_468'>and departed, leaving them for dead. But one of the House of</a>
<a id='line_469'>Bivar, suspecting foul play, had followed the travellers in</a>
<a id='line_470'>disguise. The ladies were brought back safe to the house of their</a>
<a id='line_471'>father. Complaint was made to the king. It was adjudged by the</a>
<a id='line_472'>Cortes that the dower given by the Cid should be returned, and</a>
<a id='line_473'>that the heirs of Carrion together with one of their kindred</a>
<a id='line_474'>should do battle against three knights of the party of the Cid.</a>
<a id='line_475'>The guilty youths would have declined the combat; but all their</a>
<a id='line_476'>shifts were in vain. They were vanquished in the lists, and</a>
<a id='line_477'>forever disgraced, while their injured wives were sought in</a>
<a id='line_478'>marriage by great princes.</a>
<a id='line_479'></a>
<a id='line_480'>Some Spanish writers have labored to show, by an examination of</a>
<a id='line_481'>dates and circumstances, that this story is untrue. Such</a>
<a id='line_482'>confutation was surely not needed; for the narrative is on the</a>
<a id='line_483'>face of it a romance. How it found its way into Mariana's history</a>
<a id='line_484'>is quite clear. He acknowledges his obligations to the ancient</a>
<a id='line_485'>chronicles; and had doubtless before him the Cronica del famoso</a>
<a id='line_486'>Cavallero Cid Ruy Diez Campeador, which had been printed as early</a>
<a id='line_487'>as the year 1552. He little suspected that all the most striking</a>
<a id='line_488'>passages in this chronicle were copied from a poem of the twelfth</a>
<a id='line_489'>century,--a poem of which the language and versification had long</a>
<a id='line_490'>been obsolete, but which glowed with no common portion of the</a>
<a id='line_491'>fire of the Iliad. Yet such is the fact. More than a century and</a>
<a id='line_492'>a half after the death of Mariana, this venerable ballad, of</a>
<a id='line_493'>which one imperfect copy on parchment, four hundred years old,</a>
<a id='line_494'>had been preserved at Bivar, was for the first time printed. Then</a>
<a id='line_495'>it was found that every interesting circumstance of the story of</a>
<a id='line_496'>the heirs of Carrion was derived by the eloquent Jesuit from a</a>
<a id='line_497'>song of which he had never heard, and which was composed by a</a>
<a id='line_498'>minstrel whose very name had been long forgotten.</a>
<a id='line_499'></a>
<a id='line_500'>Such, or nearly such, appears to have been the process by which</a>
<a id='line_501'>the lost ballad-poetry of Rome was transformed into history. To</a>
<a id='line_502'>reverse that process, to transform some portions of early Roman</a>
<a id='line_503'>history back into the poetry out of which they were made, is the</a>
<a id='line_504'>object of this work.</a>
<a id='line_505'></a>
<a id='line_506'>In the following poems the author speaks, not in his own person,</a>
<a id='line_507'>but in the persons of ancient minstrels who know only what Roman</a>
<a id='line_508'>citizen, born three or four hundred years before the Christian</a>
<a id='line_509'>era, may be supposed to have known, and who are in no wise above</a>
<a id='line_510'>the passions and prejudices of their age and nation. To these</a>
<a id='line_511'>imaginary poets must be ascribed some blunders which are so</a>
<a id='line_512'>obvious that is unnecessary to point them out. The real blunder</a>
<a id='line_513'>would have been to represent these old poets as deeply versed in</a>
<a id='line_514'>general history, and studious of chronological accuracy. To them</a>
<a id='line_515'>must also be attributed the illiberal sneers at the Greeks, the</a>
<a id='line_516'>furious party spirit, the contempt for the arts of peace, the</a>
<a id='line_517'>love of war for its own sake, the ungenerous exultation over the</a>
<a id='line_518'>vanquished, which the reader will sometimes observe. To portray a</a>
<a id='line_519'>Roman of the age of Camillus or Curius as superior to national</a>
<a id='line_520'>antipathies, as mourning over the devastation and slaughter by</a>
<a id='line_521'>which empire and triumphs were to be won, as looking on human</a>
<a id='line_522'>suffering with the sympathy of Howard, or as treating conquered</a>
<a id='line_523'>enemies with the delicacy of the Black Prince, would be to</a>
<a id='line_524'>violate all dramatic propriety. The old Romans had some great</a>
<a id='line_525'>virtues, fortitude, temperance, veracity, spirit to resist</a>
<a id='line_526'>oppression, respect for legitimate authority, fidelity in the</a>
<a id='line_527'>observing of contracts, disinterestedness, ardent patriotism; but</a>
<a id='line_528'>Christian charity and chivalrous generosity were alike unknown to</a>
<a id='line_529'>them.</a>
<a id='line_530'></a>
<a id='line_531'>It would have been obviously improper to mimic the manner of any</a>
<a id='line_532'>particular age or country. Something has been borrowed, however,</a>
<a id='line_533'>from our own old ballads, and more from Sir Walter Scott, the</a>
<a id='line_534'>great restorer of our ballad-poetry. To the Iliad still greater</a>
<a id='line_535'>obligations are due; and those obligations have been contracted</a>
<a id='line_536'>with the less hesitation, because there is reason to believe that</a>
<a id='line_537'>some of the old Latin minstrels really had recourse to that</a>
<a id='line_538'>inexhaustible store of poetical images.</a>
<a id='line_539'></a>
<a id='line_540'>It would have been easy to swell this little volume to a very</a>
<a id='line_541'>considerable bulk, by appending notes filled with quotations; but</a>
<a id='line_542'>to a learned reader such notes are not necessary; for an</a>
<a id='line_543'>unlearned reader they would have little interest; and the</a>
<a id='line_544'>judgment passed both by the learned and by the unlearned on a</a>
<a id='line_545'>work of the imagination will always depend much more on the</a>
<a id='line_546'>general character and spirit of such a work than on minute</a>
<a id='line_547'>details.</a>
<a id='line_548'></a>
<a id='line_549'></a>
<a id='line_550'></a>
<a id='line_551'></a>
<a id='line_552'></a>
<a id='line_553'>                            Horatius</a>
<a id='line_554'></a>
<a id='line_555'>There can be little doubt that among those parts of early Roman</a>
<a id='line_556'>history which had a poetical origin was the legend of Horatius</a>
<a id='line_557'>Cocles. We have several versions of the story, and these versions</a>
<a id='line_558'>differ from each other in points of no small importance.</a>
<a id='line_559'>Polybius, there is reason to believe, heard the tale recited over</a>
<a id='line_560'>the remains of some Consul or Prætor descended from the old</a>
<a id='line_561'>Horatian patricians; for he introduces it as a specimen of the</a>
<a id='line_562'>narratives with which the Romans were in the habit of</a>
<a id='line_563'>embellishing their funeral oratory. It is remarkable that,</a>
<a id='line_564'>according to him, Horatius defended the bridge alone, and</a>
<a id='line_565'>perished in the waters. According to the chronicles which Livy</a>
<a id='line_566'>and Dionysius followed, Horatius had two companions, swam safe to</a>
<a id='line_567'>shore, and was loaded with honors and rewards.</a>
<a id='line_568'></a>
<a id='line_569'>These discrepancies are easily explained. Our own literature,</a>
<a id='line_570'>indeed, will furnish an exact parallel to what may have taken</a>
<a id='line_571'>place at Rome. It is highly probably that the memory of the war</a>
<a id='line_572'>of Porsena was preserved by compositions much resembling the two</a>
<a id='line_573'>ballads which stand first in the Relics of Ancient English</a>
<a id='line_574'>Poetry. In both those ballads the English, commanded by the</a>
<a id='line_575'>Percy, fight with the Scots, commanded by the Douglas. In one of</a>
<a id='line_576'>the ballads the Douglas is killed by a nameless English archer,</a>
<a id='line_577'>and the Percy by a Scottish spearman; in the other, the Percy</a>
<a id='line_578'>slays the Douglas in single combat, and is himself made prisoner.</a>
<a id='line_579'>In the former, Sir Hugh Montgomery is shot through the heart by a</a>
<a id='line_580'>Northumbrian bowman; in the latter he is taken and exchanged for</a>
<a id='line_581'>the Percy. Yet both the ballads relate to the same event, and</a>
<a id='line_582'>that event which probably took place within the memory of persons</a>
<a id='line_583'>who were alive when both the ballads were made. One of the</a>
<a id='line_584'>Minstrels says:--</a>
<a id='line_585'></a>
<a id='line_586'>   "Old men that knowen the grounde well yenoughe</a>
<a id='line_587'>     Call it the battell of Otterburn:</a>
<a id='line_588'>     At Otterburn began this spurne</a>
<a id='line_589'>     Upon a monnyn day.</a>
<a id='line_590'>     Ther was the dougghte Doglas slean:</a>
<a id='line_591'>     The Perse never went away."</a>
<a id='line_592'></a>
<a id='line_593'>The other poet sums up the event in the following lines:</a>
<a id='line_594'></a>
<a id='line_595'>   "Thys fraye bygan at Otterborne</a>
<a id='line_596'>       Bytwene the nyghte and the day:</a>
<a id='line_597'>     Ther the Doglas lost hys lyfe,</a>
<a id='line_598'>       And the Percy was lede away."</a>
<a id='line_599'></a>
<a id='line_600'>It is by no means unlikely that there were two old Roman lays</a>
<a id='line_601'>about the defence of the bridge; and that, while the story which</a>
<a id='line_602'>Livy has transmitted to us was preferred by the multitude, the</a>
<a id='line_603'>other, which ascribed the whole glory to Horatius alone, may have</a>
<a id='line_604'>been the favorite with the Horatian house.</a>
<a id='line_605'></a>
<a id='line_606'>The following ballad is supposed to have been made about a</a>
<a id='line_607'>hundred and twenty years after the war which it celebrates, and</a>
<a id='line_608'>just before the taking of Rome by the Gauls. The author seems to</a>
<a id='line_609'>have been an honest citizen, proud of the military glory of his</a>
<a id='line_610'>country, sick of the disputes of factions, and much given to</a>
<a id='line_611'>pining after good old times which had never really existed. The</a>
<a id='line_612'>allusion, however, to the partial manner in which the public</a>
<a id='line_613'>lands were allotted could proceed only from a plebeian; and the</a>
<a id='line_614'>allusion to the fraudulent sale of spoils marks the date of the</a>
<a id='line_615'>poem, and shows that the poet shared in the general discontent</a>
<a id='line_616'>with which the proceedings of Camullus, after the taking of Veii,</a>
<a id='line_617'>were regarded.</a>
<a id='line_618'></a>
<a id='line_619'>The penultimate syllable of the name Porsena has been shortened</a>
<a id='line_620'>in spite of the authority of Niebuhr, who pronounces, without</a>
<a id='line_621'>assigning any ground for his opinion, that Martial was guilty of</a>
<a id='line_622'>a decided blunder in the line,</a>
<a id='line_623'></a>
<a id='line_624'>    "Hanc spectare manum Porsena non potuit."</a>
<a id='line_625'></a>
<a id='line_626'>It is not easy to understand how any modern scholar, whatever his</a>
<a id='line_627'>attainments may be,--and those of Niebuhr were undoubtedly</a>
<a id='line_628'>immense,--can venture to pronounce that Martial did not know the</a>
<a id='line_629'>quantity of a word which he must have uttered, and heard uttered,</a>
<a id='line_630'>a hundred times before he left school. Niebuhr seems also to have</a>
<a id='line_631'>forgotten that Martial has fellow culprits to keep him in</a>
<a id='line_632'>countenance. Horace has committed the same decided blunder; for</a>
<a id='line_633'>he give us, as a pure iambic line,--</a>
<a id='line_634'></a>
<a id='line_635'>    "Minacis aut Etrusca Porsenæ dextram;"</a>

<a id='line_637'>Silius Italicus has repeatedly offended in the same way, as when</a>
<a id='line_638'>he says,--"Clusinum vulgus, cum, Porsena magne, jubebas." A</a>
<a id='line_639'>modern writer may be content to err in such company.</a>
<a id='line_640'></a>
<a id='line_641'>Niebuhr's supposition that each of the three defenders of the</a>
<a id='line_642'>bridge was the representative of one of the three patrician</a>

<a id='line_1455'>                 The Battle of the Lake Regillus</a>
<a id='line_1456'></a>
<a id='line_1457'></a>
<a id='line_1458'>The following poem is supposed to have been produced about ninety</a>
<a id='line_1459'>years after the lay of Horatius. Some persons mentioned in the</a>
<a id='line_1460'>lay of Horatius make their appearance again, and some</a>
<a id='line_1461'>appellations and epithets used in the lay of Horatius have been</a>
<a id='line_1462'>purposely repeated: for, in an age of ballad-poetry, it scarcely</a>
<a id='line_1463'>ever fails to happen, that certain phrases come to be</a>
<a id='line_1464'>appropriated to certain men and things, and are regularly applied</a>
<a id='line_1465'>to those men and things by every minstrel. Thus we find, both in</a>
<a id='line_1466'>the Homeric poems and in Hesiod, [several examples of common</a>
<a id='line_1467'>phrases, in Greek]. Thus, too, in our own national songs, Douglas</a>
<a id='line_1468'>is almost always the doughty Douglas; England is merry England;</a>
<a id='line_1469'>all the gold is red; and all the ladies are gay.</a>
<a id='line_1470'></a>
<a id='line_1471'>The principal distinction between the lay of Horatius and the lay</a>
<a id='line_1472'>of the Lake Regillus is that the former is meant to be purely</a>
<a id='line_1473'>Roman, while the latter, though national in its general spirit,</a>
<a id='line_1474'>has a slight tincture of Greek learning and of Greek</a>
<a id='line_1475'>superstition. The story of the Tarquins, as it has come down to</a>
<a id='line_1476'>us, appears to have been compiled from the works of several</a>
<a id='line_1477'>popular poets; and one, at least, of those poets appears to have</a>
<a id='line_1478'>visited the Greek colonies in Italy, if not Greece itself, and to</a>
<a id='line_1479'>have had some acquaintance with the works of Homer and Herodotus.</a>
<a id='line_1480'>Many of the most striking adventures of the House of Tarquin,</a>
<a id='line_1481'>before Lucretia makes her appearance, have a Greek character. The</a>
<a id='line_1482'>Tarquins themselves are represented as Corinthian nobles of the</a>
<a id='line_1483'>great House of the Bacchiadæ, driven from their country by the</a>
<a id='line_1484'>tyranny of that Cypselus, the tale of whose strange escape</a>
<a id='line_1485'>Herodotus has related with incomparable simplicity and</a>
<a id='line_1486'>liveliness. Livy and Dionysius tell us that, when Tarquin the</a>
<a id='line_1487'>Proud was asked what was the best mode of governing a conquered</a>
<a id='line_1488'>city, he replied only by beating down with his staff all the</a>
<a id='line_1489'>tallest poppies in his garden. This is exactly what Herodotus, in</a>
<a id='line_1490'>the passage to which reference has already been made, relates of</a>
<a id='line_1491'>the counsel given to Periander, the son of Cypselus. The</a>
<a id='line_1492'>stratagem by which the town of Gabii is brought under the power</a>
<a id='line_1493'>of the Tarquins is, again, obviously copied from Herodotus. The</a>
<a id='line_1494'>embassy of the young Tarquins to the oracle at Delphi is just</a>
<a id='line_1495'>such a story as would be told by a poet whose head was full of</a>
<a id='line_1496'>the Greek mythology; and the ambiguous answer returned by Apollo</a>
<a id='line_1497'>is in the exact style of the prophecies which, according to</a>
<a id='line_1498'>Herodotus, lured Croesus to destruction. Then the character of</a>
<a id='line_1499'>the narrative changes. From the first mention of Lucretia to the</a>
<a id='line_1500'>retreat of Porsena nothing seems to be borrowed from foreign</a>
<a id='line_1501'>sources. The villainy of Sextus, the suicide of his victim, the</a>
<a id='line_1502'>revolution, the death of the sons of Brutus, the defence of the</a>
<a id='line_1503'>bridge, Musius burning his hand, Cloelia swimming through Tiber,</a>
<a id='line_1504'>seem to be all strictly Roman. But when we have done with the</a>
<a id='line_1505'>Tuscan wars, and enter upon the war with the Latines, we are</a>
<a id='line_1506'>again struck by the Greek air of the story. The Battle of the</a>
<a id='line_1507'>Lake Regillus is in all respects a Homeric battle, except that</a>
<a id='line_1508'>the combatants ride astride on their horses, instead of driving</a>
<a id='line_1509'>chariots. The mass of fighting men is hardly mentioned. The</a>
<a id='line_1510'>leaders single each other out, and engage hand to hand. The great</a>
<a id='line_1511'>object of the warriors on both sides is, as in the Iliad, to</a>
<a id='line_1512'>obtain possession of the spoils and bodies of the slain; and</a>
<a id='line_1513'>several circumstances are related which forcibly remind us of the</a>
<a id='line_1514'>great slaughter round the corpses of Sarpedon and Patroclus.</a>
<a id='line_1515'></a>
<a id='line_1516'>But there is one circumstance which deserves especial notice.</a>
<a id='line_1517'>Both the war of Troy and the war of Regillus were caused by the</a>
<a id='line_1518'>licentious passions of young princes, who were therefore</a>
<a id='line_1519'>peculiarly bound not to be sparing of their own persons on the</a>
<a id='line_1520'>day of battle. Now the conduct of Sextus at Regillus, as</a>
<a id='line_1521'>described by Livy, so exactly resembles that of Paris, as</a>
<a id='line_1522'>described at the beginning of the third book of the Iliad, that</a>
<a id='line_1523'>it is difficult to believe the resemblance accidental. Paris</a>
<a id='line_1524'>appears before the Trojan ranks, defying the bravest Greek to</a>
<a id='line_1525'>encounter him:--</a>
<a id='line_1526'></a>
<a id='line_1527'>       3 lines from the Iliad, in Greek, probably those</a>
<a id='line_1528'>       translated by Pope as:</a>
<a id='line_1529'></a>
<a id='line_1530'>       ...to the van, before the sons of fame</a>
<a id='line_1531'>       Whom Troy sent forth, the beauteous Paris came:</a>
<a id='line_1532'></a>
<a id='line_1533'>Livy introduces Sextus in a similar manner: "Ferocem juvenem</a>
<a id='line_1534'>Tarquinium, ostentantem se in prima exsulum acie." Menelaus</a>
<a id='line_1535'>rushes to meet Paris. A Roman noble, eager for vengeance, spurs</a>
<a id='line_1536'>his horse towards Sextus. Both the guilty princes are instantly</a>
<a id='line_1537'>terror-stricken:--</a>
<a id='line_1538'></a>
<a id='line_1539'>       3 more lines in Greek, Pope's translation being:</a>
<a id='line_1540'></a>
<a id='line_1541'>       ...[Menelaus] approaching near,</a>
<a id='line_1542'>       The beauteous champion views with marks of fear,</a>
<a id='line_1543'>       Smit with a conscious sense, retires behind,</a>

<a id='line_1546'>"Tarquinius," says Livy, "retro in agmen suorum infenso cessit</a>
<a id='line_1547'>hosti." If this be a fortuitous coincidence, it is also one of</a>
<a id='line_1548'>the most extraordinary in literature.</a>
<a id='line_1549'></a>
<a id='line_1550'>In the following poem, therefore, images and incidents have been</a>
<a id='line_1551'>borrowed, not merely without scruple, but on principle, from the</a>
<a id='line_1552'>incomparable battle-pieces of Homer.</a>
<a id='line_1553'></a>
<a id='line_1554'>The popular belief at Rome, from an early period, seems to have</a>
<a id='line_1555'>been that the event of the great day of Regillus was decided by</a>
<a id='line_1556'>supernatural agency. Castor and Pollux, it was said, had fought</a>
<a id='line_1557'>armed and mounted, at the head of the legions of the</a>
<a id='line_1558'>commonwealth, and had afterwards carried the news of the victory</a>
<a id='line_1559'>with incredible speed to the city. The well in the Forum at which</a>
<a id='line_1560'>they had alighted was pointed out. Near the well rose their</a>
<a id='line_1561'>ancient temple. A great festival was kept to their honor on the</a>
<a id='line_1562'>Ides of Quintilis, supposed to be the anniversary of the battle;</a>
<a id='line_1563'>and on that day sumptuous sacrifices were offered to them at the</a>
<a id='line_1564'>public charge. One spot on the margin of Lake Regillus was</a>
<a id='line_1565'>regarded during many ages with superstitious awe. A mark,</a>
<a id='line_1566'>resembling in shape a horse's hoof, was discernible in the</a>
<a id='line_1567'>volcanic rock; and this mark was believed to have been made by</a>
<a id='line_1568'>one of the celestial chargers.</a>
<a id='line_1569'></a>
<a id='line_1570'>How the legend originated cannot now be ascertained; but we may</a>
<a id='line_1571'>easily imagine several ways in which it might have originated;</a>
<a id='line_1572'>nor is it at all necessary to suppose, with Julius Frontinus,</a>
<a id='line_1573'>that two young men were dressed up by the Dictator to personate</a>
<a id='line_1574'>the sons of Leda. It is probable that Livy is correct when he</a>
<a id='line_1575'>says that the Roman general, in the hour of peril, vowed a temple</a>
<a id='line_1576'>to Castor. If so, nothing could be more natural than that the</a>
<a id='line_1577'>multitude should ascribe the victory to the favor of the Twin</a>
<a id='line_1578'>Gods. When such was the prevailing sentiment, any man who chose</a>
<a id='line_1579'>to declare that, in the midst of the confusion and slaughter, he</a>
<a id='line_1580'>had seen two godlike forms on white horses scattering the</a>
<a id='line_1581'>Latines, would find ready credence. We know, indeed, that in</a>
<a id='line_1582'>modern times a very similar story actually found credence among a</a>
<a id='line_1583'>people much more civilized than the Romans of the fifth century</a>
<a id='line_1584'>before Christ. A chaplain of Cortes, writing about thirty years</a>
<a id='line_1585'>after the conquest of Mexico, in an age of printing presses,</a>
<a id='line_1586'>libraries, universities, scholars, logicians, jurists, and</a>
<a id='line_1587'>statesmen, had the face to assert that, in one engagement against</a>
<a id='line_1588'>the Indians, St. James had appeared on a gray horse at the head</a>
<a id='line_1589'>of the Castilian adventurers. Many of those adventurers were</a>
<a id='line_1590'>living when this lie was printed. One of them, honest Bernal</a>
<a id='line_1591'>Diaz, wrote an account of the expedition. He had the evidence of</a>
<a id='line_1592'>his own senses against the legend; but he seems to have</a>
<a id='line_1593'>distrusted even the evidence of his own senses. He says that he</a>
<a id='line_1594'>was in the battle, and that he saw a gray horse with a man on his</a>
<a id='line_1595'>back, but that the man was, to his thinking, Francesco de Morla,</a>
<a id='line_1596'>and not the ever-blessed apostle St. James. "Nevertheless,"</a>
<a id='line_1597'>Bernal adds, "it may be that the person on the gray horse was</a>
<a id='line_1598'>the glorious apostle St. James, and that I, sinner that I am, was</a>
<a id='line_1599'>unworthy to see him." The Romans of the age of Cincinatus were</a>
<a id='line_1600'>probably quite as credulous as the Spanish subjects of Charles</a>
<a id='line_1601'>the Fifth. It is therefore conceivable that the appearance of</a>
<a id='line_1602'>Castor and Pollux may be become an article of faith before the</a>
<a id='line_1603'>generation which had fought at Regillus had passed away. Nor</a>
<a id='line_1604'>could anything be more natural than that the poets of the next</a>
<a id='line_1605'>age should embellish this story, and make the celestial horsemen</a>
<a id='line_1606'>bear the tidings of victory to Rome.</a>
<a id='line_1607'></a>
<a id='line_1608'>Many years after the temple of the Twin Gods had been built in</a>
<a id='line_1609'>the Forum, an important addition was made to the ceremonial by</a>
<a id='line_1610'>which the state annually testified its gratitude for their</a>
<a id='line_1611'>protection. Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius were elected</a>
<a id='line_1612'>Censors at a momentous crisis. It had become absolutely necessary</a>
<a id='line_1613'>that the classification of the citizens should be revised. On</a>
<a id='line_1614'>that classification depended the distribution of political power.</a>
<a id='line_1615'>Party spirit ran high; and the republic seemed to be in danger of</a>
<a id='line_1616'>falling under the dominion either of a narrow oligarchy or of an</a>
<a id='line_1617'>ignorant and headstrong rabble. Under such circumstances, the</a>
<a id='line_1618'>most illustrious patrician and the most illustrious plebeian of</a>
<a id='line_1619'>the age were entrusted with the office of arbitrating between the</a>
<a id='line_1620'>angry factions; and they performed their arduous task to the</a>
<a id='line_1621'>satisfaction of all honest and reasonable men.</a>
<a id='line_1622'></a>
<a id='line_1623'>One of their reforms was the remodelling of the equestrian order;</a>
<a id='line_1624'>and, having effected this reform, they determined to give to</a>
<a id='line_1625'>their work a sanction derived from religion. In the chivalrous</a>
<a id='line_1626'>societies of modern times,--societies which have much more than</a>
<a id='line_1627'>may at first sight appear in common with with the equestrian</a>
<a id='line_1628'>order of Rome,--it has been usual to invoke the special</a>
<a id='line_1629'>protection of some Saint, and to observe his day with peculiar</a>
<a id='line_1630'>solemnity. Thus the Companions of the Garter wear the image of</a>
<a id='line_1631'>St. George depending from their collars, and meet, on great</a>
<a id='line_1632'>occasions, in St. George's Chapel. Thus, when Louis the</a>
<a id='line_1633'>Fourteenth instituted a new order of chivalry for the rewarding</a>
<a id='line_1634'>of military merit, he commended it to the favor of his own</a>
<a id='line_1635'>glorified ancestor and patron, and decreed that all the members</a>
<a id='line_1636'>of the fraternity should meet at the royal palace on the feast of</a>
<a id='line_1637'>St. Louis, should attend the king to chapel, should hear mass,</a>
<a id='line_1638'>and should subsequently hold their great annual assembly. There</a>
<a id='line_1639'>is a considerable resemblance between this rule of the order of</a>
<a id='line_1640'>St. Louis and the rule which Fabius and Decius made respecting</a>
<a id='line_1641'>the Roman knights. It was ordained that a grand muster and</a>
<a id='line_1642'>inspection of the equestrian body should be part of the</a>
<a id='line_1643'>ceremonial performed, on the anniversary of the battle of</a>
<a id='line_1644'>Regillus, in honor of Castor and Pollux, the two equestrian gods.</a>
<a id='line_1645'>All the knights, clad in purple and crowned with olive, were to</a>
<a id='line_1646'>meet at a temple of Mars in the suburbs. Thence they were to ride</a>
<a id='line_1647'>in state to the Forum, where the temple of the Twins stood. This</a>
<a id='line_1648'>pageant was, during several centuries, considered as one of the</a>
<a id='line_1649'>most splendid sights of Rome. In the time of Dionysius the</a>
<a id='line_1650'>cavalcade sometimes consisted of five thousand horsemen, all</a>
<a id='line_1651'>persons of fair repute and easy fortune.</a>
<a id='line_1652'></a>
<a id='line_1653'>There can be no doubt that the Censors who instituted this august</a>
<a id='line_1654'>ceremony acted in concert with the Pontiffs to whom, by the</a>
<a id='line_1655'>constitution of Rome, the superintendence of the public worship</a>
<a id='line_1656'>belonged; and it is probable that those high religious</a>
<a id='line_1657'>functionaries were, as usual, fortunate enough to find in their</a>
<a id='line_1658'>books or traditions some warrant for the innovation.</a>
<a id='line_1659'></a>
<a id='line_1660'>The following poem is supposed to have been made for this great</a>
<a id='line_1661'>occasion. Songs, we know, were chanted at religious festivals of</a>
<a id='line_1662'>Rome from an early period, indeed from so early a period that</a>
<a id='line_1663'>some of the sacred verses were popularly ascribed to Numa, and</a>
<a id='line_1664'>were utterly unintelligible in the age of Augustus. In the Second</a>
<a id='line_1665'>Punic War a great feast was held in honor of Juno, and a song was</a>
<a id='line_1666'>sung in her praise. This song was extant when Livy wrote; and,</a>
<a id='line_1667'>though exceedingly rugged and uncouth, seemed to him not wholly</a>
<a id='line_1668'>destitute of merit. A song, as we learn from Horace, was part of</a>
<a id='line_1669'>the established ritual at the great Secular Jubilee. It is</a>
<a id='line_1670'>therefore likely that the Censors and Pontiffs, when they had</a>
<a id='line_1671'>resolved to add a grand procession of knights to the other</a>
<a id='line_1672'>solemnities annually performed on the Ides of Quintilis, would</a>
<a id='line_1673'>call in the aid of a poet. Such a poet would naturally take for</a>
<a id='line_1674'>his subject the battle of Regillus, the appearance of the Twin</a>
<a id='line_1675'>Gods, and the institution of their festival. He would find</a>
<a id='line_1676'>abundant materials in the ballads of his predecessors; and he</a>
<a id='line_1677'>would make free use of the scanty stock of Greek learning which</a>
<a id='line_1678'>he had himself acquired. He would probably introduce some wise</a>
<a id='line_1679'>and holy Pontiff enjoining the magnificent ceremonial which,</a>
<a id='line_1680'>after a long interval, had at length been adopted. If the poem</a>
<a id='line_1681'>succeeded, many persons would commit it to memory. Parts of it</a>
<a id='line_1682'>would be sung to the pipe at banquets. It would be peculiarly</a>
<a id='line_1683'>interesting to the great Posthumian House, which numbered among</a>
<a id='line_1684'>its many images that of the Dictator Aulus, the hero of Regillus.</a>
<a id='line_1685'>The orator who, in the following generation, pronounced the</a>
<a id='line_1686'>funeral panegyric over the remains of Lucius Posthumius Megellus,</a>
<a id='line_1687'>thrice Consul, would borrow largely from the lay; and thus some</a>
<a id='line_1688'>passages, much disfigured, would probably find their way into the</a>
<a id='line_1689'>chronicles which were afterwards in the hands of Dionysius and</a>
<a id='line_1690'>Livy.</a>
<a id='line_1691'></a>
<a id='line_1692'>Antiquaries differ widely as to the situation of the field of</a>
<a id='line_1693'>battle. The opinion of those who suppose that the armies met near</a>
<a id='line_1694'>Cornufelle, between Frascati and the Monte Porzio, is at least</a>
<a id='line_1695'>plausible, and has been followed in the poem.</a>
<a id='line_1696'></a>
<a id='line_1697'>As to the details of the battle, it has not been thought</a>
<a id='line_1698'>desirable to adhere minutely to the accounts which have come down</a>
<a id='line_1699'>to us. Those accounts, indeed, differ widely from each other,</a>
<a id='line_1700'>and, in all probability, differ as widely from the ancient poem</a>
<a id='line_1701'>from which they were originally derived.</a>
<a id='line_1702'></a>
<a id='line_1703'>It is unnecessary to point out the obvious imitations of the</a>

<a id='line_2435'>     And forthwith all the ranks of Rome</a>

<a id='line_2639'></a>
<a id='line_2640'></a>
<a id='line_2641'>A collection consisting exclusively of war-songs would give an</a>
<a id='line_2642'>imperfect, or rather an erroneous, notion of the spirit of the</a>
<a id='line_2643'>old Latin ballads. The Patricians, during more than a century</a>
<a id='line_2644'>after the expulsion of the Kings, held all the high military</a>
<a id='line_2645'>commands. A Plebeian, even though, like Lucius Siccius, he were</a>
<a id='line_2646'>distinguished by his valor and knowledge of war, could serve only</a>
<a id='line_2647'>in subordinate posts. A minstrel, therefore, who wished to</a>
<a id='line_2648'>celebrate the early triumphs of his country, could hardly take</a>
<a id='line_2649'>any but Patricians for his heroes. The warriors who are mentioned</a>
<a id='line_2650'>in the two preceding lays, Horatius, Lartius, Herminius, Aulus</a>
<a id='line_2651'>Posthumius, Æbutius Elva, Sempronius Atratinus, Valerius</a>
<a id='line_2652'>Poplicola, were all members of the dominant order; and a poet who</a>
<a id='line_2653'>was singing their praises, whatever his own political opinions</a>
<a id='line_2654'>might be, would naturally abstain from insulting the class to</a>
<a id='line_2655'>which they belonged, and from reflecting on the system which had</a>
<a id='line_2656'>placed such men at the head of the legions of the Commonwealth.</a>
<a id='line_2657'></a>
<a id='line_2658'>But there was a class of compositions in which the great families</a>
<a id='line_2659'>were by no means so courteously treated. No parts of early Roman</a>
<a id='line_2660'>history are richer with poetical coloring than those which relate</a>
<a id='line_2661'>to the long contest between the privileged houses and the</a>
<a id='line_2662'>commonality. The population of Rome was, from a very early</a>
<a id='line_2663'>period, divided into hereditary castes, which, indeed, readily</a>
<a id='line_2664'>united to repel foreign enemies, but which regarded each other,</a>
<a id='line_2665'>during many years, with bitter animosity. Between those castes</a>
<a id='line_2666'>there was a barrier hardly less strong than that which, at</a>
<a id='line_2667'>Venice, parted the members of the Great Council from their</a>
<a id='line_2668'>countrymen. In some respects, indeed, the line which separated an</a>
<a id='line_2669'>Icilius or a Duilius from a Posthumius or a Fabius was even more</a>
<a id='line_2670'>deeply marked than that which separated the rower of gondola from</a>
<a id='line_2671'>a Contarini or a Morosini. At Venice the distinction was merely</a>
<a id='line_2672'>civil. At Rome it was both civil and religious. Among the</a>
<a id='line_2673'>grievances under which the Plebeians suffered, three were felt as</a>
<a id='line_2674'>peculiarly severe. They were excluded from the highest</a>
<a id='line_2675'>magistracies; they were excluded from all share in the public</a>
<a id='line_2676'>lands; and they were ground down to the dust by partial and</a>
<a id='line_2677'>barbarous legislation touching pecuniary contracts. The ruling</a>
<a id='line_2678'>class in Rome was a moneyed class; and it made and administered</a>
<a id='line_2679'>the laws with a view solely to its own interest. Thus the</a>
<a id='line_2680'>relation between lender and borrower was mixed up with the</a>
<a id='line_2681'>relation between sovereign and subject. The great men held a</a>
<a id='line_2682'>large portion of the community in dependence by means of advances</a>
<a id='line_2683'>at enormous usury. The law of debt, framed by creditors, and for</a>
<a id='line_2684'>the protection of creditors, was the host horrible that has ever</a>
<a id='line_2685'>been known among men. The liberty and even the life of the</a>
<a id='line_2686'>insolvent were at the mercy of the Patrician money-lenders.</a>
<a id='line_2687'>Children often became slaves in consequence of the misfortunes of</a>
<a id='line_2688'>their parents. The debtor was imprisoned, not in a public jail</a>
<a id='line_2689'>under the care of impartial public functionaries, but in a</a>
<a id='line_2690'>private workhouse belonging to the creditor. Frightful stories</a>
<a id='line_2691'>were told respecting these dungeons. It was said that torture and</a>
<a id='line_2692'>brutal violation were common; that tight stocks, heavy chains,</a>
<a id='line_2693'>scanty measures of food, were used to punish wretches guilty of</a>
<a id='line_2694'>nothing but poverty; and that brave soldiers, whose breasts were</a>
<a id='line_2695'>covered with honorable scars, were often marked still more deeply</a>
<a id='line_2696'>on the back by the scourges of high-born usurers.</a>
<a id='line_2697'></a>
<a id='line_2698'>The Plebeians were, however, not wholly without constitutional</a>
<a id='line_2699'>rights. From an early period they had been admitted to some share</a>
<a id='line_2700'>of political power. They were enrolled each in his century, and</a>
<a id='line_2701'>were allowed a share, considerable though not proportioned to</a>
<a id='line_2702'>their numerical strength, in the disposal of those high dignities</a>
<a id='line_2703'>from which they were themselves excluded. Thus their position</a>
<a id='line_2704'>bore some resemblance to that of the Irish Catholics during the</a>
<a id='line_2705'>interval between the year 1792 and the year 1829. The Plebeians</a>
<a id='line_2706'>had also the privilege of annually appointing officers, named</a>
<a id='line_2707'>Tribunes, who had no active share in the government of the</a>
<a id='line_2708'>commonwealth, but who, by degree, acquired a power formidable</a>
<a id='line_2709'>even to the ablest and most resolute Consuls and Dictators. The</a>
<a id='line_2710'>person of the Tribune was inviolable; and, though he could</a>
<a id='line_2711'>directly effect little, he could obstruct everything.</a>
<a id='line_2712'></a>
<a id='line_2713'>During more than a century after the institution of the</a>
<a id='line_2714'>Tribuneship, the Commons struggled manfully for the removal of</a>
<a id='line_2715'>the grievances under which they labored; and, in spite of many</a>
<a id='line_2716'>checks and reverses, succeeded in wringing concession after</a>
<a id='line_2717'>concession from the stubborn aristocracy. At length in the year</a>
<a id='line_2718'>of the city 378, both parties mustered their whole strength for</a>
<a id='line_2719'>their last and most desperate conflict. The popular and active</a>
<a id='line_2720'>Tribune, Caius Licinius, proposed the three memorable laws which</a>
<a id='line_2721'>are called by his name, and which were intended to redress the</a>
<a id='line_2722'>three great evils of which the Plebeians complained. He was</a>
<a id='line_2723'>supported, with eminent ability and firmness, by his colleague,</a>
<a id='line_2724'>Lucius Sextius. The struggle appears to have been the fiercest</a>
<a id='line_2725'>that every in any community terminated without an appeal to arms.</a>
<a id='line_2726'>If such a contest had raged in any Greek city, the streets would</a>
<a id='line_2727'>have run with blood. But, even in the paroxysms of faction, the</a>
<a id='line_2728'>Roman retained his gravity, his respect for law, and his</a>
<a id='line_2729'>tenderness for the lives of his fellow citizens. Year after year</a>
<a id='line_2730'>Licinius and Sextius were reëlected Tribunes. Year after year, if</a>
<a id='line_2731'>the narrative which has come down to us is to be trusted, they</a>
<a id='line_2732'>continued to exert, to the full extent, their power of stopping</a>
<a id='line_2733'>the whole machine of government. No curule magistrates could be</a>
<a id='line_2734'>chosen; no military muster could be held. We know too little of</a>
<a id='line_2735'>the state of Rome in those days to be able to conjecture how,</a>
<a id='line_2736'>during that long anarchy, the peace was kept, and ordinary</a>
<a id='line_2737'>justice administered between man and man. The animosity of both</a>
<a id='line_2738'>parties rose to the greatest height. The excitement, we may well</a>
<a id='line_2739'>suppose, would have been peculiarly intense at the annual</a>
<a id='line_2740'>election of Tribunes. On such occasions there can be little doubt</a>
<a id='line_2741'>that the great families did all that could be done, by threats</a>
<a id='line_2742'>and caresses, to break the union of the Plebeians. That union,</a>
<a id='line_2743'>however, proved indissoluble. At length the good cause triumphed.</a>
<a id='line_2744'>The Licinian laws were carried. Lucius Sextius was the first</a>
<a id='line_2745'>Plebeian Consul, Caius Licinius the third.</a>
<a id='line_2746'></a>
<a id='line_2747'>The results of this great change were singularly happy and</a>
<a id='line_2748'>glorious. Two centuries of prosperity, harmony, and victory</a>
<a id='line_2749'>followed the reconciliation of the orders. Men who remembered</a>
<a id='line_2750'>Rome engaged in waging petty wars almost within sight of the</a>
<a id='line_2751'>Capitol lived to see her the mistress of Italy. While the</a>
<a id='line_2752'>disabilities of the Plebeians continued, she was scarcely able to</a>
<a id='line_2753'>maintain her ground against the Volscians and Hernicans. When</a>
<a id='line_2754'>those disabilities were removed, she rapidly became more than a</a>
<a id='line_2755'>match for Carthage and Macedon.</a>
<a id='line_2756'></a>
<a id='line_2757'>During the great Licinian contest the Plebeian poets were,</a>
<a id='line_2758'>doubtless, not silent. Even in modern times songs have been by no</a>
<a id='line_2759'>means without influence on public affairs; and we may therefore</a>
<a id='line_2760'>infer that, in a society where printing was unknown and where</a>
<a id='line_2761'>books were rare, a pathetic or humorous party-ballad must have</a>
<a id='line_2762'>produced effects such as we can but faintly conceive. It is</a>
<a id='line_2763'>certain that satirical poems were common at Rome from a very</a>
<a id='line_2764'>early period. The rustics, who lived at a distance from the seat</a>
<a id='line_2765'>of government, and took little part in the strife of factions,</a>
<a id='line_2766'>gave vent to their petty local animosities in coarse Fescennine</a>
<a id='line_2767'>verse. The lampoons of the city were doubtless of a higher order;</a>
<a id='line_2768'>and their sting was early felt by the nobility. For in the Twelve</a>
<a id='line_2769'>Tables, long before the time of the Licinian laws, a severe</a>
<a id='line_2770'>punishment was denounced against the citizen who should compose</a>
<a id='line_2771'>or recite verses reflecting on another. Satire is, indeed, the</a>
<a id='line_2772'>only sort of composition in which the Latin poets, whose works</a>
<a id='line_2773'>have come down to us, were not mere imitators of foreign models;</a>
<a id='line_2774'>and it is therefore the only sort of composition in which they</a>
<a id='line_2775'>have never been rivalled. It was not, like their tragedy, their</a>
<a id='line_2776'>comedy, their epic and lyric poetry, a hothouse plant which, in</a>
<a id='line_2777'>return for assiduous and skilful culture, gave only scanty and</a>
<a id='line_2778'>sickly fruits. It was hardy and full of sap; and in all the</a>
<a id='line_2779'>various juices which it yielded might be distinguished the flavor</a>
<a id='line_2780'>of the Ausonian soil. "Satire," said Quinctilian, with just</a>
<a id='line_2781'>pride, "is all our own." Satire sprang, in truth, naturally</a>
<a id='line_2782'>from the constitution of the Roman government and from the spirit</a>
<a id='line_2783'>of the Roman people; and, though at length subjected to metrical</a>
<a id='line_2784'>rules derived from Greece, retained to the last an essentially</a>
<a id='line_2785'>Roman character. Lucilius was the earliest satirist whose works</a>
<a id='line_2786'>were held in esteem under the Caesars. But many years before</a>
<a id='line_2787'>Lucilius was born, Nævius had been flung into a dungeon, and</a>
<a id='line_2788'>guarded there with circumstances of unusual rigor, on account of</a>
<a id='line_2789'>the bitter lines in which he had attacked the great Caecilian</a>
<a id='line_2790'>family. The genius and spirit of the Roman satirists survived the</a>
<a id='line_2791'>liberty of their country, and were not extinguished by the cruel</a>
<a id='line_2792'>despotism of the Julian and Flavian Emperors. The great poet who</a>
<a id='line_2793'>told the story of Domitian's turbot was the legitimate successor</a>
<a id='line_2794'>of those forgotten minstrels whose songs animated the factions of</a>
<a id='line_2795'>the infant Republic.</a>
<a id='line_2796'></a>
<a id='line_2797'>Those minstrels, as Niebuhr has remarked, appear to have</a>
<a id='line_2798'>generally taken the popular side. We can hardly be mistaken in</a>
<a id='line_2799'>supposing that, at the great crisis of the civil conflict, they</a>
<a id='line_2800'>employed themselves in versifying all the most powerful and</a>
<a id='line_2801'>virulent speeches of the Tribunes, and in heaping abuse on the</a>
<a id='line_2802'>leaders of the aristocracy. Every personal defect, every domestic</a>
<a id='line_2803'>scandal, every tradition dishonorable to a noble house, would be</a>
<a id='line_2804'>sought out, brought into notice, and exaggerated. The illustrious</a>
<a id='line_2805'>head of the aristocratical party, Marcus Furius Camillus, might</a>
<a id='line_2806'>perhaps be, in some measure, protected by his venerable age and</a>
<a id='line_2807'>by the memory of his great services to the state. But Appius</a>
<a id='line_2808'>Claudius Crassus enjoyed no such immunity. He was descended from</a>
<a id='line_2809'>a long line of ancestors distinguished by their haughty demeanor,</a>
<a id='line_2810'>and by the inflexibility with which they had withstood all the</a>
<a id='line_2811'>demands of the Plebeian order. While the political conduct and</a>
<a id='line_2812'>the deportment of the Claudian nobles drew upon them the fiercest</a>
<a id='line_2813'>public hatred, they were accused of wanting, if any credit is due</a>
<a id='line_2814'>to the early history of Rome, a class of qualities which, in a</a>
<a id='line_2815'>military commonwealth, is sufficient to cover a multitude of</a>
<a id='line_2816'>offences. The chiefs of the family appear to have been eloquent,</a>
<a id='line_2817'>versed in civil business, and learned after the fashion of their</a>
<a id='line_2818'>age; but in war they were not distinguished by skill or valor.</a>
<a id='line_2819'>Some of them, as if conscious where their weakness lay, had, when</a>
<a id='line_2820'>filling the highest magistracies, taken internal administration</a>
<a id='line_2821'>as their department of public business, and left the military</a>
<a id='line_2822'>command to their colleagues. One of them had been entrusted with</a>
<a id='line_2823'>an army, and had failed ignominiously. None of them had been</a>
<a id='line_2824'>honored with a triumph. None of them had achieved any martial</a>
<a id='line_2825'>exploit, such as those by which Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus,</a>
<a id='line_2826'>Titus Quinctius Capitolinus, Aulus Cornelius Cossus, and, above</a>
<a id='line_2827'>all, the great Camillus, had extorted the reluctant esteem of the</a>
<a id='line_2828'>multitude. During the Licinian conflict, Appius Claudius Crassus</a>
<a id='line_2829'>signalized himself by the ability and severity with which he</a>
<a id='line_2830'>harangued against the two great agitators. He would naturally,</a>
<a id='line_2831'>therefore, be the favorite mark of the Plebeian satirists; nor</a>
<a id='line_2832'>would they have been at a loss to find a point on which he was</a>
<a id='line_2833'>open to attack.</a>
<a id='line_2834'></a>
<a id='line_2835'>His grandfather, called, like himself, Appius Claudius, had left</a>
<a id='line_2836'>a name as much detested as that Sextus Tarquinius. This elder</a>
<a id='line_2837'>Appius had been Consul more than seventy years before the</a>
<a id='line_2838'>introduction of the Licinian laws. By availing himself of a</a>
<a id='line_2839'>singular crisis in public feeling, he had obtained the consent of</a>
<a id='line_2840'>the Commons to the abolition of the Tribuneship, and had been the</a>
<a id='line_2841'>chief of that Council of Ten to which the whole direction of the</a>
<a id='line_2842'>state had been committed. In a new months his administration had</a>
<a id='line_2843'>become universally odious. It had been swept away by an</a>
<a id='line_2844'>irresistible outbreak of popular fury; and its memory was still</a>
<a id='line_2845'>held in abhorrence by the whole city. The immediate cause of the</a>
<a id='line_2846'>downfall of this execrable government was said to have been an</a>
<a id='line_2847'>attempt made by Appius Claudius upon the chastity of a beautiful</a>
<a id='line_2848'>young girl of humble birth. The story ran that the Decemvir,</a>
<a id='line_2849'>unable to succeed by bribes and solicitations, resorted to an</a>
<a id='line_2850'>outrageous act of tyranny. A vile dependent of the Claudian house</a>
<a id='line_2851'>laid claim to the damsel as his slave. The cause was brought</a>
<a id='line_2852'>before the tribunal of Appius. The wicked magistrate, in defiance</a>
<a id='line_2853'>of the clearest proofs, gave judgment for the claimant. But the</a>
<a id='line_2854'>girl's father, a brave soldier, saved her from servitude and</a>
<a id='line_2855'>dishonor by stabbing her to the heart in the sight of the whole</a>
<a id='line_2856'>Forum. That blow was the signal for a general explosion. Camp and</a>
<a id='line_2857'>city rose at once; the Ten were pulled down; the Tribuneship was</a>
<a id='line_2858'>reëstablished; and Appius escaped the hands of the executioner</a>
<a id='line_2859'>only by a voluntary death.</a>
<a id='line_2860'></a>
<a id='line_2861'>It can hardly be doubted that a story so admirably adapted to the</a>
<a id='line_2862'>purposes both of the poet and of the demagogue would be eagerly</a>
<a id='line_2863'>seized upon by minstrels burning with hatred against the</a>
<a id='line_2864'>Patrician order, against the Claudian house, and especially</a>
<a id='line_2865'>against the grandson and namesake of the infamous Decemvir.</a>
<a id='line_2866'></a>
<a id='line_2867'>In order that the reader may judge fairly of these fragments of</a>
<a id='line_2868'>the lay of Virginia, he must imagine himself a Plebeian who has</a>
<a id='line_2869'>just voted for the reëlection of Sextius and Licinius. All the</a>
<a id='line_2870'>power of the Patricians has been exerted to throw out the two</a>
<a id='line_2871'>great champions of the Commons. Every Posthumius, Æmilius, and</a>
<a id='line_2872'>Cornelius has used his influence to the utmost. Debtors have been</a>
<a id='line_2873'>let out of the workhouses on condition of voting against the men</a>
<a id='line_2874'>of the people; clients have been posted to hiss and interrupt the</a>
<a id='line_2875'>favorite candidates; Appius Claudius Crassus has spoken with more</a>
<a id='line_2876'>than his usual eloquence and asperity: all has been in vain,</a>
<a id='line_2877'>Licinius and Sextius have a fifth time carried all the tribes:</a>
<a id='line_2878'>work is suspended; the booths are closed; the Plebeians bear on</a>
<a id='line_2879'>their shoulders the two champions of liberty through the Forum.</a>
<a id='line_2880'>Just at this moment it is announced that a great poet, a zealous</a>
<a id='line_2881'>adherent of the Tribunes, has made a new song which will cut the</a>
<a id='line_2882'>Claudian nobles to the heart. The crowd gathers round him, and</a>
<a id='line_2883'>calls on him to recite it. He takes his stand on the spot where,</a>
<a id='line_2884'>according to tradition, Virginia, more than seventy years ago,</a>
<a id='line_2885'>was seized by the pandar of Appius, and he begins his story.</a>
<a id='line_2886'></a>
<a id='line_2887'></a>
<a id='line_2888'>                                  Virginia</a>
<a id='line_2889'></a>
<a id='line_2890'></a>
<a id='line_2891'>Fragments of a Lay Sung in the Forum on the Day Whereon Lucius</a>
<a id='line_2892'>Sextius Sextinus Lateranus and Caius Licinius Calvus Stolo Were</a>
<a id='line_2893'>Elected Tribunes of the Commons the Fifth Time, in the Year of</a>
<a id='line_2894'>the City CCCLXXXII.</a>
<a id='line_2895'></a>
<a id='line_2896'>        Ye good men of the Commons, with loving hearts and true,</a>
<a id='line_2897'>   Who stand by the bold Tribunes that still have stood by you,</a>
<a id='line_2898'>   Come, make a circle round me, and mark my tale with care,</a>
<a id='line_2899'>   A tale of what Rome once hath borne, of what Rome yet may bear.</a>
<a id='line_2900'>   This is no Grecian fable, of fountains running wine,</a>
<a id='line_2901'>   Of maids with snaky tresses, or sailors turned to swine.</a>
<a id='line_2902'>   Here, in this very Forum, under the noonday sun,</a>
<a id='line_2903'>   In sight of all the people, the bloody deed was done.</a>
<a id='line_2904'>   Old men still creep among us who saw that fearful day,</a>
<a id='line_2905'>   Just seventy years and seven ago, when the wicked Ten bare sway.</a>
<a id='line_2906'></a>
<a id='line_2907'>        Of all the wicked Ten still the names are held accursed,</a>
<a id='line_2908'>   And of all the wicked Ten Appius Claudius was the worst.</a>
<a id='line_2909'>   He stalked along the Forum like King Tarquin in his pride:</a>
<a id='line_2910'>   Twelve axes waited on him, six marching on a side;</a>
<a id='line_2911'>   The townsmen shrank to right and left, and eyed askance with fear</a>
<a id='line_2912'>   His lowering brow, his curling mouth which always seemed to</a>
<a id='line_2913'>   sneer;</a>
<a id='line_2914'>   That brow of hate, that mouth of scorn, marks all the kindred</a>
<a id='line_2915'>   still;</a>
<a id='line_2916'>   For never was there Claudius yet but wished the Commons ill;</a>
<a id='line_2917'>   Nor lacks he fit attendance; for close behind his heels,</a>
<a id='line_2918'>   With outstretched chin and crouching pace, the client Marcus</a>
<a id='line_2919'>   steals,</a>
<a id='line_2920'>   His loins girt up to run with speed, be the errand what it may,</a>
<a id='line_2921'>   And the smile flickering on his cheek, for aught his lord may</a>
<a id='line_2922'>   say.</a>
<a id='line_2923'>   Such varlets pimp and jest for hire among the lying Greeks:</a>
<a id='line_2924'>   Such varlets still are paid to hoot when brave Licinius speaks.</a>
<a id='line_2925'>   Where'er ye shed the honey, the buzzing flies will crowd;</a>
<a id='line_2926'>   Where'er ye fling the carrion, the raven's croak is loud;</a>
<a id='line_2927'>   Where'er down Tiber garbage floats, the greedy pike ye see;</a>
<a id='line_2928'>   And wheresoe'er such lord is found, such client still will be.</a>
<a id='line_2929'></a>
<a id='line_2930'>      Just then, as through one cloudless chink in a black stormy</a>
<a id='line_2931'>   sky</a>
<a id='line_2932'>   Shines out the dewy morning-star, a fair young girl came by.</a>
<a id='line_2933'>   With her small tablets in her hand, and her satchel on her arm,</a>
<a id='line_2934'>   Home she went bounding from the school, nor dreamed of shame or</a>
<a id='line_2935'>   harm;</a>
<a id='line_2936'>   And past those dreaded axes she innocently ran,</a>
<a id='line_2937'>   With bright frank brow that had not learned to blush at gaze of</a>
<a id='line_2938'>   man;</a>
<a id='line_2939'>   And up the Sacred Street she turned, and, as she danced along,</a>
<a id='line_2940'>   She warbled gayly to herself lines of the good old song,</a>
<a id='line_2941'>   How for a sport the princes came spurring from the camp,</a>
<a id='line_2942'>   And found Lucrece, combing the fleece, under the midnight lamp.</a>
<a id='line_2943'>   The maiden sang as sings the lark, when up he darts his flight,</a>
<a id='line_2944'>   From his nest in the green April corn, to meet the morning light;</a>
<a id='line_2945'>   And Appius heard her sweet young voice, and saw her sweet young</a>
<a id='line_2946'>   face,</a>
<a id='line_2947'>   And loved her with the accursed love of his accursed race,</a>
<a id='line_2948'>   And all along the Forum, and up the Sacred Street,</a>
<a id='line_2949'>   His vulture eye pursued the trip of those small glancing feet.</a>
<a id='line_2950'></a>
<a id='line_2951'>    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .</a>
<a id='line_2952'></a>
<a id='line_2953'>      Over the Alban mountains the light of morning broke;</a>
<a id='line_2954'>   From all the roofs of the Seven Hills curled the thin wreaths of</a>
<a id='line_2955'>   smoke:</a>
<a id='line_2956'>   The city-gates were opened; the Forum all alive</a>
<a id='line_2957'>   With buyers and with sellers was humming like a hive:</a>
<a id='line_2958'>   Blithely on brass and timber the craftsman's stroke was ringing,</a>
<a id='line_2959'>   And blithely o'er her panniers the market-girl was singing,</a>
<a id='line_2960'>   And blithely young Virginia came smiling from her home:</a>
<a id='line_2961'>   Ah! woe for young Virginia, the sweetest maid in Rome!</a>
<a id='line_2962'>   With her small tablets in her hand, and her satchel on her arm,</a>
<a id='line_2963'>   Forth she went bounding to the school, nor dreamed of shame or</a>
<a id='line_2964'>   harm.</a>
<a id='line_2965'>   She crossed the Forum shining with stalls in alleys gay,</a>
<a id='line_2966'>   And just had reached the very spot whereon I stand this day,</a>
<a id='line_2967'>   When up the varlet Marcus came; not such as when erewhile</a>
<a id='line_2968'>   He crouched behind his patron's heels with the true client smile:</a>
<a id='line_2969'>   He came with lowering forehead, swollen features, and clenched</a>
<a id='line_2970'>   fist,</a>
<a id='line_2971'>   And strode across Virginia's path, and caught her by the wrist.</a>
<a id='line_2972'>   Hard strove the frightened maiden, and screamed with look aghast;</a>
<a id='line_2973'>   And at her scream from right and left the folk came running fast;</a>
<a id='line_2974'>   The money-changer Crispus, with his thin silver hairs,</a>
<a id='line_2975'>   And Hanno from the stately booth glittering with Punic wares,</a>
<a id='line_2976'>   And the strong smith Muræna, grasping a half-forged brand,</a>
<a id='line_2977'>   And Volero the flesher, his cleaver in his hand.</a>
<a id='line_2978'>   All came in wrath and wonder, for all knew that fair child;</a>
<a id='line_2979'>   And, as she passed them twice a day, all kissed their hands and</a>
<a id='line_2980'>   smiled;</a>
<a id='line_2981'>   And the strong smith Muræna gave Marcus such a blow,</a>
<a id='line_2982'>   The caitiff reeled three paces back, and let the maiden go.</a>
<a id='line_2983'>   Yet glared he fiercely round him, and growled in harsh, fell</a>
<a id='line_2984'>   tone,</a>
<a id='line_2985'>   "She's mine, and I will have her, I seek but for mine own:</a>
<a id='line_2986'>   She is my slave, born in my house, and stolen away and sold,</a>
<a id='line_2987'>   The year of the sore sickness, ere she was twelve hours old.</a>
<a id='line_2988'>   'Twas in the sad September, the month of wail and fright,</a>
<a id='line_2989'>   Two augers were borne forth that morn; the Consul died ere night.</a>
<a id='line_2990'>   I wait on Appius Claudius, I waited on his sire:</a>
<a id='line_2991'>   Let him who works the client wrong beware the patron's ire."</a>
<a id='line_2992'></a>
<a id='line_2993'>      So spake the varlet Marcus; and dread and silence came</a>
<a id='line_2994'>   On all the people at the sound of the great Claudian name.</a>
<a id='line_2995'>   For then there was no Tribune to speak the word of might,</a>
<a id='line_2996'>   Which makes the rich man tremble, and guards the poor man's</a>
<a id='line_2997'>   right.</a>
<a id='line_2998'>   There was no brave Licinius, no honest Sixtius then;</a>
<a id='line_2999'>   But all the city, in great fear, obeyed the wicked Ten.</a>
<a id='line_3000'>   Yet ere the varlet Marcus again might seize the maid,</a>
<a id='line_3001'>   Who clung tight to Muræna's skirt, and sobbed, and shrieked for</a>
<a id='line_3002'>   aid,</a>
<a id='line_3003'>   Forth through the throng of gazers the young Icilius pressed,</a>
<a id='line_3004'>   And stamped his foot, and rent his gown, and smote upon his</a>
<a id='line_3005'>   breast,</a>
<a id='line_3006'>   And sprang upon that column, by many a minstrel sung,</a>
<a id='line_3007'>   Whereon three mouldering helmets, three rusting swords, are hung,</a>
<a id='line_3008'>   And beckoned to the people, and in bold voice and clear</a>

<a id='line_3015'>   For this did Servius give us laws? For this did Lucrece bleed?</a>
<a id='line_3016'>   For this was the great vengeance wrought on Tarquin's evil seed?</a>
<a id='line_3017'>   For this did those false sons make red the axes of their sire?</a>
<a id='line_3018'>   For this did Scævola's right hand hiss in the Tuscan fire?</a>
<a id='line_3019'>   Shall the vile fox-earth awe the race that stormed the lion's</a>
<a id='line_3020'>   den?</a>
<a id='line_3021'>   Shall we, who could not brook one lord, crouch to the wicked Ten?</a>
<a id='line_3022'>   Oh, for that ancient spirit which curbed the Senate's will!</a>
<a id='line_3023'>   Oh, for the tents which in old time whitened the Sacred Hill!</a>
<a id='line_3024'>   In those brave days our fathers stood firmly side by side;</a>
<a id='line_3025'>   They faced the Marcian fury; they tamed the Fabian pride:</a>
<a id='line_3026'>   They drove the fiercest Quinctius an outcast forth from Rome;</a>
<a id='line_3027'>   They sent the haughtiest Claudius with shivered fasces home.</a>
<a id='line_3028'>   But what their care bequeathed us our madness flung away:</a>
<a id='line_3029'>   All the ripe fruit of threescore years was blighted in a day.</a>
<a id='line_3030'>   Exult, ye proud Patricians! The hard-fought fight is o'er.</a>
<a id='line_3031'>   We strove for honors--'twas in vain; for freedom--'tis no more.</a>

<a id='line_3033'>   No Tribune breathes the word of might that guards the weak from</a>
<a id='line_3034'>   wrong.</a>
<a id='line_3035'>   Our very hearts, that were so high, sink down beneath your will.</a>
<a id='line_3036'>   Riches, and lands, and power, and state--ye have them:--keep them</a>

<a id='line_3038'>   Still keep the holy fillets; still keep the purple gown,</a>
<a id='line_3039'>   The axes, and the curule chair, the car, and laurel crown:</a>

<a id='line_3045'>   Still let your haggard debtors bear all their fathers bore;</a>
<a id='line_3046'>   Still let your dens of torment be noisome as of yore;</a>
<a id='line_3047'>   No fire when Tiber freezes; no air in dog-star heat;</a>
<a id='line_3048'>   And store of rods for free-born backs, and holes for free-born</a>

<a id='line_3050'>   Heap heavier still the fetters; bar closer still the grate;</a>
<a id='line_3051'>   Patient as sheep we yield us up unto your cruel hate.</a>
<a id='line_3052'>   But, by the Shades beneath us, and by the gods above,</a>
<a id='line_3053'>   Add not unto your cruel hate your yet more cruel love!</a>
<a id='line_3054'>   Have ye not graceful ladies, whose spotless lineage springs</a>

<a id='line_3062'>   The sweet, sweet love of daughter, of sister, and of wife,</a>
<a id='line_3063'>   The gentle speech, the balm for all that his vexed soul endures,</a>
<a id='line_3064'>   The kiss, in which he half forgets even such a yoke as yours.</a>
<a id='line_3065'>   Still let the maiden's beauty swell the father's breast with</a>
<a id='line_3066'>   pride;</a>
<a id='line_3067'>   Still let the bridegroom's arms infold an unpolluted bride.</a>
<a id='line_3068'>   Spare us the inexpiable wrong, the unutterable shame,</a>

<a id='line_3071'>   Lest, when our latest hope is fled, ye taste of our despair,</a>

<a id='line_3078'></a>
<a id='line_3079'>      Straightway Virginius led the maid a little space aside,</a>
<a id='line_3080'>   To where the reeking shambles stood, piled up with horn and hide,</a>
<a id='line_3081'>   Close to yon low dark archway, where, in a crimson flood,</a>
<a id='line_3082'>   Leaps down to the great sewer the gurgling stream of blood.</a>
<a id='line_3083'>   Hard by, a flesher on a block had laid his whittle down:</a>
<a id='line_3084'>   Virginius caught the whittle up, and hid it in his gown.</a>
<a id='line_3085'>   And then his eyes grew very dim, and his throat began to swell,</a>
<a id='line_3086'>   And in a hoarse, changed voice he spake, "Farewell, sweet child!</a>
<a id='line_3087'>   Farewell!</a>
<a id='line_3088'>   Oh! how I loved my darling! Though stern I sometimes be,</a>
<a id='line_3089'>   To thee, thou know'st, I was not so. Who could be so to thee?</a>
<a id='line_3090'>   And how my darling loved me! How glad she was to hear</a>
<a id='line_3091'>   My footstep on the threshold when I came back last year!</a>
<a id='line_3092'>   And how she danced with pleasure to see my civic crown,</a>
<a id='line_3093'>   And took my sword, and hung it up, and brought me forth my gown!</a>
<a id='line_3094'>   Now, all those things are over--yes, all thy pretty ways,</a>
<a id='line_3095'>   Thy needlework, thy prattle, thy snatches of old lays;</a>
<a id='line_3096'>   And none will grieve when I go forth, or smile when I return,</a>
<a id='line_3097'>   Or watch beside the old man's bed, or weep upon his urn.</a>
<a id='line_3098'>   The house that was the happiest within the Roman walls,</a>
<a id='line_3099'>   The house that envied not the wealth of Capua's marble halls,</a>
<a id='line_3100'>   Now, for the brightness of thy smile, must have eternal gloom,</a>
<a id='line_3101'>   And for the music of thy voice, the silence of the tomb.</a>
<a id='line_3102'>   The time is come. See how he points his eager hand this way!</a>
<a id='line_3103'>   See how his eyes gloat on thy grief, like a kite's upon the prey!</a>
<a id='line_3104'>   With all his wit, he little deems, that, spurned, betrayed,</a>
<a id='line_3105'>   bereft,</a>
<a id='line_3106'>   Thy father hath in his despair one fearful refuge left.</a>
<a id='line_3107'>   He little deems that in this hand I clutch what still can save</a>
<a id='line_3108'>   Thy gentle youth from taunts and blows, the portion of the slave;</a>
<a id='line_3109'>   Yea, and from nameless evil, that passeth taunt and blow--</a>
<a id='line_3110'>   Foul outrage which thou knowest not, which thou shalt never know.</a>
<a id='line_3111'>   Then clasp me round the neck once more, and give me one more</a>
<a id='line_3112'>   kiss;</a>
<a id='line_3113'>   And now mine own dear little girl, there is no way but this."</a>
<a id='line_3114'>   With that he lifted high the steel, and smote her in the side,</a>
<a id='line_3115'>   And in her blood she sank to earth, and with one sob she died.</a>
<a id='line_3116'></a>
<a id='line_3117'>      Then, for a little moment, all people held their breath;</a>
<a id='line_3118'>   And through the crowded Forum was stillness as of death;</a>
<a id='line_3119'>   And in another moment brake forth from one and all</a>
<a id='line_3120'>   A cry as if the Volscians were coming o'er the wall.</a>
<a id='line_3121'>   Some with averted faces shrieking fled home amain;</a>
<a id='line_3122'>   Some ran to call a leech; and some ran to lift the slain;</a>
<a id='line_3123'>   Some felt her lips and little wrist, if life might there be</a>
<a id='line_3124'>   found;</a>
<a id='line_3125'>   And some tore up their garments fast, and strove to stanch the</a>
<a id='line_3126'>   wound.</a>
<a id='line_3127'>   In vain they ran, and felt, and stanched; for never truer blow</a>
<a id='line_3128'>   That good right arm had dealt in fight agains a Volscian foe.</a>
<a id='line_3129'></a>
<a id='line_3130'>      When Appius Claudius saw that deed, he shuddered and sank</a>
<a id='line_3131'>   down,</a>
<a id='line_3132'>   And hid his face some little space with the corner of his gown,</a>
<a id='line_3133'>   Till, with white lips and bloodshot eyes, Virginius tottered</a>
<a id='line_3134'>   nigh,</a>
<a id='line_3135'>   And stood before the judgment-seat, and held the knife on high.</a>
<a id='line_3136'>   "Oh! dwellers in the nether gloom, avengers of the slain,</a>
<a id='line_3137'>   By this dear blood I cry to you, do right between us twain;</a>
<a id='line_3138'>   And even as Appius Claudius hath dealt by me and mine,</a>
<a id='line_3139'>   Deal you by Appius Claudius and all the Claudian line!"</a>
<a id='line_3140'>   So spake the slayer of his child, and turned, and went his way;</a>
<a id='line_3141'>   But first he cast one haggard glance to where the body lay,</a>
<a id='line_3142'>   And writhed, and groaned a fearful groan, an then, with steadfast</a>
<a id='line_3143'>   feet,</a>
<a id='line_3144'>   Strode right across the market-place unto the Sacred Street.</a>
<a id='line_3145'></a>
<a id='line_3146'>      Then up sprang Appius Claudius: "Stop him; alive or dead!</a>
<a id='line_3147'>   Ten thousand pounds of copper to the man who brings his head."</a>
<a id='line_3148'>   He looked upon his clients; but none would work his will.</a>
<a id='line_3149'>   He looked upon his lictors, but they trembled, and stood still.</a>
<a id='line_3150'>   And, as Virginius through the press his way in silence cleft,</a>
<a id='line_3151'>   Ever the mighty multitude fell back to right and left.</a>
<a id='line_3152'>   And he hath passed in safety unto his woeful home,</a>
<a id='line_3153'>   And there ta'en horse to tell the camp what deeds are done in</a>
<a id='line_3154'>   Rome.</a>
<a id='line_3155'></a>
<a id='line_3156'>      By this the flood of people was swollen from every side,</a>
<a id='line_3157'>   And streets and porches round were filled with that o'erflowing</a>
<a id='line_3158'>   tide;</a>
<a id='line_3159'>   And close around the body gathered a little train</a>
<a id='line_3160'>   Of them that were the nearest and dearest to the slain.</a>
<a id='line_3161'>   They brought a bier, and hung it with many a cypress crown,</a>
<a id='line_3162'>   And gently they uplifted her, and gently laid her down.</a>
<a id='line_3163'>   The face of Appius Claudius wore the Claudian scowl and sneer,</a>
<a id='line_3164'>   And in the Claudian note he cried, "What doth this rabble here?</a>
<a id='line_3165'>   Have they no crafts to mind at home, that hitherward they stray?</a>
<a id='line_3166'>   Ho! lictors, clear the market-place, and fetch the corpse away!"</a>
<a id='line_3167'>   The voice of grief and fury till then had not been loud;</a>
<a id='line_3168'>   But a deep sullen murmur wandered among the crowd,</a>
<a id='line_3169'>   Like the moaning noise that goes before the whirlwind on the</a>
<a id='line_3170'>   deep,</a>
<a id='line_3171'>   Or the growl of a fierce watch-dog but half aroused from sleep.</a>
<a id='line_3172'>   But when the lictors at that word, tall yeomen all and strong,</a>
<a id='line_3173'>   Each with his axe and sheaf of twigs, went down into the throng,</a>
<a id='line_3174'>   Those old men say, who saw that day of sorrow and of sin,</a>
<a id='line_3175'>   That in the Roman Forum was never such a din.</a>
<a id='line_3176'>   The wailing, hooting, cursing, the howls of grief and hate,</a>
<a id='line_3177'>   Were heard beyond the Pincian Hill, beyond the Latin Gate.</a>
<a id='line_3178'>   But close around the body, where stood the little train</a>
<a id='line_3179'>   Of them that were the nearest and dearest to the slain,</a>
<a id='line_3180'>   No cries were there, but teeth set fast, low whispers and black</a>
<a id='line_3181'>   frowns,</a>
<a id='line_3182'>   And breaking up of benches, and girding up of gowns.</a>
<a id='line_3183'>   'Twas well the lictors might not pierce to where the maiden lay,</a>
<a id='line_3184'>   Else surely had they been all twelve torn limb from limb that</a>
<a id='line_3185'>   day.</a>
<a id='line_3186'>   Right glad they were to struggle back, blood streaming from their</a>
<a id='line_3187'>   heads,</a>
<a id='line_3188'>   With axes all in splinters, and raiment all in shreads.</a>
<a id='line_3189'>   Then Appius Claudius gnawed his lip, and the blood left his</a>
<a id='line_3190'>   cheek,</a>
<a id='line_3191'>   And thrice he beckoned with his hand, and thrice he strove to</a>
<a id='line_3192'>   speak;</a>
<a id='line_3193'>   And thrice the tossing Forum set up a frightful yell:</a>
<a id='line_3194'>   "See, see, thou dog! what thou hast done; and hide thy shame in</a>
<a id='line_3195'>   hell!</a>
<a id='line_3196'>   Thou that wouldst make our maidens slaves must first make slaves</a>
<a id='line_3197'>   of men.</a>
<a id='line_3198'>   Tribunes! Hurrah for Trubunes! Down with the wicked Ten!"</a>
<a id='line_3199'>   And straightway, thick as hailstones, came whizzing through the</a>
<a id='line_3200'>   air,</a>
<a id='line_3201'>   Pebbles, and bricks, and potsherds, all round the curule chair:</a>
<a id='line_3202'>   And upon Appius Claudius great fear and trembling came,</a>
<a id='line_3203'>   For never was a Claudius yet brave against aught but shame.</a>
<a id='line_3204'>   Though the great houses love us not, we own, to do them right,</a>
<a id='line_3205'>   That the great houses, all save one, have borne them well in</a>
<a id='line_3206'>   fight.</a>
<a id='line_3207'>   Still Caius of Corioli, his triumphs and his wrongs,</a>
<a id='line_3208'>   His vengeance and his mercy, live in our camp-fire songs.</a>
<a id='line_3209'>   Beneath the yoke of Furius oft have Gaul and Tuscan bowed:</a>
<a id='line_3210'>   And Rome may bear the pride of him of whom herself is proud.</a>
<a id='line_3211'>   But evermore a Claudius shrinks from a stricken field,</a>
<a id='line_3212'>   And changes color like a maid at sight of sword and shield.</a>
<a id='line_3213'>   The Claudian triumphs all were won within the city towers;</a>
<a id='line_3214'>   The Claudian yoke was never pressed on any necks but ours.</a>
<a id='line_3215'>   A Cossus, like a wild cat, springs ever at the face;</a>
<a id='line_3216'>   A Fabius rushes like a boar against the shouting chase;</a>
<a id='line_3217'>   But the vile Claudian litter, raging with currish spite,</a>
<a id='line_3218'>   Still yelps and snaps at those who run, still runs from those who</a>
<a id='line_3219'>   smite.</a>
<a id='line_3220'>   So now 'twas seen of Appius. When stones began to fly,</a>
<a id='line_3221'>   He shook, and crouched, and wrung his hands, and smote upon his</a>
<a id='line_3222'>   thigh.</a>
<a id='line_3223'>   "Kind clients, honest lictors, stand by me in this fray!</a>
<a id='line_3224'>   Must I be torn in pieces? Home, home the nearest way!"</a>
<a id='line_3225'>   While yet he spake, and looked around with a bewildered stare,</a>
<a id='line_3226'>   Four sturdy lictors put their necks beneath the curule chair;</a>
<a id='line_3227'>   And fourscore clients on the left, and fourscore on the right,</a>
<a id='line_3228'>   Arrayed themselves with swords and staves, and loins girt up to</a>
<a id='line_3229'>   fight.</a>
<a id='line_3230'>   But, though without or staff or sword, so furious was the throng,</a>
<a id='line_3231'>   That scarce the train with might and main could bring their lord</a>
<a id='line_3232'>   along.</a>
<a id='line_3233'>   Twelve times the crowd made at him; five times they seized his</a>
<a id='line_3234'>   gown;</a>
<a id='line_3235'>   Small chance was his to rise again, if once they got him down:</a>
<a id='line_3236'>   And sharper came the pelting; and evermore the yell,--</a>
<a id='line_3237'>   "Tribunes! we will have Tribunes!"-- rose with a louder swell:</a>
<a id='line_3238'>   And the chair tossed as tosses a bark with tattered sail</a>
<a id='line_3239'>   When raves the Adriatic beneath an eastern gale,</a>
<a id='line_3240'>   When Calabrian sea-marks are lost in clouds of spume,</a>
<a id='line_3241'>   And the great Thunder-Cape has donned his veil of inky gloom.</a>
<a id='line_3242'>   One stone hit Appius in the mouth, and one beneath the ear;</a>
<a id='line_3243'>   And ere he reached Mount Palatine, he swooned with pain and fear.</a>
<a id='line_3244'>   His cursed head, that he was wont to hold so high with pride,</a>
<a id='line_3245'>   Now, like a drunken man's, hung down, and swayed from side to</a>
<a id='line_3246'>   side;</a>
<a id='line_3247'>   And when his stout retainers had brought him to his door,</a>
<a id='line_3248'>   His face and neck were all one cake of filth and clotted gore.</a>
<a id='line_3249'>   As Appius Claudius was that day, so may his grandson be!</a>
<a id='line_3250'>   God send Rome one such other sight, and send me there to see!</a>
<a id='line_3251'>       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</a>

<a id='line_3257'></a>
<a id='line_3258'>                      The Prophecy of Capys</a>
<a id='line_3259'></a>
<a id='line_3260'>It can hardly be necessary to remind any reader that according to</a>
<a id='line_3261'>the popular tradition, Romulus, after he had slain his granduncle</a>
<a id='line_3262'>Amulius, and restored his grandfather Numitor, determined to quit</a>
<a id='line_3263'>Alba, the hereditary domain of the Sylvian princes, and to found</a>
<a id='line_3264'>a new city. The gods, it was added, vouchsafed the clearest signs</a>
<a id='line_3265'>of the favor with which they regarded the enterprise, and of the</a>
<a id='line_3266'>high destinies reserved for the young colony.</a>
<a id='line_3267'></a>
<a id='line_3268'>This event was likely to be a favorite theme of the old Latin</a>
<a id='line_3269'>minstrels. They would naturally attribute the project of Romulus</a>
<a id='line_3270'>to some divine intimation of the power and prosperity which it</a>
<a id='line_3271'>was decreed that his city should attain. They would probably</a>
<a id='line_3272'>introduce seers foretelling the victories of unborn Consuls and</a>
<a id='line_3273'>Dictators, and the last great victory would generally occupy the</a>
<a id='line_3274'>most conspicuous place in the prediction. There is nothing</a>
<a id='line_3275'>strange in the supposition that the poet who was employed to</a>
<a id='line_3276'>celebrate the first great triumph of the Romans over the Greeks</a>
<a id='line_3277'>might throw his song of exultation into this form.</a>
<a id='line_3278'></a>
<a id='line_3279'>The occasion was one likely to excite the strongest feelings of</a>
<a id='line_3280'>national pride. A great outrage had been followed by a great</a>
<a id='line_3281'>retribution. Seven years before this time, Lucius Posthumius</a>
<a id='line_3282'>Megellus, who sprang from one of the noblest houses of Rome, and</a>
<a id='line_3283'>had been thrice Consul, was sent ambassador to Tarentum, with</a>
<a id='line_3284'>charge to demand reparation for grievous injuries. The Tarentines</a>
<a id='line_3285'>gave him audience in their theatre, where he addressed them in</a>
<a id='line_3286'>such Greek as he could command, which, we may well believe, was</a>
<a id='line_3287'>not exactly such as Cineas would have spoken. An exquisite sense</a>
<a id='line_3288'>of the ridiculous belonged to the Greek character; and closely</a>
<a id='line_3289'>connected with this faculty was a strong propensity to flippancy</a>
<a id='line_3290'>and impertinence. When Posthumius placed an accent wrong, his</a>
<a id='line_3291'>hearers burst into a laugh. When he remonstrated, they hooted</a>
<a id='line_3292'>him, and called him barbarian; and at length hissed him off the</a>
<a id='line_3293'>stage as if he had been a bad actor. As the grave Roman retired,</a>
<a id='line_3294'>a buffoon, who, from his constant drunkenness, was nicknamed the</a>
<a id='line_3295'>Pint-pot, came up with gestures of the grossest indecency, and</a>
<a id='line_3296'>bespattered the senatorial gown with filth. Posthumius turned</a>
<a id='line_3297'>round to the multitude, and held up the gown, as if appealing to</a>
<a id='line_3298'>the universal law of nations. The sight only increased the</a>
<a id='line_3299'>insolence of the Tarentines. They clapped their hands, and set up</a>
<a id='line_3300'>a shout of laughter which shook the theatre. "Men of Tarentum,"</a>
<a id='line_3301'>said Posthumius, "it will take not a little blood to wash this</a>
<a id='line_3302'>gown."</a>
<a id='line_3303'></a>
<a id='line_3304'>Rome, in consequence of this insult, declared war against the</a>
<a id='line_3305'>Tarentines. The Tarentines sought for allies beyond the Ionian</a>
<a id='line_3306'>Sea. Phyrrhus, king of Epirus, came to their help with a large</a>
<a id='line_3307'>army; and, for the first time, the two great nations of antiquity</a>
<a id='line_3308'>were fairly matched against each other.</a>
<a id='line_3309'></a>
<a id='line_3310'>The fame of Greece in arms, as well as in arts, was then at the</a>
<a id='line_3311'>height. Half a century earlier, the career of Alexander had</a>
<a id='line_3312'>excited the admiration and terror of all nations from the Ganges</a>
<a id='line_3313'>to the Pillars of Hercules. Royal houses, founded by Macedonian</a>
<a id='line_3314'>captains, still reigned at Antioch and Alexandria. That barbarian</a>
<a id='line_3315'>warriors, led by barbarian chiefs, should win a pitched battle</a>
<a id='line_3316'>against Greek valor guided by Greek science, seemed as incredible</a>
<a id='line_3317'>as it would now seem that the Burmese or the Siamese should, in</a>
<a id='line_3318'>the open plain, put to flight an equal number of the best English</a>
<a id='line_3319'>troops. The Tarentines were convinced that their countrymen were</a>
<a id='line_3320'>irresistible in war; and this conviction had emboldened them to</a>
<a id='line_3321'>treat with the grossest indignity one whom they regarded as the</a>
<a id='line_3322'>representative of an inferior race. Of the Greek generals then</a>
<a id='line_3323'>living Pyrrhus was indisputably the first. Among the troops who</a>
<a id='line_3324'>were trained in the Greek discipline his Epirotes ranked high.</a>
<a id='line_3325'>His expedition to Italy was a turning-point in the history of the</a>
<a id='line_3326'>world. He found there a people who, far inferior to the Athenians</a>
<a id='line_3327'>and Corinthians in the fine arts, in the speculative sciences,</a>
<a id='line_3328'>and in all the refinements of life, were the best soldiers on the</a>
<a id='line_3329'>face of the earth. Their arms, their gradations of rank, their</a>
<a id='line_3330'>order of battle, their method of intrenchment, were all of Latin</a>
<a id='line_3331'>origin, and had all been gradually brought near to perfection,</a>
<a id='line_3332'>not by the study of foreign models, but by the genius and</a>
<a id='line_3333'>experience of many generations of great native commanders. The</a>
<a id='line_3334'>first words which broke from the king, when his practised eye had</a>
<a id='line_3335'>surveyed the Roman encampment, were full of meaning: "These</a>
<a id='line_3336'>barbarians," he said, "have nothing barbarous in their military</a>
<a id='line_3337'>arrangements." He was at first victorious; for his own talents</a>
<a id='line_3338'>were superior to those of the captains who were opposed to him;</a>
<a id='line_3339'>and the Romans were not prepared for the onset of the elephants</a>
<a id='line_3340'>of the East, which were then for the first time seen in</a>
<a id='line_3341'>Italy--moving mountains, with long snakes for hands. But the</a>
<a id='line_3342'>victories of the Epirotes were fiercely disputed, dearly</a>
<a id='line_3343'>purchased, and altogether unprofitable. At length, Manius Curius</a>
<a id='line_3344'>Dentatus, who had in his first Consulship won two triumphs, was</a>
<a id='line_3345'>again placed at the head of the Roman Commonwealth, and sent to</a>
<a id='line_3346'>conquer the invaders. A great battle was fought near Beneventum.</a>
<a id='line_3347'>Pyrrhus was completely defeated. He repassed the sea; and the</a>
<a id='line_3348'>world learned, with amazement, that a people had been discovered</a>
<a id='line_3349'>who, in fair fighting, were superior to the best troops that had</a>
<a id='line_3350'>been drilled on the system of Parmenio and Antigonus.</a>
<a id='line_3351'></a>
<a id='line_3352'>The conquerors had a good right to exult in their success; for</a>
<a id='line_3353'>their glory was all their own. They had not learned from their</a>
<a id='line_3354'>enemy how to conquer him. It was with their own national arms,</a>
<a id='line_3355'>and in their own national battle array, that they had overcome</a>
<a id='line_3356'>weapons and tactics long believed to be invincible. The pilum and</a>
<a id='line_3357'>the broadsword had vanquished the Macedonian spear. The legion</a>
<a id='line_3358'>had broken the Macedonian phalanx. Even the elephants, when the</a>
<a id='line_3359'>surprise produced by their first appearance was over, could cause</a>
<a id='line_3360'>no disorder in the steady yet flexible battalions of Rome.</a>
<a id='line_3361'>It is said by Florus, and may easily be believed, that the</a>
<a id='line_3362'>triumph far surpassed in magnificence any that Rome had</a>
<a id='line_3363'>previously seen. The only spoils which Papirius Cursor and Fabius</a>
<a id='line_3364'>Maximus could exhibit were flocks and herds, wagons of rude</a>
<a id='line_3365'>structure, and heaps of spears and helmets. But now, for the</a>
<a id='line_3366'>first time, the riches of Asia and the arts of Greece adorned a</a>
<a id='line_3367'>Roman pageant. Plate, fine stuffs, costly furniture, rare</a>
<a id='line_3368'>animals, exquisite paintings and sculptures, formed part of the</a>
<a id='line_3369'>procession. At the banquet would be assembled a crowd of warriors</a>
<a id='line_3370'>and statesmen, among whom Manius Curius Dentatus would take the</a>
<a id='line_3371'>highest room. Caius Fabricius Luscinus, then, after two</a>
<a id='line_3372'>Consulships and two triumphs, Censor of the Commonwealth, would</a>
<a id='line_3373'>doubtless occupy a place of honor at the board. In situations</a>
<a id='line_3374'>less conspicuous probably lay some of those who were, a few years</a>
<a id='line_3375'>later, the terror of Carthage: Caius Duilius, the founder of the</a>
<a id='line_3376'>maritime greatness of his country; Marcus Atilius Regulus, who</a>
<a id='line_3377'>owed to defeat a renown far higher than that which he had derived</a>
<a id='line_3378'>from his victories; and Caius Lutatius Catalus, who, while</a>
<a id='line_3379'>suffering from a grievous wound, fought the great battle of the</a>
<a id='line_3380'>Æates, and brought the First Punic War to a triumphant close. It</a>
<a id='line_3381'>is impossible to recount the names of these eminent citizens,</a>
<a id='line_3382'>without reflecting that they were, without exception, Plebeians,</a>
<a id='line_3383'>and would, but for the ever memorable struggle maintained by</a>
<a id='line_3384'>Caius Licinius and Lucius Sextius, have been doomed to hide in</a>
<a id='line_3385'>obscurity, or to waste in civil broils, the capacity and energy</a>
<a id='line_3386'>which prevailed against Pyrrhus and Hamilcar.</a>
<a id='line_3387'></a>
<a id='line_3388'>On such a day we may suppose that the patriotic enthusiasm of a</a>
<a id='line_3389'>Latin poet would vent itself in reiterated shouts of "Io</a>
<a id='line_3390'>triumphe," such as were uttered by Horace on a far less exciting</a>
<a id='line_3391'>occasion, and in boasts resembling those which Virgil put into</a>
<a id='line_3392'>the mouth of Anchises. The superiority of some foreign nations,</a>
<a id='line_3393'>and especially of the Greeks, in the lazy arts of peace, would be</a>
<a id='line_3394'>admitted with disdainful candor; but preëminence in all the</a>
<a id='line_3395'>qualities which fit a people to subdue and govern mankind would</a>
<a id='line_3396'>be claimed for the Romans.</a>
<a id='line_3397'></a>
<a id='line_3398'>The following lay belongs to the latest age of Latin</a>
<a id='line_3399'>ballad-poetry. Nævis and Livius Andronicus were probably among</a>
<a id='line_3400'>the children whose mothers held them up to see the chariot of</a>
<a id='line_3401'>Curius go by. The minstrel who sang on that day might possibly</a>
<a id='line_3402'>have lived to read the first hexameters of Ennius, and to see the</a>
<a id='line_3403'>first comedies of Plautus. His poem, as might be expected, shows</a>
<a id='line_3404'>a much wider acquaintance with the geography, manners, and</a>
<a id='line_3405'>productions of remote nations, than would have been found in</a>
<a id='line_3406'>compositions of the age of Camillus. But he troubles himself</a>
<a id='line_3407'>little about dates, and having heard travellers talk with</a>
<a id='line_3408'>admiration of the Colossus of Rhodes, and of the structures and</a>
<a id='line_3409'>gardens with which the Macedonian king of Syria had embellished</a>
<a id='line_3410'>their residence on the banks of the Orontes, he has never thought</a>
<a id='line_3411'>of inquiring whether these things existed in the age of Romulus.</a>
