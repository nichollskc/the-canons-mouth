                    <a id='line_0'>Chapter XII: Reigns Of Tacitus, Probus, Carus And His Sons.—Part</a>
<a id='line_1'>      I.</a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>     Conduct Of The Army And Senate After The Death Of Aurelian.</a>
<a id='line_4'>     —Reigns Of Tacitus, Probus, Carus, And His Sons.</a>
<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'>      Such was the unhappy condition of the Roman emperors, that,</a>
<a id='line_7'>      whatever might be their conduct, their fate was commonly the</a>
<a id='line_8'>      same. A life of pleasure or virtue, of severity or mildness, of</a>
<a id='line_9'>      indolence or glory, alike led to an untimely grave; and almost</a>
<a id='line_10'>      every reign is closed by the same disgusting repetition of</a>
<a id='line_11'>      treason and murder. The death of Aurelian, however, is remarkable</a>
<a id='line_12'>      by its extraordinary consequences. The legions admired, lamented,</a>
<a id='line_13'>      and revenged their victorious chief. The artifice of his</a>
<a id='line_14'>      perfidious secretary was discovered and punished.</a>
<a id='line_15'></a>
<a id='line_16'>      The deluded conspirators attended the funeral of their injured</a>
<a id='line_17'>      sovereign, with sincere or well-feigned contrition, and submitted</a>
<a id='line_18'>      to the unanimous resolution of the military order, which was</a>
<a id='line_19'>      signified by the following epistle: “The brave and fortunate</a>
<a id='line_20'>      armies to the senate and people of Rome.—The crime of one man,</a>
<a id='line_21'>      and the error of many, have deprived us of the late emperor</a>
<a id='line_22'>      Aurelian. May it please you, venerable lords and fathers! to</a>
<a id='line_23'>      place him in the number of the gods, and to appoint a successor</a>
<a id='line_24'>      whom your judgment shall declare worthy of the Imperial purple!</a>
<a id='line_25'>      None of those whose guilt or misfortune have contributed to our</a>
<a id='line_26'>      loss, shall ever reign over us.” 1 The Roman senators heard,</a>
<a id='line_27'>      without surprise, that another emperor had been assassinated in</a>
<a id='line_28'>      his camp; they secretly rejoiced in the fall of Aurelian; but the</a>
<a id='line_29'>      modest and dutiful address of the legions, when it was</a>
<a id='line_30'>      communicated in full assembly by the consul, diffused the most</a>
<a id='line_31'>      pleasing astonishment. Such honors as fear and perhaps esteem</a>
<a id='line_32'>      could extort, they liberally poured forth on the memory of their</a>
<a id='line_33'>      deceased sovereign. Such acknowledgments as gratitude could</a>
<a id='line_34'>      inspire, they returned to the faithful armies of the republic,</a>
<a id='line_35'>      who entertained so just a sense of the legal authority of the</a>
<a id='line_36'>      senate in the choice of an emperor. Yet, notwithstanding this</a>
<a id='line_37'>      flattering appeal, the most prudent of the assembly declined</a>
<a id='line_38'>      exposing their safety and dignity to the caprice of an armed</a>
<a id='line_39'>      multitude. The strength of the legions was, indeed, a pledge of</a>
<a id='line_40'>      their sincerity, since those who may command are seldom reduced</a>
<a id='line_41'>      to the necessity of dissembling; but could it naturally be</a>
<a id='line_42'>      expected, that a hasty repentance would correct the inveterate</a>
<a id='line_43'>      habits of fourscore years? Should the soldiers relapse into their</a>
<a id='line_44'>      accustomed seditions, their insolence might disgrace the majesty</a>
<a id='line_45'>      of the senate, and prove fatal to the object of its choice.</a>
<a id='line_46'>      Motives like these dictated a decree, by which the election of a</a>
<a id='line_47'>      new emperor was referred to the suffrage of the military order.</a>

<a id='line_49'>      1 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 222. Aurelius Victor</a>
<a id='line_50'>      mentions a formal deputation from the troops to the senate.]</a>
<a id='line_51'></a>
<a id='line_52'>      The contention that ensued is one of the best attested, but most</a>
<a id='line_53'>      improbable events in the history of mankind. 2 The troops, as if</a>
<a id='line_54'>      satiated with the exercise of power, again conjured the senate to</a>
<a id='line_55'>      invest one of its own body with the Imperial purple. The senate</a>
<a id='line_56'>      still persisted in its refusal; the army in its request. The</a>
<a id='line_57'>      reciprocal offer was pressed and rejected at least three times,</a>
<a id='line_58'>      and, whilst the obstinate modesty of either party was resolved to</a>
<a id='line_59'>      receive a master from the hands of the other, eight months</a>
<a id='line_60'>      insensibly elapsed; an amazing period of tranquil anarchy, during</a>
<a id='line_61'>      which the Roman world remained without a sovereign, without a</a>
<a id='line_62'>      usurper, and without a sedition. 201 The generals and magistrates</a>
<a id='line_63'>      appointed by Aurelian continued to execute their ordinary</a>
<a id='line_64'>      functions; and it is observed, that a proconsul of Asia was the</a>
<a id='line_65'>      only considerable person removed from his office in the whole</a>
<a id='line_66'>      course of the interregnum.</a>

<a id='line_69'>      sixteen years only after the death of Aurelian; and, besides the</a>
<a id='line_70'>      recent notoriety of the facts, constantly draws his materials</a>
<a id='line_71'>      from the Journals of the Senate, and the original papers of the</a>
<a id='line_72'>      Ulpian library. Zosimus and Zonaras appear as ignorant of this</a>
<a id='line_73'>      transaction as they were in general of the Roman constitution.]</a>

<a id='line_75'>      201 (return) [ The interregnum could not be more than seven</a>
<a id='line_76'>      months; Aurelian was assassinated in the middle of March, the</a>
<a id='line_77'>      year of Rome 1028. Tacitus was elected the 25th September in the</a>
<a id='line_78'>      same year.—G.]</a>
<a id='line_79'></a>
<a id='line_80'>      An event somewhat similar, but much less authentic, is supposed</a>
<a id='line_81'>      to have happened after the death of Romulus, who, in his life and</a>
<a id='line_82'>      character, bore some affinity with Aurelian. The throne was</a>
<a id='line_83'>      vacant during twelve months, till the election of a Sabine</a>
<a id='line_84'>      philosopher, and the public peace was guarded in the same manner,</a>
<a id='line_85'>      by the union of the several orders of the state. But, in the time</a>
<a id='line_86'>      of Numa and Romulus, the arms of the people were controlled by</a>
<a id='line_87'>      the authority of the Patricians; and the balance of freedom was</a>
<a id='line_88'>      easily preserved in a small and virtuous community. 3 The decline</a>
<a id='line_89'>      of the Roman state, far different from its infancy, was attended</a>
<a id='line_90'>      with every circumstance that could banish from an interregnum the</a>
<a id='line_91'>      prospect of obedience and harmony: an immense and tumultuous</a>
<a id='line_92'>      capital, a wide extent of empire, the servile equality of</a>
<a id='line_93'>      despotism, an army of four hundred thousand mercenaries, and the</a>
<a id='line_94'>      experience of frequent revolutions. Yet, notwithstanding all</a>
<a id='line_95'>      these temptations, the discipline and memory of Aurelian still</a>
<a id='line_96'>      restrained the seditious temper of the troops, as well as the</a>
<a id='line_97'>      fatal ambition of their leaders. The flower of the legions</a>
<a id='line_98'>      maintained their stations on the banks of the Bosphorus, and the</a>
<a id='line_99'>      Imperial standard awed the less powerful camps of Rome and of the</a>
<a id='line_100'>      provinces. A generous though transient enthusiasm seemed to</a>
<a id='line_101'>      animate the military order; and we may hope that a few real</a>
<a id='line_102'>      patriots cultivated the returning friendship of the army and the</a>
<a id='line_103'>      senate as the only expedient capable of restoring the republic to</a>
<a id='line_104'>      its ancient beauty and vigor.</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>      3 (return) [ Liv. i. 17 Dionys. Halicarn. l. ii. p. 115. Plutarch</a>
<a id='line_107'>      in Numa, p. 60. The first of these writers relates the story like</a>
<a id='line_108'>      an orator, the second like a lawyer, and the third like a</a>
<a id='line_109'>      moralist, and none of them probably without some intermixture of</a>
<a id='line_110'>      fable.]</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'>      On the twenty-fifth of September, near eight months after the</a>
<a id='line_113'>      murder of Aurelian, the consul convoked an assembly of the</a>
<a id='line_114'>      senate, and reported the doubtful and dangerous situation of the</a>
<a id='line_115'>      empire. He slightly insinuated, that the precarious loyalty of</a>
<a id='line_116'>      the soldiers depended on the chance of every hour, and of every</a>
<a id='line_117'>      accident; but he represented, with the most convincing eloquence,</a>
<a id='line_118'>      the various dangers that might attend any further delay in the</a>
<a id='line_119'>      choice of an emperor. Intelligence, he said, was already</a>
<a id='line_120'>      received, that the Germans had passed the Rhine, and occupied</a>
<a id='line_121'>      some of the strongest and most opulent cities of Gaul. The</a>
<a id='line_122'>      ambition of the Persian king kept the East in perpetual alarms;</a>
<a id='line_123'>      Egypt, Africa, and Illyricum, were exposed to foreign and</a>
<a id='line_124'>      domestic arms, and the levity of Syria would prefer even a female</a>
<a id='line_125'>      sceptre to the sanctity of the Roman laws. The consul, then</a>
<a id='line_126'>      addressing himself to Tacitus, the first of the senators, 4</a>
<a id='line_127'>      required his opinion on the important subject of a proper</a>
<a id='line_128'>      candidate for the vacant throne.</a>
<a id='line_129'></a>
<a id='line_130'>      4 (return) [ Vopiscus (in Hist. August p. 227) calls him “primæ</a>
<a id='line_131'>      sententia consularis;” and soon afterwards Princeps senatus. It</a>
<a id='line_132'>      is natural to suppose, that the monarchs of Rome, disdaining that</a>
<a id='line_133'>      humble title, resigned it to the most ancient of the senators.]</a>
<a id='line_134'></a>
<a id='line_135'>      If we can prefer personal merit to accidental greatness, we shall</a>
<a id='line_136'>      esteem the birth of Tacitus more truly noble than that of kings.</a>
<a id='line_137'>      He claimed his descent from the philosophic historian whose</a>
<a id='line_138'>      writings will instruct the last generations of mankind. 5 The</a>
<a id='line_139'>      senator Tacitus was then seventy-five years of age. 6 The long</a>
<a id='line_140'>      period of his innocent life was adorned with wealth and honors.</a>
<a id='line_141'>      He had twice been invested with the consular dignity, 7 and</a>
<a id='line_142'>      enjoyed with elegance and sobriety his ample patrimony of between</a>
<a id='line_143'>      two and three millions sterling. 8 The experience of so many</a>
<a id='line_144'>      princes, whom he had esteemed or endured, from the vain follies</a>
<a id='line_145'>      of Elagabalus to the useful rigor of Aurelian, taught him to form</a>
<a id='line_146'>      a just estimate of the duties, the dangers, and the temptations</a>
<a id='line_147'>      of their sublime station. From the assiduous study of his</a>
<a id='line_148'>      immortal ancestor, he derived the knowledge of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_149'>      constitution, and of human nature. 9 The voice of the people had</a>
<a id='line_150'>      already named Tacitus as the citizen the most worthy of empire.</a>
<a id='line_151'>      The ungrateful rumor reached his ears, and induced him to seek</a>
<a id='line_152'>      the retirement of one of his villas in Campania. He had passed</a>
<a id='line_153'>      two months in the delightful privacy of Baiæ, when he reluctantly</a>
<a id='line_154'>      obeyed the summons of the consul to resume his honorable place in</a>
<a id='line_155'>      the senate, and to assist the republic with his counsels on this</a>
<a id='line_156'>      important occasion.</a>
<a id='line_157'></a>
<a id='line_158'>      5 (return) [ The only objection to this genealogy is, that the</a>
<a id='line_159'>      historian was named Cornelius, the emperor, Claudius. But under</a>
<a id='line_160'>      the lower empire, surnames were extremely various and uncertain.]</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>      6 (return) [ Zonaras, l. xii. p. 637. The Alexandrian Chronicle,</a>
<a id='line_163'>      by an obvious mistake, transfers that age to Aurelian.]</a>

<a id='line_165'>      7 (return) [ In the year 273, he was ordinary consul. But he must</a>
<a id='line_166'>      have been Suffectus many years before, and most probably under</a>

<a id='line_171'>      to eight hundred and forty thousand Roman pounds of silver, each</a>
<a id='line_172'>      of the value of three pounds sterling. But in the age of Tacitus,</a>
<a id='line_173'>      the coin had lost much of its weight and purity.]</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>      9 (return) [ After his accession, he gave orders that ten copies</a>
<a id='line_176'>      of the historian should be annually transcribed and placed in the</a>
<a id='line_177'>      public libraries. The Roman libraries have long since perished,</a>
<a id='line_178'>      and the most valuable part of Tacitus was preserved in a single</a>
<a id='line_179'>      Ms., and discovered in a monastery of Westphalia. See Bayle,</a>
<a id='line_180'>      Dictionnaire, Art. Tacite, and Lipsius ad Annal. ii. 9.]</a>
<a id='line_181'></a>
<a id='line_182'>      He arose to speak, when from every quarter of the house, he was</a>
<a id='line_183'>      saluted with the names of Augustus and emperor. “Tacitus</a>
<a id='line_184'>      Augustus, the gods preserve thee! we choose thee for our</a>
<a id='line_185'>      sovereign; to thy care we intrust the republic and the world.</a>
<a id='line_186'>      Accept the empire from the authority of the senate. It is due to</a>
<a id='line_187'>      thy rank, to thy conduct, to thy manners.” As soon as the tumult</a>
<a id='line_188'>      of acclamations subsided, Tacitus attempted to decline the</a>
<a id='line_189'>      dangerous honor, and to express his wonder, that they should</a>
<a id='line_190'>      elect his age and infirmities to succeed the martial vigor of</a>
<a id='line_191'>      Aurelian. “Are these limbs, conscript fathers! fitted to sustain</a>
<a id='line_192'>      the weight of armor, or to practise the exercises of the camp?</a>
<a id='line_193'>      The variety of climates, and the hardships of a military life,</a>
<a id='line_194'>      would soon oppress a feeble constitution, which subsists only by</a>
<a id='line_195'>      the most tender management. My exhausted strength scarcely</a>
<a id='line_196'>      enables me to discharge the duty of a senator; how insufficient</a>
<a id='line_197'>      would it prove to the arduous labors of war and government! Can</a>
<a id='line_198'>      you hope, that the legions will respect a weak old man, whose</a>
<a id='line_199'>      days have been spent in the shade of peace and retirement? Can</a>
<a id='line_200'>      you desire that I should ever find reason to regret the favorable</a>
<a id='line_201'>      opinion of the senate?” 10</a>
<a id='line_202'></a>
<a id='line_203'>      10 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 227.]</a>
<a id='line_204'></a>
<a id='line_205'>      The reluctance of Tacitus (and it might possibly be sincere) was</a>
<a id='line_206'>      encountered by the affectionate obstinacy of the senate. Five</a>
<a id='line_207'>      hundred voices repeated at once, in eloquent confusion, that the</a>
<a id='line_208'>      greatest of the Roman princes, Numa, Trajan, Hadrian, and the</a>
<a id='line_209'>      Antonines, had ascended the throne in a very advanced season of</a>
<a id='line_210'>      life; that the mind, not the body, a sovereign, not a soldier,</a>
<a id='line_211'>      was the object of their choice; and that they expected from him</a>
<a id='line_212'>      no more than to guide by his wisdom the valor of the legions.</a>
<a id='line_213'>      These pressing though tumultuary instances were seconded by a</a>
<a id='line_214'>      more regular oration of Metius Falconius, the next on the</a>
<a id='line_215'>      consular bench to Tacitus himself. He reminded the assembly of</a>
<a id='line_216'>      the evils which Rome had endured from the vices of headstrong and</a>
<a id='line_217'>      capricious youths, congratulated them on the election of a</a>
<a id='line_218'>      virtuous and experienced senator, and, with a manly, though</a>
<a id='line_219'>      perhaps a selfish, freedom, exhorted Tacitus to remember the</a>
<a id='line_220'>      reasons of his elevation, and to seek a successor, not in his own</a>
<a id='line_221'>      family, but in the republic. The speech of Falconius was enforced</a>
<a id='line_222'>      by a general acclamation. The emperor elect submitted to the</a>
<a id='line_223'>      authority of his country, and received the voluntary homage of</a>
<a id='line_224'>      his equals. The judgment of the senate was confirmed by the</a>
<a id='line_225'>      consent of the Roman people and of the Prætorian guards. 11</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>      11 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 228. Tacitus addressed the</a>
<a id='line_228'>      Prætorians by the appellation of sanctissimi milites, and the</a>
<a id='line_229'>      people by that of sacratissim. Quirites.]</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>      The administration of Tacitus was not unworthy of his life and</a>
<a id='line_232'>      principles. A grateful servant of the senate, he considered that</a>
<a id='line_233'>      national council as the author, and himself as the subject, of</a>
<a id='line_234'>      the laws. 12 He studied to heal the wounds which Imperial pride,</a>
<a id='line_235'>      civil discord, and military violence, had inflicted on the</a>
<a id='line_236'>      constitution, and to restore, at least, the image of the ancient</a>
<a id='line_237'>      republic, as it had been preserved by the policy of Augustus, and</a>
<a id='line_238'>      the virtues of Trajan and the Antonines. It may not be useless to</a>
<a id='line_239'>      recapitulate some of the most important prerogatives which the</a>
<a id='line_240'>      senate appeared to have regained by the election of Tacitus. 13</a>
<a id='line_241'>      1. To invest one of their body, under the title of emperor, with</a>
<a id='line_242'>      the general command of the armies, and the government of the</a>
<a id='line_243'>      frontier provinces. 2. To determine the list, or, as it was then</a>
<a id='line_244'>      styled, the College of Consuls. They were twelve in number, who,</a>
<a id='line_245'>      in successive pairs, each, during the space of two months, filled</a>
<a id='line_246'>      the year, and represented the dignity of that ancient office. The</a>
<a id='line_247'>      authority of the senate, in the nomination of the consuls, was</a>
<a id='line_248'>      exercised with such independent freedom, that no regard was paid</a>
<a id='line_249'>      to an irregular request of the emperor in favor of his brother</a>
<a id='line_250'>      Florianus. “The senate,” exclaimed Tacitus, with the honest</a>
<a id='line_251'>      transport of a patriot, “understand the character of a prince</a>
<a id='line_252'>      whom they have chosen.” 3. To appoint the proconsuls and</a>
<a id='line_253'>      presidents of the provinces, and to confer on all the magistrates</a>
<a id='line_254'>      their civil jurisdiction. 4. To receive appeals through the</a>
<a id='line_255'>      intermediate office of the præfect of the city from all the</a>
<a id='line_256'>      tribunals of the empire. 5. To give force and validity, by their</a>

<a id='line_449'>      of tribune, long before the age prescribed by the military</a>
<a id='line_450'>      regulations. The tribune soon justified his choice, by a victory</a>
<a id='line_451'>      over a great body of Sarmatians, in which he saved the life of a</a>
<a id='line_452'>      near relation of Valerian; and deserved to receive from the</a>

<a id='line_458'>      station which he filled. Africa and Pontus, the Rhine, the</a>

<a id='line_460'>      most splendid occasions of displaying his personal prowess and</a>
<a id='line_461'>      his conduct in war. Aurelian was indebted for the honest courage</a>

<a id='line_468'>      age; 24 in the full possession of his fame, of the love of the</a>

<a id='line_483'>      must continue to personate the character which the soldiers have</a>
<a id='line_484'>      imposed upon me.” 25 His dutiful address to the senate displayed</a>
<a id='line_485'>      the sentiments, or at least the language, of a Roman patriot:</a>
<a id='line_486'>      “When you elected one of your order, conscript fathers! to</a>
<a id='line_487'>      succeed the emperor Aurelian, you acted in a manner suitable to</a>
<a id='line_488'>      your justice and wisdom. For you are the legal sovereigns of the</a>
<a id='line_489'>      world, and the power which you derive from your ancestors will</a>
<a id='line_490'>      descend to your posterity. Happy would it have been, if</a>
<a id='line_491'>      Florianus, instead of usurping the purple of his brother, like a</a>
<a id='line_492'>      private inheritance, had expected what your majesty might</a>
<a id='line_493'>      determine, either in his favor, or in that of any other person.</a>
<a id='line_494'>      The prudent soldiers have punished his rashness. To me they have</a>
<a id='line_495'>      offered the title of Augustus. But I submit to your clemency my</a>
<a id='line_496'>      pretensions and my merits.” 26 When this respectful epistle was</a>
<a id='line_497'>      read by the consul, the senators were unable to disguise their</a>
<a id='line_498'>      satisfaction, that Probus should condescend thus numbly to</a>
<a id='line_499'>      solicit a sceptre which he already possessed. They celebrated</a>
<a id='line_500'>      with the warmest gratitude his virtues, his exploits, and above</a>
<a id='line_501'>      all his moderation. A decree immediately passed, without a</a>
<a id='line_502'>      dissenting voice, to ratify the election of the eastern armies,</a>
<a id='line_503'>      and to confer on their chief all the several branches of the</a>
<a id='line_504'>      Imperial dignity: the names of Cæsar and Augustus, the title of</a>
<a id='line_505'>      Father of his country, the right of making in the same day three</a>
<a id='line_506'>      motions in the senate, 27 the office of Pontifex Maximus, the</a>
<a id='line_507'>      tribunitian power, and the proconsular command; a mode of</a>
<a id='line_508'>      investiture, which, though it seemed to multiply the authority of</a>
<a id='line_509'>      the emperor, expressed the constitution of the ancient republic.</a>
<a id='line_510'>      The reign of Probus corresponded with this fair beginning. The</a>
<a id='line_511'>      senate was permitted to direct the civil administration of the</a>
<a id='line_512'>      empire. Their faithful general asserted the honor of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_513'>      arms, and often laid at their feet crowns of gold and barbaric</a>
<a id='line_514'>      trophies, the fruits of his numerous victories. 28 Yet, whilst he</a>

<a id='line_601'>      we may distinguish, with some degree of clearness, three great</a>
<a id='line_602'>      armies, or rather nations, successively vanquished by the valor</a>

<a id='line_605'>      confederacy known by the manly appellation of _Free_, already</a>
<a id='line_606'>      occupied the flat maritime country, intersected and almost</a>
<a id='line_607'>      overflown by the stagnating waters of the Rhine, and that several</a>
<a id='line_608'>      tribes of the Frisians and Batavians had acceded to their</a>
<a id='line_609'>      alliance. He vanquished the Burgundians, a considerable people of</a>
<a id='line_610'>      the Vandalic race. 341 They had wandered in quest of booty from</a>
<a id='line_611'>      the banks of the Oder to those of the Seine. They esteemed</a>
<a id='line_612'>      themselves sufficiently fortunate to purchase, by the restitution</a>
<a id='line_613'>      of all their booty, the permission of an undisturbed retreat.</a>
<a id='line_614'>      They attempted to elude that article of the treaty. Their</a>
<a id='line_615'>      punishment was immediate and terrible. 35 But of all the invaders</a>
<a id='line_616'>      of Gaul, the most formidable were the Lygians, a distant people,</a>
<a id='line_617'>      who reigned over a wide domain on the frontiers of Poland and</a>
<a id='line_618'>      Silesia. 36 In the Lygian nation, the Arii held the first rank by</a>
<a id='line_619'>      their numbers and fierceness. “The Arii” (it is thus that they</a>
<a id='line_620'>      are described by the energy of Tacitus) “study to improve by art</a>
<a id='line_621'>      and circumstances the innate terrors of their barbarism. Their</a>
<a id='line_622'>      shields are black, their bodies are painted black. They choose</a>
<a id='line_623'>      for the combat the darkest hour of the night. Their host</a>
<a id='line_624'>      advances, covered as it were with a funeral shade; 37 nor do they</a>
<a id='line_625'>      often find an enemy capable of sustaining so strange and infernal</a>
<a id='line_626'>      an aspect. Of all our senses, the eyes are the first vanquished</a>
<a id='line_627'>      in battle.” 38 Yet the arms and discipline of the Romans easily</a>
<a id='line_628'>      discomfited these horrid phantoms. The Lygii were defeated in a</a>
<a id='line_629'>      general engagement, and Semno, the most renowned of their chiefs,</a>
<a id='line_630'>      fell alive into the hands of Probus. That prudent emperor,</a>
<a id='line_631'>      unwilling to reduce a brave people to despair, granted them an</a>
<a id='line_632'>      honorable capitulation, and permitted them to return in safety to</a>
<a id='line_633'>      their native country. But the losses which they suffered in the</a>
<a id='line_634'>      march, the battle, and the retreat, broke the power of the</a>
<a id='line_635'>      nation: nor is the Lygian name ever repeated in the history</a>
<a id='line_636'>      either of Germany or of the empire. The deliverance of Gaul is</a>
<a id='line_637'>      reported to have cost the lives of four hundred thousand of the</a>
<a id='line_638'>      invaders; a work of labor to the Romans, and of expense to the</a>

<a id='line_689'>      who perpetually pressed on the frontiers of the empire. The more</a>
<a id='line_690'>      daring Probus pursued his Gallic victories, passed the Rhine, and</a>
<a id='line_691'>      displayed his invincible eagles on the banks of the Elbe and the</a>
<a id='line_692'>      Neckar. He was fully convinced that nothing could reconcile the</a>
<a id='line_693'>      minds of the barbarians to peace, unless they experienced, in</a>
<a id='line_694'>      their own country, the calamities of war. Germany, exhausted by</a>
<a id='line_695'>      the ill success of the last emigration, was astonished by his</a>
<a id='line_696'>      presence. Nine of the most considerable princes repaired to his</a>
<a id='line_697'>      camp, and fell prostrate at his feet. Such a treaty was humbly</a>
<a id='line_698'>      received by the Germans, as it pleased the conqueror to dictate.</a>
<a id='line_699'>      He exacted a strict restitution of the effects and captives which</a>
<a id='line_700'>      they had carried away from the provinces; and obliged their own</a>
<a id='line_701'>      magistrates to punish the more obstinate robbers who presumed to</a>

<a id='line_709'>      residence of an Imperial governor, supported by a numerous army,</a>

<a id='line_712'>      indeed rather of specious than solid utility. 40 Had Germany been</a>

<a id='line_721'></a>
<a id='line_722'>      Instead of reducing the warlike natives of Germany to the</a>
<a id='line_723'>      condition of subjects, Probus contented himself with the humble</a>
<a id='line_724'>      expedient of raising a bulwark against their inroads. The country</a>
<a id='line_725'>      which now forms the circle of Swabia had been left desert in the</a>
<a id='line_726'>      age of Augustus by the emigration of its ancient inhabitants. 41</a>
<a id='line_727'>      The fertility of the soil soon attracted a new colony from the</a>
<a id='line_728'>      adjacent provinces of Gaul. Crowds of adventurers, of a roving</a>
<a id='line_729'>      temper and of desperate fortunes, occupied the doubtful</a>
<a id='line_730'>      possession, and acknowledged, by the payment of tithes, the</a>
<a id='line_731'>      majesty of the empire. 42 To protect these new subjects, a line</a>
<a id='line_732'>      of frontier garrisons was gradually extended from the Rhine to</a>
<a id='line_733'>      the Danube. About the reign of Hadrian, when that mode of defence</a>
<a id='line_734'>      began to be practised, these garrisons were connected and covered</a>
<a id='line_735'>      by a strong intrenchment of trees and palisades. In the place of</a>
<a id='line_736'>      so rude a bulwark, the emperor Probus constructed a stone wall of</a>
<a id='line_737'>      a considerable height, and strengthened it by towers at</a>
<a id='line_738'>      convenient distances. From the neighborhood of Neustadt and</a>
<a id='line_739'>      Ratisbon on the Danube, it stretched across hills, valleys,</a>
<a id='line_740'>      rivers, and morasses, as far as Wimpfen on the Neckar, and at</a>
<a id='line_741'>      length terminated on the banks of the Rhine, after a winding</a>
<a id='line_742'>      course of near two hundred miles. 43 This important barrier,</a>
<a id='line_743'>      uniting the two mighty streams that protected the provinces of</a>
<a id='line_744'>      Europe, seemed to fill up the vacant space through which the</a>
<a id='line_745'>      barbarians, and particularly the Alemanni, could penetrate with</a>
<a id='line_746'>      the greatest facility into the heart of the empire. But the</a>
<a id='line_747'>      experience of the world, from China to Britain, has exposed the</a>
<a id='line_748'>      vain attempt of fortifying any extensive tract of country. 44 An</a>
<a id='line_749'>      active enemy, who can select and vary his points of attack, must,</a>

<a id='line_805'>      infrequency of marriage, and the ruin of agriculture, affected</a>
<a id='line_806'>      the principles of population, and not only destroyed the strength</a>
<a id='line_807'>      of the present, but intercepted the hope of future, generations.</a>
<a id='line_808'>      The wisdom of Probus embraced a great and beneficial plan of</a>
<a id='line_809'>      replenishing the exhausted frontiers, by new colonies of captive</a>
<a id='line_810'>      or fugitive barbarians, on whom he bestowed lands, cattle,</a>

<a id='line_877'>      Notwithstanding the vigilance and activity of Probus, it was</a>

<a id='line_881'>      domestic war. When the emperor marched to the relief of Gaul, he</a>
<a id='line_882'>      devolved the command of the East on Saturninus. That general, a</a>
<a id='line_883'>      man of merit and experience, was driven into rebellion by the</a>

<a id='line_885'>      the pressing instances of his friends, and his own fears; but</a>
<a id='line_886'>      from the moment of his elevation, he never entertained a hope of</a>
<a id='line_887'>      empire, or even of life. “Alas!” he said, “the republic has lost</a>
<a id='line_888'>      a useful servant, and the rashness of an hour has destroyed the</a>
<a id='line_889'>      services of many years. You know not,” continued he, “the misery</a>
<a id='line_890'>      of sovereign power; a sword is perpetually suspended over our</a>
<a id='line_891'>      head. We dread our very guards, we distrust our companions. The</a>

<a id='line_898'>      verified by the victory, so the latter was disappointed by the</a>
<a id='line_899'>      clemency, of Probus. That amiable prince attempted even to save</a>
<a id='line_900'>      the unhappy Saturninus from the fury of the soldiers. He had more</a>

<a id='line_1309'>      and, as it were, natural. Born and educated in a private station,</a>
<a id='line_1310'>      the election of their father raised them at once to the rank of</a>
<a id='line_1311'>      princes; and his death, which happened about sixteen months</a>

<a id='line_1313'>      sustain with temper this rapid elevation, an uncommon share of</a>
<a id='line_1314'>      virtue and prudence was requisite; and Carinus, the elder of the</a>

<a id='line_1316'>      the Gallic war he discovered some degree of personal courage; 80</a>
<a id='line_1317'>      but from the moment of his arrival at Rome, he abandoned himself</a>
<a id='line_1318'>      to the luxury of the capital, and to the abuse of his fortune. He</a>
<a id='line_1319'>      was soft, yet cruel; devoted to pleasure, but destitute of taste;</a>
<a id='line_1320'>      and though exquisitely susceptible of vanity, indifferent to the</a>
<a id='line_1321'>      public esteem. In the course of a few months, he successively</a>
<a id='line_1322'>      married and divorced nine wives, most of whom he left pregnant;</a>
<a id='line_1323'>      and notwithstanding this legal inconstancy, found time to indulge</a>
<a id='line_1324'>      such a variety of irregular appetites, as brought dishonor on</a>
<a id='line_1325'>      himself and on the noblest houses of Rome. He beheld with</a>
<a id='line_1326'>      inveterate hatred all those who might remember his former</a>
<a id='line_1327'>      obscurity, or censure his present conduct. He banished, or put to</a>
<a id='line_1328'>      death, the friends and counsellors whom his father had placed</a>
<a id='line_1329'>      about him, to guide his inexperienced youth; and he persecuted</a>

<a id='line_1332'></a>
<a id='line_1333'>      With the senators, Carinus affected a lofty and regal demeanor,</a>

<a id='line_1567'>      union would have proved of any long duration. The jealousy of</a>
<a id='line_1568'>      power must have been inflamed by the opposition of characters. In</a>
<a id='line_1569'>      the most corrupt of times, Carinus was unworthy to live: Numerian</a>
<a id='line_1570'>      deserved to reign in a happier period. His affable manners and</a>
<a id='line_1571'>      gentle virtues secured him, as soon as they became known, the</a>
<a id='line_1572'>      regard and affections of the public. He possessed the elegant</a>
<a id='line_1573'>      accomplishments of a poet and orator, which dignify as well as</a>
<a id='line_1574'>      adorn the humblest and the most exalted station. His eloquence,</a>
<a id='line_1575'>      however it was applauded by the senate, was formed not so much on</a>

<a id='line_1580'>      circumstance which evinces either the goodness of his heart, or</a>
<a id='line_1581'>      the superiority of his genius. 101 But the talents of Numerian</a>
<a id='line_1582'>      were rather of the contemplative than of the active kind. When</a>
<a id='line_1583'>      his father’s elevation reluctantly forced him from the shade of</a>
<a id='line_1584'>      retirement, neither his temper nor his pursuits had qualified him</a>

<a id='line_1614'>      Roman army, returning by slow marches from the banks of the</a>

<a id='line_1617'>      Heraclea, on the European side of the Propontis. 104 But a report</a>
<a id='line_1618'>      soon circulated through the camp, at first in secret whispers,</a>
<a id='line_1619'>      and at length in loud clamors, of the emperor’s death, and of the</a>

<a id='line_1622'>      impatience of the soldiers could not long support a state of</a>
<a id='line_1623'>      suspense. With rude curiosity they broke into the Imperial tent,</a>
<a id='line_1624'>      and discovered only the corpse of Numerian. 105 The gradual</a>
<a id='line_1625'>      decline of his health might have induced them to believe that his</a>
<a id='line_1626'>      death was natural; but the concealment was interpreted as an</a>
<a id='line_1627'>      evidence of guilt, and the measures which Aper had taken to</a>
<a id='line_1628'>      secure his election became the immediate occasion of his ruin.</a>
<a id='line_1629'>      Yet, even in the transport of their rage and grief, the troops</a>
<a id='line_1630'>      observed a regular proceeding, which proves how firmly discipline</a>
<a id='line_1631'>      had been reëstablished by the martial successors of Gallienus. A</a>
<a id='line_1632'>      general assembly of the army was appointed to be held at</a>
<a id='line_1633'>      Chalcedon, whither Aper was transported in chains, as a prisoner</a>
<a id='line_1634'>      and a criminal. A vacant tribunal was erected in the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_1635'>      camp, and the generals and tribunes formed a great military</a>
<a id='line_1636'>      council. They soon announced to the multitude that their choice</a>
<a id='line_1637'>      had fallen on Diocletian, commander of the domestics or</a>
<a id='line_1638'>      body-guards, as the person the most capable of revenging and</a>
<a id='line_1639'>      succeeding their beloved emperor. The future fortunes of the</a>
<a id='line_1640'>      candidate depended on the chance or conduct of the present hour.</a>
<a id='line_1641'>      Conscious that the station which he had filled exposed him to</a>
<a id='line_1642'>      some suspicions, Diocletian ascended the tribunal, and raising</a>
<a id='line_1643'>      his eyes towards the Sun, made a solemn profession of his own</a>
<a id='line_1644'>      innocence, in the presence of that all-seeing Deity. 106 Then,</a>
<a id='line_1645'>      assuming the tone of a sovereign and a judge, he commanded that</a>
<a id='line_1646'>      Aper should be brought in chains to the foot of the tribunal.</a>
<a id='line_1647'>      “This man,” said he, “is the murderer of Numerian;” and without</a>
<a id='line_1648'>      giving him time to enter on a dangerous justification, drew his</a>

<a id='line_1677'>      cruel arrogance, of the son. The hearts of the people were</a>
<a id='line_1678'>      engaged in favor of his rival, and even the senate was inclined</a>
<a id='line_1679'>      to prefer a usurper to a tyrant. The arts of Diocletian inflamed</a>
<a id='line_1680'>      the general discontent; and the winter was employed in secret</a>

<a id='line_1688'>      broken, and, for a moment, Diocletian despaired of the purple and</a>

<a id='line_1690'>      valor of his soldiers, he quickly lost by the infidelity of his</a>
