<a id='line_86'></a>
<a id='line_87'>PROLOGUE</a>
<a id='line_88'></a>
<a id='line_89'>In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece</a>
<a id='line_90'>The princes orgulous, their high blood chaf’d,</a>
<a id='line_91'>Have to the port of Athens sent their ships</a>
<a id='line_92'>Fraught with the ministers and instruments</a>
<a id='line_93'>Of cruel war. Sixty and nine that wore</a>
<a id='line_94'>Their crownets regal from the Athenian bay</a>
<a id='line_95'>Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made</a>
<a id='line_96'>To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures</a>
<a id='line_97'>The ravish’d Helen, Menelaus’ queen,</a>
<a id='line_98'>With wanton Paris sleeps—and that’s the quarrel.</a>
<a id='line_99'>To Tenedos they come,</a>
<a id='line_100'>And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge</a>
<a id='line_101'>Their war-like fraughtage. Now on Dardan plains</a>
<a id='line_102'>The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch</a>
<a id='line_103'>Their brave pavilions: Priam’s six-gated city,</a>
<a id='line_104'>Dardan, and Tymbria, Ilias, Chetas, Troien,</a>
<a id='line_105'>And Antenorides, with massy staples</a>
<a id='line_106'>And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,</a>
<a id='line_107'>Stir up the sons of Troy.</a>
<a id='line_108'>Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits</a>
<a id='line_109'>On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,</a>
<a id='line_110'>Sets all on hazard. And hither am I come</a>
<a id='line_111'>A prologue arm’d, but not in confidence</a>
<a id='line_112'>Of author’s pen or actor’s voice, but suited</a>
<a id='line_113'>In like conditions as our argument,</a>
<a id='line_114'>To tell you, fair beholders, that our play</a>
<a id='line_115'>Leaps o’er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,</a>
<a id='line_116'>Beginning in the middle; starting thence away,</a>
<a id='line_117'>To what may be digested in a play.</a>
<a id='line_118'>Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are;</a>
<a id='line_119'>Now good or bad, ’tis but the chance of war.</a>
<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'></a>
<a id='line_123'>ACT I</a>
<a id='line_124'></a>
<a id='line_125'>SCENE I. Troy. Before PRIAM’S palace.</a>
<a id='line_126'></a>
<a id='line_127'> Enter Troilus armed, and Pandarus.</a>
<a id='line_128'></a>
<a id='line_129'>TROILUS.</a>
<a id='line_130'>Call here my varlet; I’ll unarm again.</a>
<a id='line_131'>Why should I war without the walls of Troy</a>
<a id='line_132'>That find such cruel battle here within?</a>
<a id='line_133'>Each Trojan that is master of his heart,</a>
<a id='line_134'>Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_137'>Will this gear ne’er be mended?</a>
<a id='line_138'></a>
<a id='line_139'>TROILUS.</a>
<a id='line_140'>The Greeks are strong, and skilful to their strength,</a>
<a id='line_141'>Fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant;</a>
<a id='line_142'>But I am weaker than a woman’s tear,</a>
<a id='line_143'>Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,</a>
<a id='line_144'>Less valiant than the virgin in the night,</a>
<a id='line_145'>And skilless as unpractis’d infancy.</a>
<a id='line_146'></a>
<a id='line_147'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_148'>Well, I have told you enough of this; for my part, I’ll not meddle nor</a>
<a id='line_149'>make no farther. He that will have a cake out of the wheat must tarry</a>
<a id='line_150'>the grinding.</a>
<a id='line_151'></a>
<a id='line_152'>TROILUS.</a>
<a id='line_153'>Have I not tarried?</a>
<a id='line_154'></a>
<a id='line_155'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_156'>Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.</a>
<a id='line_157'></a>
<a id='line_158'>TROILUS.</a>
<a id='line_159'>Have I not tarried?</a>
<a id='line_160'></a>
<a id='line_161'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_162'>Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>TROILUS.</a>
<a id='line_165'>Still have I tarried.</a>
<a id='line_166'></a>
<a id='line_167'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_168'>Ay, to the leavening; but here’s yet in the word ‘hereafter’ the</a>
<a id='line_169'>kneading, the making of the cake, the heating of the oven, and the</a>
<a id='line_170'>baking; nay, you must stay the cooling too, or you may chance burn your</a>
<a id='line_171'>lips.</a>
<a id='line_172'></a>
<a id='line_173'>TROILUS.</a>
<a id='line_174'>Patience herself, what goddess e’er she be,</a>
<a id='line_175'>Doth lesser blench at suff’rance than I do.</a>
<a id='line_176'>At Priam’s royal table do I sit;</a>
<a id='line_177'>And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,</a>
<a id='line_178'>So, traitor! ‘when she comes’! when she is thence?</a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_181'>Well, she look’d yesternight fairer than ever I saw her look, or any</a>
<a id='line_182'>woman else.</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>TROILUS.</a>
<a id='line_185'>I was about to tell thee: when my heart,</a>
<a id='line_186'>As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,</a>
<a id='line_187'>Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,</a>
<a id='line_188'>I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,</a>
<a id='line_189'>Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile.</a>
<a id='line_190'>But sorrow that is couch’d in seeming gladness</a>
<a id='line_191'>Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.</a>
<a id='line_192'></a>
<a id='line_193'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_194'>An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen’s, well, go to, there</a>
<a id='line_195'>were no more comparison between the women. But, for my part, she is my</a>
<a id='line_196'>kinswoman; I would not, as they term it, praise her, but I would</a>
<a id='line_197'>somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I will not dispraise</a>
<a id='line_198'>your sister Cassandra’s wit; but—</a>
<a id='line_199'></a>
<a id='line_200'>TROILUS.</a>
<a id='line_201'>O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,</a>
<a id='line_202'>When I do tell thee there my hopes lie drown’d,</a>
<a id='line_203'>Reply not in how many fathoms deep</a>
<a id='line_204'>They lie indrench’d. I tell thee I am mad</a>
<a id='line_205'>In Cressid’s love. Thou answer’st ‘She is fair’;</a>
<a id='line_206'>Pour’st in the open ulcer of my heart</a>
<a id='line_207'>Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,</a>
<a id='line_208'>Handlest in thy discourse. O! that her hand,</a>
<a id='line_209'>In whose comparison all whites are ink</a>
<a id='line_210'>Writing their own reproach; to whose soft seizure</a>
<a id='line_211'>The cygnet’s down is harsh, and spirit of sense</a>
<a id='line_212'>Hard as the palm of ploughman! This thou tell’st me,</a>
<a id='line_213'>As true thou tell’st me, when I say I love her;</a>
<a id='line_214'>But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,</a>
<a id='line_215'>Thou lay’st in every gash that love hath given me</a>
<a id='line_216'>The knife that made it.</a>
<a id='line_217'></a>
<a id='line_218'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_219'>I speak no more than truth.</a>
<a id='line_220'></a>
<a id='line_221'>TROILUS.</a>
<a id='line_222'>Thou dost not speak so much.</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_225'>Faith, I’ll not meddle in’t. Let her be as she is: if she be fair, ’tis</a>
<a id='line_226'>the better for her; and she be not, she has the mends in her own hands.</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>TROILUS.</a>
<a id='line_229'>Good Pandarus! How now, Pandarus!</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_232'>I have had my labour for my travail, ill thought on of her and ill</a>
<a id='line_233'>thought on of you; gone between and between, but small thanks for my</a>
<a id='line_234'>labour.</a>
<a id='line_235'></a>
<a id='line_236'>TROILUS.</a>
<a id='line_237'>What! art thou angry, Pandarus? What! with me?</a>
<a id='line_238'></a>
<a id='line_239'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_240'>Because she’s kin to me, therefore she’s not so fair as Helen. And she</a>
<a id='line_241'>were not kin to me, she would be as fair on Friday as Helen is on</a>
<a id='line_242'>Sunday. But what care I? I care not and she were a blackamoor; ’tis all</a>
<a id='line_243'>one to me.</a>
<a id='line_244'></a>
<a id='line_245'>TROILUS.</a>
<a id='line_246'>Say I she is not fair?</a>
<a id='line_247'></a>
<a id='line_248'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_249'>I do not care whether you do or no. She’s a fool to stay behind her</a>
<a id='line_250'>father. Let her to the Greeks; and so I’ll tell her the next time I see</a>
<a id='line_251'>her. For my part, I’ll meddle nor make no more i’ the matter.</a>
<a id='line_252'></a>
<a id='line_253'>TROILUS.</a>
<a id='line_254'>Pandarus—</a>
<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_257'>Not I.</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>TROILUS.</a>
<a id='line_260'>Sweet Pandarus—</a>
<a id='line_261'></a>
<a id='line_262'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_263'>Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I found it, and</a>
<a id='line_264'>there an end.</a>
<a id='line_265'></a>
<a id='line_266'> [_Exit Pandarus. An alarum._]</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>TROILUS.</a>
<a id='line_269'>Peace, you ungracious clamours! Peace, rude sounds!</a>
<a id='line_270'>Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,</a>
<a id='line_271'>When with your blood you daily paint her thus.</a>
<a id='line_272'>I cannot fight upon this argument;</a>
<a id='line_273'>It is too starv’d a subject for my sword.</a>
<a id='line_274'>But Pandarus, O gods! how do you plague me!</a>
<a id='line_275'>I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;</a>
<a id='line_276'>And he’s as tetchy to be woo’d to woo</a>
<a id='line_277'>As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.</a>
<a id='line_278'>Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne’s love,</a>
<a id='line_279'>What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?</a>
<a id='line_280'>Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl;</a>
<a id='line_281'>Between our Ilium and where she resides</a>
<a id='line_282'>Let it be call’d the wild and wandering flood;</a>
<a id='line_283'>Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar</a>
<a id='line_284'>Our doubtful hope, our convoy, and our bark.</a>

<a id='line_290'></a>
<a id='line_291'>TROILUS.</a>
<a id='line_292'>Because not there. This woman’s answer sorts,</a>
<a id='line_293'>For womanish it is to be from thence.</a>
<a id='line_294'>What news, Aeneas, from the field today?</a>
<a id='line_295'></a>
<a id='line_296'>AENEAS.</a>
<a id='line_297'>That Paris is returned home, and hurt.</a>

<a id='line_340'>Up to the eastern tower,</a>
<a id='line_341'>Whose height commands as subject all the vale,</a>
<a id='line_342'>To see the battle. Hector, whose patience</a>
<a id='line_343'>Is as a virtue fix’d, today was mov’d.</a>
<a id='line_344'>He chid Andromache, and struck his armourer;</a>
<a id='line_345'>And, like as there were husbandry in war,</a>
<a id='line_346'>Before the sun rose he was harness’d light,</a>
<a id='line_347'>And to the field goes he; where every flower</a>
<a id='line_348'>Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw</a>

<a id='line_354'>ALEXANDER.</a>
<a id='line_355'>The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks</a>

<a id='line_363'>They say he is a very man _per se_</a>

<a id='line_365'></a>
<a id='line_366'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_367'>So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.</a>
<a id='line_368'></a>
<a id='line_369'>ALEXANDER.</a>
<a id='line_370'>This man, lady, hath robb’d many beasts of their particular additions:</a>
<a id='line_371'>he is as valiant as the lion, churlish as the bear, slow as the</a>
<a id='line_372'>elephant—a man into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his valour</a>
<a id='line_373'>is crush’d into folly, his folly sauced with discretion. There is no</a>
<a id='line_374'>man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint</a>
<a id='line_375'>but he carries some stain of it; he is melancholy without cause and</a>

<a id='line_377'>everything so out of joint that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and</a>

<a id='line_379'></a>
<a id='line_380'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_381'>But how should this man, that makes me smile, make Hector angry?</a>
<a id='line_382'></a>
<a id='line_383'>ALEXANDER.</a>
<a id='line_384'>They say he yesterday cop’d Hector in the battle and struck him down,</a>
<a id='line_385'>the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting and</a>
<a id='line_386'>waking.</a>
<a id='line_387'></a>
<a id='line_388'> Enter Pandarus.</a>
<a id='line_389'></a>
<a id='line_390'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_391'>Who comes here?</a>
<a id='line_392'></a>
<a id='line_393'>ALEXANDER.</a>
<a id='line_394'>Madam, your uncle Pandarus.</a>
<a id='line_395'></a>
<a id='line_396'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_397'>Hector’s a gallant man.</a>
<a id='line_398'></a>
<a id='line_399'>ALEXANDER.</a>
<a id='line_400'>As may be in the world, lady.</a>
<a id='line_401'></a>
<a id='line_402'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_403'>What’s that? What’s that?</a>
<a id='line_404'></a>
<a id='line_405'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_406'>Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.</a>
<a id='line_407'></a>
<a id='line_408'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_409'>Good morrow, cousin Cressid. What do you talk of?—Good morrow,</a>
<a id='line_410'>Alexander.—How do you, cousin? When were you at Ilium?</a>
<a id='line_411'></a>
<a id='line_412'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_413'>This morning, uncle.</a>
<a id='line_414'></a>
<a id='line_415'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_416'>What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector arm’d and gone ere you</a>
<a id='line_417'>came to Ilium? Helen was not up, was she?</a>
<a id='line_418'></a>
<a id='line_419'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_420'>Hector was gone; but Helen was not up.</a>
<a id='line_421'></a>
<a id='line_422'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_423'>E’en so. Hector was stirring early.</a>
<a id='line_424'></a>
<a id='line_425'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_426'>That were we talking of, and of his anger.</a>
<a id='line_427'></a>
<a id='line_428'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_429'>Was he angry?</a>
<a id='line_430'></a>
<a id='line_431'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_432'>So he says here.</a>
<a id='line_433'></a>
<a id='line_434'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_435'>True, he was so; I know the cause too; he’ll lay about him today, I can</a>
<a id='line_436'>tell them that. And there’s Troilus will not come far behind him; let</a>
<a id='line_437'>them take heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.</a>
<a id='line_438'></a>
<a id='line_439'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_440'>What, is he angry too?</a>
<a id='line_441'></a>
<a id='line_442'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_443'>Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.</a>
<a id='line_444'></a>
<a id='line_445'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_446'>O Jupiter! there’s no comparison.</a>
<a id='line_447'></a>
<a id='line_448'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_449'>What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a man if you see him?</a>
<a id='line_450'></a>
<a id='line_451'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_452'>Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.</a>
<a id='line_453'></a>
<a id='line_454'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_455'>Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.</a>
<a id='line_456'></a>
<a id='line_457'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_458'>Then you say as I say, for I am sure he is not Hector.</a>
<a id='line_459'></a>
<a id='line_460'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_461'>No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.</a>
<a id='line_462'></a>
<a id='line_463'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_464'>’Tis just to each of them: he is himself.</a>
<a id='line_465'></a>
<a id='line_466'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_467'>Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were!</a>
<a id='line_468'></a>
<a id='line_469'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_470'>So he is.</a>
<a id='line_471'></a>
<a id='line_472'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_473'>Condition I had gone barefoot to India.</a>
<a id='line_474'></a>
<a id='line_475'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_476'>He is not Hector.</a>
<a id='line_477'></a>
<a id='line_478'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_479'>Himself! no, he’s not himself. Would a’ were himself! Well, the gods</a>
<a id='line_480'>are above; time must friend or end. Well, Troilus, well! I would my</a>
<a id='line_481'>heart were in her body! No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.</a>
<a id='line_482'></a>
<a id='line_483'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_484'>Excuse me.</a>
<a id='line_485'></a>
<a id='line_486'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_487'>He is elder.</a>
<a id='line_488'></a>
<a id='line_489'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_490'>Pardon me, pardon me.</a>
<a id='line_491'></a>
<a id='line_492'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_493'>Th’other’s not come to’t; you shall tell me another tale when</a>
<a id='line_494'>th’other’s come to’t. Hector shall not have his wit this year.</a>
<a id='line_495'></a>
<a id='line_496'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_497'>He shall not need it if he have his own.</a>
<a id='line_498'></a>
<a id='line_499'>ANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_500'>Nor his qualities.</a>
<a id='line_501'></a>
<a id='line_502'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_503'>No matter.</a>
<a id='line_504'></a>
<a id='line_505'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_506'>Nor his beauty.</a>
<a id='line_507'></a>
<a id='line_508'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_509'>’Twould not become him: his own’s better.</a>
<a id='line_510'></a>
<a id='line_511'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_512'>You have no judgement, niece. Helen herself swore th’other day that</a>
<a id='line_513'>Troilus, for a brown favour, for so ’tis, I must confess—not brown</a>
<a id='line_514'>neither—</a>
<a id='line_515'></a>
<a id='line_516'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_517'>No, but brown.</a>
<a id='line_518'></a>
<a id='line_519'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_520'>Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.</a>
<a id='line_521'></a>
<a id='line_522'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_523'>To say the truth, true and not true.</a>
<a id='line_524'></a>
<a id='line_525'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_526'>She prais’d his complexion above Paris.</a>
<a id='line_527'></a>
<a id='line_528'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_529'>Why, Paris hath colour enough.</a>
<a id='line_530'></a>
<a id='line_531'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_532'>So he has.</a>
<a id='line_533'></a>
<a id='line_534'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_535'>Then Troilus should have too much. If she prais’d him above, his</a>
<a id='line_536'>complexion is higher than his; he having colour enough, and the other</a>
<a id='line_537'>higher, is too flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as lief</a>
<a id='line_538'>Helen’s golden tongue had commended Troilus for a copper nose.</a>
<a id='line_539'></a>
<a id='line_540'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_541'>I swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paris.</a>
<a id='line_542'></a>
<a id='line_543'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_544'>Then she’s a merry Greek indeed.</a>
<a id='line_545'></a>
<a id='line_546'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_547'>Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th’other day into the</a>
<a id='line_548'>compass’d window—and you know he has not past three or four hairs on</a>
<a id='line_549'>his chin—</a>
<a id='line_550'></a>
<a id='line_551'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_552'>Indeed a tapster’s arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to</a>
<a id='line_553'>a total.</a>
<a id='line_554'></a>
<a id='line_555'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_556'>Why, he is very young, and yet will he within three pound lift as much</a>
<a id='line_557'>as his brother Hector.</a>
<a id='line_558'></a>
<a id='line_559'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_560'>Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?</a>
<a id='line_561'></a>
<a id='line_562'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_563'>But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and puts me her</a>
<a id='line_564'>white hand to his cloven chin—</a>
<a id='line_565'></a>
<a id='line_566'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_567'>Juno have mercy! How came it cloven?</a>
<a id='line_568'></a>
<a id='line_569'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_570'>Why, you know, ’tis dimpled. I think his smiling becomes him better</a>
<a id='line_571'>than any man in all Phrygia.</a>
<a id='line_572'></a>
<a id='line_573'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_574'>O, he smiles valiantly!</a>
<a id='line_575'></a>
<a id='line_576'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_577'>Does he not?</a>
<a id='line_578'></a>
<a id='line_579'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_580'>O yes, an ’twere a cloud in autumn!</a>
<a id='line_581'></a>
<a id='line_582'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_583'>Why, go to, then! But to prove to you that Helen loves Troilus—</a>
<a id='line_584'></a>
<a id='line_585'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_586'>Troilus will stand to the proof, if you’ll prove it so.</a>
<a id='line_587'></a>
<a id='line_588'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_589'>Troilus! Why, he esteems her no more than I esteem an addle egg.</a>
<a id='line_590'></a>
<a id='line_591'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_592'>If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head, you would</a>
<a id='line_593'>eat chickens i’ th’ shell.</a>
<a id='line_594'></a>
<a id='line_595'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_596'>I cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin. Indeed,</a>
<a id='line_597'>she has a marvell’s white hand, I must needs confess.</a>
<a id='line_598'></a>
<a id='line_599'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_600'>Without the rack.</a>
<a id='line_601'></a>
<a id='line_602'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_603'>And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.</a>
<a id='line_604'></a>
<a id='line_605'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_606'>Alas, poor chin! Many a wart is richer.</a>
<a id='line_607'></a>
<a id='line_608'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_609'>But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laugh’d that her eyes ran</a>
<a id='line_610'>o’er.</a>
<a id='line_611'></a>
<a id='line_612'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_613'>With millstones.</a>
<a id='line_614'></a>
<a id='line_615'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_616'>And Cassandra laugh’d.</a>
<a id='line_617'></a>
<a id='line_618'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_619'>But there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes. Did her</a>
<a id='line_620'>eyes run o’er too?</a>
<a id='line_621'></a>
<a id='line_622'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_623'>And Hector laugh’d.</a>
<a id='line_624'></a>
<a id='line_625'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_626'>At what was all this laughing?</a>
<a id='line_627'></a>
<a id='line_628'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_629'>Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus’ chin.</a>
<a id='line_630'></a>
<a id='line_631'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_632'>And’t had been a green hair I should have laugh’d too.</a>
<a id='line_633'></a>
<a id='line_634'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_635'>They laugh’d not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.</a>
<a id='line_636'></a>
<a id='line_637'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_638'>What was his answer?</a>
<a id='line_639'></a>
<a id='line_640'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_641'>Quoth she ‘Here’s but two and fifty hairs on your chin, and one of them</a>
<a id='line_642'>is white.’</a>
<a id='line_643'></a>
<a id='line_644'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_645'>This is her question.</a>
<a id='line_646'></a>
<a id='line_647'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_648'>That’s true; make no question of that. ‘Two and fifty hairs,’ quoth he</a>
<a id='line_649'>‘and one white. That white hair is my father, and all the rest are his</a>
<a id='line_650'>sons.’ ‘Jupiter!’ quoth she ‘which of these hairs is Paris my husband?’</a>
<a id='line_651'>‘The forked one,’ quoth he, ’pluck’t out and give it him.’ But there</a>
<a id='line_652'>was such laughing! and Helen so blush’d, and Paris so chaf’d; and all</a>
<a id='line_653'>the rest so laugh’d that it pass’d.</a>
<a id='line_654'></a>
<a id='line_655'>CRESSIDA.</a>
<a id='line_656'>So let it now; for it has been a great while going by.</a>
<a id='line_657'></a>
<a id='line_658'>PANDARUS.</a>
<a id='line_659'>Well, cousin, I told you a thing yesterday; think on’t.</a>
<a id='line_660'></a>

<a id='line_775'>Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon him, niece; look</a>
<a id='line_776'>you how his sword is bloodied, and his helm more hack’d than Hector’s;</a>
<a id='line_777'>and how he looks, and how he goes! O admirable youth! he never saw</a>
<a id='line_778'>three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way. Had I a sister were</a>

<a id='line_873'>That she was never yet that ever knew</a>

<a id='line_888'>Princes,</a>
<a id='line_889'>What grief hath set these jaundies o’er your cheeks?</a>
<a id='line_890'>The ample proposition that hope makes</a>
<a id='line_891'>In all designs begun on earth below</a>
<a id='line_892'>Fails in the promis’d largeness; checks and disasters</a>
<a id='line_893'>Grow in the veins of actions highest rear’d,</a>
<a id='line_894'>As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,</a>
<a id='line_895'>Infects the sound pine, and diverts his grain</a>
<a id='line_896'>Tortive and errant from his course of growth.</a>
<a id='line_897'>Nor, princes, is it matter new to us</a>
<a id='line_898'>That we come short of our suppose so far</a>
<a id='line_899'>That after seven years’ siege yet Troy walls stand;</a>
<a id='line_900'>Sith every action that hath gone before,</a>
<a id='line_901'>Whereof we have record, trial did draw</a>
<a id='line_902'>Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,</a>
<a id='line_903'>And that unbodied figure of the thought</a>
<a id='line_904'>That gave’t surmised shape. Why then, you princes,</a>
<a id='line_905'>Do you with cheeks abash’d behold our works</a>
<a id='line_906'>And call them shames, which are, indeed, naught else</a>
<a id='line_907'>But the protractive trials of great Jove</a>
<a id='line_908'>To find persistive constancy in men;</a>
<a id='line_909'>The fineness of which metal is not found</a>

<a id='line_911'>The wise and fool, the artist and unread,</a>
<a id='line_912'>The hard and soft, seem all affin’d and kin.</a>
<a id='line_913'>But in the wind and tempest of her frown</a>
<a id='line_914'>Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,</a>
<a id='line_915'>Puffing at all, winnows the light away;</a>

<a id='line_920'>With due observance of thy godlike seat,</a>
<a id='line_921'>Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply</a>
<a id='line_922'>Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance</a>
<a id='line_923'>Lies the true proof of men. The sea being smooth,</a>
<a id='line_924'>How many shallow bauble boats dare sail</a>
<a id='line_925'>Upon her patient breast, making their way</a>
<a id='line_926'>With those of nobler bulk!</a>
<a id='line_927'>But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage</a>
<a id='line_928'>The gentle Thetis, and anon behold</a>
<a id='line_929'>The strong-ribb’d bark through liquid mountains cut,</a>
<a id='line_930'>Bounding between the two moist elements</a>
<a id='line_931'>Like Perseus’ horse. Where’s then the saucy boat,</a>
<a id='line_932'>Whose weak untimber’d sides but even now</a>
<a id='line_933'>Co-rivall’d greatness? Either to harbour fled</a>
<a id='line_934'>Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so</a>
<a id='line_935'>Doth valour’s show and valour’s worth divide</a>
<a id='line_936'>In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness</a>
<a id='line_937'>The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze</a>
<a id='line_938'>Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind</a>
<a id='line_939'>Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,</a>

<a id='line_949'>In whom the tempers and the minds of all</a>

<a id='line_953'>[_To Nestor_] And, thou most reverend, for thy stretch’d-out life,</a>
<a id='line_954'>I give to both your speeches—which were such</a>
<a id='line_955'>As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece</a>
<a id='line_956'>Should hold up high in brass; and such again</a>
<a id='line_957'>As venerable Nestor, hatch’d in silver,</a>
<a id='line_958'>Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree</a>
<a id='line_959'>On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears</a>
<a id='line_960'>To his experienc’d tongue—yet let it please both,</a>
<a id='line_961'>Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.</a>
<a id='line_962'></a>
<a id='line_963'>AGAMEMNON.</a>
<a id='line_964'>Speak, Prince of Ithaca; and be’t of less expect</a>

<a id='line_966'>Divide thy lips than we are confident,</a>
<a id='line_967'>When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,</a>

<a id='line_970'>ULYSSES.</a>
<a id='line_971'>Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,</a>
<a id='line_972'>And the great Hector’s sword had lack’d a master,</a>
<a id='line_973'>But for these instances:</a>
<a id='line_974'>The specialty of rule hath been neglected;</a>
<a id='line_975'>And look how many Grecian tents do stand</a>
<a id='line_976'>Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.</a>
<a id='line_977'>When that the general is not like the hive,</a>
<a id='line_978'>To whom the foragers shall all repair,</a>
<a id='line_979'>What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,</a>
<a id='line_980'>Th’unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.</a>
<a id='line_981'>The heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre,</a>
<a id='line_982'>Observe degree, priority, and place,</a>
<a id='line_983'>Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,</a>
<a id='line_984'>Office, and custom, in all line of order;</a>
<a id='line_985'>And therefore is the glorious planet Sol</a>
<a id='line_986'>In noble eminence enthron’d and spher’d</a>
<a id='line_987'>Amidst the other, whose med’cinable eye</a>
<a id='line_988'>Corrects the influence of evil planets,</a>
<a id='line_989'>And posts, like the commandment of a king,</a>
<a id='line_990'>Sans check, to good and bad. But when the planets</a>
<a id='line_991'>In evil mixture to disorder wander,</a>
<a id='line_992'>What plagues and what portents, what mutiny,</a>
<a id='line_993'>What raging of the sea, shaking of earth,</a>
<a id='line_994'>Commotion in the winds! Frights, changes, horrors,</a>
<a id='line_995'>Divert and crack, rend and deracinate,</a>
<a id='line_996'>The unity and married calm of states</a>
<a id='line_997'>Quite from their fixture! O, when degree is shak’d,</a>
<a id='line_998'>Which is the ladder of all high designs,</a>
<a id='line_999'>The enterprise is sick! How could communities,</a>
<a id='line_1000'>Degrees in schools, and brotherhoods in cities,</a>
<a id='line_1001'>Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,</a>
<a id='line_1002'>The primogenity and due of birth,</a>
<a id='line_1003'>Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,</a>
<a id='line_1004'>But by degree stand in authentic place?</a>
<a id='line_1005'>Take but degree away, untune that string,</a>
<a id='line_1006'>And hark what discord follows! Each thing melts</a>
<a id='line_1007'>In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters</a>
<a id='line_1008'>Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores,</a>
<a id='line_1009'>And make a sop of all this solid globe;</a>
<a id='line_1010'>Strength should be lord of imbecility,</a>
<a id='line_1011'>And the rude son should strike his father dead;</a>
<a id='line_1012'>Force should be right; or, rather, right and wrong—</a>
<a id='line_1013'>Between whose endless jar justice resides—</a>
<a id='line_1014'>Should lose their names, and so should justice too.</a>
<a id='line_1015'>Then everything includes itself in power,</a>
<a id='line_1016'>Power into will, will into appetite;</a>
<a id='line_1017'>And appetite, an universal wolf,</a>
<a id='line_1018'>So doubly seconded with will and power,</a>
<a id='line_1019'>Must make perforce an universal prey,</a>
<a id='line_1020'>And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,</a>
<a id='line_1021'>This chaos, when degree is suffocate,</a>
<a id='line_1022'>Follows the choking.</a>
<a id='line_1023'>And this neglection of degree it is</a>
<a id='line_1024'>That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose</a>
<a id='line_1025'>It hath to climb. The general’s disdain’d</a>
<a id='line_1026'>By him one step below, he by the next,</a>
<a id='line_1027'>That next by him beneath; so every step,</a>
<a id='line_1028'>Exampl’d by the first pace that is sick</a>
<a id='line_1029'>Of his superior, grows to an envious fever</a>
<a id='line_1030'>Of pale and bloodless emulation.</a>
<a id='line_1031'>And ’tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,</a>
<a id='line_1032'>Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,</a>
<a id='line_1033'>Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.</a>
<a id='line_1034'></a>
<a id='line_1035'>NESTOR.</a>
<a id='line_1036'>Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover’d</a>

<a id='line_1041'>What is the remedy?</a>
<a id='line_1042'></a>
<a id='line_1043'>ULYSSES.</a>
<a id='line_1044'>The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns</a>
<a id='line_1045'>The sinew and the forehand of our host,</a>
<a id='line_1046'>Having his ear full of his airy fame,</a>
<a id='line_1047'>Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent</a>
<a id='line_1048'>Lies mocking our designs; with him Patroclus</a>
<a id='line_1049'>Upon a lazy bed the livelong day</a>
<a id='line_1050'>Breaks scurril jests;</a>
<a id='line_1051'>And with ridiculous and awkward action—</a>
<a id='line_1052'>Which, slanderer, he imitation calls—</a>
<a id='line_1053'>He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,</a>
<a id='line_1054'>Thy topless deputation he puts on;</a>
<a id='line_1055'>And like a strutting player whose conceit</a>
<a id='line_1056'>Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich</a>
<a id='line_1057'>To hear the wooden dialogue and sound</a>
<a id='line_1058'>’Twixt his stretch’d footing and the scaffoldage—</a>
<a id='line_1059'>Such to-be-pitied and o’er-wrested seeming</a>
<a id='line_1060'>He acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks</a>
<a id='line_1061'>’Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquar’d,</a>
<a id='line_1062'>Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp’d,</a>
<a id='line_1063'>Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff</a>
<a id='line_1064'>The large Achilles, on his press’d bed lolling,</a>
<a id='line_1065'>From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;</a>
<a id='line_1066'>Cries ‘Excellent! ’Tis Agamemnon right!</a>
<a id='line_1067'>Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,</a>
<a id='line_1068'>As he being drest to some oration.’</a>
<a id='line_1069'>That’s done—as near as the extremest ends</a>
<a id='line_1070'>Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife;</a>
<a id='line_1071'>Yet god Achilles still cries ‘Excellent!</a>
<a id='line_1072'>’Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,</a>
<a id='line_1073'>Arming to answer in a night alarm.’</a>
<a id='line_1074'>And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age</a>
<a id='line_1075'>Must be the scene of mirth: to cough and spit</a>
<a id='line_1076'>And, with a palsy fumbling on his gorget,</a>
<a id='line_1077'>Shake in and out the rivet. And at this sport</a>
<a id='line_1078'>Sir Valour dies; cries ‘O, enough, Patroclus;</a>
<a id='line_1079'>Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all</a>
<a id='line_1080'>In pleasure of my spleen.’ And in this fashion</a>
<a id='line_1081'>All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,</a>
<a id='line_1082'>Severals and generals of grace exact,</a>
<a id='line_1083'>Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,</a>
<a id='line_1084'>Excitements to the field or speech for truce,</a>
<a id='line_1085'>Success or loss, what is or is not, serves</a>
<a id='line_1086'>As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.</a>
<a id='line_1087'></a>
<a id='line_1088'>NESTOR.</a>
<a id='line_1089'>And in the imitation of these twain—</a>
<a id='line_1090'>Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns</a>
<a id='line_1091'>With an imperial voice—many are infect.</a>
<a id='line_1092'>Ajax is grown self-will’d and bears his head</a>
<a id='line_1093'>In such a rein, in full as proud a place</a>
<a id='line_1094'>As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;</a>
<a id='line_1095'>Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war</a>
<a id='line_1096'>Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,</a>
<a id='line_1097'>A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,</a>
<a id='line_1098'>To match us in comparisons with dirt,</a>
<a id='line_1099'>To weaken and discredit our exposure,</a>

<a id='line_1101'></a>
<a id='line_1102'>ULYSSES.</a>
<a id='line_1103'>They tax our policy and call it cowardice,</a>
<a id='line_1104'>Count wisdom as no member of the war,</a>
<a id='line_1105'>Forestall prescience, and esteem no act</a>
<a id='line_1106'>But that of hand. The still and mental parts</a>

<a id='line_1111'>They call this bed-work, mapp’ry, closet-war;</a>

<a id='line_1309'></a>
<a id='line_1310'>NESTOR.</a>
<a id='line_1311'>True. The purpose is perspicuous even as substance</a>

<a id='line_1322'></a>
<a id='line_1323'>NESTOR.</a>
<a id='line_1324'>Why, ’tis most meet. Who may you else oppose</a>
<a id='line_1325'>That can from Hector bring those honours off,</a>
<a id='line_1326'>If not Achilles? Though ’t be a sportful combat,</a>
<a id='line_1327'>Yet in this trial much opinion dwells</a>
<a id='line_1328'>For here the Trojans taste our dear’st repute</a>
<a id='line_1329'>With their fin’st palate; and trust to me, Ulysses,</a>
<a id='line_1330'>Our imputation shall be oddly pois’d</a>

<a id='line_1334'>And in such indexes, although small pricks</a>

<a id='line_1336'>The baby figure of the giant mass</a>
<a id='line_1337'>Of things to come at large. It is suppos’d</a>
<a id='line_1338'>He that meets Hector issues from our choice;</a>
<a id='line_1339'>And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,</a>
<a id='line_1340'>Makes merit her election, and doth boil,</a>
<a id='line_1341'>As ’twere from forth us all, a man distill’d</a>
<a id='line_1342'>Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,</a>
<a id='line_1343'>What heart receives from hence a conquering part,</a>

<a id='line_1349'>ULYSSES.</a>
<a id='line_1350'>Give pardon to my speech. Therefore ’tis meet</a>
<a id='line_1351'>Achilles meet not Hector. Let us, like merchants,</a>
<a id='line_1352'>First show foul wares, and think perchance they’ll sell;</a>
<a id='line_1353'>If not, the lustre of the better shall exceed</a>

<a id='line_1367'>Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1368'>Should he scape Hector fair. If he were foil’d,</a>
<a id='line_1369'>Why, then we do our main opinion crush</a>
<a id='line_1370'>In taint of our best man. No, make a lott’ry;</a>
<a id='line_1371'>And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw</a>
<a id='line_1372'>The sort to fight with Hector. Among ourselves</a>
<a id='line_1373'>Give him allowance for the better man;</a>
<a id='line_1374'>For that will physic the great Myrmidon,</a>
<a id='line_1375'>Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall</a>
<a id='line_1376'>His crest, that prouder than blue Iris bends.</a>
<a id='line_1377'>If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,</a>
<a id='line_1378'>We’ll dress him up in voices; if he fail,</a>

<a id='line_1907'>Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice</a>
<a id='line_1908'>Of any true decision. Nature craves</a>
<a id='line_1909'>All dues be rend’red to their owners. Now,</a>

<a id='line_1921'>To have her back return’d. Thus to persist</a>
<a id='line_1922'>In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,</a>
<a id='line_1923'>But makes it much more heavy. Hector’s opinion</a>
