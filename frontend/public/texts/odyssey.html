<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>BOOK I</a>
<a id='line_4'></a>
<a id='line_5'>ARGUMENT.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>MINERVA'S DESCENT TO ITHACA.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>The poem opens within forty eight days of the arrival of Ulysses</a>
<a id='line_10'>in his dominions. He had now remained seven years in the Island of</a>
<a id='line_11'>Calypso, when the gods assembled in council, proposed the method</a>
<a id='line_12'>of his departure from thence and his return to his native country.</a>
<a id='line_13'>For this purpose it is concluded to send Mercury to Calypso, and</a>
<a id='line_14'>Pallas immediately descends to Ithaca. She holds a conference with</a>
<a id='line_15'>Telemachus, in the shape of Mantes, king of Taphians; in which she</a>
<a id='line_16'>advises him to take a journey in quest of his father Ulysses, to</a>
<a id='line_17'>Pylos and Sparta, where Nestor and Menelaus yet reigned; then,</a>
<a id='line_18'>after having visibly displayed her divinity, disappears. The</a>
<a id='line_19'>suitors of Penelope make great entertainments, and riot in her</a>
<a id='line_20'>palace till night. Phemius sings to them the return of the</a>
<a id='line_21'>Grecians, till Penelope puts a stop to the song. Some words arise</a>
<a id='line_22'>between the suitors and Telemachus, who summons the council to</a>
<a id='line_23'>meet the day following.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'></a>
<a id='line_27'>The man for wisdom's various arts renown'd,</a>
<a id='line_28'>Long exercised in woes, O Muse! resound;</a>
<a id='line_29'>Who, when his arms had wrought the destined fall</a>
<a id='line_30'>Of sacred Troy, and razed her heaven-built wall,</a>
<a id='line_31'>Wandering from clime to clime, observant stray'd,</a>
<a id='line_32'>Their manners noted, and their states survey'd,</a>
<a id='line_33'>On stormy seas unnumber'd toils he bore,</a>
<a id='line_34'>Safe with his friends to gain his natal shore:</a>
<a id='line_35'>Vain toils! their impious folly dared to prey</a>
<a id='line_36'>On herds devoted to the god of day;</a>
<a id='line_37'>The god vindictive doom'd them never more</a>
<a id='line_38'>(Ah, men unbless'd!) to touch that natal shore.</a>
<a id='line_39'>Oh, snatch some portion of these acts from fate,</a>
<a id='line_40'>Celestial Muse! and to our world relate.</a>
<a id='line_41'></a>
<a id='line_42'>Now at their native realms the Greeks arrived;</a>
<a id='line_43'>All who the wars of ten long years survived;</a>
<a id='line_44'>And 'scaped the perils of the gulfy main.</a>
<a id='line_45'>Ulysses, sole of all the victor train,</a>
<a id='line_46'>An exile from his dear paternal coast,</a>
<a id='line_47'>Deplored his absent queen and empire lost.</a>
<a id='line_48'>Calypso in her caves constrain'd his stay,</a>
<a id='line_49'>With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay;</a>
<a id='line_50'>In vain-for now the circling years disclose</a>
<a id='line_51'>The day predestined to reward his woes.</a>
<a id='line_52'>At length his Ithaca is given by fate,</a>
<a id='line_53'>Where yet new labours his arrival wait;</a>
<a id='line_54'>At length their rage the hostile powers restrain,</a>
<a id='line_55'>All but the ruthless monarch of the main.</a>
<a id='line_56'>But now the god, remote, a heavenly guest,</a>
<a id='line_57'>In AEthiopia graced the genial feast</a>
<a id='line_58'>(A race divided, whom with sloping rays</a>
<a id='line_59'>The rising and descending sun surveys);</a>
<a id='line_60'>There on the world's extremest verge revered</a>
<a id='line_61'>With hecatombs and prayer in pomp preferr'd,</a>
<a id='line_62'>Distant he lay: while in the bright abodes</a>
<a id='line_63'>Of high Olympus, Jove convened the gods:</a>
<a id='line_64'>The assembly thus the sire supreme address'd,</a>
<a id='line_65'>AEgysthus' fate revolving in his breast,</a>
<a id='line_66'>Whom young Orestes to the dreary coast</a>
<a id='line_67'>Of Pluto sent, a blood-polluted ghost.</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>"Perverse mankind! whose wills, created free,</a>
<a id='line_70'>Charge all their woes on absolute degree;</a>
<a id='line_71'>All to the dooming gods their guilt translate,</a>
<a id='line_72'>And follies are miscall'd the crimes of fate.</a>
<a id='line_73'>When to his lust AEgysthus gave the rein,</a>
<a id='line_74'>Did fate, or we, the adulterous act constrain?</a>
<a id='line_75'>Did fate, or we, when great Atrides died,</a>
<a id='line_76'>Urge the bold traitor to the regicide?</a>
<a id='line_77'>Hermes I sent, while yet his soul remain'd</a>
<a id='line_78'>Sincere from royal blood, and faith profaned;</a>
<a id='line_79'>To warn the wretch, that young Orestes, grown</a>
<a id='line_80'>To manly years, should re-assert the throne.</a>
<a id='line_81'>Yet, impotent of mind, and uncontroll'd,</a>
<a id='line_82'>He plunged into the gulf which Heaven foretold."</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>Here paused the god; and pensive thus replies</a>
<a id='line_85'>Minerva, graceful with her azure eyes:</a>
<a id='line_86'></a>
<a id='line_87'>"O thou! from whom the whole creation springs,</a>
<a id='line_88'>The source of power on earth derived to kings!</a>
<a id='line_89'>His death was equal to the direful deed;</a>
<a id='line_90'>So may the man of blood be doomed to bleed!</a>
<a id='line_91'>But grief and rage alternate wound my breast</a>
<a id='line_92'>For brave Ulysses, still by fate oppress'd.</a>
<a id='line_93'>Amidst an isle, around whose rocky shore</a>
<a id='line_94'>The forests murmur, and the surges roar,</a>
<a id='line_95'>The blameless hero from his wish'd-for home</a>
<a id='line_96'>A goddess guards in her enchanted dome;</a>
<a id='line_97'>(Atlas her sire, to whose far-piercing eye</a>
<a id='line_98'>The wonders of the deep expanded lie;</a>
<a id='line_99'>The eternal columns which on earth he rears</a>
<a id='line_100'>End in the starry vault, and prop the spheres).</a>
<a id='line_101'>By his fair daughter is the chief confined,</a>
<a id='line_102'>Who soothes to dear delight his anxious mind;</a>
<a id='line_103'>Successless all her soft caresses prove,</a>
<a id='line_104'>To banish from his breast his country's love;</a>
<a id='line_105'>To see the smoke from his loved palace rise,</a>
<a id='line_106'>While the dear isle in distant prospect lies,</a>
<a id='line_107'>With what contentment could he close his eyes!</a>
<a id='line_108'>And will Omnipotence neglect to save</a>
<a id='line_109'>The suffering virtue of the wise and brave?</a>
<a id='line_110'>Must he, whose altars on the Phrygian shore</a>
<a id='line_111'>With frequent rites, and pure, avow'd thy power,</a>
<a id='line_112'>Be doom'd the worst of human ills to prove,</a>
<a id='line_113'>Unbless'd, abandon'd to the wrath of Jove?"</a>
<a id='line_114'></a>
<a id='line_115'>"Daughter! what words have pass'd thy lips unweigh'd!</a>
<a id='line_116'>(Replied the Thunderer to the martial maid;)</a>
<a id='line_117'>Deem not unjustly by my doom oppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_118'>Of human race the wisest and the best.</a>
<a id='line_119'>Neptune, by prayer repentant rarely won,</a>
<a id='line_120'>Afflicts the chief, to avenge his giant son,</a>
<a id='line_121'>Whose visual orb Ulysses robb'd of light;</a>
<a id='line_122'>Great Polypheme, of more than mortal might?</a>
<a id='line_123'>Him young Thousa bore (the bright increase</a>
<a id='line_124'>Of Phorcys, dreaded in the sounds and seas);</a>
<a id='line_125'>Whom Neptune eyed with bloom of beauty bless'd,</a>
<a id='line_126'>And in his cave the yielding nymph compress'd</a>
<a id='line_127'>For this the god constrains the Greek to roam,</a>
<a id='line_128'>A hopeless exile from his native home,</a>
<a id='line_129'>From death alone exempt--but cease to mourn;</a>
<a id='line_130'>Let all combine to achieve his wish'd return;</a>
<a id='line_131'>Neptune atoned, his wrath shall now refrain,</a>
<a id='line_132'>Or thwart the synod of the gods in vain."</a>
<a id='line_133'></a>
<a id='line_134'>"Father and king adored!" Minerva cried,</a>
<a id='line_135'>"Since all who in the Olympian bower reside</a>
<a id='line_136'>Now make the wandering Greek their public care,</a>
<a id='line_137'>Let Hermes to the Atlantic isle repair;</a>
<a id='line_138'>Bid him, arrived in bright Calypso's court,</a>
<a id='line_139'>The sanction of the assembled powers report:</a>
<a id='line_140'>That wise Ulysses to his native land</a>
<a id='line_141'>Must speed, obedient to their high command.</a>
<a id='line_142'>Meantime Telemachus, the blooming heir</a>
<a id='line_143'>Of sea-girt Ithaca, demands my care;</a>
<a id='line_144'>'Tis mine to form his green, unpractised years</a>
<a id='line_145'>In sage debates; surrounded with his peers,</a>
<a id='line_146'>To save the state, and timely to restrain</a>
<a id='line_147'>The bold intrusion of the suitor-train;</a>
<a id='line_148'>Who crowd his palace, and with lawless power</a>
<a id='line_149'>His herds and flocks in feastful rites devour.</a>
<a id='line_150'>To distant Sparta, and the spacious waste</a>
<a id='line_151'>Of Sandy Pyle, the royal youth shall haste.</a>
<a id='line_152'>There, warm with filial love, the cause inquire</a>
<a id='line_153'>That from his realm retards his god-like sire;</a>
<a id='line_154'>Delivering early to the voice of fame</a>
<a id='line_155'>The promise of a green immortal name."</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>She said: the sandals of celestial mould,</a>
<a id='line_158'>Fledged with ambrosial plumes, and rich with gold,</a>
<a id='line_159'>Surround her feet: with these sublime she sails</a>
<a id='line_160'>The aerial space, and mounts the winged gales;</a>
<a id='line_161'>O'er earth and ocean wide prepared to soar,</a>
<a id='line_162'>Her dreaded arm a beamy javelin bore,</a>
<a id='line_163'>Ponderous and vast: which, when her fury burns,</a>
<a id='line_164'>Proud tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o'erturns.</a>
<a id='line_165'>From high Olympus prone her flight she bends,</a>
<a id='line_166'>And in the realms of Ithaca descends,</a>
<a id='line_167'>Her lineaments divine, the grave disguise</a>
<a id='line_168'>Of Mentes' form conceal'd from human eyes</a>
<a id='line_169'>(Mentes, the monarch of the Taphian land);</a>
<a id='line_170'>A glittering spear waved awful in her hand.</a>
<a id='line_171'>There in the portal placed, the heaven-born maid</a>
<a id='line_172'>Enormous riot and misrule survey'd.</a>
<a id='line_173'>On hides of beeves, before the palace gate</a>
<a id='line_174'>(Sad spoils of luxury), the suitors sate.</a>
<a id='line_175'>With rival art, and ardour in their mien,</a>
<a id='line_176'>At chess they vie, to captivate the queen;</a>
<a id='line_177'>Divining of their loves.  Attending nigh,</a>
<a id='line_178'>A menial train the flowing bowl supply.</a>
<a id='line_179'>Others, apart, the spacious hall prepare,</a>
<a id='line_180'>And form the costly feast with busy care.</a>
<a id='line_181'>There young Telemachus, his bloomy face</a>
<a id='line_182'>Glowing celestial sweet, with godlike grace</a>
<a id='line_183'>Amid the circle shines: but hope and fear</a>
<a id='line_184'>(Painful vicissitude!) his bosom tear.</a>
<a id='line_185'>Now, imaged in his mind, he sees restored</a>
<a id='line_186'>In peace and joy the people's rightful lord;</a>
<a id='line_187'>The proud oppressors fly the vengeful sword.</a>
<a id='line_188'>While his fond soul these fancied triumphs swell'd,</a>
<a id='line_189'>The stranger guest the royal youth beheld;</a>
<a id='line_190'>Grieved that a visitant so long should wait</a>
<a id='line_191'>Unmark'd, unhonour'd, at a monarch's gate;</a>
<a id='line_192'>Instant he flew with hospitable haste,</a>
<a id='line_193'>And the new friend with courteous air embraced.</a>
<a id='line_194'>"Stranger, whoe'er thou art, securely rest,</a>
<a id='line_195'>Affianced in my faith, a ready guest;</a>
<a id='line_196'>Approach the dome, the social banquet share,</a>
<a id='line_197'>And then the purpose of thy soul declare."</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>Thus affable and mild, the prince precedes,</a>
<a id='line_200'>And to the dome the unknown celestial leads.</a>
<a id='line_201'>The spear receiving from the hand, he placed</a>
<a id='line_202'>Against a column, fair with sculpture graced;</a>
<a id='line_203'>Where seemly ranged in peaceful order stood</a>
<a id='line_204'>Ulysses' arms now long disused to blood.</a>
<a id='line_205'>He led the goddess to the sovereign seat,</a>
<a id='line_206'>Her feet supported with a stool of state</a>
<a id='line_207'>(A purple carpet spread the pavement wide);</a>
<a id='line_208'>Then drew his seat, familiar, to her side;</a>
<a id='line_209'>Far from the suitor-train, a brutal crowd,</a>
<a id='line_210'>With insolence, and wine, elate and loud:</a>
<a id='line_211'>Where the free guest, unnoted, might relate,</a>
<a id='line_212'>If haply conscious, of his father's fate.</a>
<a id='line_213'>The golden ewer a maid obsequious brings,</a>
<a id='line_214'>Replenish'd from the cool, translucent springs;</a>
<a id='line_215'>With copious water the bright vase supplies</a>
<a id='line_216'>A silver laver of capacious size;</a>
<a id='line_217'>They wash. The tables in fair order spread,</a>
<a id='line_218'>They heap the glittering canisters with bread:</a>
<a id='line_219'>Viands of various kinds allure the taste,</a>
<a id='line_220'>Of choicest sort and savour, rich repast!</a>
<a id='line_221'>Delicious wines the attending herald brought;</a>
<a id='line_222'>The gold gave lustre to the purple draught.</a>
<a id='line_223'>Lured with the vapour of the fragrant feast,</a>
<a id='line_224'>In rush'd the suitors with voracious haste;</a>
<a id='line_225'>Marshall'd in order due, to each a sewer</a>
<a id='line_226'>Presents, to bathe his hands, a radiant ewer.</a>
<a id='line_227'>Luxurious then they feast. Observant round</a>
<a id='line_228'>Gay stripling youths the brimming goblets crown'd.</a>
<a id='line_229'>The rage of hunger quell'd, they all advance</a>
<a id='line_230'>And form to measured airs the mazy dance;</a>
<a id='line_231'>To Phemius was consign'd the chorded lyre,</a>
<a id='line_232'>Whose hand reluctant touch'd the warbling wire;</a>
<a id='line_233'>Phemius, whose voice divine could sweetest sing</a>
<a id='line_234'>High strains responsive to the vocal string.</a>
<a id='line_235'></a>
<a id='line_236'>Meanwhile, in whispers to his heavenly guest</a>
<a id='line_237'>His indignation thus the prince express'd:</a>
<a id='line_238'></a>
<a id='line_239'>"Indulge my rising grief, whilst these (my friend)</a>
<a id='line_240'>With song and dance the pompous revel end.</a>
<a id='line_241'>Light is the dance, and doubly sweet the lays,</a>
<a id='line_242'>When for the dear delight another pays.</a>
<a id='line_243'>His treasured stores those cormarants consume,</a>
<a id='line_244'>Whose bones, defrauded of a regal tomb</a>
<a id='line_245'>And common turf, lie naked on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_246'>Or doom'd to welter in the whelming main.</a>
<a id='line_247'>Should he return, that troop so blithe and bold,</a>
<a id='line_248'>With purple robes inwrought, and stiff with gold,</a>
<a id='line_249'>Precipitant in fear would wing their flight,</a>
<a id='line_250'>And curse their cumbrous pride's unwieldy weight.</a>
<a id='line_251'>But ah, I dream!-the appointed hour is fled.</a>
<a id='line_252'>And hope, too long with vain delusion fed,</a>
<a id='line_253'>Deaf to the rumour of fallacious fame,</a>
<a id='line_254'>Gives to the roll of death his glorious name!</a>
<a id='line_255'>With venial freedom let me now demand</a>
<a id='line_256'>Thy name, thy lineage, and paternal land;</a>
<a id='line_257'>Sincere from whence began thy course, recite,</a>
<a id='line_258'>And to what ship I owe the friendly freight?</a>
<a id='line_259'>Now first to me this visit dost thou deign,</a>
<a id='line_260'>Or number'd in my father's social train?</a>
<a id='line_261'>All who deserved his choice he made his own,</a>
<a id='line_262'>And, curious much to know, he far was known."</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>"My birth I boast (the blue-eyed virgin cries)</a>
<a id='line_265'>From great Anchialus, renown'd and wise;</a>
<a id='line_266'>Mentes my name; I rule the Taphian race,</a>
<a id='line_267'>Whose bounds the deep circumfluent waves embrace;</a>
<a id='line_268'>A duteous people, and industrious isle,</a>
<a id='line_269'>To naval arts inured, and stormy toil.</a>
<a id='line_270'>Freighted with iron from my native land,</a>
<a id='line_271'>I steer my voyage to the Brutian strand</a>
<a id='line_272'>To gain by commerce, for the labour'd mass,</a>
<a id='line_273'>A just proportion of refulgent brass.</a>
<a id='line_274'>Far from your capital my ship resides</a>
<a id='line_275'>At Reitorus, and secure at anchor rides;</a>
<a id='line_276'>Where waving groves on airy Neign grow,</a>
<a id='line_277'>Supremely tall and shade the deeps below.</a>
<a id='line_278'>Thence to revisit your imperial dome,</a>
<a id='line_279'>An old hereditary guest I come;</a>
<a id='line_280'>Your father's friend.  Laertes can relate</a>
<a id='line_281'>Our faith unspotted, and its early date;</a>
<a id='line_282'>Who, press'd with heart-corroding grief and years,</a>
<a id='line_283'>To the gay court a rural shed pretors,</a>
<a id='line_284'>Where, sole of all his train, a matron sage</a>
<a id='line_285'>Supports with homely fond his drooping age,</a>
<a id='line_286'>With feeble steps from marshalling his vines</a>
<a id='line_287'>Returning sad, when toilsome day declines.</a>
<a id='line_288'></a>
<a id='line_289'>"With friendly speed, induced by erring fame,</a>
<a id='line_290'>To hail Ulysses' safe return I came;</a>
<a id='line_291'>But still the frown of some celestial power</a>
<a id='line_292'>With envious joy retards the blissful hour.</a>
<a id='line_293'>Let not your soul be sunk in sad despair;</a>
<a id='line_294'>He lives, he breathes this heavenly vital air,</a>
<a id='line_295'>Among a savage race, whose shelfy bounds</a>
<a id='line_296'>With ceaseless roar the foaming deep surrounds.</a>
<a id='line_297'>The thoughts which roll within my ravish'd breast,</a>
<a id='line_298'>To me, no seer, the inspiring gods suggest;</a>
<a id='line_299'>Nor skill'd nor studious, with prophetic eye</a>
<a id='line_300'>To judge the winged omens of the sky.</a>
<a id='line_301'>Yet hear this certain speech, nor deem it vain;</a>
<a id='line_302'>Though adamantine bonds the chief restrain,</a>
<a id='line_303'>The dire restraint his wisdom will defeat,</a>
<a id='line_304'>And soon restore him to his regal seat.</a>
<a id='line_305'>But generous youth! sincere and free declare,</a>
<a id='line_306'>Are you, of manly growth, his royal heir?</a>
<a id='line_307'>For sure Ulysses in your look appears,</a>
<a id='line_308'>The same his features, if the same his years.</a>
<a id='line_309'>Such was that face, on which I dwelt with joy</a>
<a id='line_310'>Ere Greece assembled stemm'd the tides to Troy;</a>
<a id='line_311'>But, parting then for that detested shore,</a>
<a id='line_312'>Our eyes, unhappy never greeted more."</a>
<a id='line_313'></a>
<a id='line_314'>"To prove a genuine birth (the prince replies)</a>
<a id='line_315'>On female truth assenting faith relies.</a>
<a id='line_316'>Thus manifest of right, I build my claim</a>

<a id='line_318'>Ulysses' son: but happier he, whom fate</a>
<a id='line_319'>Hath placed beneath the storms which toss the great!</a>
<a id='line_320'>Happier the son, whose hoary sire is bless'd</a>
<a id='line_321'>With humble affluence, and domestic rest!</a>
<a id='line_322'>Happier than I, to future empire born,</a>
<a id='line_323'>But doom'd a father's wretch'd fate to mourn!"</a>

<a id='line_325'>To whom, with aspect mild, the guest divine:</a>
<a id='line_326'>"Oh true descendant of a sceptred line!</a>
<a id='line_327'>The gods a glorious fate from anguish free</a>
<a id='line_328'>To chaste Penelope's increase decree.</a>
<a id='line_329'>But say, yon jovial troops so gaily dress'd,</a>
<a id='line_330'>Is this a bridal or a friendly feast?</a>
<a id='line_331'>Or from their deed I rightlier may divine,</a>
<a id='line_332'>Unseemly flown with insolence and wine?</a>
<a id='line_333'>Unwelcome revellers, whose lawless joy</a>
<a id='line_334'>Pains the sage ear, and hurts the sober eye."</a>
<a id='line_335'></a>
<a id='line_336'>"Magnificence of old (the prince replied)</a>
<a id='line_337'>Beneath our roof with virtue could reside;</a>
<a id='line_338'>Unblamed abundance crowned the royal board,</a>

<a id='line_340'>Who now (so Heaven decrees) is doom'd to mourn,</a>
<a id='line_341'>Bitter constraint, erroneous and forlorn.</a>
<a id='line_342'>Better the chief, on Ilion's hostile plain,</a>
<a id='line_343'>Had fall'n surrounded with his warlike train;</a>
<a id='line_344'>Or safe return'd, the race of glory pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_345'>New to his friends' embrace, and breathed his last!</a>
<a id='line_346'>Then grateful Greece with streaming eyes would raise,</a>
<a id='line_347'>Historic marbles to record his praise;</a>
<a id='line_348'>His praise, eternal on the faithful stone,</a>
<a id='line_349'>Had with transmissive honour graced his son.</a>
<a id='line_350'>Now snatch'd by harpies to the dreary coast.</a>
<a id='line_351'>Sunk is the hero, and his glory lost;</a>
<a id='line_352'>Vanish'd at once! unheard of, and unknown!</a>
<a id='line_353'>And I his heir in misery alone.</a>
<a id='line_354'>Nor for a dear lost father only flow</a>

<a id='line_356'>To tempt the spouseless queen with amorous wiles</a>
<a id='line_357'>Resort the nobles from the neighbouring isles;</a>
<a id='line_358'>From Samos, circled with the Ionian main,</a>

<a id='line_364'>They, vain expectants of the bridal hour,</a>
<a id='line_365'>My stores in riotous expense devour.</a>
<a id='line_366'>In feast and dance the mirthful months employ,</a>
<a id='line_367'>And meditate my doom to crown their joy."</a>
<a id='line_368'></a>
<a id='line_369'>With tender pity touch'd, the goddess cried:</a>

<a id='line_371'>Soon may your sire discharge the vengeance due,</a>
<a id='line_372'>And all your wrongs the proud oppressors rue!</a>

<a id='line_374'>Each hand tremendous with a brazen spear,</a>
<a id='line_375'>In radiant panoply his limbs incased</a>
<a id='line_376'>(For so of old my fathers court he graced,</a>
<a id='line_377'>When social mirth unbent his serious soul,</a>
<a id='line_378'>O'er the full banquet, and the sprightly bowl);</a>
<a id='line_379'>He then from Ephyre, the fair domain</a>
<a id='line_380'>Of Ilus, sprung from Jason's royal strain,</a>
<a id='line_381'>Measured a length of seas, a toilsome length, in vain.</a>
<a id='line_382'>For, voyaging to learn the direful art</a>
<a id='line_383'>To taint with deadly drugs the barbed dart;</a>
<a id='line_384'>Observant of the gods, and sternly just,</a>
<a id='line_385'>Ilus refused to impart the baneful trust;</a>
<a id='line_386'>With friendlier zeal my father's soul was fired,</a>
<a id='line_387'>The drugs he knew, and gave the boon desired.</a>
<a id='line_388'>Appear'd he now with such heroic port,</a>
<a id='line_389'>As then conspicuous at the Taphian court;</a>
<a id='line_390'>Soon should you boasters cease their haughty strife,</a>
<a id='line_391'>Or each atone his guilty love with life.</a>

<a id='line_403'>To great Icarius, whose paternal care</a>
<a id='line_404'>Will guide her passion, and reward her choice</a>

<a id='line_464'>At length, composed, he join'd the suitor-throng;</a>
<a id='line_465'>Hush'd in attention to the warbled song.</a>
<a id='line_466'>His tender theme the charming lyrist chose.</a>
<a id='line_467'>Minerva's anger, and the dreadful woes</a>
<a id='line_468'>Which voyaging from Troy the victors bore,</a>
<a id='line_469'>While storms vindictive intercept the store.</a>
<a id='line_470'>The shrilling airs the vaulted roof rebounds,</a>

<a id='line_472'>With grief renew'd the weeping fair descends;</a>
<a id='line_473'>Their sovereign's step a virgin train attends:</a>
<a id='line_474'>A veil, of richest texture wrought, she wears,</a>

<a id='line_476'>There from the portal, with her mild command,</a>
<a id='line_477'>Thus gently checks the minstrel's tuneful hand:</a>
<a id='line_478'></a>
<a id='line_479'>"Phemius! let acts of gods, and heroes old,</a>
<a id='line_480'>What ancient bards in hall and bower have told,</a>
<a id='line_481'>Attemper'd to the lyre, your voice employ;</a>
<a id='line_482'>Such the pleased ear will drink with silent joy.</a>
<a id='line_483'>But, oh! forbear that dear disastrous name,</a>
<a id='line_484'>To sorrow sacred, and secure of fame;</a>
<a id='line_485'>My bleeding bosom sickens at the sound,</a>
<a id='line_486'>And every piercing note inflicts a wound."</a>
<a id='line_487'></a>
<a id='line_488'>"Why, dearest object of my duteous love,</a>
<a id='line_489'>(Replied the prince,) will you the bard reprove?</a>
<a id='line_490'>Oft, Jove's ethereal rays (resistless fire)</a>
<a id='line_491'>The chanters soul and raptured song inspire</a>
<a id='line_492'>Instinct divine? nor blame severe his choice,</a>
<a id='line_493'>Warbling the Grecian woes with heart and voice;</a>
<a id='line_494'>For novel lays attract our ravish'd ears;</a>
<a id='line_495'>But old, the mind with inattention hears:</a>
<a id='line_496'>Patient permit the sadly pleasing strain;</a>
<a id='line_497'>Familiar now with grief, your tears refrain,</a>
<a id='line_498'>And in the public woe forget your own;</a>
<a id='line_499'>You weep not for a perish'd lord alone.</a>
<a id='line_500'>What Greeks new wandering in the Stygian gloom,</a>
<a id='line_501'>Wish your Ulysses shared an equal doom!</a>
<a id='line_502'>Your widow'd hours, apart, with female toil</a>
<a id='line_503'>And various labours of the loom beguile;</a>
<a id='line_504'>There rule, from palace-cares remote and free;</a>
<a id='line_505'>That care to man belongs, and most to me."</a>
<a id='line_506'></a>
<a id='line_507'>Mature beyond his years, the queen admires</a>
<a id='line_508'>His sage reply, and with her train retires.</a>
<a id='line_509'>Then swelling sorrows burst their former bounds,</a>
<a id='line_510'>With echoing grief afresh the dome resounds;</a>
<a id='line_511'>Till Pallas, piteous of her plaintive cries,</a>
<a id='line_512'>In slumber closed her silver-streaming eyes.</a>
<a id='line_513'></a>
<a id='line_514'>Meantime, rekindled at the royal charms,</a>
<a id='line_515'>Tumultuous love each beating bosom warms;</a>
<a id='line_516'>Intemperate rage a wordy war began;</a>
<a id='line_517'>But bold Telemachus assumed the man.</a>
<a id='line_518'>"Instant (he cried) your female discord end,</a>
<a id='line_519'>Ye deedless boasters! and the song attend;</a>
<a id='line_520'>Obey that sweet compulsion, nor profane</a>

<a id='line_522'>Pacific now prolong the jovial feast;</a>
<a id='line_523'>But when the dawn reveals the rosy east,</a>
<a id='line_524'>I, to the peers assembled, shall propose</a>
<a id='line_525'>The firm resolve, I here in few disclose;</a>
<a id='line_526'>No longer live the cankers of my court;</a>

<a id='line_528'>Waste in wild riot what your land allows,</a>
<a id='line_529'>There ply the early feast, and late carouse.</a>
<a id='line_530'>But if, to honour lost, 'tis still decreed</a>
<a id='line_531'>For you my bowl shall flow, my flock shall bleed;</a>
<a id='line_532'>Judge and revenge my right, impartial Jove!</a>
<a id='line_533'>By him and all the immortal thrones above</a>
<a id='line_534'>(A sacred oath), each proud oppressor slain,</a>
<a id='line_535'>Shall with inglorious gore this marble stain."</a>
<a id='line_536'></a>
<a id='line_537'>Awed by the prince, thus haughty, bold, and young,</a>
<a id='line_538'>Rage gnaw'd the lip, and wonder chain'd the tongue.</a>
<a id='line_539'>Silence at length the gay Antinous broke,</a>
<a id='line_540'>Constrain'd a smile, and thus ambiguous spoke:</a>
<a id='line_541'>"What god to your untutor'd youth affords</a>
<a id='line_542'>This headlong torrent of amazing words?</a>
<a id='line_543'>May Jove delay thy reign, and cumber late</a>

<a id='line_545'></a>
<a id='line_546'>"Those toils (Telemachus serene replies)</a>
<a id='line_547'>Have charms, with all their weight, t'allure the wise.</a>
<a id='line_548'>Fast by the throne obsequious fame resides,</a>
<a id='line_549'>And wealth incessant rolls her golden tides.</a>
<a id='line_550'>Nor let Antinous rage, if strong desire</a>
<a id='line_551'>Of wealth and fame a youthful bosom fire:</a>
<a id='line_552'>Elect by Jove, his delegate of sway,</a>
<a id='line_553'>With joyous pride the summons I'd obey.</a>
<a id='line_554'>Whene'er Ulysses roams the realm of night,</a>
<a id='line_555'>Should factious power dispute my lineal right,</a>
<a id='line_556'>Some other Greeks a fairer claim may plead;</a>
<a id='line_557'>To your pretence their title would precede.</a>
<a id='line_558'>At least, the sceptre lost, I still should reign</a>
<a id='line_559'>Sole o'er my vassals, and domestic train."</a>
<a id='line_560'></a>
<a id='line_561'>To this Eurymachus: "To Heaven alone</a>
<a id='line_562'>Refer the choice to fill the vacant throne.</a>
<a id='line_563'>Your patrimonial stores in peace possess;</a>
<a id='line_564'>Undoubted, all your filial claim confess:</a>
<a id='line_565'>Your private right should impious power invade,</a>
<a id='line_566'>The peers of Ithaca would arm in aid.</a>
<a id='line_567'>But say, that stranger guest who late withdrew,</a>
<a id='line_568'>What and from whence? his name and lineage shew.</a>
<a id='line_569'>His grave demeanour and majestic grace</a>
<a id='line_570'>Speak him descended of no vulgar race:</a>
<a id='line_571'>Did he some loan of ancient right require,</a>
<a id='line_572'>Or came forerunner of your sceptr'd sire?"</a>
<a id='line_573'></a>
<a id='line_574'>"Oh son of Polybus!" the prince replies,</a>
<a id='line_575'>"No more my sire will glad these longing eyes;</a>
<a id='line_576'>The queen's fond hope inventive rumour cheers,</a>
<a id='line_577'>Or vain diviners' dreams divert her fears.</a>
<a id='line_578'>That stranger-guest the Taphian realm obeys,</a>

<a id='line_582'></a>
<a id='line_583'>Thus he, though conscious of the ethereal guest,</a>

<a id='line_585'>Meantime the lyre rejoins the sprightly lay;</a>
<a id='line_586'>Love-dittied airs, and dance, conclude the day</a>

<a id='line_617'></a>
<a id='line_618'>ARGUMENT.</a>
<a id='line_619'></a>
<a id='line_620'>THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.</a>
<a id='line_621'></a>
<a id='line_622'>Telemachus in the assembly of the lords of Ithaca complains of the</a>
<a id='line_623'>injustice done him by the suitors, and insists upon their</a>
<a id='line_624'>departure from his palace; appealing to the princes, and exciting</a>
<a id='line_625'>the people to declare against them. The suitors endeavour to</a>
<a id='line_626'>justify their stay, at least till he shall send the queen to the</a>
<a id='line_627'>court of Icarius her father; which he refuses. There appears a</a>
<a id='line_628'>prodigy of two eagles in the sky, which an augur expounds to the</a>
<a id='line_629'>ruin of the suitors. Telemachus the demands a vessel to carry him</a>
<a id='line_630'>to Pylos and Sparta, there to inquire of his father's fortunes.</a>
<a id='line_631'>Pallas, in the shape of Mentor (an ancient friend of Ulysses),</a>
<a id='line_632'>helps him to a ship, assists him in preparing necessaries for the</a>
<a id='line_633'>voyage, and embarks with him that night; which concludes the</a>
<a id='line_634'>second day from the opening of the poem. The scene continues in</a>
<a id='line_635'>the palace of Ulysses, in Ithaca.</a>
<a id='line_636'></a>
<a id='line_637'></a>
<a id='line_638'></a>
<a id='line_639'>Now reddening from the dawn, the morning ray</a>
<a id='line_640'>Glow'd in the front of heaven, and gave the day</a>
<a id='line_641'>The youthful hero, with returning light,</a>
<a id='line_642'>Rose anxious from the inquietudes of night.</a>
<a id='line_643'>A royal robe he wore with graceful pride,</a>
<a id='line_644'>A two-edged falchion threaten'd by his side,</a>
<a id='line_645'>Embroider'd sandals glitter'd as he trod,</a>
<a id='line_646'>And forth he moved, majestic as a god.</a>
<a id='line_647'>Then by his heralds, restless of delay,</a>
<a id='line_648'>To council calls the peers: the peers obey.</a>
<a id='line_649'>Soon as in solemn form the assembly sate,</a>
<a id='line_650'>From his high dome himself descends in state.</a>
<a id='line_651'>Bright in his hand a ponderous javelin shined;</a>
<a id='line_652'>Two dogs, a faithful guard, attend behind;</a>
<a id='line_653'>Pallas with grace divine his form improves,</a>
<a id='line_654'>And gazing crowds admire him as he moves,</a>
<a id='line_655'></a>
<a id='line_656'>His father's throne he fill'd; while distant stood</a>
<a id='line_657'>The hoary peers, and aged wisdom bow'd.</a>
<a id='line_658'></a>
<a id='line_659'>'Twas silence all.  At last AEgyptius spoke;</a>
<a id='line_660'>AEgyptius, by his age and sorrow broke;</a>
<a id='line_661'>A length of days his soul with prudence crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_662'>A length of days had bent him to the ground.</a>
<a id='line_663'>His eldest hope in arms to Ilion came,</a>
<a id='line_664'>By great Ulysses taught the path to fame;</a>
<a id='line_665'>But (hapless youth) the hideous Cyclops tore</a>
<a id='line_666'>His quivering limbs, and quaff'd his spouting gore.</a>
<a id='line_667'>Three sons remain'd; to climb with haughty fires</a>
<a id='line_668'>The royal bed, Eurynomus aspires;</a>
<a id='line_669'>The rest with duteous love his griefs assuage,</a>
<a id='line_670'>And ease the sire of half the cares of age.</a>
<a id='line_671'>Yet still his Antiphus he loves, he mourns,</a>
<a id='line_672'>And, as he stood, he spoke and wept by turns,</a>
<a id='line_673'></a>
<a id='line_674'>"Since great Ulysses sought the Phrygian plains,</a>
<a id='line_675'>Within these walls inglorious silence reigns.</a>
<a id='line_676'>Say then, ye peers! by whose commands we meet?</a>
<a id='line_677'>Why here once more in solemn council sit?</a>
<a id='line_678'>Ye young, ye old, the weighty cause disclose:</a>
<a id='line_679'>Arrives some message of invading foes?</a>
<a id='line_680'>Or say, does high necessity of state</a>
<a id='line_681'>Inspire some patriot, and demand debate?</a>
<a id='line_682'>The present synod speaks its author wise;</a>
<a id='line_683'>Assist him, Jove, thou regent of the skies!"</a>
<a id='line_684'></a>
<a id='line_685'>He spoke. Telemachus with transport glows,</a>
<a id='line_686'>Embraced the omen, and majestic rose</a>
<a id='line_687'>(His royal hand the imperial sceptre sway'd);</a>
<a id='line_688'>Then thus, addressing to AEgyptius, said:</a>
<a id='line_689'></a>
<a id='line_690'>"Reverend old man! lo here confess'd he stands</a>
<a id='line_691'>By whom ye meet; my grief your care demands.</a>
<a id='line_692'>No story I unfold of public woes,</a>
<a id='line_693'>Nor bear advices of impending foes:</a>
<a id='line_694'>Peace the blest land, and joys incessant crown:</a>
<a id='line_695'>Of all this happy realm, I grieve alone.</a>
<a id='line_696'>For my lost sire continual sorrows spring,</a>
<a id='line_697'>The great, the good; your father and your king.</a>
<a id='line_698'>Yet more; our house from its foundation bows,</a>
<a id='line_699'>Our foes are powerful, and your sons the foes;</a>
<a id='line_700'>Hither, unwelcome to the queen, they come;</a>
<a id='line_701'>Why seek they not the rich Icarian dome?</a>
<a id='line_702'>If she must wed, from other hands require</a>
<a id='line_703'>The dowry: is Telemachus her sire?</a>
<a id='line_704'>Yet through my court the noise of revel rings,</a>
<a id='line_705'>And waste the wise frugality of kings.</a>
<a id='line_706'>Scarce all my herds their luxury suffice;</a>
<a id='line_707'>Scarce all my wine their midnight hours supplies.</a>
<a id='line_708'>Safe in my youth, in riot still they grow,</a>
<a id='line_709'>Nor in the helpless orphan dread a foe.</a>
<a id='line_710'>But come it will, the time when manhood grants</a>
<a id='line_711'>More powerful advocates than vain complaints.</a>
<a id='line_712'>Approach that hour! insufferable wrong</a>
<a id='line_713'>Cries to the gods, and vengeance sleeps too long.</a>
<a id='line_714'>Rise then, ye peers! with virtuous anger rise;</a>
<a id='line_715'>Your fame revere, but most the avenging skies.</a>
<a id='line_716'>By all the deathless powers that reign above,</a>
<a id='line_717'>By righteous Themis and by thundering Jove</a>
<a id='line_718'>(Themis, who gives to councils, or denies</a>
<a id='line_719'>Success; and humbles, or confirms the wise),</a>
<a id='line_720'>Rise in my aid! suffice the tears that flow</a>
<a id='line_721'>For my lost sire, nor add new woe to woe.</a>
<a id='line_722'>If e'er he bore the sword to strengthen ill,</a>
<a id='line_723'>Or, having power to wrong, betray'd the will,</a>
<a id='line_724'>On me, on me your kindled wrath assuage,</a>
<a id='line_725'>And bid the voice of lawless riot rage.</a>
<a id='line_726'>If ruin to your royal race ye doom,</a>
<a id='line_727'>Be you the spoilers, and our wealth consume.</a>
<a id='line_728'>Then might we hope redress from juster laws,</a>
<a id='line_729'>And raise all Ithaca to aid our cause:</a>
<a id='line_730'>But while your sons commit the unpunish'd wrong,</a>
<a id='line_731'>You make the arm of violence too strong."</a>
<a id='line_732'></a>
<a id='line_733'>While thus he spoke, with rage and grief he frown'd,</a>
<a id='line_734'>And dash'd the imperial sceptre to the ground.</a>
<a id='line_735'>The big round tear hung trembling in his eye:</a>
<a id='line_736'>The synod grieved, and gave a pitying sigh,</a>
<a id='line_737'>Then silent sate--at length Antinous burns</a>
<a id='line_738'>With haughty rage, and sternly thus returns:</a>
<a id='line_739'></a>
<a id='line_740'>"O insolence of youth! whose tongue affords</a>
<a id='line_741'>Such railing eloquence, and war of words.</a>
<a id='line_742'>Studious thy country's worthies to defame,</a>
<a id='line_743'>Thy erring voice displays thy mother's shame.</a>
<a id='line_744'>Elusive of the bridal day, she gives</a>
<a id='line_745'>Fond hopes to all, and all with hopes deceives.</a>
<a id='line_746'>Did not the sun, through heaven's wide azure roll'd,</a>
<a id='line_747'>For three long years the royal fraud behold?</a>
<a id='line_748'>While she, laborious in delusion, spread</a>
<a id='line_749'>The spacious loom, and mix'd the various thread:</a>
<a id='line_750'>Where as to life the wondrous figures rise,</a>
<a id='line_751'>Thus spoke the inventive queen, with artful sighs:</a>
<a id='line_752'></a>
<a id='line_753'>"Though cold in death Ulysses breathes no more,</a>
<a id='line_754'>Cease yet awhile to urge the bridal hour:</a>
<a id='line_755'>Cease, till to great Laertes I bequeath</a>
<a id='line_756'>A task of grief, his ornaments of death.</a>
<a id='line_757'>Lest when the Fates his royal ashes claim,</a>
<a id='line_758'>The Grecian matrons taint my spotless fame;</a>
<a id='line_759'>When he, whom living mighty realms obey'd,</a>
<a id='line_760'>Shall want in death a shroud to grace his shade.'</a>
<a id='line_761'></a>
<a id='line_762'>"Thus she: at once the generous train complies,</a>
<a id='line_763'>Nor fraud mistrusts in virtue's fair disguise.</a>
<a id='line_764'>The work she plied; but, studious of delay,</a>
<a id='line_765'>By night reversed the labours of the day.</a>
<a id='line_766'>While thrice the sun his annual journey made,</a>
<a id='line_767'>The conscious lamp the midnight fraud survey'd;</a>
<a id='line_768'>Unheard, unseen, three years her arts prevail;</a>
<a id='line_769'>The fourth her maid unfolds the amazing tale.</a>
<a id='line_770'>We saw, as unperceived we took our stand,</a>
<a id='line_771'>The backward labours of her faithless hand.</a>
<a id='line_772'>Then urged, she perfects her illustrious toils;</a>
<a id='line_773'>A wondrous monument of female wiles!</a>
<a id='line_774'></a>
<a id='line_775'>"But you, O peers! and thou, O prince! give ear</a>
<a id='line_776'>(I speak aloud, that every Greek may hear):</a>
<a id='line_777'>Dismiss the queen; and if her sire approves</a>
<a id='line_778'>Let him espouse her to the peer she loves:</a>
<a id='line_779'>Bid instant to prepare the bridal train,</a>
<a id='line_780'>Nor let a race of princes wait in vain.</a>
<a id='line_781'>Though with a grace divine her soul is blest,</a>
<a id='line_782'>And all Minerva breathes within her breast,</a>
<a id='line_783'>In wondrous arts than woman more renown'd,</a>
<a id='line_784'>And more than woman with deep wisdom crown'd;</a>
<a id='line_785'>Though Tyro nor Mycene match her name,</a>
<a id='line_786'>Not great Alemena (the proud boasts of fame);</a>
<a id='line_787'>Yet thus by heaven adorn'd, by heaven's decree</a>
<a id='line_788'>She shines with fatal excellence, to thee:</a>
<a id='line_789'>With thee, the bowl we drain, indulge the feast,</a>
<a id='line_790'>Till righteous heaven reclaim her stubborn breast.</a>
<a id='line_791'>What though from pole to pole resounds her name!</a>
<a id='line_792'>The son's destruction waits the mother's fame:</a>
<a id='line_793'>For, till she leaves thy court, it is decreed,</a>
<a id='line_794'>Thy bowl to empty and thy flock to bleed."</a>
<a id='line_795'></a>
<a id='line_796'>While yet he speaks, Telemachus replies:</a>
<a id='line_797'>"Ev'n nature starts, and what ye ask denies.</a>
<a id='line_798'>Thus, shall I thus repay a mother's cares,</a>
<a id='line_799'>Who gave me life, and nursed my infant years!</a>
<a id='line_800'>While sad on foreign shores Ulysses treads.</a>
<a id='line_801'>Or glides a ghost with unapparent shades;</a>
<a id='line_802'>How to Icarius in the bridal hour</a>
<a id='line_803'>Shall I, by waste undone, refund the dower?</a>
<a id='line_804'>How from my father should I vengeance dread!</a>
<a id='line_805'>How would my mother curse my hated head!</a>
<a id='line_806'>And while In wrath to vengeful fiends she cries,</a>
<a id='line_807'>How from their hell would vengeful fiends arise!</a>
<a id='line_808'>Abhorr'd by all, accursed my name would grow,</a>
<a id='line_809'>The earth's disgrace, and human-kind my foe.</a>
<a id='line_810'>If this displease, why urge ye here your stay?</a>
<a id='line_811'>Haste from the court, ye spoilers, haste away:</a>
<a id='line_812'>Waste in wild riot what your land allows,</a>
<a id='line_813'>There ply the early feast, and late carouse.</a>
<a id='line_814'>But if to honour lost, 'tis still decreed</a>
<a id='line_815'>For you my bowl shall flow, my flocks shall bleed;</a>
<a id='line_816'>Judge, and assert my right, impartial Jove!</a>
<a id='line_817'>By him, and all the immortal host above</a>
<a id='line_818'>(A sacred oath), if heaven the power supply,</a>
<a id='line_819'>Vengeance I vow, and for your wrongs ye die."</a>
<a id='line_820'></a>
<a id='line_821'>With that, two eagles from a mountain's height</a>
<a id='line_822'>By Jove's command direct their rapid flight;</a>
<a id='line_823'>Swift they descend, with wing to wing conjoin'd,</a>
<a id='line_824'>Stretch their broad plumes, and float upon the wind.</a>
<a id='line_825'>Above the assembled peers they wheel on high,</a>
<a id='line_826'>And clang their wings, and hovering beat the sky;</a>
<a id='line_827'>With ardent eyes the rival train they threat,</a>
<a id='line_828'>And shrieking loud denounce approaching fate.</a>
<a id='line_829'>They cuff, they tear; their cheeks and neck they rend,</a>
<a id='line_830'>And from their plumes huge drops of blood descend;</a>
<a id='line_831'>Then sailing o'er the domes and towers, they fly,</a>
<a id='line_832'>Full toward the east, and mount into the sky.</a>
<a id='line_833'></a>
<a id='line_834'>The wondering rivals gaze, with cares oppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_835'>And chilling horrors freeze in every breast,</a>
<a id='line_836'>Till big with knowledge of approaching woes,</a>
<a id='line_837'>The prince of augurs, Halitherses, rose:</a>
<a id='line_838'>Prescient he view'd the aerial tracks, and drew</a>
<a id='line_839'>A sure presage from every wing that flew.</a>
<a id='line_840'></a>
<a id='line_841'>"Ye sons (he cried) of Ithaca, give ear;</a>
<a id='line_842'>Hear all! but chiefly you, O rivals! hear.</a>
<a id='line_843'>Destruction sure o'er all your heads impends</a>
<a id='line_844'>Ulysses comes, and death his steps attends.</a>
<a id='line_845'>Nor to the great alone is death decreed;</a>
<a id='line_846'>We and our guilty Ithaca must bleed.</a>
<a id='line_847'>Why cease we then the wrath of heaven to stay?</a>
<a id='line_848'>Be humbled all, and lead, ye great! the way.</a>
<a id='line_849'>For lo my words no fancied woes relate;</a>
<a id='line_850'>I speak from science and the voice of fate.</a>
<a id='line_851'></a>
<a id='line_852'>"When great Ulysses sought the Phrygian shores</a>
<a id='line_853'>To shake with war proud Ilion's lofty towers,</a>
<a id='line_854'>Deeds then undone my faithful tongue foretold:</a>
<a id='line_855'>Heaven seal'd my words, and you those deeds behold.</a>
<a id='line_856'>I see (I cried) his woes, a countless train;</a>
<a id='line_857'>I see his friends o'erwhelm'd beneath the main;</a>
<a id='line_858'>How twice ten years from shore to shore he roams:</a>
<a id='line_859'>Now twice ten years are past, and now he comes!"</a>
<a id='line_860'></a>
<a id='line_861'>To whom Eurymachus--"Fly, dotard fly,</a>
<a id='line_862'>With thy wise dreams, and fables of the sky.</a>
<a id='line_863'>Go prophesy at home, thy sons advise:</a>
<a id='line_864'>Here thou art sage in vain--I better read the skies</a>
<a id='line_865'>Unnumber'd birds glide through the aerial way;</a>
<a id='line_866'>Vagrants of air, and unforeboding stray.</a>
<a id='line_867'>Cold in the tomb, or in the deeps below,</a>
<a id='line_868'>Ulysses lies; oh wert thou laid as low!</a>
<a id='line_869'>Then would that busy head no broils suggest,</a>
<a id='line_870'>For fire to rage Telemachus' breast,</a>
<a id='line_871'>From him some bribe thy venal tongue requires,</a>
<a id='line_872'>And interest, not the god, thy voice inspires.</a>
<a id='line_873'>His guideless youth, if thy experienced age</a>
<a id='line_874'>Mislead fallacious into idle rage,</a>
<a id='line_875'>Vengeance deserved thy malice shall repress.</a>
<a id='line_876'>And but augment the wrongs thou would'st redress,</a>
<a id='line_877'>Telemachus may bid the queen repair</a>
<a id='line_878'>To great Icarius, whose paternal care</a>
<a id='line_879'>Will guide her passion, and reward her choice</a>
<a id='line_880'>With wealthy dower, and bridal gifts of price.</a>
<a id='line_881'>Till she retires, determined we remain,</a>
<a id='line_882'>And both the prince and augur threat in vain:</a>
<a id='line_883'>His pride of words, and thy wild dream of fate,</a>
<a id='line_884'>Move not the brave, or only move their hate,</a>
<a id='line_885'>Threat on, O prince! elude the bridal day.</a>
<a id='line_886'>Threat on, till all thy stores in waste decay.</a>
<a id='line_887'>True, Greece affords a train of lovely dames,</a>
<a id='line_888'>In wealth and beauty worthy of our flames:</a>
<a id='line_889'>But never from this nobler suit we cease;</a>
<a id='line_890'>For wealth and beauty less than virtue please."</a>
<a id='line_891'></a>
<a id='line_892'>To whom the youth: "Since then in vain I tell</a>
<a id='line_893'>My numerous woes, in silence let them dwell.</a>
<a id='line_894'>But Heaven, and all the Greeks, have heard my wrongs;</a>
<a id='line_895'>To Heaven, and all the Greeks, redress belongs;</a>
<a id='line_896'>Yet this I ask (nor be it ask'd in vain),</a>
<a id='line_897'>A bark to waft me o'er the rolling main,</a>
<a id='line_898'>The realms of Pyle and Sparta to explore,</a>
<a id='line_899'>And seek my royal sire from shore to shore;</a>
<a id='line_900'>If, or to fame his doubtful fate be known,</a>
<a id='line_901'>Or to be learn'd from oracles alone,</a>
<a id='line_902'>If yet he lives, with patience I forbear,</a>
<a id='line_903'>Till the fleet hours restore the circling year;</a>
<a id='line_904'>But if already wandering in the train</a>
<a id='line_905'>Of empty shades, I measure back the main,</a>
<a id='line_906'>Plant the fair column o'er the mighty dead,</a>
<a id='line_907'>And yield his consort to the nuptial bed."</a>
<a id='line_908'></a>
<a id='line_909'>He ceased; and while abash'd the peers attend,</a>
<a id='line_910'>Mentor arose, Ulysses' faithful friend:</a>
<a id='line_911'>(When fierce in arms he sought the scenes of war,</a>
<a id='line_912'>"My friend (he cried), my palace be thy care;</a>
<a id='line_913'>Years roll'd on years my godlike sire decay,</a>
<a id='line_914'>Guard thou his age, and his behests obey.")</a>
<a id='line_915'>Stern as he rose, he cast his eyes around,</a>
<a id='line_916'>That flash'd with rage; and as spoke, he frown'd,</a>
<a id='line_917'></a>
<a id='line_918'>"O never, never more let king be just,</a>
<a id='line_919'>Be mild in power, or faithful to his trust!</a>
<a id='line_920'>Let tyrants govern with an iron rod,</a>
<a id='line_921'>Oppress, destroy, and be the scourge of God;</a>
<a id='line_922'>Since he who like a father held his reign,</a>
<a id='line_923'>So soon forgot, was just and mild in vain!</a>
<a id='line_924'>True, while my friend is grieved, his griefs I share;</a>
<a id='line_925'>Yet now the rivals are my smallest care:</a>
<a id='line_926'>They for the mighty mischiefs they devise,</a>
<a id='line_927'>Ere long shall pay--their forfeit lives the price.</a>
<a id='line_928'>But against you, ye Greeks! ye coward train!</a>
<a id='line_929'>Gods! how my soul is moved with just disdain!</a>
<a id='line_930'>Dumb ye all stand, and not one tongue affords</a>
<a id='line_931'>His injured prince the little aid of words."</a>
<a id='line_932'></a>
<a id='line_933'>While yet he spoke, Leocritus rejoined:</a>
<a id='line_934'>"O pride of words, and arrogance of mind!</a>
<a id='line_935'>Would'st thou to rise in arms the Greeks advise?</a>
<a id='line_936'>Join all your powers? in arms, ye Greeks, arise!</a>
<a id='line_937'>Yet would your powers in vain our strength oppose.</a>
<a id='line_938'>The valiant few o'ermatch a host of foes.</a>
<a id='line_939'>Should great Ulysses stern appear in arms,</a>
<a id='line_940'>While the bowl circles and the banquet warms;</a>
<a id='line_941'>Though to his breast his spouse with transport flies,</a>
<a id='line_942'>Torn from her breast, that hour, Ulysses dies.</a>
<a id='line_943'>But hence retreating to your domes repair.</a>
<a id='line_944'>To arm the vessel, Mentor! be thy care,</a>
<a id='line_945'>And Halitherses! thine: be each his friend;</a>
<a id='line_946'>Ye loved the father: go, the son attend.</a>
<a id='line_947'>But yet, I trust, the boaster means to stay</a>
<a id='line_948'>Safe in the court, nor tempt the watery way."</a>
<a id='line_949'></a>
<a id='line_950'>Then, with a rushing sound the assembly bend</a>
<a id='line_951'>Diverse their steps: the rival rout ascend</a>
<a id='line_952'>The royal dome; while sad the prince explores</a>
<a id='line_953'>The neighbouring main, and sorrowing treads the shores.</a>
<a id='line_954'>There, as the waters o'er his hands he shed,</a>
<a id='line_955'>The royal suppliant to Minerva pray'd:</a>
<a id='line_956'></a>
<a id='line_957'>"O goddess! who descending from the skies</a>
<a id='line_958'>Vouchsafed thy presence to my wondering eyes,</a>
<a id='line_959'>By whose commands the raging deeps I trace,</a>
<a id='line_960'>And seek my sire through storms and rolling seas!</a>
<a id='line_961'>Hear from thy heavens above, O warrior maid!</a>
<a id='line_962'>Descend once more, propitious to my aid.</a>
<a id='line_963'>Without thy presence, vain is thy command:</a>
<a id='line_964'>Greece, and the rival train, thy voice withstand."</a>
<a id='line_965'></a>
<a id='line_966'>Indulgent to his prayer, the goddess took</a>
<a id='line_967'>Sage Mentor's form, and thus like Mentor spoke:</a>
<a id='line_968'></a>
<a id='line_969'>"O prince, in early youth divinely wise,</a>
<a id='line_970'>Born, the Ulysses of thy age to rise</a>
<a id='line_971'>If to the son the father's worth descends,</a>
<a id='line_972'>O'er the wide wave success thy ways attends</a>
<a id='line_973'>To tread the walks of death he stood prepared;</a>
<a id='line_974'>And what he greatly thought, he nobly dared.</a>
<a id='line_975'>Were not wise sons descendant of the wise,</a>
<a id='line_976'>And did not heroes from brave heroes rise,</a>
<a id='line_977'>Vain were my hopes: few sons attain the praise</a>
<a id='line_978'>Of their great sires, and most their sires disgrace.</a>
<a id='line_979'>But since thy veins paternal virtue fires,</a>
<a id='line_980'>And all Penelope thy soul inspires,</a>
<a id='line_981'>Go, and succeed: the rivals' aims despise;</a>
<a id='line_982'>For never, never wicked man was wise.</a>
<a id='line_983'>Blind they rejoice, though now, ev'n now they fall;</a>
<a id='line_984'>Death hastes amain: one hour o'erwhelms them all!</a>
<a id='line_985'>And lo, with speed we plough the watery way;</a>
<a id='line_986'>My power shall guard thee, and my hand convey:</a>
<a id='line_987'>The winged vessel studious I prepare,</a>
<a id='line_988'>Through seas and realms companion of thy care.</a>
<a id='line_989'>Thou to the court ascend: and to the shores</a>
<a id='line_990'>(When night advances) bear the naval stores;</a>
<a id='line_991'>Bread, that decaying man with strength supplies,</a>
<a id='line_992'>And generous wine, which thoughtful sorrow flies.</a>
<a id='line_993'>Meanwhile the mariners, by my command,</a>
<a id='line_994'>Shall speed aboard, a valiant chosen band.</a>
<a id='line_995'>Wide o'er the bay, by vessel vessel rides;</a>
<a id='line_996'>The best I choose to waft then o'er the tides."</a>
<a id='line_997'></a>
<a id='line_998'>She spoke: to his high dome the prince returns,</a>
<a id='line_999'>And, as he moves, with royal anguish mourns.</a>
<a id='line_1000'>'Twas riot all, among the lawless train;</a>
<a id='line_1001'>Boar bled by boar, and goat by goat lay slain.</a>
<a id='line_1002'>Arrived, his hand the gay Antinous press'd,</a>
<a id='line_1003'>And thus deriding, with a smile address'd:</a>
<a id='line_1004'></a>
<a id='line_1005'>"Grieve not, O daring prince! that noble heart;</a>
<a id='line_1006'>Ill suits gay youth the stern heroic part.</a>
<a id='line_1007'>Indulge the genial hour, unbend thy soul,</a>
<a id='line_1008'>Leave thought to age, and drain the flowing bowl.</a>
<a id='line_1009'>Studious to ease thy grief, our care provides</a>
<a id='line_1010'>The bark, to waft thee o'er the swelling tides."</a>
<a id='line_1011'></a>
<a id='line_1012'>"Is this (returns the prince) for mirth a time?</a>
<a id='line_1013'>When lawless gluttons riot, mirth's a crime;</a>
<a id='line_1014'>The luscious wines, dishonour'd, lose their taste;</a>
<a id='line_1015'>The song is noise, and impious is the feast.</a>

<a id='line_1025'>And where on earth I live, I live your foe."</a>
<a id='line_1026'></a>
<a id='line_1027'>He spoke and frown'd, nor longer deign'd to stay,</a>
<a id='line_1028'>Sternly his hand withdrew, and strode away.</a>
<a id='line_1029'></a>
<a id='line_1030'>Meantime, o'er all the dome, they quaff, they feast,</a>
<a id='line_1031'>Derisive taunts were spread from guest to guest,</a>
<a id='line_1032'>And each in jovial mood his mate address'd:</a>
<a id='line_1033'></a>
<a id='line_1034'>"Tremble ye not, O friends, and coward fly,</a>
<a id='line_1035'>Doom'd by the stern Telemachus to die?</a>
<a id='line_1036'>To Pyle or Sparta to demand supplies,</a>
<a id='line_1037'>Big with revenge, the mighty warrior flies;</a>
<a id='line_1038'>Or comes from Ephyre with poisons fraught,</a>
<a id='line_1039'>And kills us all in one tremendous draught!"</a>
<a id='line_1040'></a>
<a id='line_1041'>"Or who can say (his gamesome mate replies)</a>
<a id='line_1042'>But, while the danger of the deeps he tries</a>
<a id='line_1043'>He, like his sire, may sink deprived of breath,</a>
<a id='line_1044'>And punish us unkindly by his death?</a>
<a id='line_1045'>What mighty labours would he then create,</a>
<a id='line_1046'>To seize his treasures, and divide his state,</a>
<a id='line_1047'>The royal palace to the queen convey,</a>
<a id='line_1048'>Or him she blesses in the bridal day!"</a>
<a id='line_1049'></a>
<a id='line_1050'>Meantime the lofty rooms the prince surveys,</a>
<a id='line_1051'>Where lay the treasures of the Ithacian race:</a>
<a id='line_1052'>Here ruddy brass and gold refulgent blazed;</a>
<a id='line_1053'>There polished chests embroider'd vestures graced;</a>
<a id='line_1054'>Here jars of oil breathed forth a rich perfume;</a>
<a id='line_1055'>There casks of wine in rows adorn'd the dome</a>
<a id='line_1056'>(Pure flavorous wine, by gods in bounty given</a>
<a id='line_1057'>And worthy to exalt the feasts of heaven).</a>
<a id='line_1058'>Untouch'd they stood, till, his long labours o'er,</a>
<a id='line_1059'>The great Ulysses reach'd his native shore.</a>
<a id='line_1060'>A double strength of bars secured the gates;</a>
<a id='line_1061'>Fast by the door the wise Euryclea waits;</a>
<a id='line_1062'>Euryclea, who great Ops! thy lineage shared,</a>
<a id='line_1063'>And watch'd all night, all day, a faithful guard.</a>
<a id='line_1064'></a>
<a id='line_1065'>To whom the prince: "O thou whose guardian care</a>
<a id='line_1066'>Nursed the most wretched king that breathes the air;</a>
<a id='line_1067'>Untouch'd and sacred may these vessels stand,</a>
<a id='line_1068'>Till great Ulysses views his native land.</a>
<a id='line_1069'>But by thy care twelve urns of wine be fill'd;</a>
<a id='line_1070'>Next these in worth, and firm these urns be seal'd;</a>
<a id='line_1071'>And twice ten measures of the choicest flour</a>
<a id='line_1072'>Prepared, are yet descends the evening hour.</a>
<a id='line_1073'>For when the favouring shades of night arise,</a>
<a id='line_1074'>And peaceful slumbers close my mother's eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1075'>Me from our coast shall spreading sails convey,</a>
<a id='line_1076'>To seek Ulysses through the watery way."</a>
<a id='line_1077'></a>
<a id='line_1078'>While yet he spoke, she fill'd the walls with cries,</a>
<a id='line_1079'>And tears ran trickling from her aged eyes.</a>
<a id='line_1080'>"O whither, whither flies my son (she cried)</a>
<a id='line_1081'>To realms; that rocks and roaring seas divide?</a>
<a id='line_1082'>In foreign lands thy father's days decay'd.</a>
<a id='line_1083'>And foreign lands contain the mighty dead.</a>
<a id='line_1084'>The watery way ill-fated if thou try,</a>
<a id='line_1085'>All, all must perish, and by fraud you die!</a>
<a id='line_1086'>Then stay, my, child! storms beat, and rolls the main,</a>
<a id='line_1087'>Oh, beat those storms, and roll the seas in vain!"</a>
<a id='line_1088'></a>
<a id='line_1089'>"Far hence (replied the prince) thy fears be driven:</a>
<a id='line_1090'>Heaven calls me forth; these counsels are of Heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1091'>But, by the powers that hate the perjured, swear,</a>
<a id='line_1092'>To keep my voyage from the royal ear,</a>
<a id='line_1093'>Nor uncompell'd the dangerous truth betray,</a>
<a id='line_1094'>Till twice six times descends the lamp of day,</a>
<a id='line_1095'>Lest the sad tale a mother's life impair,</a>
<a id='line_1096'>And grief destroy what time awhile would spare."</a>
<a id='line_1097'></a>
<a id='line_1098'>Thus he. The matron with uplifted eyes</a>
<a id='line_1099'>Attests the all-seeing sovereign of the skies.</a>
<a id='line_1100'>Then studious she prepares the choicest flour,</a>
<a id='line_1101'>The strength of wheat and wines an ample store.</a>
<a id='line_1102'>While to the rival train the prince returns,</a>
<a id='line_1103'>The martial goddess with impatience burns;</a>
<a id='line_1104'>Like thee, Telemachus, in voice and size,</a>
<a id='line_1105'>With speed divine from street to street she flies,</a>
<a id='line_1106'>She bids the mariners prepared to stand,</a>
<a id='line_1107'>When night descends, embodied on the strand.</a>
<a id='line_1108'>Then to Noemon swift she runs, she flies,</a>
<a id='line_1109'>And asks a bark: the chief a bark supplies.</a>
<a id='line_1110'></a>
<a id='line_1111'>And now, declining with his sloping wheels,</a>
<a id='line_1112'>Down sunk the sun behind the western hills</a>
<a id='line_1113'>The goddess shoved the vessel from the shores,</a>
<a id='line_1114'>And stow'd within its womb the naval stores,</a>
<a id='line_1115'>Full in the openings of the spacious main</a>
<a id='line_1116'>It rides; and now descends the sailor-train,</a>
<a id='line_1117'></a>
<a id='line_1118'>Next, to the court, impatient of delay.</a>
<a id='line_1119'>With rapid step the goddess urged her way;</a>
<a id='line_1120'>There every eye with slumberous chains she bound,</a>
<a id='line_1121'>And dash'd the flowing goblet to the ground.</a>
<a id='line_1122'>Drowsy they rose, with heavy fumes oppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_1123'>Reel'd from the palace, and retired to rest.</a>
<a id='line_1124'>Then thus, in Mentor's reverend form array'd,</a>
<a id='line_1125'>Spoke to Telemachus the martial maid.</a>
<a id='line_1126'>"Lo! on the seas, prepared the vessel stands,</a>
<a id='line_1127'>The impatient mariner thy speed demands."</a>
<a id='line_1128'>Swift as she spoke, with rapid pace she leads;</a>
<a id='line_1129'>The footsteps of the deity he treads.</a>
<a id='line_1130'>Swift to the shore they move along the strand;</a>
<a id='line_1131'>The ready vessel rides, the sailors ready stand.</a>
<a id='line_1132'></a>
<a id='line_1133'>He bids them bring their stores; the attending train</a>
<a id='line_1134'>Load the tall bark, and launch into the main,</a>
<a id='line_1135'>The prince and goddess to the stern ascend;</a>
<a id='line_1136'>To the strong stroke at once the rowers bend.</a>
<a id='line_1137'>Full from the west she bids fresh breezes blow;</a>
<a id='line_1138'>The sable billows foam and roar below.</a>
<a id='line_1139'>The chief his orders gives; the obedient band</a>
<a id='line_1140'>With due observance wait the chief's command;</a>
<a id='line_1141'>With speed the mast they rear, with speed unbind</a>
<a id='line_1142'>The spacious sheet, and stretch it to the wind.</a>
<a id='line_1143'>High o'er the roaring waves the spreading sails</a>
<a id='line_1144'>Bow the tall mast, and swell before the gales;</a>
<a id='line_1145'>The crooked keel the parting surge divides,</a>
<a id='line_1146'>And to the stern retreating roll the tides.</a>
<a id='line_1147'>And now they ship their oars, and crown with wine</a>
<a id='line_1148'>The holy goblet to the powers divine:</a>
<a id='line_1149'>Imploring all the gods that reign above,</a>
<a id='line_1150'>But chief the blue-eyed progeny of Jove.</a>
<a id='line_1151'></a>
<a id='line_1152'>Thus all the night they stem the liquid way,</a>
<a id='line_1153'>And end their voyage with the morning ray.</a>

<a id='line_1157'>BOOK III</a>
<a id='line_1158'></a>
<a id='line_1159'>ARGUMENT</a>
<a id='line_1160'></a>
<a id='line_1161'>THE INTERVIEW OF TELEMACHUS AND NESTOR.</a>
<a id='line_1162'></a>
<a id='line_1163'>Telemachus, guided by Pallas in the shape of Mentor, arrives in</a>
<a id='line_1164'>the morning at Pylos, where Nestor and his sons are sacrificing on</a>
<a id='line_1165'>the sea-shore to Neptune. Telemachus declares the occasion of his</a>
<a id='line_1166'>coming: and Nestor relates what passed in their return from Troy,</a>
<a id='line_1167'>how their fleets were separated, and he never since heard of</a>
<a id='line_1168'>Ulysses. They discourse concerning the death of Agamemnon, the</a>
<a id='line_1169'>revenge of Orestes, and the injuries of the suitors. Nestor</a>
<a id='line_1170'>advises him to go to Sparta, and inquire further of Menelaus. The</a>
<a id='line_1171'>sacrifice ending with the night, Minerva vanishes from them in the</a>
<a id='line_1172'>form of an eagle: Telemachus is lodged in the palace. The next</a>
<a id='line_1173'>morning they sacrifice a bullock to Minerva; and Telemachus</a>
<a id='line_1174'>proceeds on his journey to Sparta, attended by Pisistratus.</a>
<a id='line_1175'></a>
<a id='line_1176'>The scene lies on the sea-shore of Pylos.</a>
<a id='line_1177'></a>
<a id='line_1178'></a>
<a id='line_1179'>The sacred sun, above the waters raised,</a>
<a id='line_1180'>Through heaven's eternal brazen portals blazed;</a>
<a id='line_1181'>And wide o'er earth diffused his cheering ray,</a>
<a id='line_1182'>To gods and men to give the golden day.</a>
<a id='line_1183'>Now on the coast of Pyle the vessel falls,</a>
<a id='line_1184'>Before old Neleus' venerable walls.</a>
<a id='line_1185'>There suppliant to the monarch of the flood,</a>
<a id='line_1186'>At nine green theatres the Pylians stood,</a>
<a id='line_1187'>Each held five hundred (a deputed train),</a>
<a id='line_1188'>At each, nine oxen on the sand lay slain.</a>
<a id='line_1189'>They taste the entrails, and the altars load</a>
<a id='line_1190'>With smoking thighs, an offering to the god.</a>
<a id='line_1191'>Full for the port the Ithacensians stand,</a>
<a id='line_1192'>And furl their sails, and issue on the land.</a>
<a id='line_1193'>Telemachus already press'd the shore;</a>
<a id='line_1194'>Not first, the power of wisdom march'd before,</a>
<a id='line_1195'>And ere the sacrificing throng he join'd,</a>
<a id='line_1196'>Admonish'd thus his well-attending mind:</a>
<a id='line_1197'></a>
<a id='line_1198'>"Proceed, my son! this youthful shame expel;</a>
<a id='line_1199'>An honest business never blush to tell.</a>
<a id='line_1200'>To learn what fates thy wretched sire detain,</a>
<a id='line_1201'>We pass'd the wide immeasurable main.</a>
<a id='line_1202'>Meet then the senior far renown'd for sense</a>
<a id='line_1203'>With reverend awe, but decent confidence:</a>
<a id='line_1204'>Urge him with truth to frame his fair replies;</a>
<a id='line_1205'>And sure he will; for wisdom never lies."</a>
<a id='line_1206'></a>
<a id='line_1207'>"Oh tell me, Mentor! tell me, faithful guide</a>
<a id='line_1208'>(The youth with prudent modesty replied),</a>
<a id='line_1209'>How shall I meet, or how accost the sage,</a>
<a id='line_1210'>Unskill'd in speech, nor yet mature of age?</a>
<a id='line_1211'>Awful th'approach, and hard the task appears,</a>
<a id='line_1212'>To question wisely men of riper years."</a>
<a id='line_1213'></a>
<a id='line_1214'>To whom the martial goddess thus rejoin'd:</a>
<a id='line_1215'>"Search, for some thoughts, thy own suggesting mind;</a>
<a id='line_1216'>And others, dictated by heavenly power,</a>
<a id='line_1217'>Shall rise spontaneous in the needful hour.</a>
<a id='line_1218'>For nought unprosperous shall thy ways attend,</a>
<a id='line_1219'>Born with good omens, and with heaven thy friend."</a>
<a id='line_1220'></a>
<a id='line_1221'>She spoke, and led the way with swiftest speed;</a>
<a id='line_1222'>As swift, the youth pursued the way she led;</a>
<a id='line_1223'>and join'd the band before the sacred fire,</a>
<a id='line_1224'>Where sate, encompass'd with his sons, the sire.</a>
<a id='line_1225'>The youth of Pylos, some on pointed wood</a>
<a id='line_1226'>Transfix'd the fragments, some prepared the food:</a>
<a id='line_1227'>In friendly throngs they gather to embrace</a>
<a id='line_1228'>Their unknown guests, and at the banquet place,</a>
<a id='line_1229'>Pisistratus was first to grasp their hands,</a>
<a id='line_1230'>And spread soft hides upon the yellow sands;</a>
<a id='line_1231'>Along the shore the illustrious pair he led,</a>
<a id='line_1232'>Where Nestor sate with the youthful Thrasymed,</a>
<a id='line_1233'>To each a portion of the feast he bore,</a>
<a id='line_1234'>And held the golden goblet foaming o'er;</a>
<a id='line_1235'>Then first approaching to the elder guest,</a>
<a id='line_1236'>The latent goddess in these words address'd:</a>
<a id='line_1237'>"Whoe'er thou art, from fortune brings to keep</a>
<a id='line_1238'>These rites of Neptune, monarch of the deep,</a>
<a id='line_1239'>Thee first it fits, O stranger!  to prepare</a>
<a id='line_1240'>The due libation and the solemn prayer;</a>
<a id='line_1241'>Then give thy friend to shed the sacred wine;</a>
<a id='line_1242'>Though much thy younger, and his years like mine,</a>
<a id='line_1243'>He too, I deem, implores the power divine;</a>
<a id='line_1244'>For all mankind alike require their grace,</a>
<a id='line_1245'>All born to want; a miserable race!"</a>
<a id='line_1246'>He spake, and to her hand preferr'd the bowl;</a>
<a id='line_1247'>A secret pleasure touch'd Athena's soul,</a>
<a id='line_1248'>To see the preference due to sacred age</a>
<a id='line_1249'>Regarded ever by the just and sage.</a>
<a id='line_1250'>Of Ocean's king she then implores the grace.</a>
<a id='line_1251'>"O thou! whose arms this ample globe embrace,</a>
<a id='line_1252'>Fulfil our wish, and let thy glory shine</a>
<a id='line_1253'>On Nestor first, and Nestor's royal line;</a>
<a id='line_1254'>Next grant the Pylian states their just desires,</a>
<a id='line_1255'>Pleased with their hecatomb's ascending fires;</a>
<a id='line_1256'>Last, deign Telemachus and me to bless,</a>
<a id='line_1257'>And crown our voyage with desired success."</a>
<a id='line_1258'></a>
<a id='line_1259'>Thus she: and having paid the rite divine,</a>
<a id='line_1260'>Gave to Ulysses' son the rosy wine.</a>
<a id='line_1261'>Suppliant he pray'd. And now the victims dress'd</a>
<a id='line_1262'>They draw, divide, and celebrate the feast.</a>
<a id='line_1263'>The banquet done, the narrative old man,</a>
<a id='line_1264'>Thus mild, the pleasing conference began:</a>
<a id='line_1265'></a>
<a id='line_1266'>"Now gentle guests! the genial banquet o'er,</a>
<a id='line_1267'>It fits to ask ye, what your native shore,</a>
<a id='line_1268'>And whence your race? on what adventure say,</a>
<a id='line_1269'>Thus far you wander through the watery way?</a>
<a id='line_1270'>Relate if business, or the thirst of gain,</a>
<a id='line_1271'>Engage your journey o'er the pathless main</a>
<a id='line_1272'>Where savage pirates seek through seas unknown</a>
<a id='line_1273'>The lives of others, venturous of their own."</a>
<a id='line_1274'></a>
<a id='line_1275'>Urged by the precepts by the goddess given,</a>
<a id='line_1276'>And fill'd with confidence infused from Heaven,</a>
<a id='line_1277'>The youth, whom Pallas destined to be wise</a>
<a id='line_1278'>And famed among the sons of men, replies:</a>
<a id='line_1279'>"Inquir'st thou, father! from what coast we came?</a>
<a id='line_1280'>(Oh grace and glory of the Grecian name!)</a>
<a id='line_1281'>From where high Ithaca o'erlooks the floods,</a>
<a id='line_1282'>Brown with o'er-arching shades and pendent woods</a>
<a id='line_1283'>Us to these shores our filial duty draws,</a>
<a id='line_1284'>A private sorrow, not a public cause.</a>
<a id='line_1285'>My sire I seek, where'er the voice of fame</a>
<a id='line_1286'>Has told the glories of his noble name,</a>
<a id='line_1287'>The great Ulysses; famed from shore to shore</a>
<a id='line_1288'>For valour much, for hardy suffering more.</a>
<a id='line_1289'>Long time with thee before proud Ilion's wall</a>
<a id='line_1290'>In arms he fought; with thee beheld her fall.</a>
<a id='line_1291'>Of all the chiefs, this hero's fate alone</a>
<a id='line_1292'>Has Jove reserved, unheard of, and unknown;</a>
<a id='line_1293'>Whether in fields by hostile fury slain,</a>
<a id='line_1294'>Or sunk by tempests in the gulfy main?</a>
<a id='line_1295'>Of this to learn, oppress'd with tender fears,</a>
<a id='line_1296'>Lo, at thy knee his suppliant son appears.</a>
<a id='line_1297'>If or thy certain eye, or curious ear,</a>
<a id='line_1298'>Have learnt his fate, the whole dark story clear</a>
<a id='line_1299'>And, oh! whate'er Heaven destined to betide,</a>
<a id='line_1300'>Let neither flattery soothe, nor pity hide.</a>
<a id='line_1301'>Prepared I stand: he was but born to try</a>
<a id='line_1302'>The lot of man; to suffer, and to die.</a>
<a id='line_1303'>Oh then, if ever through the ten years' war</a>
<a id='line_1304'>The wise, the good Ulysses claim'd thy care;</a>
<a id='line_1305'>If e'er he join'd thy council, or thy sword,</a>
<a id='line_1306'>True in his deed, and constant to his word;</a>
<a id='line_1307'>Far as thy mind through backward time can see</a>
<a id='line_1308'>Search all thy stores of faithful memory:</a>
<a id='line_1309'>'Tis sacred truth I ask, and ask of thee."</a>
<a id='line_1310'></a>
<a id='line_1311'>To him experienced Nestor thus rejoin'd:</a>
<a id='line_1312'>"O friend! what sorrows dost thou bring to mind!</a>
<a id='line_1313'>Shall I the long, laborious scene review,</a>
<a id='line_1314'>And open all the wounds of Greece anew?</a>
<a id='line_1315'>What toils by sea! where dark in quest of prey</a>
<a id='line_1316'>Dauntless we roved; Achilles led the way;</a>
<a id='line_1317'>What toils by land! where mix'd in fatal fight</a>
<a id='line_1318'>Such numbers fell, such heroes sunk to night;</a>
<a id='line_1319'>There Ajax great, Achilles there the brave,</a>
<a id='line_1320'>There wise Patroclus, fill an early grave:</a>
<a id='line_1321'>There, too, my son--ah, once my best delight</a>
<a id='line_1322'>Once swift of foot, and terrible in fight;</a>
<a id='line_1323'>In whom stern courage with soft virtue join'd</a>
<a id='line_1324'>A faultless body and a blameless mind;</a>
<a id='line_1325'>Antilochus--What more can I relate?</a>
<a id='line_1326'>How trace the tedious series of our fate?</a>
<a id='line_1327'>Not added years on years my task could close,</a>
<a id='line_1328'>The long historian of my country's woes;</a>
<a id='line_1329'>Back to thy native islands might'st thou sail,</a>
<a id='line_1330'>And leave half-heard the melancholy tale.</a>
<a id='line_1331'>Nine painful years on that detested shore;</a>
<a id='line_1332'>What stratagems we form'd, what toils we bore!</a>
<a id='line_1333'>Still labouring on, till scarce at last we found</a>
<a id='line_1334'>Great Jove propitious, and our conquest crown'd.</a>
<a id='line_1335'>Far o'er the rest thy mighty father shined,</a>
<a id='line_1336'>In wit, in prudence, and in force of mind.</a>
<a id='line_1337'>Art thou the son of that illustrious sire?</a>
<a id='line_1338'>With joy I grasp thee, and with love admire.</a>
<a id='line_1339'>So like your voices, and your words so wise,</a>
<a id='line_1340'>Who finds thee younger must consult his eyes.</a>
<a id='line_1341'>Thy sire and I were one; nor varied aught</a>
<a id='line_1342'>In public sentence, or in private thought;</a>
<a id='line_1343'>Alike to council or the assembly came,</a>
<a id='line_1344'>With equal souls, and sentiments the same.</a>
<a id='line_1345'>But when (by wisdom won) proud Ilion burn'd,</a>
<a id='line_1346'>And in their ships the conquering Greeks return'd,</a>
<a id='line_1347'>'Twas God's high will the victors to divide,</a>
<a id='line_1348'>And turn the event, confounding human pride;</a>
<a id='line_1349'>Some be destroy'd, some scatter'd as the dust</a>
<a id='line_1350'>(Not all were prudent, and not all were just).</a>
<a id='line_1351'>Then Discord, sent by Pallas from above,</a>

<a id='line_1358'>Sour with debauch, a reeling tribe the came.</a>
<a id='line_1359'>To these the cause of meeting they explain,</a>
<a id='line_1360'>And Menelaus moves to cross the main;</a>

<a id='line_1364'>The gods not lightly change their love, or hate.</a>
<a id='line_1365'>With ireful taunts each other they oppose,</a>

<a id='line_1370'>(So Jove, that urged us to our fate, ordain'd).</a>
<a id='line_1371'>We with the rising morn our ships unmoor'd,</a>

<a id='line_1373'>But half the people with respect obey'd</a>
<a id='line_1374'>The king of men, and at his bidding stay'd.</a>
<a id='line_1375'>Now on the wings of winds our course we keep</a>
<a id='line_1376'>(For God had smooth'd the waters of the deep);</a>

<a id='line_1394'>And anchor under Mimas' shaggy brow?</a>
<a id='line_1395'>We sought direction of the power divine:</a>
<a id='line_1396'>The god propitious gave the guiding sign;</a>
<a id='line_1397'>Through the mid seas he bid our navy steer,</a>

<a id='line_1399'>The whistling winds already waked the sky;</a>
<a id='line_1400'>Before the whistling winds the vessels fly,</a>
<a id='line_1401'>With rapid swiftness cut the liquid way,</a>
<a id='line_1402'>And reach Gerestus at the point of day.</a>

<a id='line_1513'>But fowls obscene dismember'd his remains,</a>
<a id='line_1514'>And dogs had torn him on the naked plains.</a>
<a id='line_1515'>While us the works of bloody Mars employ'd,</a>
<a id='line_1516'>The wanton youth inglorious peace enjoy'd:</a>
<a id='line_1517'>He stretch'd at ease in Argos' calm recess</a>
<a id='line_1518'>(Whose stately steeds luxuriant pastures bless),</a>
<a id='line_1519'>With flattery's insinuating art</a>
<a id='line_1520'>Soothed the frail queen, and poison'd all her heard.</a>
<a id='line_1521'>At first, with the worthy shame and decent pride,</a>
<a id='line_1522'>The royal dame his lawless suit denied.</a>
<a id='line_1523'>For virtue's image yet possess'd her mind.</a>
<a id='line_1524'>Taught by a master of the tuneful kind;</a>
<a id='line_1525'>Atrides, parting for the Trojan war,</a>
<a id='line_1526'>Consign'd the youthful consort to his care.</a>
<a id='line_1527'>True to his charge, the bard preserved her long</a>
<a id='line_1528'>In honour's limits; such the power of song.</a>
<a id='line_1529'>But when the gods these objects of their hate</a>
<a id='line_1530'>Dragg'd to the destruction by the links of fate;</a>
<a id='line_1531'>The bard they banish'd from his native soil,</a>
<a id='line_1532'>And left all helpless in a desert isle;</a>
<a id='line_1533'>There he, the sweetest of the sacred train,</a>
<a id='line_1534'>Sung dying to the rocks, but sung in vain.</a>
<a id='line_1535'>Then virtue was no more; her guard away,</a>
<a id='line_1536'>She fell, to lust a voluntary prey.</a>
<a id='line_1537'>Even to the temple stalk'd the adulterous spouse,</a>
<a id='line_1538'>With impious thanks, and mockery of the vows,</a>
<a id='line_1539'>With images, with garments, and with gold;</a>
<a id='line_1540'>And odorous fumes from loaded altars roll'd.</a>
<a id='line_1541'>"Meantime from flaming Troy we cut the way</a>
<a id='line_1542'>With Menelaus, through the curling sea.</a>

<a id='line_1544'>Crown'd with the temple of the Athenian dame;</a>
<a id='line_1545'>Atride's pilot, Phrontes, there expired</a>

<a id='line_1557'>Soon as Malae's misty tops arise,</a>
<a id='line_1558'>Sudden the Thunderer blackens all the skies,</a>
<a id='line_1559'>And the winds whistle, and the surges roll</a>
<a id='line_1560'>Mountains on mountains, and obscure the pole.</a>
<a id='line_1561'>The tempest scatters, and divides our fleet;</a>
<a id='line_1562'>Part, the storm urges on the coast of Crete,</a>
<a id='line_1563'>Where winding round the rich Cydonian plain,</a>
<a id='line_1564'>The streams of Jardan issue to the main.</a>
<a id='line_1565'>There stands a rock, high, eminent and steep,</a>
<a id='line_1566'>Whose shaggy brow o'erhangs the shady deep,</a>
<a id='line_1567'>And views Gortyna on the western side;</a>
<a id='line_1568'>On this rough Auster drove the impetuous tide:</a>
<a id='line_1569'>With broken force the billows roll'd away,</a>
<a id='line_1570'>And heaved the fleet into the neighb'ring bay.</a>
<a id='line_1571'>Thus saved from death, the gain'd the Phaestan shores,</a>
<a id='line_1572'>With shatter'd vessels and disabled oars;</a>
<a id='line_1573'>But five tall barks the winds and water toss'd,</a>
<a id='line_1574'>Far from their fellows, on the Aegyptian coast.</a>
<a id='line_1575'>There wander'd Menelaus through foreign shores</a>
<a id='line_1576'>Amassing gold, and gathering naval stores;</a>
<a id='line_1577'>While cursed Aegysthus the detested deed</a>
<a id='line_1578'>By fraud fulfilled, and his great brother bled.</a>
<a id='line_1579'>Seven years, the traitor rich Mycenae sway'd,</a>

<a id='line_1585'>That day, ere yet the bloody triumphs cease,</a>
<a id='line_1586'>Return'd Atrides to the coast of Greece,</a>
<a id='line_1587'>And safe to Argos port his navy brought,</a>
<a id='line_1588'>With gifts of price and ponderous treasure fraught.</a>
<a id='line_1589'>Hence warn'd, my son, beware! nor idly stand</a>

<a id='line_1591'>Lest heedless absence wear thy wealth away,</a>
<a id='line_1592'>While lawless feasters in thy palace away;</a>

<a id='line_1598'>He, wandering long a wider circle made,</a>
<a id='line_1599'>And many-languaged nations has survey'd:</a>
<a id='line_1600'>And measured tracks unknown to other ships,</a>
<a id='line_1601'>Amid the monstrous wonders of the deeps,</a>
<a id='line_1602'>(A length of ocean and unbounded sky.</a>

<a id='line_1604'>Go then; to Sparta take the watery way,</a>
<a id='line_1605'>Thy ship and sailors but for orders stay;</a>

<a id='line_1607'>My steeds, my chariots, and my songs, attend;</a>
<a id='line_1608'>Thee to Atrides they shall safe convey,</a>

<a id='line_1612'>Thus while he speaks the ruddy sun descends,</a>
<a id='line_1613'>And twilight grey her evening shade extends.</a>
<a id='line_1614'>Then thus the blue-eyed maid: "O full of days!</a>

<a id='line_1627'>From bowl to bowl the homely beverage flows;</a>
<a id='line_1628'>While to the final sacrifice they rose.</a>

<a id='line_1632'>The youthful hero and the Athenian maid</a>

<a id='line_1701'>To Pallas high the foaming bowl he crown'd,</a>

<a id='line_1705'>Deep in a rich alcove the prince was laid,</a>
<a id='line_1706'>And slept beneath the pompous colonnade;</a>
<a id='line_1707'>Fast by his side Pisistratus was spread</a>
<a id='line_1708'>(In age his equal) on a splendid bed:</a>
<a id='line_1709'>But in an inner court, securely closed,</a>
<a id='line_1710'>The reverend Nestor and his queen reposed.</a>
<a id='line_1711'></a>
<a id='line_1712'>When now Aurora, daughter of the dawn,</a>
<a id='line_1713'>With rosy lustre purpled o'er the lawn,</a>
<a id='line_1714'>The old man early rose, walk'd forth, and sate</a>
<a id='line_1715'>On polish'd stone before his palace gate;</a>
<a id='line_1716'>With unguents smooth the lucid marble shone,</a>
<a id='line_1717'>Where ancient Neleus sate, a rustic throne;</a>
<a id='line_1718'>But he descending to the infernal shade,</a>

<a id='line_1720'>His sons around him mild obeisance pay,</a>
<a id='line_1721'>And duteous take the orders of the day.</a>
<a id='line_1722'>First Eehephron and Stratius quit their bed;</a>
<a id='line_1723'>Then Perseus, Aretus, and Thrasymed;</a>
<a id='line_1724'>The last Pisistratus arose from rest:</a>
<a id='line_1725'>They came, and near him placed the stranger-guest.</a>
<a id='line_1726'>To these the senior thus declared his will:</a>
<a id='line_1727'>"My sons! the dictates of your sire fulfil.</a>
<a id='line_1728'>To Pallas, first of gods, prepare the feast,</a>
<a id='line_1729'>Who graced our rites, a more than mortal guest</a>
<a id='line_1730'>Let one, despatchful, bid some swain to lead</a>
<a id='line_1731'>A well-fed bullock from the grassy mead;</a>
<a id='line_1732'>One seek the harbour where the vessels moor,</a>

<a id='line_1739'>And bid the handmaids for the feast prepare,</a>
<a id='line_1740'>The seats to range, the fragrant wood to bring,</a>
<a id='line_1741'>And limpid waters from the living spring."</a>
<a id='line_1742'></a>
<a id='line_1743'>He said, and busy each his care bestow'd;</a>
<a id='line_1744'>Already at the gates the bullock low'd,</a>
<a id='line_1745'>Already came the Ithacensian crew,</a>
<a id='line_1746'>The dexterous smith the tools already drew;</a>
<a id='line_1747'>His ponderous hammer and his anvil sound,</a>
<a id='line_1748'>And the strong tongs to turn the metal round.</a>
<a id='line_1749'>Nor was Minerva absent from the rite,</a>
<a id='line_1750'>She view'd her honours, and enjoyed the sight,</a>
<a id='line_1751'>With reverend hand the king presents the gold,</a>
<a id='line_1752'>Which round the intorted horns the gilder roll'd.</a>
<a id='line_1753'>So wrought as Pallas might with pride behold.</a>
<a id='line_1754'>Young Aretus from forth his bride bower</a>
<a id='line_1755'>Brought the full laver, o'er their hands to pour,</a>
<a id='line_1756'>And canisters of consecrated flour.</a>
<a id='line_1757'>Stratius and Echephron the victim led;</a>
<a id='line_1758'>The axe was held by warlike Thrasymed,</a>
<a id='line_1759'>In act to strike; before him Perseus stood,</a>
<a id='line_1760'>The vase extending to receive the blood.</a>
<a id='line_1761'>The king himself initiates to the power:</a>
<a id='line_1762'>Scatters with quivering hand the sacred flour,</a>
<a id='line_1763'>And the stream sprinkles; from the curling brows</a>
<a id='line_1764'>The hair collected in the fire he throws.</a>
<a id='line_1765'>Soon as due vows on every part were paid,</a>
<a id='line_1766'>And sacred wheat upon the victim laid,</a>
<a id='line_1767'>Strong Thrasymed discharged the speeding blow</a>
<a id='line_1768'>Full on his neck, and cut the nerves in two.</a>
<a id='line_1769'>Down sunk the heavy beast; the females round</a>
<a id='line_1770'>Maids, wives, and matrons, mix a shrilling sound.</a>
<a id='line_1771'>Nor scorned the queen the holy choir to join</a>
<a id='line_1772'>(The first born she, of old Clymenus' line:</a>
<a id='line_1773'>In youth by Nestor loved, of spotless fame.</a>
<a id='line_1774'>And loved in age, Eurydice her name).</a>
<a id='line_1775'>From earth they rear him, struggling now with death;</a>

<a id='line_1777'>The soul for ever flies; on all sides round</a>
<a id='line_1778'>Streams the black blood, and smokes upon the ground</a>
<a id='line_1779'>The beast they then divide and disunite</a>
<a id='line_1780'>The ribs and limbs, observant of the rite:</a>
<a id='line_1781'>On these, in double cauls involved with art,</a>
<a id='line_1782'>The choicest morsels lay from every part.</a>
<a id='line_1783'>The sacred sage before his altar stands,</a>
<a id='line_1784'>Turns the burnt offering with his holy hands,</a>

<a id='line_1786'>The youth with instruments surround the fire.</a>
<a id='line_1787'>The thighs now sacrificed, and entrails dress'd,</a>
<a id='line_1788'>The assistants part, transfix, and broil the rest</a>

<a id='line_1790'>The last fair branch of the Nestorean line,</a>
<a id='line_1791'>Sweet Polycaste, took the pleasing toil</a>
<a id='line_1792'>To bathe the prince, and pour the fragrant oil.</a>
<a id='line_1793'>O'er his fair limbs a flowery vest he throw,</a>
<a id='line_1794'>And issued, like a god, to mortal view.</a>

<a id='line_1812'>Beneath the bounding yoke alike they hold</a>
<a id='line_1813'>Their equal pace, and smoked along the field.</a>

<a id='line_1816'>Then sunk the sun, and darken'd all the way.</a>

<a id='line_1837'>THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.</a>
<a id='line_1838'></a>
<a id='line_1839'>Telemachus with Pisistratus arriving at Sparta, is hospitably</a>
<a id='line_1840'>received by Menelaus to whom he relates the cause of his coming,</a>
<a id='line_1841'>and learns from him many particulars of what befell the Greeks</a>
<a id='line_1842'>since the destruction of Troy. He dwells more at large upon the</a>
<a id='line_1843'>prophecies of Proteus to him in his return; from which he</a>
<a id='line_1844'>acquaints Telemachus that Ulysses is detained in the island of</a>
<a id='line_1845'>Calypso.</a>
<a id='line_1846'></a>
<a id='line_1847'>In the meantime the suitors consult to destroy Telemachus on the</a>
<a id='line_1848'>voyage home. Penelope is apprised of this; but comforted in a</a>
<a id='line_1849'>dream by Pallas, in the shape of her sister Iphthima.</a>
<a id='line_1850'></a>
<a id='line_1851'></a>
<a id='line_1852'></a>
<a id='line_1853'>And now proud Sparta with their wheels resounds,</a>
<a id='line_1854'>Sparta whose walls a range of hills surrounds;</a>
<a id='line_1855'>At the fair dome the rapid labour ends;</a>

<a id='line_1882'>The splendid car roll'd slow in regal state:</a>
<a id='line_1883'>On the bright eminence young Nestor shone,</a>

<a id='line_1886'>And speeding, thus address'd the royal ear;</a>
<a id='line_1887'></a>
<a id='line_1888'>"Two youths approach, whose semblant features prove</a>
<a id='line_1889'>Their blood devolving from the source of Jove</a>

<a id='line_1904'>The seneschal, rebuked, in haste withdrew;</a>
<a id='line_1905'>With equal haste a menial train pursue:</a>

<a id='line_1907'>Each to a crib with choicest grain surcharged;</a>
<a id='line_1908'>Part in a portico, profusely graced</a>
<a id='line_1909'>With rich magnificence, the chariot placed;</a>

<a id='line_1917'>With liquid odours, and embroider'd vests.</a>
<a id='line_1918'>Refresh'd, they wait them to the bower of state,</a>

<a id='line_1933'>With signatures of such majestic grace."</a>
<a id='line_1934'></a>
<a id='line_1935'>Ceasing, benevolent he straight assigns</a>

<a id='line_1955'>With all my affluence, when my woes are weigh'd,</a>
<a id='line_1956'>Envy will own the purchase dearly paid.</a>

<a id='line_1964'>O'er the warm Lybian wave to spread my sails;</a>
<a id='line_1965'>That happy clime, where each revolving year</a>
<a id='line_1966'>The teeming ewes a triple offspring bear;</a>

<a id='line_2663'>Mould the round hail, or flake the fleecy snow;</a>
<a id='line_2664'>But from the breezy deep the blest inhale</a>
<a id='line_2665'>The fragrant murmurs of the western gale.</a>
<a id='line_2666'>This grace peculiar will the gods afford</a>
<a id='line_2667'>To thee, the son of Jove, and beauteous Helen's lord.'</a>

<a id='line_2669'>"He ceased, and plunging in the vast profound,</a>

<a id='line_2676'>Soon as the morn reveals the roseate east,</a>
<a id='line_2677'>With sails we wing the masts, our anchors weigh,</a>
<a id='line_2678'>Unmoor the fleet, and rush into the sea.</a>
<a id='line_2679'>Ranged on the banks, beneath our equal oars</a>
<a id='line_2680'>White curl the waves, and the vex'd ocean roars</a>
<a id='line_2681'>Then, steering backward from the Pharian isle,</a>
<a id='line_2682'>We gain the stream of Jove-descended Nile;</a>
<a id='line_2683'>There quit the ships, and on the destined shore</a>
<a id='line_2684'>With ritual hecatombs the gods adore;</a>
<a id='line_2685'>Their wrath atoned, to Agamemnon's name</a>
<a id='line_2686'>A cenotaph I raise of deathless fame.</a>

<a id='line_2717'>Horrid with cliffs, our meagre land allows</a>
<a id='line_2718'>Thin herbage for the mountain goat to browse,</a>

<a id='line_2720'>The sprightly courser, or indulge his speed:</a>
<a id='line_2721'>To sea-surrounded realms the gods assign</a>
<a id='line_2722'>Small tract of fertile lawn, the least to mine."</a>
<a id='line_2723'></a>
<a id='line_2724'>His hand the king with tender passion press'd,</a>
<a id='line_2725'>And, smiling, thus the royal youth address'd:</a>

<a id='line_2733'></a>
<a id='line_2734'>Thus they alternate; while, with artful care,</a>
<a id='line_2735'>The menial train the regal feast prepare.</a>
<a id='line_2736'>The firstlings of the flock are doom'd to die:</a>
<a id='line_2737'>Rich fragrant wines the cheering bowl supply;</a>
<a id='line_2738'>A female band the gift of Ceres bring;</a>
<a id='line_2739'>And the gilt roofs with genial triumph ring.</a>
<a id='line_2740'></a>
<a id='line_2741'>Meanwhile, in Ithaca, the suitor powers</a>
<a id='line_2742'>In active games divide their jovial hours;</a>
<a id='line_2743'>In areas varied with mosaic art,</a>
<a id='line_2744'>Some whirl the disk, and some the javelin dart,</a>

<a id='line_2754'>When steers he home, or why this long delay?</a>
<a id='line_2755'>For Elis I should sail with utmost speed.</a>
<a id='line_2756'>To import twelve mares which there luxurious feed,</a>

<a id='line_2759'></a>
<a id='line_2760'>Unknowing of the course to Pyle design'd,</a>
<a id='line_2761'>A sudden horror seized on either mind;</a>

<a id='line_2763'>Numbering his flocks and herds, not far remote.</a>
<a id='line_2764'>"Relate (Antinous cries), devoid of guile,</a>
<a id='line_2765'>When spread the prince his sale for distant Pyle?</a>

<a id='line_2771'>"With willing duty, not reluctant mind</a>

<a id='line_2782'>Then ceased the youth, and from the court retired.</a>
<a id='line_2783'></a>
<a id='line_2784'>Confounded and appall'd, the unfinish'd game</a>
<a id='line_2785'>The suitors quit, and all to council came.</a>
<a id='line_2786'>Antinous first the assembled peers address'd.</a>
<a id='line_2787'>Rage sparkling in his eyes, and burning in his breast</a>
<a id='line_2788'></a>
<a id='line_2789'>"O shame to manhood! shall one daring boy</a>
<a id='line_2790'>The scheme of all our happiness destroy?</a>

<a id='line_2801'></a>
<a id='line_2802'>With vast applause the sentence all approve;</a>
<a id='line_2803'>Then rise, and to the feastful hall remove;</a>

<a id='line_2861'>Words to her dumb complaint a pause supplies,</a>
<a id='line_2862'>And breath, to waste in unavailing cries.</a>
<a id='line_2863'>Around their sovereign wept the menial fair,</a>
<a id='line_2864'>To whom she thus address'd her deep despair:</a>
<a id='line_2865'></a>
<a id='line_2866'>"Behold a wretch whom all the gods consign</a>
<a id='line_2867'>To woe! Did ever sorrows equal mine?</a>
<a id='line_2868'>Long to my joys my dearest lord is lost,</a>

<a id='line_2871'>Our other column of the state is borne;</a>

<a id='line_2877'>Why did you fear to trouble my repose?</a>
<a id='line_2878'>He either had obey'd my fond desire,</a>
<a id='line_2879'>Or seen his mother pierced with grief expire.</a>
<a id='line_2880'>Bid Dolius quick attend, the faithful slave</a>

<a id='line_2887'>And to their power to save his race appeal."</a>
<a id='line_2888'></a>
<a id='line_2889'>Then Euryclea thus: "My dearest dread;</a>

<a id='line_2912'>Her pious speed a female train attends:</a>
<a id='line_2913'>The salted cakes in canisters are laid,</a>
<a id='line_2914'>And thus the queen invokes Minerva's aid;</a>
<a id='line_2915'></a>
<a id='line_2916'>"Daughter divine of Jove, whose arm can wield</a>
<a id='line_2917'>The avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield</a>

<a id='line_2922'>His wish'd return with happy power befriend,</a>
<a id='line_2923'>And on the suitors let thy wrath descend."</a>
<a id='line_2924'></a>
<a id='line_2925'>She ceased; shrill ecstasies of joy declare</a>
<a id='line_2926'>The favouring goddess present to the prayer;</a>
<a id='line_2927'>The suitors heard, and deem'd the mirthful voice</a>
<a id='line_2928'>A signal of her hymeneal choice;</a>
<a id='line_2929'>Whilst one most jovial thus accosts the board:</a>
<a id='line_2930'></a>

<a id='line_2934'>Thus he, unskill'd of what the fates provide!</a>
<a id='line_2935'>But with severe rebuke Antinous cried:</a>
<a id='line_2936'></a>
<a id='line_2937'>"These empty vaunts will make the voyage vain:</a>

<a id='line_2941'>His speech thus ended short, he frowning rose,</a>
<a id='line_2942'>And twenty chiefs renowned for valour chose;</a>
<a id='line_2943'>Down to the strand he speeds with haughty strides,</a>
<a id='line_2944'>Where anchor'd in the bay the vessel rides,</a>
<a id='line_2945'>Replete with mail and military store,</a>

<a id='line_2951'></a>
<a id='line_2952'>Meantime the queen, without reflection due,</a>
<a id='line_2953'>Heart-wounded, to the bed of state withdrew:</a>
<a id='line_2954'>In her sad breast the prince's fortunes roll,</a>

<a id='line_3036'>ARGUMENT</a>
<a id='line_3037'></a>
<a id='line_3038'>THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO</a>
<a id='line_3039'></a>
<a id='line_3040'>Pallas in a council of the gods complains of the detention of</a>
<a id='line_3041'>Ulysses in the Island of Calypso: whereupon Mercury is sent to</a>
<a id='line_3042'>command his removal. The seat of Calypso described. She consents</a>
<a id='line_3043'>with much difficulty; and Ulysses builds a vessel with his own</a>
<a id='line_3044'>hands, in which he embarks. Neptune overtakes him with a terrible</a>
<a id='line_3045'>tempest, in which he is shipwrecked, and in the last danger of</a>
<a id='line_3046'>death; till Lencothea, a sea-goddess, assists him, and, after</a>
<a id='line_3047'>innumerable perils, he gets ashore on Phaeacia.</a>
<a id='line_3048'></a>
<a id='line_3049'></a>
<a id='line_3050'></a>
<a id='line_3051'>The saffron morn, with early blushes spread,</a>
<a id='line_3052'>Now rose refulgent from Tithonus' bed;</a>
<a id='line_3053'>With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,</a>
<a id='line_3054'>And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light.</a>
<a id='line_3055'>Then met the eternal synod of the sky,</a>
<a id='line_3056'>Before the god, who thunders from on high,</a>
<a id='line_3057'>Supreme in might, sublime in majesty.</a>
<a id='line_3058'>Pallas, to these, deplores the unequal fates</a>
<a id='line_3059'>Of wise Ulysses and his toils relates:</a>
<a id='line_3060'>Her hero's danger touch'd the pitying power,</a>
<a id='line_3061'>The nymph's seducements, and the magic bower.</a>
<a id='line_3062'>Thus she began her plaint:  "Immortal Jove!</a>
<a id='line_3063'>And you who fill the blissful seats above!</a>
<a id='line_3064'>Let kings no more with gentle mercy sway,</a>
<a id='line_3065'>Or bless a people willing to obey,</a>
<a id='line_3066'>But crush the nations with an iron rod,</a>
<a id='line_3067'>And every monarch be the scourge of God.</a>
<a id='line_3068'>If from your thoughts Ulysses you remove,</a>
<a id='line_3069'>Who ruled his subjects with a father's love,</a>
<a id='line_3070'>Sole in an isle, encircled by the main,</a>
<a id='line_3071'>Abandon'd, banish'd from his native reign,</a>
<a id='line_3072'>Unbless'd he sighs, detained by lawless charms,</a>
<a id='line_3073'>And press'd unwilling in Calypso's arms.</a>
<a id='line_3074'>Nor friends are there, nor vessels to convey,</a>
<a id='line_3075'>Nor oars to cut the immeasurable way.</a>
<a id='line_3076'>And now fierce traitors, studious to destroy</a>
<a id='line_3077'>His only son, their ambush'd fraud employ;</a>
<a id='line_3078'>Who, pious, following his great father's fame,</a>
<a id='line_3079'>To sacred Pylos and to Sparta came."</a>
<a id='line_3080'></a>
<a id='line_3081'>"What words are these? (replied the power who forms</a>
<a id='line_3082'>The clouds of night, and darkens heaven with storms;)</a>
<a id='line_3083'>Is not already in thy soul decreed,</a>
<a id='line_3084'>The chief's return shall make the guilty bleed?</a>
<a id='line_3085'>What cannot Wisdom do? Thou may'st restore</a>
<a id='line_3086'>The son in safety to his native shore;</a>
<a id='line_3087'>While the fell foes, who late in ambush lay,</a>
<a id='line_3088'>With fraud defeated measure back their way."</a>
<a id='line_3089'></a>
<a id='line_3090'>Then thus to Hermes the command was given:</a>
<a id='line_3091'>"Hermes, thou chosen messenger of heaven!</a>
<a id='line_3092'>Go, to the nymph be these our orders borne</a>
<a id='line_3093'>'Tis Jove's decree, Ulysses shall return:</a>
<a id='line_3094'>The patient man shall view his old abodes,</a>
<a id='line_3095'>Nor helped by mortal hand, nor guiding gods</a>
<a id='line_3096'>In twice ten days shall fertile Scheria find,</a>
<a id='line_3097'>Alone, and floating to the wave and wind.</a>
<a id='line_3098'>The bold Phaecians there, whose haughty line</a>
<a id='line_3099'>Is mixed with gods, half human, half divine,</a>
<a id='line_3100'>The chief shall honour as some heavenly guest,</a>
<a id='line_3101'>And swift transport him to his place of rest,</a>
<a id='line_3102'>His vessels loaded with a plenteous store</a>
<a id='line_3103'>Of brass, of vestures, and resplendent ore</a>
<a id='line_3104'>(A richer prize than if his joyful isle</a>
<a id='line_3105'>Received him charged with Ilion's noble spoil),</a>
<a id='line_3106'>His friends, his country, he shall see, though late:</a>
<a id='line_3107'>Such is our sovereign will, and such is fate."</a>
<a id='line_3108'></a>
<a id='line_3109'>He spoke. The god who mounts the winged winds</a>
<a id='line_3110'>Fast to his feet the golden pinions binds,</a>
<a id='line_3111'>That high through fields of air his flight sustain</a>
<a id='line_3112'>O'er the wide earth, and o'er the boundless main:</a>
<a id='line_3113'>He grasps the wand that causes sleep to fly,</a>
<a id='line_3114'>Or in soft slumber seals the wakeful eye;</a>
<a id='line_3115'>Then shoots from heaven to high Pieria's steep,</a>
<a id='line_3116'>And stoops incumbent on the rolling deep.</a>
<a id='line_3117'>So watery fowl, that seek their fishy food,</a>
<a id='line_3118'>With wings expanded o'er the foaming flood,</a>
<a id='line_3119'>Now sailing smooth the level surface sweep,</a>
<a id='line_3120'>Now dip their pinions in the briny deep;</a>
<a id='line_3121'>Thus o'er the word of waters Hermes flew,</a>
<a id='line_3122'>Till now the distant island rose in view:</a>
<a id='line_3123'>Then, swift ascending from the azure wave,</a>
<a id='line_3124'>he took the path that winded to the cave.</a>
<a id='line_3125'>Large was the grot, in which the nymph he found</a>
<a id='line_3126'>(The fair-hair'd nymph with every beauty crown'd).</a>
<a id='line_3127'>The cave was brighten'd with a rising blaze;</a>
<a id='line_3128'>Cedar and frankincense, an odorous pile,</a>
<a id='line_3129'>Flamed on the hearth, and wide perfumed the isle;</a>
<a id='line_3130'>While she with work and song the time divides,</a>
<a id='line_3131'>And through the loom the golden shuttle guides.</a>
<a id='line_3132'>Without the grot a various sylvan scene</a>
<a id='line_3133'>Appear'd around, and groves of living green;</a>
<a id='line_3134'>Poplars and alders ever quivering play'd,</a>
<a id='line_3135'>And nodding cypress form'd a fragrant shade:</a>
<a id='line_3136'>On whose high branches, waving with the storm,</a>
<a id='line_3137'>The birds of broadest wing their mansions form,--</a>
<a id='line_3138'>The chough, the sea-mew, the loquacious crow,--</a>
<a id='line_3139'>and scream aloft, and skim the deeps below.</a>
<a id='line_3140'>Depending vines the shelving cavern screen.</a>
<a id='line_3141'>With purple clusters blushing through the green.</a>
<a id='line_3142'>Four limped fountains from the clefts distil:</a>
<a id='line_3143'>And every fountain pours a several rill,</a>
<a id='line_3144'>In mazy windings wandering down the hill:</a>
<a id='line_3145'>Where bloomy meads with vivid greens were crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_3146'>And glowing violets threw odours round.</a>
<a id='line_3147'>A scene, where, if a god should cast his sight,</a>
<a id='line_3148'>A god might gaze, and wander with delight!</a>
<a id='line_3149'>Joy touch'd the messenger of heaven: he stay'd</a>
<a id='line_3150'>Entranced, and all the blissful haunts surveyed.</a>
<a id='line_3151'>Him, entering in the cave, Calypso knew;</a>
<a id='line_3152'>For powers celestial to each other's view</a>
<a id='line_3153'>Stand still confess'd, though distant far they lie</a>
<a id='line_3154'>To habitants of earth, or sea, or sky.</a>
<a id='line_3155'>But sad Ulysses, by himself apart,</a>
<a id='line_3156'>Pour'd the big sorrows of his swelling heard;</a>
<a id='line_3157'>All on the lonely shore he sate to weep,</a>
<a id='line_3158'>And roll'd his eyes around the restless deep:</a>
<a id='line_3159'>Toward his loved coast he roll'd his eyes in vain,</a>
<a id='line_3160'>Till, dimm'd with rising grief, they stream'd again.</a>
<a id='line_3161'></a>
<a id='line_3162'>Now graceful seated on her shining throne,</a>
<a id='line_3163'>To Hermes thus the nymph divine begun:</a>
<a id='line_3164'></a>
<a id='line_3165'>"God of the golden wand! on what behest</a>
<a id='line_3166'>Arrivest thou here, an unexpected guest?</a>
<a id='line_3167'>Loved as thou art, thy free injunctions lay;</a>
<a id='line_3168'>'Tis mine with joy and duty to obey.</a>
<a id='line_3169'>Till now a stranger, in a happy hour</a>
<a id='line_3170'>Approach, and taste the dainties of my bower."</a>
<a id='line_3171'></a>
<a id='line_3172'>Thus having spoke, the nymph the table spread</a>
<a id='line_3173'>(Ambrosial cates, with nectar rosy-red);</a>
<a id='line_3174'>Hermes the hospitable rite partook,</a>
<a id='line_3175'>Divine refection! then, recruited, spoke:</a>
<a id='line_3176'></a>
<a id='line_3177'>"What moves this journey from my native sky,</a>
<a id='line_3178'>A goddess asks, nor can a god deny.</a>
<a id='line_3179'>Hear then the truth. By mighty Jove's command</a>
<a id='line_3180'>Unwilling have I trod this pleasing land:</a>
<a id='line_3181'>For who, self-moved, with weary wing would sweep</a>
<a id='line_3182'>Such length of ocean and unmeasured deep;</a>
<a id='line_3183'>A world of waters! far from all the ways</a>
<a id='line_3184'>Where men frequent, or sacred altars blaze!</a>
<a id='line_3185'>But to Jove's will submission we must pay;</a>
<a id='line_3186'>What power so great to dare to disobey?</a>
<a id='line_3187'>A man, he says, a man resides with thee,</a>
<a id='line_3188'>Of all his kind most worn with misery.</a>
<a id='line_3189'>The Greeks, (whose arms for nine long year employ'd</a>
<a id='line_3190'>Their force on Ilion, in the tenth destroy'd,)</a>
<a id='line_3191'>At length, embarking in a luckless hour,</a>
<a id='line_3192'>With conquest proud, incensed Minerva's power:</a>
<a id='line_3193'>Hence on the guilty race her vengeance hurl'd,</a>
<a id='line_3194'>With storms pursued them through the liquid world.</a>
<a id='line_3195'>There all his vessels sunk beneath the wave!</a>
<a id='line_3196'>There all his dear companions found their grave!</a>
<a id='line_3197'>Saved from the jaws of death by Heaven's decree,</a>
<a id='line_3198'>The tempest drove him to these shores and thee.</a>
<a id='line_3199'>Him, Jove now orders to his native lands</a>
<a id='line_3200'>Straight to dismiss: so destiny commands:</a>
<a id='line_3201'>Impatient Fate his near return attends,</a>
<a id='line_3202'>And calls him to his country, and his friends."</a>
<a id='line_3203'></a>
<a id='line_3204'>E'en to her inmost soul the goddess shook;</a>
<a id='line_3205'>Then thus her anguish, and her passion broke:</a>
<a id='line_3206'>"Ungracious gods! with spite and envy cursed!</a>
<a id='line_3207'>Still to your own ethereal race the worst!</a>
<a id='line_3208'>Ye envy mortal and immortal joy,</a>
<a id='line_3209'>And love, the only sweet of life destroy,</a>
<a id='line_3210'>Did ever goddess by her charms engage</a>
<a id='line_3211'>A favour'd mortal, and not feel your rage?</a>
<a id='line_3212'>So when Aurora sought Orion's love,</a>
<a id='line_3213'>Her joys disturbed your blissful hours above,</a>
<a id='line_3214'>Till, in Ortygia Dian's winged dart</a>
<a id='line_3215'>Had pierced the hapless hunter to the heart,</a>
<a id='line_3216'>So when the covert of the thrice-eared field</a>
<a id='line_3217'>Saw stately Ceres to her passion yield,</a>
<a id='line_3218'>Scarce could Iasion taste her heavenly charms,</a>
<a id='line_3219'>But Jove's swift lightning scorched him in her arms.</a>
<a id='line_3220'>And is it now my turn, ye mighty powers!</a>
<a id='line_3221'>Am I the envy of your blissful bowers?</a>
<a id='line_3222'>A man, an outcast to the storm and wave,</a>
<a id='line_3223'>It was my crime to pity, and to save;</a>
<a id='line_3224'>When he who thunders rent his bark in twain,</a>
<a id='line_3225'>And sunk his brave companions in the main,</a>
<a id='line_3226'>Alone, abandon'd, in mid-ocean tossed,</a>
<a id='line_3227'>The sport of winds, and driven from every coast,</a>
<a id='line_3228'>Hither this man of miseries I led,</a>
<a id='line_3229'>Received the friendless, and the hungry fed;</a>
<a id='line_3230'>Nay promised (vainly promised) to bestow</a>
<a id='line_3231'>Immortal life, exempt from age and woe.</a>
<a id='line_3232'>'Tis past-and Jove decrees he shall remove;</a>
<a id='line_3233'>Gods as we are, we are but slaves to Jove.</a>
<a id='line_3234'>Go then he must (he must, if he ordain,</a>
<a id='line_3235'>Try all those dangers, all those deeps, again);</a>
<a id='line_3236'>But never, never shall Calypso send</a>
<a id='line_3237'>To toils like these her husband and her friend.</a>
<a id='line_3238'>What ships have I, what sailors to convey,</a>
<a id='line_3239'>What oars to cut the long laborious way?</a>
<a id='line_3240'>Yet I'll direct the safest means to go;</a>
<a id='line_3241'>That last advice is all I can bestow."</a>
<a id='line_3242'></a>
<a id='line_3243'>To her the power who hears the charming rod;</a>
<a id='line_3244'>"Dismiss the man, nor irritate the god;</a>
<a id='line_3245'>Prevent the rage of him who reigns above,</a>
<a id='line_3246'>For what so dreadful as the wrath of Jove?"</a>
<a id='line_3247'>Thus having said, he cut the cleaving sky,</a>
<a id='line_3248'>And in a moment vanished from her eye,</a>
<a id='line_3249'>The nymph, obedient to divine command,</a>
<a id='line_3250'>To seek Ulysses, paced along the sand,</a>
<a id='line_3251'>Him pensive on the lonely beach she found,</a>
<a id='line_3252'>With streaming eyes in briny torrents drown'd,</a>
<a id='line_3253'>And inly pining for his native shore;</a>
<a id='line_3254'>For now the soft enchantress pleased no more;</a>
<a id='line_3255'>For now, reluctant, and constrained by charms,</a>
<a id='line_3256'>Absent he lay in her desiring arms,</a>
<a id='line_3257'>In slumber wore the heavy night away,</a>
<a id='line_3258'>On rocks and shores consumed the tedious day;</a>
<a id='line_3259'>There sate all desolate, and sighed alone,</a>
<a id='line_3260'>With echoing sorrows made the mountains groan.</a>
<a id='line_3261'>And roll'd his eyes o'er all the restless main,</a>
<a id='line_3262'>Till, dimmed with  rising grief, they streamed again.</a>
<a id='line_3263'></a>
<a id='line_3264'>Here, on his musing mood the goddess press'd,</a>
<a id='line_3265'>Approaching soft, and thus the chief address'd:</a>
<a id='line_3266'>"Unhappy man! to wasting woes a prey,</a>
<a id='line_3267'>No more in sorrows languish life away:</a>
<a id='line_3268'>Free as the winds I give thee now to rove:</a>
<a id='line_3269'>Go, fell the timber of yon lofty grove,</a>
<a id='line_3270'>And form a raft, and build the rising ship,</a>
<a id='line_3271'>Sublime to bear thee o'er the gloomy deep.</a>
<a id='line_3272'>To store the vessel let the care be mine,</a>
<a id='line_3273'>With water from the rock and rosy wine,</a>
<a id='line_3274'>And life-sustaining bread, and fair array,</a>
<a id='line_3275'>And prosperous gales to waft thee on the way.</a>
<a id='line_3276'>These, if the gods with my desire comply</a>
<a id='line_3277'>(The gods, alas, more mighty far than I,</a>
<a id='line_3278'>And better skill'd in dark events to come),</a>
<a id='line_3279'>In peace shall land thee at thy native home."</a>
<a id='line_3280'></a>
<a id='line_3281'>With sighs Ulysses heard the words she spoke,</a>
<a id='line_3282'>Then thus his melancholy silence broke:</a>
<a id='line_3283'>"Some other motive, goddess! sways thy mind</a>
<a id='line_3284'>(Some close design, or turn of womankind),</a>
<a id='line_3285'>Nor my return the end, nor this the way,</a>
<a id='line_3286'>On a slight raft to pass the swelling sea,</a>
<a id='line_3287'>Huge, horrid, vast! where scarce in safety sails</a>
<a id='line_3288'>The best-built ship, though Jove inspires the gales.</a>
<a id='line_3289'>The bold proposal how shall I fulfil,</a>
<a id='line_3290'>Dark as I am, unconscious of thy will?</a>
<a id='line_3291'>Swear, then, thou mean'st not what my soul forebodes;</a>
<a id='line_3292'>Swear by the solemn oath that binds the gods."</a>
<a id='line_3293'></a>
<a id='line_3294'>Him, while he spoke, with smiles Calypso eyed,</a>
<a id='line_3295'>And gently grasp'd his hand, and thus replied:</a>
<a id='line_3296'>"This shows thee, friend, by old experience taught,</a>
<a id='line_3297'>And learn'd in all the wiles of human thought,</a>
<a id='line_3298'>How prone to doubt, how cautious, are the wise!</a>
<a id='line_3299'>But hear, O earth, and hear, ye sacred skies!</a>
<a id='line_3300'>And thou, O Styx! whose formidable floods</a>
<a id='line_3301'>Glide through the shades, and bind the attesting gods!</a>
<a id='line_3302'>No form'd design, no meditated end,</a>
<a id='line_3303'>Lurks in the counsel of thy faithful friend;</a>
<a id='line_3304'>Kind the persuasion, and sincere my aim;</a>
<a id='line_3305'>The same my practice, were my fate the same.</a>
<a id='line_3306'>Heaven has not cursed me with a heart of steel,</a>
<a id='line_3307'>But given the sense to pity, and to feel."</a>
<a id='line_3308'></a>
<a id='line_3309'>Thus having said, the goddess marched before:</a>
<a id='line_3310'>He trod her footsteps in the sandy shore.</a>
<a id='line_3311'>At the cool cave arrived, they took their state;</a>
<a id='line_3312'>He filled the throne where Mercury had sate.</a>
<a id='line_3313'>For him the nymph a rich repast ordains,</a>
<a id='line_3314'>Such as the mortal life of man sustains;</a>
<a id='line_3315'>Before herself were placed the the cates divine,</a>
<a id='line_3316'>Ambrosial banquet and celestial wine.</a>
<a id='line_3317'>Their hunger satiate, and their thirst repress'd,</a>
<a id='line_3318'>Thus spoke Calypso to her godlike guest:</a>
<a id='line_3319'></a>
<a id='line_3320'>"Ulysses! (with a sigh she thus began;)</a>
<a id='line_3321'>O sprung from gods! in wisdom more than man!</a>
<a id='line_3322'>Is then thy home the passion of thy heart?</a>
<a id='line_3323'>Thus wilt thou leave me, are we thus to part?</a>
<a id='line_3324'>Farewell! and ever joyful mayst thou be,</a>
<a id='line_3325'>Nor break the transport with one thought of me.</a>
<a id='line_3326'>But ah, Ulysses! wert thou given to know</a>
<a id='line_3327'>What Fate yet dooms these still to undergo,</a>
<a id='line_3328'>Thy heart might settle in this scene of ease.</a>
<a id='line_3329'>And e'en these slighted charms might learn to please.</a>
<a id='line_3330'>A willing goddess, and immortal life.</a>
<a id='line_3331'>Might banish from thy mind an absent wife.</a>
<a id='line_3332'>Am I inferior to a mortal dame?</a>
<a id='line_3333'>Less soft my feature less august my frame?</a>
<a id='line_3334'>Or shall the daughters of mankind compare</a>
<a id='line_3335'>Their earth born beauties with the heavenly fair?"</a>
<a id='line_3336'></a>
<a id='line_3337'>"Alas! for this (the prudent man replies)</a>
<a id='line_3338'>Against Ulysses shall thy anger rise?</a>
<a id='line_3339'>Loved and adored, O goddess as thou art,</a>
<a id='line_3340'>Forgive the weakness of a human heart.</a>
<a id='line_3341'>Though well I see thy graces far above</a>
<a id='line_3342'>The dear, though mortal, object of my love,</a>
<a id='line_3343'>Of youth eternal well the difference know,</a>
<a id='line_3344'>And the short date of fading charms below;</a>
<a id='line_3345'>Yet every day, while absent thus I roam,</a>
<a id='line_3346'>I languish to return and die at home.</a>
<a id='line_3347'>Whate'er the gods shall destine me to bear;</a>
<a id='line_3348'>In the black ocean or the watery war,</a>
<a id='line_3349'>'Tis mine to master with a constant mind;</a>
<a id='line_3350'>Inured to perils, to the worst resign'd,</a>
<a id='line_3351'>By seas, by wars, so many dangers run;</a>
<a id='line_3352'>Still I can suffer; their high will he done!"</a>
<a id='line_3353'></a>
<a id='line_3354'>Thus while he spoke, the beamy sun descends,</a>
<a id='line_3355'>And rising night her friendly shade extends,</a>
<a id='line_3356'>To the close grot the lonely pair remove,</a>
<a id='line_3357'>And slept delighted with the gifts of love.</a>
<a id='line_3358'>When rose morning call'd them from their rest,</a>
<a id='line_3359'>Ulysses robed him in the cloak and vest.</a>
<a id='line_3360'>The nymph's fair head a veil transparent graced,</a>
<a id='line_3361'>Her swelling loins a radiant zone embraced</a>
<a id='line_3362'>With flowers of gold; an under robe, unbound,</a>
<a id='line_3363'>In snowy waves flow'd glittering on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_3364'>Forth issuing thus, she gave him first to wield</a>
<a id='line_3365'>A weighty axe with truest temper steeled,</a>
<a id='line_3366'>And double-edged; the handle smooth and plain,</a>
<a id='line_3367'>Wrought of the clouded olive's easy grain;</a>
<a id='line_3368'>And next, a wedge to drive with sweepy sway</a>
<a id='line_3369'>Then to the neighboring forest led the way.</a>
<a id='line_3370'>On the lone island's utmost verge there stood</a>
<a id='line_3371'>Of poplars, pine, and firs, a lofty wood,</a>
<a id='line_3372'>Whose leafless summits to the skies aspire,</a>
<a id='line_3373'>Scorch'd by the sun, or seared by heavenly fire</a>
<a id='line_3374'>(Already dried).  These pointing out to view,</a>
<a id='line_3375'>The nymph just show'd him, and with tears withdrew.</a>
<a id='line_3376'></a>
<a id='line_3377'>Now toils the hero: trees on trees o'erthrown</a>
<a id='line_3378'>Fall crackling round him, and the forests groan:</a>
<a id='line_3379'>Sudden, full twenty on the plain are strow'd,</a>
<a id='line_3380'>And lopp'd and lighten'd of their branchy load.</a>
<a id='line_3381'>At equal angles these disposed to join,</a>
<a id='line_3382'>He smooth'd and squared them by the rule and line,</a>
<a id='line_3383'>(The wimbles for the work Calypso found)</a>
<a id='line_3384'>With those he pierced them and with clinchers bound.</a>
<a id='line_3385'>Long and capacious as a shipwright forms</a>
<a id='line_3386'>Some bark's broad bottom to out-ride the storms,</a>
<a id='line_3387'>So large he built the raft; then ribb'd it strong</a>
<a id='line_3388'>From space to space, and nail'd the planks along;</a>
<a id='line_3389'>These form'd the sides: the deck he fashion'd last;</a>
<a id='line_3390'>Then o'er the vessel raised the taper mast,</a>
<a id='line_3391'>With crossing sail-yards dancing in the wind;</a>
<a id='line_3392'>And to the helm the guiding rudder join'd</a>
<a id='line_3393'>(With yielding osiers fenced, to break the force</a>
<a id='line_3394'>Of surging waves, and steer the steady course).</a>
<a id='line_3395'>Thy loom, Calypso, for the future sails</a>
<a id='line_3396'>Supplied the cloth, capacious of the gales.</a>
<a id='line_3397'>With stays and cordage last he rigged the ship,</a>
<a id='line_3398'>And, roll'd on levers, launch'd her in the deep.</a>
<a id='line_3399'></a>
<a id='line_3400'>Four days were pass'd, and now the work complete,</a>
<a id='line_3401'>Shone the fifth morn, when from her sacred seat</a>
<a id='line_3402'>The nymph dismiss'd him (odorous garments given),</a>
<a id='line_3403'>And bathed in fragrant oils that breathed of heaven:</a>
<a id='line_3404'>Then fill'd two goatskins with her hands divine,</a>
<a id='line_3405'>With water one, and one with sable wine:</a>
<a id='line_3406'>Of every kind, provisions heaved aboard;</a>
<a id='line_3407'>And the full decks with copious viands stored.</a>
<a id='line_3408'>The goddess, last, a gentle breeze supplies,</a>
<a id='line_3409'>To curl old Ocean, and to warm the skies.</a>
<a id='line_3410'></a>
<a id='line_3411'>And now, rejoicing in the prosperous gales,</a>
<a id='line_3412'>With beating heart Ulysses spreads his sails;</a>
<a id='line_3413'>Placed at the helm he sate, and mark'd the skies,</a>
<a id='line_3414'>Nor closed in sleep his ever-watchful eyes.</a>
<a id='line_3415'>There view'd the Pleiads, and the Northern Team,</a>
<a id='line_3416'>And great Orion's more refulgent beam.</a>
<a id='line_3417'>To which, around the axle of the sky,</a>
<a id='line_3418'>The Bear, revolving, points his golden eye:</a>
<a id='line_3419'>Who shines exalted on the ethereal plain,</a>
<a id='line_3420'>Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.</a>
<a id='line_3421'>Far on the left those radiant fires to keep</a>
<a id='line_3422'>The nymph directed, as he sail'd the deep.</a>
<a id='line_3423'>Full seventeen nights he cut the foaming way:</a>
<a id='line_3424'>The distant land appear'd the following day:</a>
<a id='line_3425'>Then swell'd to sight Phaeacia's dusky coast,</a>
<a id='line_3426'>And woody mountains, half in vapours lost;</a>
<a id='line_3427'>That lay before him indistinct and vast,</a>
<a id='line_3428'>Like a broad shield amid the watery waste.</a>
<a id='line_3429'></a>
<a id='line_3430'>But him, thus voyaging the deeps below,</a>
<a id='line_3431'>From far, on Solyme's aerial brow,</a>
<a id='line_3432'>The king of ocean saw, and seeing burn'd</a>
<a id='line_3433'>(From AEthiopia's happy climes return'd);</a>
<a id='line_3434'>The raging monarch shook his azure head,</a>
<a id='line_3435'>And thus in secret to his soul he said:</a>
<a id='line_3436'>"Heavens! how uncertain are the powers on high!</a>
<a id='line_3437'>Is then reversed the sentence of the sky,</a>
<a id='line_3438'>In one man's favour; while a distant guest</a>
<a id='line_3439'>I shared secure the AEthiopian feast?</a>
<a id='line_3440'>Behold how near Phoenecia's land he draws;</a>
<a id='line_3441'>The land affix'd by Fate's eternal laws</a>
<a id='line_3442'>To end his toils. Is then our anger vain?</a>
<a id='line_3443'>No; if this sceptre yet commands the main."</a>
<a id='line_3444'></a>
<a id='line_3445'>He spoke, and high the forky trident hurl'd,</a>
<a id='line_3446'>Rolls clouds on clouds, and stirs the watery world,</a>
<a id='line_3447'>At once the face of earth and sea deforms,</a>
<a id='line_3448'>Swells all the winds, and rouses all the storms.</a>
<a id='line_3449'>Down rushed the night: east, west, together roar;</a>
<a id='line_3450'>And south and north roll mountains to the shore.</a>
<a id='line_3451'>Then shook the hero, to despair resign'd,</a>
<a id='line_3452'>And question'd thus his yet unconquer'd mind;</a>
<a id='line_3453'></a>
<a id='line_3454'>"Wretch that I am! what farther fates attend</a>
<a id='line_3455'>This life of toils, and what my destined end?</a>
<a id='line_3456'>Too well, alas! the island goddess knew</a>
<a id='line_3457'>On the black sea what perils should ensue.</a>
<a id='line_3458'>New horrors now this destined head inclose;</a>
<a id='line_3459'>Untill'd is yet the measure of my woes;</a>
<a id='line_3460'>With what a cloud the brows of heaven are crown'd;</a>
<a id='line_3461'>What raging winds! what roaring waters round!</a>
<a id='line_3462'>'Tis Jove himself the swelling tempest rears;</a>
<a id='line_3463'>Death, present death, on every side appears.</a>
<a id='line_3464'>Happy! thrice happy! who, in battle slain,</a>
<a id='line_3465'>Press'd in Atrides' cause the Trojan plain!</a>
<a id='line_3466'>Oh! had I died before that well-fought wall!</a>
<a id='line_3467'>Had some distinguish'd day renown'd my fall</a>
<a id='line_3468'>(Such as was that when showers of javelins fled</a>
<a id='line_3469'>From conquering Troy around Achilles dead),</a>
<a id='line_3470'>All Greece had paid me solemn funerals then,</a>
<a id='line_3471'>And spread my glory with the sons of men.</a>
<a id='line_3472'>A shameful fate now hides my hapless head,</a>
<a id='line_3473'>Unwept, unnoted, and for ever dead!"</a>
<a id='line_3474'></a>
<a id='line_3475'>A mighty wave rush'd o'er him as he spoke,</a>
<a id='line_3476'>The raft is cover'd, and the mast is broke;</a>
<a id='line_3477'>Swept from the deck and from the rudder torn,</a>
<a id='line_3478'>Far on the swelling surge the chief was borne;</a>
<a id='line_3479'>While by the howling tempest rent in twain</a>
<a id='line_3480'>Flew sail and sail-yards rattling o'er the main.</a>
<a id='line_3481'>Long-press'd, he heaved beneath the weighty wave,</a>
<a id='line_3482'>Clogg'd by the cumbrous vest Calypso gave;</a>
<a id='line_3483'>At length, emerging, from his nostrils wide</a>
<a id='line_3484'>And gushing mouth effused the briny tide;</a>
<a id='line_3485'>E'en then not mindless of his last retreat,</a>
<a id='line_3486'>He seized the raft, and leap'd into his seat,</a>
<a id='line_3487'>Strong with the fear of death.  In rolling flood,</a>
<a id='line_3488'>Now here, now there, impell'd the floating wood</a>
<a id='line_3489'>As when a heap of gather'd thorns is cast,</a>
<a id='line_3490'>Now to, now fro, before the autumnal blast;</a>
<a id='line_3491'>Together clung, it rolls around the field;</a>
<a id='line_3492'>So roll'd the float, and so its texture held:</a>
<a id='line_3493'>And now the south, and now the north, bear sway,</a>
<a id='line_3494'>And now the east the foamy floods obey,</a>
<a id='line_3495'>And now the west wind whirls it o'er the sea.</a>
<a id='line_3496'>The wandering chief with toils on toils oppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_3497'>Leucothea saw, and pity touch'd her breast.</a>
<a id='line_3498'>(Herself a mortal once, of Cadmus' strain,</a>
<a id='line_3499'>But now an azure sister of the main)</a>
<a id='line_3500'>Swift as a sea-mew springing from the flood,</a>
<a id='line_3501'>All radiant on the raft the goddess stood;</a>
<a id='line_3502'>Then thus address'd him: "Thou whom heaven decrees</a>
<a id='line_3503'>To Neptune's wrath, stern tyrant of the seas!</a>
<a id='line_3504'>(Unequal contest!) not his rage and power,</a>
<a id='line_3505'>Great as he is, such virtue shall devour.</a>
<a id='line_3506'>What I suggest, thy wisdom will perform:</a>
<a id='line_3507'>Forsake thy float, and leave it to the storm;</a>
<a id='line_3508'>Strip off thy garments; Neptune's fury brave</a>
<a id='line_3509'>With naked strength, and plunge into the wave.</a>
<a id='line_3510'>To reach Phaeacia all thy nerves extend,</a>
<a id='line_3511'>There Fate decrees thy miseries shall end.</a>
<a id='line_3512'>This heavenly scarf beneath thy bosom bind,</a>
<a id='line_3513'>And live; give all thy terrors to the wind.</a>
<a id='line_3514'>Soon as thy arms the happy shore shall gain,</a>
<a id='line_3515'>Return the gift, and cast it in the main:</a>
<a id='line_3516'>Observe my orders, and with heed obey,</a>
<a id='line_3517'>Cast it far off, and turn thy eyes away."</a>
<a id='line_3518'></a>
<a id='line_3519'>With that, her hand the sacred veil bestows,</a>
<a id='line_3520'>Then down the deeps she dived from whence she rose;</a>
<a id='line_3521'>A moment snatch'd the shining form away,</a>
<a id='line_3522'>And all was covered with the curling sea.</a>
<a id='line_3523'></a>
<a id='line_3524'>Struck with amaze, yet still to doubt inclined,</a>
<a id='line_3525'>He stands suspended, and explores his mind:</a>
<a id='line_3526'>"What shall I do? unhappy me! who knows</a>
<a id='line_3527'>But other gods intend me other woes?</a>
<a id='line_3528'>Whoe'er thou art, I shall not blindly join</a>
<a id='line_3529'>Thy pleaded reason, but consult with mine:</a>
<a id='line_3530'>For scarce in ken appears that distant isle</a>
<a id='line_3531'>Thy voice foretells me shall conclude my toil.</a>
<a id='line_3532'>Thus then I judge: while yet the planks sustain</a>
<a id='line_3533'>The wild waves' fury, here I fix'd remain:</a>
<a id='line_3534'>But, when their texture to the tempest yields,</a>
<a id='line_3535'>I launch adventurous on the liquid fields,</a>
<a id='line_3536'>Join to the help of gods the strength of man,</a>
<a id='line_3537'>And take this method, since the best I can."</a>
<a id='line_3538'></a>
<a id='line_3539'>While thus his thoughts an anxious council hold,</a>
<a id='line_3540'>The raging god a watery mountain roll'd;</a>
<a id='line_3541'>Like a black sheet the whelming billows spread,</a>
<a id='line_3542'>Burst o'er the float, and thunder'd on his head.</a>
<a id='line_3543'>Planks, beams, disparted fly; the scatter'd wood</a>
<a id='line_3544'>Rolls diverse, and in fragments strews the flood.</a>
<a id='line_3545'>So the rude Boreas, o'er the field new-shorn,</a>
<a id='line_3546'>Tosses and drives the scatter'd heaps of corn.</a>
<a id='line_3547'>And now a single beam the chief bestrides:</a>
<a id='line_3548'>There poised a while above the bounding tides,</a>
<a id='line_3549'>His limbs discumbers of the clinging vest,</a>
<a id='line_3550'>And binds the sacred cincture round his breast:</a>
<a id='line_3551'>Then prone an ocean in a moment flung,</a>
<a id='line_3552'>Stretch'd wide his eager arms, and shot the seas along.</a>
<a id='line_3553'>All naked now, on heaving billows laid,</a>
<a id='line_3554'>Stern Neptune eyed him, and contemptuous said:</a>
<a id='line_3555'></a>
<a id='line_3556'>"Go, learn'd in woes, and other foes essay!</a>
<a id='line_3557'>Go, wander helpless on the watery way;</a>
<a id='line_3558'>Thus, thus find out the destined shore, and then</a>
<a id='line_3559'>(If Jove ordains it) mix with happier men.</a>
<a id='line_3560'>Whate'er thy fate, the ills our wrath could raise</a>
<a id='line_3561'>Shall last remember'd in thy best of days."</a>
<a id='line_3562'></a>
<a id='line_3563'>This said, his sea-green steeds divide the foam,</a>
<a id='line_3564'>And reach high Aegae and the towery dome.</a>
<a id='line_3565'>Now, scarce withdrawn the fierce earth-shaking power,</a>
<a id='line_3566'>Jove's daughter Pallas watch'd the favouring hour.</a>
<a id='line_3567'>Back to their caves she bade the winds to fly;</a>
<a id='line_3568'>And hush'd the blustering brethren of the sky.</a>
<a id='line_3569'>The drier blasts alone of Boreas away,</a>
<a id='line_3570'>And bear him soft on broken waves away;</a>
<a id='line_3571'>With gentle force impelling to that shore,</a>
<a id='line_3572'>Where fate has destined he shall toil no more.</a>
<a id='line_3573'>And now, two nights, and now two days were pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_3574'>Since wide he wander'd on the watery waste;</a>
<a id='line_3575'>Heaved on the surge with intermitting breath,</a>
<a id='line_3576'>And hourly panting in the arms of death.</a>
<a id='line_3577'>The third fair morn now blazed upon the main;</a>
<a id='line_3578'>Then glassy smooth lay all the liquid plain;</a>
<a id='line_3579'>The winds were hush'd, the billows scarcely curl'd,</a>
<a id='line_3580'>And a dead silence still'd the watery world;</a>
<a id='line_3581'>When lifted on a ridgy wave he spies</a>
<a id='line_3582'>The land at distance, and with sharpen'd eyes.</a>
<a id='line_3583'>As pious children joy with vast delight</a>
<a id='line_3584'>When a loved sire revives before their sight</a>
<a id='line_3585'>(Who, lingering along, has call'd on death in vain,</a>
<a id='line_3586'>Fix'd by some demon to his bed of pain,</a>
<a id='line_3587'>Till heaven by miracle his life restore);</a>
<a id='line_3588'>So joys Ulysses at the appearing shore;</a>
<a id='line_3589'>And sees (and labours onward as he sees)</a>
<a id='line_3590'>The rising forests, and the tufted trees.</a>
<a id='line_3591'>And now, as near approaching as the sound</a>
<a id='line_3592'>Of human voice the listening ear may wound,</a>
<a id='line_3593'>Amidst the rocks he heard a hollow roar</a>
<a id='line_3594'>Of murmuring surges breaking on the shore;</a>
<a id='line_3595'>Nor peaceful port was there, nor winding bay,</a>
<a id='line_3596'>To shield the vessel from the rolling sea,</a>
<a id='line_3597'>But cliffs and shaggy shores, a dreadful sight!</a>
<a id='line_3598'>All rough with rocks, with foamy billows white.</a>
<a id='line_3599'>Fear seized his slacken'd limbs and beating heart,</a>
<a id='line_3600'>As thus he communed with his soul apart;</a>
<a id='line_3601'></a>
<a id='line_3602'>"Ah me! when, o'er a length of waters toss'd,</a>
<a id='line_3603'>These eyes at last behold the unhoped-for coast,</a>
<a id='line_3604'>No port receives me from the angry main,</a>
<a id='line_3605'>But the loud deeps demand me back again.</a>
<a id='line_3606'>Above, sharp rocks forbid access; around</a>
<a id='line_3607'>Roar the wild waves; beneath, is sea profound!</a>
<a id='line_3608'>No footing sure affords the faithless sand,</a>
<a id='line_3609'>To stem too rapid, and too deep to stand.</a>
<a id='line_3610'>If here I enter, my efforts are vain,</a>
<a id='line_3611'>Dash'd on the cliffs, or heaved into the main;</a>
<a id='line_3612'>Or round the island if my course I bend,</a>
<a id='line_3613'>Where the ports open, or the shores descend,</a>
<a id='line_3614'>Back to the seas the rolling surge may sweep,</a>
<a id='line_3615'>And bury all my hopes beneath the deep.</a>
<a id='line_3616'>Or some enormous whale the god may send</a>
<a id='line_3617'>(For many such an Amphitrite attend);</a>
<a id='line_3618'>Too well the turns of mortal chance I know,</a>
<a id='line_3619'>And hate relentless of my heavenly foe."</a>
<a id='line_3620'>While thus he thought, a monstrous wave upbore</a>
<a id='line_3621'>The chief, and dash'd him on the craggy shore;</a>
<a id='line_3622'>Torn was his skin, nor had the ribs been whole,</a>
<a id='line_3623'>But Instant Pallas enter'd in his soul.</a>
<a id='line_3624'>Close to the cliff with both his hands he clung,</a>
<a id='line_3625'>And stuck adherent, and suspended hung;</a>
<a id='line_3626'>Till the huge surge roll'd off; then backward sweep</a>
<a id='line_3627'>The refluent tides, and plunge him in the deep.</a>
<a id='line_3628'>As when the polypus, from forth his cave</a>
<a id='line_3629'>Torn with full force, reluctant beats the wave,</a>
<a id='line_3630'>His ragged claws are stuck with stones and sands;</a>
<a id='line_3631'>So the rough rock had shagg'd Ulysses hands,</a>
<a id='line_3632'>And now had perish'd, whelm'd beneath the main,</a>
<a id='line_3633'>The unhappy man; e'en fate had been in vain;</a>
<a id='line_3634'>But all-subduing Pallas lent her power,</a>
<a id='line_3635'>And prudence saved him in the needful hour.</a>
<a id='line_3636'>Beyond the beating surge his course he bore,</a>
<a id='line_3637'>(A wider circle, but in sight of shore),</a>
<a id='line_3638'>With longing eyes, observing, to survey</a>
<a id='line_3639'>Some smooth ascent, or safe sequester'd bay.</a>
<a id='line_3640'>Between the parting rocks at length he spied</a>
<a id='line_3641'>A failing stream with gentler waters glide;</a>
<a id='line_3642'>Where to the seas the shelving shore declined,</a>
<a id='line_3643'>And form'd a bay impervious to the wind.</a>
<a id='line_3644'>To this calm port the glad Ulysses press'd,</a>
<a id='line_3645'>And hail'd the river, and its god address'd:</a>
<a id='line_3646'></a>
<a id='line_3647'>"Whoe'er thou art, before whose stream unknown</a>
<a id='line_3648'>I bend, a suppliant at thy watery throne,</a>
<a id='line_3649'>Hear, azure king! nor let me fly in vain</a>
<a id='line_3650'>To thee from Neptune and the raging main</a>
<a id='line_3651'>Heaven hears and pities hapless men like me,</a>
<a id='line_3652'>For sacred even to gods is misery:</a>
<a id='line_3653'>Let then thy waters give the weary rest,</a>
<a id='line_3654'>And save a suppliant, and a man distress'd."</a>
<a id='line_3655'></a>
<a id='line_3656'>He pray'd, and straight the gentle stream subsides,</a>
<a id='line_3657'>Detains the rushing current of his tides,</a>
<a id='line_3658'>Before the wanderer smooths the watery way,</a>
<a id='line_3659'>And soft receives him from the rolling sea.</a>
<a id='line_3660'>That moment, fainting as he touch'd the shore,</a>
<a id='line_3661'>He dropp'd his sinewy arms: his knees no more</a>
<a id='line_3662'>Perform'd their office, or his weight upheld:</a>
<a id='line_3663'>His swoln heart heaved; his bloated body swell'd:</a>
<a id='line_3664'>From mouth and nose the briny torrent ran;</a>
<a id='line_3665'>And lost in lassitude lay all the man,</a>
<a id='line_3666'>Deprived of voice, of motion, and of breath;</a>
<a id='line_3667'>The soul scarce waking in the arms of death.</a>
<a id='line_3668'>Soon as warm life its wonted office found,</a>
<a id='line_3669'>The mindful chief Leucothea's scarf unbound;</a>
<a id='line_3670'>Observant of her word, he turn'd aside</a>
<a id='line_3671'>HIs head, and cast it on the rolling tide.</a>
<a id='line_3672'>Behind him far, upon the purple waves,</a>
<a id='line_3673'>The waters waft it, and the nymph receives.</a>
<a id='line_3674'></a>
<a id='line_3675'>Now parting from the stream, Ulysses found</a>
<a id='line_3676'>A mossy bank with pliant rushes crown'd;</a>
<a id='line_3677'>The bank he press'd, and gently kiss'd the ground;</a>
<a id='line_3678'>Where on the flowery herb as soft he lay,</a>
<a id='line_3679'>Thus to his soul the sage began to say:</a>
<a id='line_3680'></a>
<a id='line_3681'>"What will ye next ordain, ye powers on high!</a>
<a id='line_3682'>And yet, ah yet, what fates are we to try?</a>
<a id='line_3683'>Here by the stream, if I the night out-wear,</a>
<a id='line_3684'>Thus spent already, how shall nature bear</a>
<a id='line_3685'>The dews descending, and nocturnal air;</a>
<a id='line_3686'>Or chilly vapours breathing from the flood</a>
<a id='line_3687'>When morning rises?--If I take the wood,</a>
<a id='line_3688'>And in thick shelter of innumerous boughs</a>
<a id='line_3689'>Enjoy the comfort gentle sleep allows;</a>
<a id='line_3690'>Though fenced from cold, and though my toil be pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_3691'>What savage beasts may wander in the waste?</a>
<a id='line_3692'>Perhaps I yet may fall a bloody prey</a>
<a id='line_3693'>To prowling bears, or lions in the way."</a>
<a id='line_3694'></a>
<a id='line_3695'>Thus long debating in himself he stood:</a>
<a id='line_3696'>At length he took the passage to the wood,</a>
<a id='line_3697'>Whose shady horrors on a rising brow</a>
<a id='line_3698'>Waved high, and frown'd upon the stream below.</a>
<a id='line_3699'>There grew two olives, closest of the grove,</a>
<a id='line_3700'>With roots entwined, the branches interwove;</a>
<a id='line_3701'>Alike their leaves, but not alike they smiled</a>
<a id='line_3702'>With sister-fruits; one fertile, one was wild.</a>
<a id='line_3703'>Nor here the sun's meridian rays had power,</a>
<a id='line_3704'>Nor wind sharp-piercing, nor the rushing shower;</a>
<a id='line_3705'>The verdant arch so close its texture kept:</a>
<a id='line_3706'>Beneath this covert great Ulysses crept.</a>
<a id='line_3707'>Of gather'd leaves an ample bed he made</a>
<a id='line_3708'>(Thick strewn by tempest through the bowery shade);</a>
<a id='line_3709'>Where three at least might winter's cold defy,</a>
<a id='line_3710'>Though Boreas raged along the inclement sky.</a>
<a id='line_3711'>This store with joy the patient hero found,</a>
<a id='line_3712'>And, sunk amidst them, heap'd the leaves around.</a>
<a id='line_3713'>As some poor peasant, fated to reside</a>
<a id='line_3714'>Remote from neighbours in a forest wide,</a>
<a id='line_3715'>Studious to save what human wants require,</a>
<a id='line_3716'>In embers heap'd, preserves the seeds of fire:</a>
<a id='line_3717'>Hid in dry foliage thus Ulysses lies,</a>
<a id='line_3718'>Till Pallas pour'd soft slumbers on his eyes;</a>
<a id='line_3719'>And golden dreams (the gift of sweet repose)</a>
<a id='line_3720'>Lull'd all his cares, and banish'd all his woes.</a>

<a id='line_3724'>BOOK VI.</a>
<a id='line_3725'></a>
<a id='line_3726'>ARGUMENT.</a>
<a id='line_3727'></a>
<a id='line_3728'>Pallas appearing in a dream in to Nausicaa (the daughter of</a>
<a id='line_3729'>Alcinous, king of Phaeacia, commands her to descend to the river,</a>
<a id='line_3730'>and wash the robes of state, in preparation for her nuptials.</a>
<a id='line_3731'>Nausicaa goes with her handmaidens to the river; where, while the</a>
<a id='line_3732'>garments are spread on the bank, they divert themselves in sports.</a>
<a id='line_3733'>Their voices awaken Ulysses, who, addressing himself to the</a>
<a id='line_3734'>princess, is by her relieved and clothed, and receives directions</a>
<a id='line_3735'>in what manner to apply to the king and queen of the island.</a>
<a id='line_3736'></a>
<a id='line_3737'></a>
<a id='line_3738'></a>
<a id='line_3739'>While thus the weary wanderer sunk to rest,</a>
<a id='line_3740'>And peaceful slumbers calmed his anxious breast,</a>
<a id='line_3741'>The martial maid from heavens aerial height</a>
<a id='line_3742'>Swift to Phaeacia wing'd her rapid flight,</a>
<a id='line_3743'>In elder times the soft Phaeacian train</a>
<a id='line_3744'>In ease possess'd the wide Hyperian plain;</a>
<a id='line_3745'>Till the Cyclopean race in arms arose</a>
<a id='line_3746'>A lawless nation of gigantic foes;</a>
<a id='line_3747'>Then great Nausithous from Hyperia far,</a>
<a id='line_3748'>Through seas retreating from the sounds of war,</a>
<a id='line_3749'>The recreant nation to fair Scheria led,</a>
<a id='line_3750'>Where never science rear'd her laurell'd head;</a>
<a id='line_3751'>There round his tribes a strength of wall he raised;</a>
<a id='line_3752'>To heaven the glittering domes and temples blazed;</a>
<a id='line_3753'>Just to his realms, he parted grounds from grounds,</a>
<a id='line_3754'>And shared the lands, and gave the lands their bounds.</a>
<a id='line_3755'>Now in the silent grave the monarch lay,</a>
<a id='line_3756'>And wise Alcinous held the legal sway.</a>
<a id='line_3757'></a>
<a id='line_3758'>To his high palace through the fields of air</a>
<a id='line_3759'>The goddess shot; Ulysses was her care.</a>
<a id='line_3760'>There, as the night in silence roll'd away,</a>
<a id='line_3761'>A heaven of charms divine Nausicaa lay:</a>
<a id='line_3762'>Through the thick gloom the shining portals blaze;</a>
<a id='line_3763'>Two nymphs the portals guard, each nymph a Grace,</a>
<a id='line_3764'>Light as the viewless air the warrior maid</a>
<a id='line_3765'>Glides through the valves, and hovers round her head;</a>
<a id='line_3766'>A favourite virgin's blooming form she took,</a>
<a id='line_3767'>From Dymas sprung, and thus the vision spoke:</a>
<a id='line_3768'></a>
<a id='line_3769'>"Oh Indolent! to waste thy hours away!</a>
<a id='line_3770'>And sleep'st thou careless of the bridal day!</a>
<a id='line_3771'>Thy spousal ornament neglected lies;</a>
<a id='line_3772'>Arise, prepare the bridal train, arise!</a>
<a id='line_3773'>A just applause the cares of dress impart,</a>
<a id='line_3774'>And give soft transport to a parent's heart.</a>
<a id='line_3775'>Haste, to the limpid stream direct thy way,</a>
<a id='line_3776'>When the gay morn unveils her smiling ray;</a>
<a id='line_3777'>Haste to the stream! companion of thy care,</a>
<a id='line_3778'>Lo, I thy steps attend, thy labours share.</a>
<a id='line_3779'>Virgin, awake! the marriage hour is nigh,</a>
<a id='line_3780'>See from their thrones thy kindred monarchs sigh!</a>
<a id='line_3781'>The royal car at early dawn obtain,</a>
<a id='line_3782'>And order mules obedient to the rein;</a>
<a id='line_3783'>For rough the way, and distant rolls the wave,</a>
<a id='line_3784'>Where their fair vests Phaeacian virgins lave,</a>
<a id='line_3785'>In pomp ride forth; for pomp becomes the great</a>
<a id='line_3786'>And majesty derives a grace from state."</a>
<a id='line_3787'>Then to the palaces of heaven she sails,</a>
<a id='line_3788'>Incumbent on the wings of wafting gales;</a>
<a id='line_3789'>The seat of gods; the regions mild of peace,</a>
<a id='line_3790'>Full joy, and calm eternity of ease.</a>
<a id='line_3791'>There no rude winds presume to shake the skies,</a>
<a id='line_3792'>No rains descend, no snowy vapours rise;</a>
<a id='line_3793'>But on immortal thrones the blest repose;</a>
<a id='line_3794'>The firmament with living splendours glows.</a>
<a id='line_3795'>Hither the goddess winged the aerial way,</a>
<a id='line_3796'>Through heaven's eternal gates that blazed with day.</a>
<a id='line_3797'></a>
<a id='line_3798'>Now from her rosy car Aurora shed</a>
<a id='line_3799'>The dawn, and all the orient flamed with red.</a>
<a id='line_3800'>Up rose the virgin with the morning light,</a>
<a id='line_3801'>Obedient to the vision of the night.</a>
<a id='line_3802'>The queen she sought, the queen her hours bestowed</a>
<a id='line_3803'>In curious works; the whirling spindle glow'd</a>
<a id='line_3804'>With crimson threads, while busy damsels call</a>
<a id='line_3805'>The snowy fleece, or twist the purpled wool.</a>
<a id='line_3806'>Meanwhile Phaeacia's peers in council sate;</a>
<a id='line_3807'>From his high dome the king descends in state;</a>
<a id='line_3808'>Then with a filial awe the royal maid</a>
<a id='line_3809'>Approach'd him passing, and submissive said:</a>
<a id='line_3810'></a>
<a id='line_3811'>"Will my dread sire his ear regardful deign,</a>
<a id='line_3812'>And may his child the royal car obtain?</a>
<a id='line_3813'>Say, with my garments shall I bend my way?</a>
<a id='line_3814'>Where through the vales the mazy waters stray?</a>
<a id='line_3815'>A dignity of dress adorns the great,</a>
<a id='line_3816'>And kings draw lustre from the robe of state.</a>
<a id='line_3817'>Five sons thou hast; three wait the bridal day.</a>
<a id='line_3818'>And spotless robes become the young and gay;</a>
<a id='line_3819'>So when with praise amid the dance they shine,</a>
<a id='line_3820'>By these my cares adorn'd that praise is mine."</a>
<a id='line_3821'></a>
<a id='line_3822'>Thus she: but blushes ill-restrain'd betray</a>
<a id='line_3823'>Her thoughts intentive on the bridal day,</a>
<a id='line_3824'>The conscious sire the dawning blush survey'd,</a>
<a id='line_3825'>And, smiling, thus bespoke the blooming maid</a>
<a id='line_3826'>"My child, my darling joy, the car receive;</a>
<a id='line_3827'>That, and whate'er our daughter asks, we give."</a>
<a id='line_3828'>Swift at the royal nod the attending train</a>
<a id='line_3829'>The car prepare, the mules incessant rein,</a>
<a id='line_3830'>The blooming virgin with despatchful cares</a>
<a id='line_3831'>Tunics, and stoles, and robes imperial, bears.</a>
<a id='line_3832'>The queen, assiduous to her train assigns</a>
<a id='line_3833'>The sumptuous viands, and the flavorous wines.</a>
<a id='line_3834'>The train prepare a cruse of curious mould,</a>
<a id='line_3835'>A cruse of fragrance, form'd of burnish'd gold;</a>
<a id='line_3836'>Odour divine! whose soft refreshing streams</a>
<a id='line_3837'>Sleek the smooth skin, and scent the snowy limbs.</a>
<a id='line_3838'></a>
<a id='line_3839'>Now mounting the gay seat, the silken reins</a>
<a id='line_3840'>Shine in her hand; along the sounding plains</a>
<a id='line_3841'>Swift fly the mules; nor rode the nymph alone;</a>
<a id='line_3842'>Around, a bevy of bright damsels shone.</a>
<a id='line_3843'>They seek the cisterns where Phaeacian dames</a>
<a id='line_3844'>Wash their fair garments in the limpid streams;</a>
<a id='line_3845'>Where, gathering into depth from falling rills,</a>
<a id='line_3846'>The lucid wave a spacious bason fills.</a>
<a id='line_3847'>The mules, unharness'd, range beside the main,</a>
<a id='line_3848'>Or crop the verdant herbage of the plain.</a>
<a id='line_3849'></a>
<a id='line_3850'>Then emulous the royal robes they lave,</a>
<a id='line_3851'>And plunge the vestures in the cleansing wave</a>
<a id='line_3852'>(The vestures cleansed o'erspread the shelly sand,</a>
<a id='line_3853'>Their snowy lustre whitens all the strand);</a>
<a id='line_3854'>Then with a short repast relieve their toil,</a>
<a id='line_3855'>And o'er their limbs diffuse ambrosial oil;</a>
<a id='line_3856'>And while the robes imbibe the solar ray,</a>
<a id='line_3857'>O'er the green mead the sporting virgins play</a>
<a id='line_3858'>(Their shining veils unbound). Along the skies,</a>
<a id='line_3859'>Toss'd and retoss'd, the ball incessant flies.</a>
<a id='line_3860'>They sport, they feast; Nausicaa lifts her voice,</a>
<a id='line_3861'>And, warbling sweet, makes earth and heaven rejoice.</a>
<a id='line_3862'></a>
<a id='line_3863'>As when o'er Erymanth Diana roves,</a>
<a id='line_3864'>Or wide Tuygetus' resounding groves;</a>
<a id='line_3865'>A sylvan train the huntress queen surrounds,</a>
<a id='line_3866'>Her rattling quiver from her shoulders sounds:</a>
<a id='line_3867'>Fierce in the sport, along the mountain's brow</a>
<a id='line_3868'>They bay the boar, or chase the bounding roe;</a>
<a id='line_3869'>High o'er the lawn, with more majestic pace,</a>
<a id='line_3870'>Above the nymphs she treads with stately grace;</a>
<a id='line_3871'>Distinguish'd excellence the goddess proves;</a>
<a id='line_3872'>Exults Latona as the virgin moves.</a>
<a id='line_3873'>With equal grace Nausicaa trod the plain,</a>
<a id='line_3874'>And shone transcendent o'er the beauteous train.</a>
<a id='line_3875'></a>
<a id='line_3876'>Meantime (the care and favourite of the skies</a>
<a id='line_3877'>Wrapp'd in imbowering shade, Ulysses lies,</a>
<a id='line_3878'>His woes forgot! but Pallas now address'd</a>
<a id='line_3879'>To break the bands of all-composing rest.</a>
<a id='line_3880'>Forth from her snowy hand Nausicaa threw</a>
<a id='line_3881'>The various ball; the ball erroneous flew</a>
<a id='line_3882'>And swam the stream; loud shrieks the virgin train,</a>
<a id='line_3883'>And the loud shriek redoubles from the main.</a>
<a id='line_3884'>Waked by the shrilling sound, Ulysses rose,</a>
<a id='line_3885'>And, to the deaf woods wailing, breathed his woes:</a>
<a id='line_3886'></a>
<a id='line_3887'>"Ah me! on what inhospitable coast,</a>
<a id='line_3888'>On what new region is Ulysses toss'd;</a>
<a id='line_3889'>Possess'd by wild barbarians fierce in arms;</a>
<a id='line_3890'>Or men, whose bosom tender pity warms?</a>
<a id='line_3891'>What sounds are these that gather from he shores?</a>
<a id='line_3892'>The voice of nymphs that haunt the sylvan bowers,</a>
<a id='line_3893'>The fair-hair'd Dryads of the shady wood;</a>
<a id='line_3894'>Or azure daughters of the silver flood;</a>
<a id='line_3895'>Or human voice? but issuing from the shades,</a>
<a id='line_3896'>Why cease I straight to learn what sound invades?"</a>
<a id='line_3897'></a>
<a id='line_3898'>Then, where the grove with leaves umbrageous bends,</a>
<a id='line_3899'>With forceful strength a branch the hero rends;</a>
<a id='line_3900'>Around his loins the verdant cincture spreads</a>
<a id='line_3901'>A wreathy foliage and concealing shades.</a>
<a id='line_3902'>As when a lion in the midnight hours,</a>
<a id='line_3903'>Beat by rude blasts, and wet with wintry showers,</a>
<a id='line_3904'>Descends terrific from the mountains brow;</a>
<a id='line_3905'>With living flames his rolling eye balls glow;</a>
<a id='line_3906'>With conscious strength elate, he bends his way,</a>
<a id='line_3907'>Majestically fierce, to seize his prey</a>
<a id='line_3908'>(The steer or stag;) or, with keen hunger bold,</a>
<a id='line_3909'>Spring o'er the fence and dissipates the fold.</a>
<a id='line_3910'>No less a terror, from the neighbouring groves</a>
<a id='line_3911'>(Rough from the tossing surge) Ulysses moves;</a>
<a id='line_3912'>Urged on by want, and recent from the storms;</a>
<a id='line_3913'>The brackish ooze his manly grace deforms.</a>
<a id='line_3914'>Wide o'er the shore with many a piercing cry</a>
<a id='line_3915'>To rocks, to caves, the frightened virgins fly;</a>
<a id='line_3916'>All but the nymph; the nymph stood fix'd alone,</a>
<a id='line_3917'>By Pallas arm'd with boldness not her own.</a>
<a id='line_3918'>Meantime in dubious thought the king awaits,</a>
<a id='line_3919'>And, self-considering, as he stands, debates;</a>
<a id='line_3920'>Distant his mournful story to declare,</a>
<a id='line_3921'>Or prostrate at her knee address the prayer.</a>
<a id='line_3922'>But fearful to offend, by wisdom sway'd,</a>
<a id='line_3923'>At awful distance he accosts the maid:</a>
<a id='line_3924'></a>
<a id='line_3925'>"If from the skies a goddess, or if earth</a>
<a id='line_3926'>(Imperial virgin) boast thy glorious birth,</a>
<a id='line_3927'>To thee I bend! If in that bright disguise</a>
<a id='line_3928'>Thou visit earth, a daughter of the skies,</a>
<a id='line_3929'>Hail, Dian, hail! the huntress of the groves</a>
<a id='line_3930'>So shines majestic, and so stately moves,</a>
<a id='line_3931'>So breathes an air divine! But if thy race</a>
<a id='line_3932'>Be mortal, and this earth thy native place,</a>
<a id='line_3933'>Blest is the father from whose loins you sprung,</a>
<a id='line_3934'>Blest is the mother at whose breast you hung.</a>
<a id='line_3935'>Blest are the brethren who thy blood divide,</a>
<a id='line_3936'>To such a miracle of charms allied:</a>
<a id='line_3937'>Joyful they see applauding princes gaze,</a>
<a id='line_3938'>When stately in the dance you swim the harmonious maze.</a>
<a id='line_3939'>But blest o'er all, the youth with heavenly charms,</a>
<a id='line_3940'>Who clasps the bright perfection in his arms!</a>
<a id='line_3941'>Never, I never view'd till this blast hour</a>
<a id='line_3942'>Such finish'd grace! I gaze, and I adore!</a>
<a id='line_3943'>Thus seems the palm with stately honours crown'd</a>
<a id='line_3944'>By Phoebus' altars; thus o'erlooks the ground;</a>
<a id='line_3945'>The pride of Delos. (By the Delian coast,</a>
<a id='line_3946'>I voyaged, leader of a warrior-host,</a>
<a id='line_3947'>But ah, how changed I from thence my sorrow flows;</a>
<a id='line_3948'>O fatal voyage, source of all my woes;)</a>
<a id='line_3949'>Raptured I stood, and as this hour amazed,</a>
<a id='line_3950'>With reverence at the lofty wonder gazed:</a>
<a id='line_3951'>Raptured I stand! for earth ne'er knew to bear</a>
<a id='line_3952'>A plant so stately, or a nymph so fair.</a>
<a id='line_3953'>Awed from access, I lift my suppliant hands;</a>
<a id='line_3954'>For Misery, O queen! before thee stands.</a>
<a id='line_3955'>Twice ten tempestuous nights I roll'd, resign'd</a>
<a id='line_3956'>To roaring blows, and the warring wind;</a>
<a id='line_3957'>Heaven bade the deep to spare; but heaven, my foe,</a>
<a id='line_3958'>Spares only to inflict some mightier woe.</a>
<a id='line_3959'>Inured to cares, to death in all its forms;</a>
<a id='line_3960'>Outcast I rove, familiar with the storms.</a>
<a id='line_3961'>Once more I view the face of human kind:</a>
<a id='line_3962'>Oh let soft pity touch thy generous mind!</a>
<a id='line_3963'>Unconscious of what air I breathe, I stand</a>
<a id='line_3964'>Naked, defenceless on a narrow land.</a>
<a id='line_3965'>Propitious to my wants a vest supply</a>
<a id='line_3966'>To guard the wretched from the inclement sky:</a>
<a id='line_3967'>So may the gods, who heaven and earth control,</a>
<a id='line_3968'>Crown the chaste wishes of thy virtuous soul,</a>
<a id='line_3969'>On thy soft hours their choicest blessings shed;</a>

<a id='line_3972'>And lasting union crown your blissful days.</a>
<a id='line_3973'>The gods, when they supremely bless, bestow</a>
<a id='line_3974'>Firm union on their favourites below;</a>
<a id='line_3975'>Then envy grieves, with inly-pining hate;</a>

<a id='line_4007'>A vest and robe, with rich embroidery gay;</a>
<a id='line_4008'>Then unguents in a vase of gold supply,</a>
<a id='line_4009'>That breathed a fragrance through the balmy sky.</a>

<a id='line_4025'>Then, dressed, in pomp magnificently treads.</a>
<a id='line_4026'>The warrior-goddess gives his frame to shine</a>
<a id='line_4027'>With majesty enlarged, and air divine:</a>

<a id='line_4036'>A fragrance breathes around; majestic grace</a>
<a id='line_4037'>Attends his steps: the astonished virgins gaze.</a>
<a id='line_4038'>Soft he reclines along the murmuring seas,</a>

<a id='line_4040'></a>
<a id='line_4041'>The wondering nymph his glorious port survey'd,</a>

<a id='line_4064'>Where, in high state, the nobles of the land</a>
<a id='line_4065'>Attend my royal sire, a radiant band</a>

<a id='line_4068'>Advance at distance, while I pass the plain</a>
<a id='line_4069'>Where o'er the furrows waves the golden grain;</a>
<a id='line_4070'>Alone I reascend--With airy mounds</a>
<a id='line_4071'>A strength of wall the guarded city bounds;</a>
<a id='line_4072'>The jutting land two ample bays divides:</a>
<a id='line_4073'>Full through the narrow mouths descend the tides;</a>
<a id='line_4074'>The spacious basons arching rocks enclose,</a>
<a id='line_4075'>A sure defence from every storm that blows.</a>
<a id='line_4076'>Close to the bay great Neptune's fane adjoins;</a>
<a id='line_4077'>And near, a forum flank'd with marble shines,</a>
<a id='line_4078'>Where the bold youth, the numerous fleets to store,</a>
<a id='line_4079'>Shape the broad sail, or smooth the taper oar:</a>
<a id='line_4080'>For not the bow they bend, nor boast the skill</a>
<a id='line_4081'>To give the feather'd arrow wings to kill;</a>
<a id='line_4082'>But the tall mast above the vessel rear,</a>
<a id='line_4083'>Or teach the fluttering sail to float in air.</a>
<a id='line_4084'>They rush into the deep with eager joy,</a>
<a id='line_4085'>Climb the steep surge, and through the tempest fly;</a>
<a id='line_4086'>A proud, unpolish'd race--To me belongs</a>
<a id='line_4087'>The care to shun the blast of slanderous tongues;</a>
<a id='line_4088'>Lest malice, prone the virtuous to defame,</a>
<a id='line_4089'>Thus with wild censure taint my spotless name:</a>
<a id='line_4090'>'What stranger this whom thus Nausicaa leads!</a>
<a id='line_4091'>Heavens, with what graceful majesty he treads!</a>
<a id='line_4092'>Perhaps a native of some distant shore,</a>

<a id='line_4094'>Or rather some descendant of the skies;</a>
<a id='line_4095'>Won by her prayer, the aerial bridegroom flies,</a>

<a id='line_4110'>We bend our way; a bubbling fount distills</a>
<a id='line_4111'>A lucid lake, and thence descends in rills;</a>
<a id='line_4112'>Around the grove, a mead with lively green</a>
<a id='line_4113'>Falls by degrees, and forms a beauteous scene;</a>
<a id='line_4114'>Here a rich juice the royal vineyard pours;</a>
<a id='line_4115'>And there the garden yields a waste of flowers.</a>
<a id='line_4116'>Hence lies the town, as far as to the ear</a>

<a id='line_4164'>The court of Alcinous.</a>
<a id='line_4165'></a>
<a id='line_4166'>The princess Nausicaa returns to the city and Ulysses soon after</a>
<a id='line_4167'>follows thither. He is met by Pallas in the form of a young</a>
<a id='line_4168'>virgin, who guides him to the palace, and directs him in what</a>
<a id='line_4169'>manner to address the queen Arete. She then involves him in a mist</a>
<a id='line_4170'>which causes him to pass invisible. The palace and gardens of</a>
<a id='line_4171'>Alcinous described. Ulysses falling at the feet of the queen, the</a>
<a id='line_4172'>mist disperses, the Phaecians admire, and receive him with</a>
<a id='line_4173'>respect. The queen inquiring by what means he had the garments he</a>
<a id='line_4174'>then wore, be relates to her and Alcinous his departure from</a>
<a id='line_4175'>Calypso, and his arrival in their dominions.</a>

<a id='line_4180'>The patient heavenly man thus suppliant pray'd;</a>

<a id='line_4188'>Whose charms in youth her father's heart inflamed,</a>
<a id='line_4189'>Now worn with age, Eurymedusa named;</a>

<a id='line_4205'>His step a virgin met, and stood before:</a>

<a id='line_4308'>Alive each animated frame appears,</a>
<a id='line_4309'>And still to live beyond the power of years,</a>
<a id='line_4310'>Fair thrones within from space to space were raised,</a>
<a id='line_4311'>Where various carpets with embroidery blessed,</a>
<a id='line_4312'>The work of matrons: these the princes press'd.</a>
<a id='line_4313'>Day following day, a long-continued feast,</a>
<a id='line_4314'>Refulgent pedestals the walls surround,</a>
<a id='line_4315'>Which boys of gold with illuming torches crown'd;</a>
<a id='line_4316'>The polish'd oar, reflecting every ray,</a>
<a id='line_4317'>Blazed on the banquets with a double day.</a>
<a id='line_4318'>Full fifty handmaids form the household train;</a>
<a id='line_4319'>Some turn the mill, or sift the golden grain;</a>
<a id='line_4320'>Some ply the loom; their busy fingers move</a>
<a id='line_4321'>Like poplar-leaves when Zephyr fans the grove.</a>
<a id='line_4322'>Not more renown'd the men of Scheria's isle</a>
<a id='line_4323'>For sailing arts and all the naval toil,</a>
<a id='line_4324'>Than works of female skill their women's pride,</a>
<a id='line_4325'>The flying shuttle through the threads to guide:</a>
<a id='line_4326'>Pallas to these her double gifts imparts,</a>
<a id='line_4327'>Incentive genius, and industrious arts.</a>
<a id='line_4328'></a>
<a id='line_4329'>Close to the gates a spacious garden lies,</a>
<a id='line_4330'>From storms defended and inclement skies.</a>
<a id='line_4331'>Four acres was the allotted space of ground,</a>
<a id='line_4332'>Fenced with a green enclosure all around.</a>
<a id='line_4333'>Tall thriving trees confess'd the fruitful mould:</a>
<a id='line_4334'>The reddening apple ripens here to gold.</a>
<a id='line_4335'>Here the blue fig with luscious juice o'erflows,</a>
<a id='line_4336'>With deeper red the full pomegranate glows;</a>
<a id='line_4337'>The branch here bends beneath the weighty pear,</a>
<a id='line_4338'>And verdant olives flourish round the year,</a>
<a id='line_4339'>The balmy spirit of the western gale</a>
<a id='line_4340'>Eternal breathes on fruits, unthought to fail:</a>
<a id='line_4341'>Each dropping pear a following pear supplies,</a>
<a id='line_4342'>On apples apples, figs on figs arise:</a>
<a id='line_4343'>The same mild season gives the blooms to blow,</a>
<a id='line_4344'>The buds to harden, and the fruits to grow.</a>
<a id='line_4345'></a>
<a id='line_4346'>Here order'd vines in equal ranks appear,</a>
<a id='line_4347'>With all the united labours of the year;</a>
<a id='line_4348'>Some to unload the fertile branches run,</a>
<a id='line_4349'>Some dry the blackening clusters in the sun,</a>
<a id='line_4350'>Others to tread the liquid harvest join:</a>
<a id='line_4351'>The groaning presses foam with floods of wine</a>
<a id='line_4352'>Here are the vines in early flower descried,</a>
<a id='line_4353'>Here grapes discolour'd on the sunnyside,</a>
<a id='line_4354'>And there in autumn's richest purple dyed,</a>
<a id='line_4355'></a>
<a id='line_4356'>Beds of all various herbs, for ever green,</a>
<a id='line_4357'>In beauteous order terminate the scene.</a>
<a id='line_4358'></a>
<a id='line_4359'>Two plenteous fountains the whole prospect crown'd</a>
<a id='line_4360'>This through the gardens leads its streams around</a>
<a id='line_4361'>Visits each plant, and waters all the ground;</a>
<a id='line_4362'>While that in pipes beneath the palace flows,</a>
<a id='line_4363'>And thence its current on the town bestows:</a>
<a id='line_4364'>To various use their various streams they bring,</a>
<a id='line_4365'>The people one, and one supplies the king.</a>
<a id='line_4366'></a>
<a id='line_4367'>Such were the glories which the gods ordain'd,</a>
<a id='line_4368'>To grace Alcinous, and his happy land.</a>
<a id='line_4369'>E'en from the chief whom men and nations knew,</a>
<a id='line_4370'>The unwonted scene surprise and rapture drew;</a>
<a id='line_4371'>In pleasing thought he ran the prospect o'er,</a>
<a id='line_4372'>Then hasty enter'd at the lofty door.</a>
<a id='line_4373'>Night now approaching, in the palace stand,</a>
<a id='line_4374'>With goblets crown'd, the rulers of the land;</a>
<a id='line_4375'>Prepared for rest, and offering to the god</a>
<a id='line_4376'>Who bears the virtue of the sleepy rod,</a>
<a id='line_4377'>Unseen he glided through the joyous crowd,</a>
<a id='line_4378'>With darkness circled, and an ambient cloud.</a>
<a id='line_4379'>Direct to great Alcinous' throne he came,</a>
<a id='line_4380'>And prostrate fell before the imperial dame.</a>
<a id='line_4381'>Then from around him dropp'd the veil of night;</a>
<a id='line_4382'>Sudden he shines, and manifest to sight.</a>
<a id='line_4383'>The nobles gaze, with awful fear oppress'd;</a>
<a id='line_4384'>Silent they gaze, and eye the godlike guest.</a>
<a id='line_4385'></a>
<a id='line_4386'>"Daughter of great Rhexenor! (thus began,</a>
<a id='line_4387'>Low at her knees, the much-enduring man)</a>
<a id='line_4388'>To thee, thy consort, and this royal train,</a>
<a id='line_4389'>To all that share the blessings of your reign,</a>
<a id='line_4390'>A suppliant bends: oh pity human woe!</a>
<a id='line_4391'>'Tis what the happy to the unhappy owe.</a>
<a id='line_4392'>A wretched exile to his country send,</a>
<a id='line_4393'>Long worn with griefs, and long without a friend</a>
<a id='line_4394'>So may the gods your better days increase,</a>
<a id='line_4395'>And all your joys descend on all your race;</a>
<a id='line_4396'>So reign for ever on your country's breast,</a>
<a id='line_4397'>Your people blessing, by your people bless'd!"</a>
<a id='line_4398'></a>
<a id='line_4399'>Then to the genial hearth he bow'd his face,</a>
<a id='line_4400'>And humbled in the ashes took his place.</a>
<a id='line_4401'>Silence ensued.  The eldest first began,</a>
<a id='line_4402'>Echeneus sage, a venerable man!</a>
<a id='line_4403'>Whose well-taught mind the present age surpass'd,</a>
<a id='line_4404'>And join'd to that the experience of the last.</a>
<a id='line_4405'>Fit words attended on his weighty sense,</a>
<a id='line_4406'>And mild persuasion flow'd in eloquence.</a>
<a id='line_4407'></a>
<a id='line_4408'>"Oh sight (he cried) dishonest and unjust!</a>
<a id='line_4409'>A guest, a stranger, seated in the dust!</a>
<a id='line_4410'>To raise the lowly suppliant from the ground</a>
<a id='line_4411'>Befits a monarch. Lo! the peers around</a>
<a id='line_4412'>But wait thy word, the gentle guest to grace,</a>
<a id='line_4413'>And seat him fair in some distinguish'd place.</a>
<a id='line_4414'>Let first the herald due libation pay</a>
<a id='line_4415'>To Jove, who guides the wanderer on his way:</a>
<a id='line_4416'>Then set the genial banquet in his view,</a>
<a id='line_4417'>And give the stranger-guest a stranger's due."</a>
<a id='line_4418'></a>
<a id='line_4419'>His sage advice the listening king obeys,</a>
<a id='line_4420'>He stretch'd his hand the prudent chief to raise,</a>
<a id='line_4421'>And from his seat Laodamas removed</a>
<a id='line_4422'>(The monarch's offspring, and his best-beloved);</a>
<a id='line_4423'>There next his side the godlike hero sate;</a>
<a id='line_4424'>With stars of silver shone the bed of state.</a>
<a id='line_4425'>The golden ewer a beauteous handmaid brings,</a>
<a id='line_4426'>Replenish'd from the cool translucent springs,</a>
<a id='line_4427'>Whose polish'd vase with copious streams supplies</a>
<a id='line_4428'>A silver layer of capacious size.</a>
<a id='line_4429'>The table next in regal order spread,</a>
<a id='line_4430'>The glittering canisters are heap'd with bread:</a>
<a id='line_4431'>Viands of various kinds invite the taste,</a>
<a id='line_4432'>Of choicest sort and savour, rich repast!</a>
<a id='line_4433'>Thus feasting high, Alcinous gave the sign,</a>
<a id='line_4434'>And bade the herald pour the rosy wine;</a>
<a id='line_4435'>"Let all around the due libation pay</a>
<a id='line_4436'>To Jove, who guides the wanderer on his way."</a>
<a id='line_4437'></a>
<a id='line_4438'>He said. Pontonous heard the king's command;</a>
<a id='line_4439'>The circling goblet moves from hand to hand;</a>
<a id='line_4440'>Each drinks the juice that glads the heart of man.</a>
<a id='line_4441'>Alcinous then, with aspect mild, began:</a>
<a id='line_4442'></a>
<a id='line_4443'>"Princes and peers, attend; while we impart</a>
<a id='line_4444'>To you the thoughts of no inhuman heart.</a>
<a id='line_4445'>Now pleased and satiate from the social rite</a>
<a id='line_4446'>Repair we to the blessings of the night;</a>
<a id='line_4447'>But with the rising day, assembled here,</a>
<a id='line_4448'>Let all the elders of the land appear,</a>
<a id='line_4449'>Pious observe our hospitable laws,</a>
<a id='line_4450'>And Heaven propitiate in the stranger's cause;</a>
<a id='line_4451'>Then join'd in council, proper means explore</a>
<a id='line_4452'>Safe to transport him to the wished-for shore</a>
<a id='line_4453'>(How distant that, imports us not to know,</a>
<a id='line_4454'>Nor weigh the labour, but relieve the woe).</a>
<a id='line_4455'>Meantime, nor harm nor anguish let him bear</a>
<a id='line_4456'>This interval, Heaven trusts him to our care</a>
<a id='line_4457'>But to his native land our charge resign'd,</a>
<a id='line_4458'>Heaven's is his life to come, and all the woes behind.</a>
<a id='line_4459'>Then must he suffer what the Fates ordain;</a>
<a id='line_4460'>For Fate has wove the thread of life with pain?</a>
<a id='line_4461'>And twins, e'en from the birth, are Misery and Man!</a>
<a id='line_4462'>But if, descended from the Olympian bower,</a>
<a id='line_4463'>Gracious approach us some immortal power;</a>
<a id='line_4464'>If in that form thou comest a guest divine:</a>
<a id='line_4465'>Some high event the conscious gods design.</a>
<a id='line_4466'>As yet, unbid they never graced our feast,</a>
<a id='line_4467'>The solemn sacrifice call'd down the guest;</a>
<a id='line_4468'>Then manifest of Heaven the vision stood,</a>
<a id='line_4469'>And to our eyes familiar was the god.</a>
<a id='line_4470'>Oft with some favour'd traveller they stray,</a>
<a id='line_4471'>And shine before him all the desert way;</a>
<a id='line_4472'>With social intercourse, and face to face,</a>
<a id='line_4473'>The friends and guardians of our pious race.</a>
<a id='line_4474'>So near approach we their celestial kind,</a>
<a id='line_4475'>By justice, truth, and probity of mind;</a>
<a id='line_4476'>As our dire neighbours of Cyclopean birth</a>
<a id='line_4477'>Match in fierce wrong the giant-sons of earth."</a>
<a id='line_4478'></a>
<a id='line_4479'>"Let no such thought (with modest grace rejoin'd</a>
<a id='line_4480'>The prudent Greek) possess the royal mind.</a>
<a id='line_4481'>Alas! a mortal, like thyself, am I;</a>
<a id='line_4482'>No glorious native of yon azure sky:</a>
<a id='line_4483'>In form, ah how unlike their heavenly kind!</a>
<a id='line_4484'>How more inferior in the gifts of mind!</a>
<a id='line_4485'>Alas, a mortal! most oppress'd of those</a>
<a id='line_4486'>Whom Fate has loaded with a weight of woes;</a>
<a id='line_4487'>By a sad train of Miseries alone</a>
<a id='line_4488'>Distinguish'd long, and second now to none!</a>
<a id='line_4489'>By Heaven's high will compell'd from shore to shore;</a>
<a id='line_4490'>With Heaven's high will prepared to suffer more.</a>
<a id='line_4491'>What histories of toil could I declare!</a>
<a id='line_4492'>But still long-wearied nature wants repair;</a>
<a id='line_4493'>Spent with fatigue, and shrunk with pining fast,</a>
<a id='line_4494'>My craving bowels still require repast.</a>
<a id='line_4495'>Howe'er the noble, suffering mind may grieve</a>
<a id='line_4496'>Its load of anguish, and disdain to live,</a>
<a id='line_4497'>Necessity demands our daily bread;</a>
<a id='line_4498'>Hunger is insolent, and will be fed.</a>
<a id='line_4499'>But finish, oh ye peers! what you propose,</a>
<a id='line_4500'>And let the morrow's dawn conclude my woes.</a>
<a id='line_4501'>Pleased will I suffer all the gods ordain,</a>
<a id='line_4502'>To see my soil, my son, my friends again.</a>
<a id='line_4503'>That view vouchsafed, let instant death surprise</a>
<a id='line_4504'>With ever-during shade these happy eyes!"</a>
<a id='line_4505'></a>
<a id='line_4506'>The assembled peers with general praise approved</a>
<a id='line_4507'>His pleaded reason, and the suit he moved.</a>
<a id='line_4508'>Each drinks a full oblivion of his cares,</a>
<a id='line_4509'>And to the gifts of balmy sleep repairs,</a>
<a id='line_4510'>Ulysses in the regal walls alone</a>
<a id='line_4511'>Remain'd: beside him, on a splendid throne,</a>
<a id='line_4512'>Divine Arete and Alcinous shone.</a>
<a id='line_4513'>The queen, an nearer view, the guest survey'd,</a>
<a id='line_4514'>Rob'd in the garments her own hands had made,</a>
<a id='line_4515'>Not without wonder seen. Then thus began,</a>
<a id='line_4516'>Her words addressing to the godlike man:</a>
<a id='line_4517'></a>
<a id='line_4518'>"Camest thou hither, wondrous stranger I say,</a>
<a id='line_4519'>From lands remote and o'er a length of sea?</a>
<a id='line_4520'>Tell, then, whence art thou? whence, that princely air?</a>
<a id='line_4521'>And robes like these, so recent and so fair?"</a>
<a id='line_4522'></a>
<a id='line_4523'>"Hard is the task, O princess! you impose</a>
<a id='line_4524'>(Thus sighing spoke the man of many woes),</a>
<a id='line_4525'>The long, the mournful series to relate</a>
<a id='line_4526'>Of all my sorrows sent by Heaven and Fate!</a>
<a id='line_4527'>Yet what you ask, attend.  An island lies</a>
<a id='line_4528'>Beyond these tracts, and under other skies,</a>
<a id='line_4529'>Ogygia named, in Ocean's watery arms;</a>
<a id='line_4530'>Where dwells Calypso, dreadful in her charms!</a>
<a id='line_4531'>Remote from gods or men she holds her reign,</a>
<a id='line_4532'>Amid the terrors of a rolling main.</a>
<a id='line_4533'>Me, only me, the hand of fortune bore,</a>
<a id='line_4534'>Unblest! to tread that interdicted shore:</a>
<a id='line_4535'>When Jove tremendous in the sable deeps</a>
<a id='line_4536'>Launch'd his red lightning at our scattered ships;</a>
<a id='line_4537'>Then, all my fleet and all my followers lost.</a>
<a id='line_4538'>Sole on a plank on boiling surges toss'd,</a>
<a id='line_4539'>Heaven drove my wreck the Ogygian Isle to find,</a>
<a id='line_4540'>Full nine days floating to the wave and wind.</a>
<a id='line_4541'>Met by the goddess there with open arms,</a>
<a id='line_4542'>She bribed my stay with more than human charms;</a>
<a id='line_4543'>Nay, promised, vainly promised, to bestow</a>
<a id='line_4544'>Immortal life, exempt from age and woe;</a>
<a id='line_4545'>But all her blandishments successless prove,</a>
<a id='line_4546'>To banish from my breast my country's love.</a>
<a id='line_4547'>I stay reluctant seven continued years,</a>
<a id='line_4548'>And water her ambrosial couch with tears,</a>
<a id='line_4549'>The eighth she voluntary moves to part,</a>
<a id='line_4550'>Or urged by Jove, or her own changeful heart.</a>
<a id='line_4551'>A raft was formed to cross the surging sea;</a>
<a id='line_4552'>Herself supplied the stores and rich array,</a>
<a id='line_4553'>And gave the gales to waft me on my way,</a>
<a id='line_4554'>In seventeen days appear'd your pleasing coast,</a>
<a id='line_4555'>And woody mountains half in vapours lost.</a>
<a id='line_4556'>Joy touched my soul; my soul was joy'd in vain,</a>
<a id='line_4557'>For angry Neptune roused the raging main;</a>
<a id='line_4558'>The wild winds whistle, and the billows roar;</a>
<a id='line_4559'>The splitting raft the furious tempest tore;</a>
<a id='line_4560'>And storms vindictive intercept the shore.</a>
<a id='line_4561'>Soon as their rage subsides, the seas I brave</a>
<a id='line_4562'>With naked force, and shoot along the wave,</a>
<a id='line_4563'>To reach this isle; but there my hopes were lost,</a>
<a id='line_4564'>The surge impell'd me on a craggy coast.</a>
<a id='line_4565'>I chose the safer sea, and chanced to find</a>
<a id='line_4566'>A river's mouth impervious to the wind,</a>
<a id='line_4567'>And clear of rocks. I fainted by the flood;</a>
<a id='line_4568'>Then took the shelter of the neighbouring wood.</a>
<a id='line_4569'>'Twas night, and, covered in the foliage deep,</a>
<a id='line_4570'>Jove plunged my senses in the death of sleep.</a>
<a id='line_4571'>All night I slept, oblivious of my pain:</a>
<a id='line_4572'>Aurora dawned and Phoebus shined in vain,</a>
<a id='line_4573'>Nor, till oblique he sloped his evening ray,</a>
<a id='line_4574'>Had Somnus dried the balmy dews away.</a>
<a id='line_4575'>Then female voices from the shore I heard:</a>
<a id='line_4576'>A maid amidst them, goddess-like appear'd;</a>
<a id='line_4577'>To her I sued, she pitied my distress;</a>
<a id='line_4578'>Like thee in beauty, nor in virtue less.</a>
<a id='line_4579'>Who from such youth could hope considerate care?</a>
<a id='line_4580'>In youth and beauty wisdom is but rare!</a>
<a id='line_4581'>She gave me life, relieved with just supplies</a>
<a id='line_4582'>My wants, and lent these robes that strike your eyes.</a>
<a id='line_4583'>This is the truth: and oh, ye powers on high!</a>
<a id='line_4584'>Forbid that want should sink me to a lie."</a>
<a id='line_4585'></a>
<a id='line_4586'>To this the king: "Our daughter but express'd</a>
<a id='line_4587'>Her cares imperfect to our godlike guest.</a>
<a id='line_4588'>Suppliant to her, since first he chose to pray,</a>
<a id='line_4589'>Why not herself did she conduct the way,</a>
<a id='line_4590'>And with her handmaids to our court convey?"</a>
<a id='line_4591'></a>
<a id='line_4592'>"Hero and king (Ulysses thus replied)</a>
<a id='line_4593'>Nor blame her faultless nor suspect of pride:</a>
<a id='line_4594'>She bade me follow in the attendant train;</a>

<a id='line_4596'>Lest rash suspicion might alarm thy mind:</a>
<a id='line_4597'>Man's of a jealous and mistaken kind."</a>

<a id='line_4602'>And would to Phoebus, Pallas, and to Jove,</a>
<a id='line_4603'>Such as thou art, thy thought and mine were one,</a>
<a id='line_4604'>Nor thou unwilling to be called my son.</a>
<a id='line_4605'>In such alliance couldst thou wish to join,</a>
<a id='line_4606'>A palace stored with treasures should be thine.</a>
<a id='line_4607'>But if reluctant, who shall force thy stay?</a>
<a id='line_4608'>Jove bids to set the stranger on his way,</a>
<a id='line_4609'>And ships shall wait thee with the morning ray.</a>
<a id='line_4610'>Till then, let slumber cross thy careful eyes:</a>
<a id='line_4611'>The wakeful mariners shall watch the skies,</a>
<a id='line_4612'>And seize the moment when the breezes rise:</a>
<a id='line_4613'>Then gently waft thee to the pleasing shore,</a>
<a id='line_4614'>Where thy soul rests, and labour is no more.</a>
<a id='line_4615'>Far as Euboea though thy country lay,</a>
<a id='line_4616'>Our ships with ease transport thee in a day.</a>
<a id='line_4617'>Thither of old, earth's giant son to view,</a>
<a id='line_4618'>On wings of wind with Rhadamanth they flew;</a>
<a id='line_4619'>This land, from whence their morning course begun,</a>
<a id='line_4620'>Saw them returning with the setting sun.</a>
<a id='line_4621'>Your eyes shall witness and confirm my tale,</a>
<a id='line_4622'>Our youth how dexterous, and how fleet our sail,</a>
<a id='line_4623'>When justly timed with equal sweep they row,</a>
<a id='line_4624'>And ocean whitens in long tracks below."</a>
<a id='line_4625'></a>
<a id='line_4626'>Thus he. No word the experienced man replies,</a>
<a id='line_4627'>But thus to heaven (and heavenward lifts his eyes):</a>

<a id='line_4638'>And finish'd all their queen's command with haste:</a>
<a id='line_4639'>Then gave the signal to the willing guest:</a>
<a id='line_4640'>He rose with pleasure, and retired to rest.</a>
<a id='line_4641'>There, soft extended, to the murmuring sound</a>
<a id='line_4642'>Of the high porch, Ulysses sleeps profound!</a>
<a id='line_4643'>Within, released from cares, Alcinous lies;</a>
<a id='line_4644'>And fast beside were closed Arete's eyes.</a>
<a id='line_4645'></a>

<a id='line_4648'>BOOK VIII.</a>
<a id='line_4649'></a>
<a id='line_4650'>ARGUMENT.</a>
<a id='line_4651'></a>
<a id='line_4652'>Alcinous calls a council, in which it is resolved to transport</a>
<a id='line_4653'>Ulysses into his country. After which splendid entertainments are</a>
<a id='line_4654'>made, where the celebrated musician and poet, Demodocus, plays and</a>
<a id='line_4655'>sings to the guests. They next proceed to the games, the race, the</a>
<a id='line_4656'>wrestling, discus, &c., where Ulysses casts a prodigious length,</a>
<a id='line_4657'>to the admiration of all the spectators. They return again to the</a>
<a id='line_4658'>banquet and Demodocus sings the loves of Mars and Venus. Ulysses,</a>
<a id='line_4659'>after a compliment to the poet, desires him to sing the</a>
<a id='line_4660'>introduction of the wooden horse into Troy, which subject</a>
<a id='line_4661'>provoking his tears, Alcinous inquires of his guest his name,</a>
<a id='line_4662'>parentage, and fortunes.</a>
<a id='line_4663'></a>
<a id='line_4664'></a>
<a id='line_4665'></a>
<a id='line_4666'>Now fair Aurora lifts her golden ray,</a>
<a id='line_4667'>And all the ruddy orient flames with day:</a>
<a id='line_4668'>Alcinous, and the chief, with dawning light,</a>
<a id='line_4669'>Rose instant from the slumbers of the night;</a>
<a id='line_4670'>Then to the council-seat they bend their way,</a>
<a id='line_4671'>And fill the shining thrones along the bay.</a>
<a id='line_4672'></a>
<a id='line_4673'>Meanwhile Minerva, in her guardian care,</a>
<a id='line_4674'>Shoots from the starry vault through fields of air;</a>
<a id='line_4675'>In form, a herald of the king, she flies</a>
<a id='line_4676'>From peer to peer, and thus incessant cries;</a>
<a id='line_4677'></a>
<a id='line_4678'>"Nobles and chiefs who rule Phaeacia's states,</a>
<a id='line_4679'>The king in council your attendance waits;</a>
<a id='line_4680'>A prince of grace divine your aid implores,</a>
<a id='line_4681'>O'er unknown seas arrived from unknown shores."</a>
<a id='line_4682'></a>
<a id='line_4683'>She spoke, and sudden with tumultuous sounds</a>
<a id='line_4684'>Of thronging multitudes the shore rebounds:</a>
<a id='line_4685'>At once the seats they fill; and every eye</a>
<a id='line_4686'>Glazed, as before some brother of the sky.</a>
<a id='line_4687'>Pallas with grace divine his form improves,</a>
<a id='line_4688'>More high he treads, and more enlarged he moves:</a>
<a id='line_4689'>She sheds celestial bloom, regard to draw;</a>
<a id='line_4690'>And gives a dignity of mien, to awe;</a>
<a id='line_4691'>With strength, the future prize of fame to play,</a>
<a id='line_4692'>And gather all the honours of the day.</a>
<a id='line_4693'></a>
<a id='line_4694'>Then from his glittering throne Alcinous rose;</a>
<a id='line_4695'>"Attend (he cried) while we our will disclose.</a>
<a id='line_4696'>Your present aid this godlike stranger craves,</a>
<a id='line_4697'>Toss'd by rude tempest through a war of waves;</a>
<a id='line_4698'>Perhaps from realms that view the rising day,</a>
<a id='line_4699'>Or nations subject to the western ray.</a>
<a id='line_4700'>Then grant, what here all sons of wine obtain</a>
<a id='line_4701'>(For here affliction never pleads in vain);</a>
<a id='line_4702'>Be chosen youth prepared, expert to try</a>
<a id='line_4703'>The vast profound and hid the vessel fly;</a>
<a id='line_4704'>Launch the tall back, and order every oar;</a>
<a id='line_4705'>Then in our court indulge the genial hour.</a>
<a id='line_4706'>Instant, you sailors to this task attend;</a>
<a id='line_4707'>Swift to the palace, all ye peers ascend;</a>
<a id='line_4708'>Let none to strangers honours due disclaim:</a>
<a id='line_4709'>Be there Demodocus the bard of fame,</a>
<a id='line_4710'>Taught by the gods to please, when high he sings</a>
<a id='line_4711'>The vocal lay, responsive to the strings."</a>
<a id='line_4712'></a>
<a id='line_4713'>Thus spoke the prince; the attending peers obey;</a>
<a id='line_4714'>In state they move; Alcinous heads the way</a>
<a id='line_4715'>Swift to Demodocus the herald flies,</a>
<a id='line_4716'>At once the sailors to their charge arise;</a>
<a id='line_4717'>They launch the vessel, and unfurl the sails,</a>
<a id='line_4718'>And stretch the swelling canvas to the gales;</a>
<a id='line_4719'>Then to the palace move: a gathering throng,</a>
<a id='line_4720'>Youth, and white age, tumultuous pour along.</a>
<a id='line_4721'>Now all accesses to the dome are fill'd;</a>
<a id='line_4722'>Eight boars, the choicest of the herd, are kill'd;</a>
<a id='line_4723'>Two beeves, twelve fatlings, from the flock they bring</a>
<a id='line_4724'>To crown the feast; so wills the bounteous king,</a>
<a id='line_4725'>The herald now arrives, and guides along</a>
<a id='line_4726'>The sacred master of celestial song;</a>
<a id='line_4727'>Dear to the Muse!  who gave his days to flow</a>
<a id='line_4728'>With mighty blessings, mix'd with mighty woe;</a>
<a id='line_4729'>With clouds of darkness quench'd his visual ray,</a>
<a id='line_4730'>But gave him skill to raise the lofty lay.</a>
<a id='line_4731'>High on a radiant throne sublime in state,</a>
<a id='line_4732'>Encircled by huge multitudes, he sate;</a>
<a id='line_4733'>With silver shone the throne; his lyre, well strung</a>
<a id='line_4734'>To rapturous sounds, at hand Poutonous hung.</a>
<a id='line_4735'>Before his seat a polish'd table shines,</a>
<a id='line_4736'>And a full goblet foams with generous wines;</a>
<a id='line_4737'>His food a herald bore; and now they fed;</a>
<a id='line_4738'>And now the rage of craving hunger fled.</a>
<a id='line_4739'></a>
<a id='line_4740'>Then, fired by all the Muse, aloud he sings</a>
<a id='line_4741'>The mighty deeds of demigods and kings;</a>
<a id='line_4742'>From that fierce wrath the noble song arose,</a>
<a id='line_4743'>That made Ulysses and Achilles foes;</a>
<a id='line_4744'>How o'er the feast they doom the fall of Troy;</a>
<a id='line_4745'>The stern debate Atrides hears with joy;</a>
<a id='line_4746'>For Heaven foretold the contest, when he trod</a>
<a id='line_4747'>The marble threshold of the Delphic god,</a>
<a id='line_4748'>Curious to learn the counsels of the sky,</a>
<a id='line_4749'>Ere yet he loosed the rage of war on Troy.</a>
<a id='line_4750'></a>
<a id='line_4751'>Touch'd at the song, Ulysses straight resign'd</a>
<a id='line_4752'>To soft affliction all his manly mind.</a>
<a id='line_4753'>Before his eyes the purple vest he drew,</a>
<a id='line_4754'>Industrious to conceal the falling dew;</a>
<a id='line_4755'>But when the music paused, he ceased to shed</a>
<a id='line_4756'>The flowing tear, and raised his drooping head;</a>
<a id='line_4757'>And, lifting to the gods a goblet crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_4758'>He pour'd a pure libation to the ground.</a>
<a id='line_4759'></a>
<a id='line_4760'>Transported with the song, the listening train</a>
<a id='line_4761'>Again with loud applause demand the strain;</a>
<a id='line_4762'>Again Ulysses veil'd his pensive head.</a>
<a id='line_4763'>Again unmann'd, a shower of sorrows shed;</a>
<a id='line_4764'>Conceal'd he wept; the king observed alone</a>
<a id='line_4765'>The silent tear, and heard the secret groan;</a>
<a id='line_4766'>Then to the bard aloud--"O cease to sing,</a>
<a id='line_4767'>Dumb be thy voice and mute the harmonious string;</a>
<a id='line_4768'>Enough the feast has pleased, enough the power</a>
<a id='line_4769'>Of heavenly song has crown'd the genial hour!</a>
<a id='line_4770'>Incessant in the games your strength display,</a>
<a id='line_4771'>Contest, ye brave the honours of the day!</a>
<a id='line_4772'>That pleased the admiring stranger may proclaim</a>
<a id='line_4773'>In distant regions the Phaeacian fame:</a>
<a id='line_4774'>None wield the gauntlet with so dire a sway,</a>
<a id='line_4775'>Or swifter in the race devour the way;</a>
<a id='line_4776'>None in the leap spring with so strong a bound,</a>
<a id='line_4777'>Or firmer, in the wrestling, press the ground."</a>
<a id='line_4778'></a>
<a id='line_4779'>Thus spoke the king; the attending peers obey;</a>
<a id='line_4780'>In state they move, Alcinous lends the way;</a>
<a id='line_4781'>His golden lyre Demodocus unstrung,</a>
<a id='line_4782'>High on a column in the palace hung;</a>
<a id='line_4783'>And guided by a herald's guardian cares,</a>
<a id='line_4784'>Majestic to the lists of Fame repairs.</a>
<a id='line_4785'></a>
<a id='line_4786'>Now swarms the populace: a countless throng,</a>
<a id='line_4787'>Youth and boar age; and man drives man along.</a>
<a id='line_4788'>The games begin; ambitious of the prize,</a>
<a id='line_4789'>Acroneus, Thoon, and Eretmeus rise;</a>
<a id='line_4790'>The prize Ocyalus and Prymneus claim,</a>
<a id='line_4791'>Anchialus and Ponteus, chiefs of fame.</a>
<a id='line_4792'>There Proreus, Nautes, Eratreus, appear</a>
<a id='line_4793'>And famed Amphialus, Polyneus' heir;</a>
<a id='line_4794'>Euryalus, like Mars terrific, rose,</a>
<a id='line_4795'>When clad in wrath he withers hosts of foes;</a>
<a id='line_4796'>Naubolides with grace unequall'd shone,</a>
<a id='line_4797'>Or equall'd by Laodamas alone.</a>
<a id='line_4798'>With these came forth Ambasineus the strong:</a>
<a id='line_4799'>And three brave sons, from great Alcinous sprung.</a>
<a id='line_4800'></a>
<a id='line_4801'>Ranged in a line the ready racers stand,</a>
<a id='line_4802'>Start from the goal, and vanish o'er the strand:</a>
<a id='line_4803'>Swift as on wings of winds, upborne they fly,</a>
<a id='line_4804'>And drifts of rising dust involve the sky.</a>
<a id='line_4805'>Before the rest, what space the hinds allow</a>
<a id='line_4806'>Between the mule and ox, from plough to plough,</a>
<a id='line_4807'>Clytonius sprung: he wing'd the rapid way,</a>
<a id='line_4808'>And bore the unrivall'd honours of the day.</a>
<a id='line_4809'>With fierce embrace the brawny wrestlers join;</a>
<a id='line_4810'>The conquest, great Euryalus, is thine.</a>
<a id='line_4811'>Amphialus sprung forward with a bound,</a>
<a id='line_4812'>Superior in the leap, a length of ground.</a>
<a id='line_4813'>From Elatreus' strong arm the discus flies,</a>
<a id='line_4814'>And sings with unmatch'd force along the skies.</a>
<a id='line_4815'>And Laodam whirls high, with dreadful sway,</a>
<a id='line_4816'>The gloves of death, victorious in the fray.</a>
<a id='line_4817'></a>
<a id='line_4818'>While thus the peerage in the games contends,</a>
<a id='line_4819'>In act to speak, Laodamas ascends.</a>
<a id='line_4820'></a>
<a id='line_4821'>"O friends (he cries), the stranger seems well skill'd</a>
<a id='line_4822'>To try the illustrious labours of the field:</a>
<a id='line_4823'>I deem him brave: then grant the brave man's claim,</a>
<a id='line_4824'>Invite the hero to his share of fame.</a>
<a id='line_4825'>What nervous arms he boasts! how firm his tread!</a>
<a id='line_4826'>His limbs how turn'd! how broad his shoulders spread!</a>
<a id='line_4827'>By age unbroke!--but all-consuming care</a>
<a id='line_4828'>Destroys perhaps the strength that time would spare:</a>
<a id='line_4829'>Dire is the ocean, dread in all its forms!</a>
<a id='line_4830'>Man must decay when man contends with storms."</a>
<a id='line_4831'></a>
<a id='line_4832'>"Well hast thou spoke (Euryalus replies):</a>
<a id='line_4833'>Thine is the guest, invite him thou to rise."</a>
<a id='line_4834'>Swift as the word, advancing from the crowd,</a>
<a id='line_4835'>He made obeisance, and thus spoke aloud:</a>
<a id='line_4836'></a>
<a id='line_4837'>"Vouchsafes the reverend stranger to display</a>
<a id='line_4838'>His manly worth, and share the glorious day?</a>
<a id='line_4839'>Father, arise! for thee thy port proclaims</a>
<a id='line_4840'>Expert to conquer in the solemn games.</a>
<a id='line_4841'>To fame arise! for what more fame can yield</a>
<a id='line_4842'>Than the swift race, or conflict of the field?</a>
<a id='line_4843'>Steal from corroding care one transient day,</a>
<a id='line_4844'>To glory give the space thou hast to stay;</a>
<a id='line_4845'>Short is the time, and lo! e'en now the gales</a>
<a id='line_4846'>Call thee aboard, and stretch the swelling sails."</a>
<a id='line_4847'></a>
<a id='line_4848'>To whom with sighs Ulysses gave reply:</a>
<a id='line_4849'>"Ah why the ill-suiting pastime must I try?</a>
<a id='line_4850'>To gloomy care my thoughts alone are free;</a>
<a id='line_4851'>Ill the gay sorts with troubled hearts agree;</a>
<a id='line_4852'>Sad from my natal hour my days have ran,</a>
<a id='line_4853'>A much-afflicted, much-enduring man!</a>
<a id='line_4854'>Who, suppliant to the king and peers, implores</a>
<a id='line_4855'>A speedy voyage to his native shore."</a>
<a id='line_4856'>"Wise wanders, Laodam, thy erring tongue</a>
<a id='line_4857'>The sports of glory to the brave belong</a>
<a id='line_4858'>(Retorts Euryalus): he bears no claim</a>
<a id='line_4859'>Among the great, unlike the sons of Fame.</a>
<a id='line_4860'>A wandering merchant he frequents the main</a>
<a id='line_4861'>Some mean seafarer in pursuit of gain;</a>
<a id='line_4862'>Studious of freight, in naval trade well skill'd,</a>
<a id='line_4863'>But dreads the athletic labours of the field."</a>
<a id='line_4864'>Incensed, Ulysses with a frown replies:</a>
<a id='line_4865'>"O forward to proclaim thy soul unwise!</a>
<a id='line_4866'>With partial hands the gods their gifts dispense;</a>
<a id='line_4867'>Some greatly think, some speak with manly sense;</a>
<a id='line_4868'>Here Heaven an elegance of form denies,</a>
<a id='line_4869'>But wisdom the defect of form supplies;</a>
<a id='line_4870'>This man with energy of thought controls,</a>
<a id='line_4871'>And steals with modest violence our souls;</a>
<a id='line_4872'>He speaks reservedly, but he speaks with force,</a>
<a id='line_4873'>Nor can one word be changed but for a worse;</a>
<a id='line_4874'>In public more than mortal he appears,</a>
<a id='line_4875'>And as he moves, the praising crowd reveres;</a>
<a id='line_4876'>While others, beauteous as the etherial kind,</a>
<a id='line_4877'>The nobler portion went, a knowing mind,</a>
<a id='line_4878'>In outward show Heaven gives thee to excel.</a>
<a id='line_4879'>But Heaven denies the praise of thinking well</a>
<a id='line_4880'>I'll bear the brave a rude ungovern'd tongue,</a>
<a id='line_4881'>And, youth, my generous soul resents the wrong.</a>
<a id='line_4882'>Skill'd in heroic exercise, I claim</a>
<a id='line_4883'>A post of honour with the sons of Fame.</a>
<a id='line_4884'>Such was my boast while vigour crown'd my days,</a>
<a id='line_4885'>Now care surrounds me, and my force decays;</a>
<a id='line_4886'>Inured a melancholy part to bear</a>
<a id='line_4887'>In scenes of death, by tempest and by war</a>
<a id='line_4888'>Yet thus by woes impair'd, no more I waive</a>
<a id='line_4889'>To prove the hero--slander stings the brave."</a>
<a id='line_4890'></a>
<a id='line_4891'>Then gliding forward with a furious bound</a>
<a id='line_4892'>He wrench'd a rocky fragment from the ground</a>
<a id='line_4893'>By far more ponderous, and more huge by far</a>
<a id='line_4894'>Than what Phaeacia's sons discharged in air.</a>
<a id='line_4895'>Fierce from his arm the enormous load he flings;</a>
<a id='line_4896'>Sonorous through the shaded air it sings;</a>
<a id='line_4897'>Couch'd to the earth, tempestuous as it flies,</a>
<a id='line_4898'>The crowd gaze upward while it cleaves the skies.</a>
<a id='line_4899'>Beyond all marks, with many a giddy round</a>
<a id='line_4900'>Down-rushing, it up-turns a hill of ground.</a>
<a id='line_4901'></a>
<a id='line_4902'>That Instant Pallas, bursting from a cloud,</a>
<a id='line_4903'>Fix'd a distinguish'd mark, and cried aloud:</a>
<a id='line_4904'></a>
<a id='line_4905'>"E'en he who, sightless, wants his visual ray</a>
<a id='line_4906'>May by his touch alone award the day:</a>
<a id='line_4907'>Thy signal throw transcends the utmost bound</a>
<a id='line_4908'>Of every champion by a length of ground:</a>
<a id='line_4909'>Securely bid the strongest of the train</a>
<a id='line_4910'>Arise to throw; the strongest throws in vain."</a>
<a id='line_4911'></a>
<a id='line_4912'>She spoke: and momentary mounts the sky:</a>
<a id='line_4913'>The friendly voice Ulysses hears with joy.</a>
<a id='line_4914'>Then thus aloud (elate with decent pride)</a>
<a id='line_4915'>"Rise, ye Phaecians, try your force (he cried):</a>
<a id='line_4916'>If with this throw the strongest caster vie,</a>
<a id='line_4917'>Still, further still, I bid the discus fly.</a>
<a id='line_4918'>Stand forth, ye champions, who the gauntlet wield,</a>
<a id='line_4919'>Or ye, the swiftest racers of the field!</a>
<a id='line_4920'>Stand forth, ye wrestlers, who these pastimes grace!</a>
<a id='line_4921'>I wield the gauntlet, and I run the race.</a>
<a id='line_4922'>In such heroic games I yield to none,</a>
<a id='line_4923'>Or yield to brave Laodamas alone:</a>

<a id='line_4929'>Base to his friend, to his own interest blind:</a>
<a id='line_4930'>All, all your heroes I this day defy;</a>
<a id='line_4931'>Give me a man that we our might may try.</a>

<a id='line_4934'>Should a whole host at once discharge the bow,</a>
<a id='line_4935'>My well-aim'd shaft with death prevents the foe:</a>
<a id='line_4936'>Alone superior in the field of Troy,</a>
<a id='line_4937'>Great Philoctetes taught the shaft to fly.</a>
<a id='line_4938'>From all the sons of earth unrivall'd praise</a>
<a id='line_4939'>I justly claim; but yield to better days,</a>

<a id='line_4946'>In fighting fields as far the spear I throw</a>

<a id='line_4952'></a>
<a id='line_4953'>Abash'd, the numbers hear the godlike man,</a>

<a id='line_4989'>The herald bears the lyre: intent to play,</a>
<a id='line_4990'>The bard advancing meditates the lay.</a>
<a id='line_4991'>Skill'd in the dance, tall youths, a blooming band,</a>
<a id='line_4992'>Graceful before the heavenly minstrel stand:</a>
<a id='line_4993'>Light bounding from the earth, at once they rise,</a>
<a id='line_4994'>Their feet half-viewless quiver in the skies:</a>
<a id='line_4995'>Ulysses gazed, astonish'd to survey</a>
<a id='line_4996'>The glancing splendours as their sandals play.</a>
<a id='line_4997'>Meantime the bard, alternate to the strings,</a>
<a id='line_4998'>The loves of Mars and Cytherea sings:</a>
<a id='line_4999'>How the stern god, enamour'd with her charms</a>
<a id='line_5000'>Clasp'd the gay panting goddess in his arms,</a>
<a id='line_5001'>By bribes seduced; and how the sun, whose eye</a>
<a id='line_5002'>Views the broad heavens, disclosed the lawless joy.</a>
<a id='line_5003'>Stung to the soul, indignant through the skies</a>
<a id='line_5004'>To his black forge vindictive Vulcan flies:</a>
<a id='line_5005'>Arrived, his sinewy arms incessant place</a>
<a id='line_5006'>The eternal anvil on the massy base.</a>
<a id='line_5007'>A wondrous net he labours, to betray</a>
<a id='line_5008'>The wanton lovers, as entwined they lay,</a>
<a id='line_5009'>Indissolubly strong; Then instant bears</a>
<a id='line_5010'>To his immortal dome the finish'd snares:</a>
<a id='line_5011'>Above, below, around, with art dispread,</a>
<a id='line_5012'>The sure inclosure folds the genial bed:</a>
<a id='line_5013'>Whose texture even the search of gods deceives,</a>
<a id='line_5014'>Thin as the filmy threads the spider weaves,</a>
<a id='line_5015'>Then, as withdrawing from the starry bowers,</a>
<a id='line_5016'>He feigns a journey to the Lemnian shores,</a>
<a id='line_5017'>His favourite isle: observant Mars descries</a>
<a id='line_5018'>His wish'd recees, and to the goddess flies;</a>
<a id='line_5019'>He glows, he burns, the fair-hair'd queen of love</a>
<a id='line_5020'>Descends, smooth gliding from the courts of Jove,</a>
<a id='line_5021'>Gay blooming in full charms: her hand he press'd</a>
<a id='line_5022'>With eager joy, and with a sigh address'd:</a>
<a id='line_5023'></a>
<a id='line_5024'>"Come, my beloved! and taste the soft delights:</a>
<a id='line_5025'>Come, to repose the genial bed invites:</a>

<a id='line_5028'></a>
<a id='line_5029'>Then, nothing loth, the enamour'd fair he led,</a>
<a id='line_5030'>And sunk transported on the conscious bed.</a>
<a id='line_5031'>Down rush'd the toils, inwrapping as they lay</a>
<a id='line_5032'>The careless lovers in their wanton play:</a>
<a id='line_5033'>In vain they strive; the entangling snares deny</a>
<a id='line_5034'>(Inextricably firm) the power to fly.</a>
<a id='line_5035'>Warn'd by the god who sheds the golden day,</a>
<a id='line_5036'>Stern Vulcan homeward treads the starry way:</a>
<a id='line_5037'>Arrived, he sees, he grieves, with rage he burns:</a>
<a id='line_5038'>Full horribly he roars, his voice all heaven returns.</a>
<a id='line_5039'></a>
<a id='line_5040'>"O Jove (he cried) O all ye powers above,</a>
<a id='line_5041'>See the lewd dalliance of the queen of love!</a>
<a id='line_5042'>Me, awkward me, she scorns; and yields her charms</a>
<a id='line_5043'>To that fair lecher, the strong god of arms.</a>
<a id='line_5044'>If I am lame, that stain my natal hour</a>
<a id='line_5045'>By fate imposed; such me my parent bore.</a>
<a id='line_5046'>Why was I born? See how the wanton lies!</a>
<a id='line_5047'>Oh sight tormenting to a husband's eyes!</a>
<a id='line_5048'>But yet, I trust, this once e'en Mars would fly</a>
<a id='line_5049'>His fair-one's arms--he thinks her, once, too nigh.</a>
<a id='line_5050'>But there remain, ye guilty, in my power,</a>
<a id='line_5051'>Till Jove refunds his shameless daughter's dower.</a>
<a id='line_5052'>Too dear I prized a fair enchanting face:</a>
<a id='line_5053'>Beauty unchaste is beauty in disgrace."</a>
<a id='line_5054'></a>
<a id='line_5055'>Meanwhile the gods the dome of Vulcan throng;</a>
<a id='line_5056'>Apollo comes, and Neptune comes along;</a>
<a id='line_5057'>With these gay Hermes trod the starry plain;</a>
<a id='line_5058'>But modesty withheld the goddess train.</a>
<a id='line_5059'>All heaven beholds, imprison'd as they lie,</a>
<a id='line_5060'>And unextinguish'd laughter shakes the sky.</a>
<a id='line_5061'>Then mutual, thus they spoke: "Behold on wrong</a>
<a id='line_5062'>Swift vengeance waits; and art subdues the strong!</a>
<a id='line_5063'>Dwells there a god on all the Olympian brow</a>
<a id='line_5064'>More swift than Mars, and more than Vulcan slow?</a>
<a id='line_5065'>Yet Vulcan conquers, and the god of arms</a>
<a id='line_5066'>Must pay the penalty for lawless charms."</a>
<a id='line_5067'></a>
<a id='line_5068'>Thus serious they; but he who gilds the skies,</a>
<a id='line_5069'>The gay Apollo, thus to Hermes cries:</a>
<a id='line_5070'>"Wouldst thou enchain'd like Mars, O Hermes, lie</a>
<a id='line_5071'>And bear the shame like Mars to share the joy?"</a>
<a id='line_5072'></a>
<a id='line_5073'>"O envied shame! (the smiling youth rejoin'd;)</a>
<a id='line_5074'>And thrice the chains, and thrice more firmly bind;</a>
<a id='line_5075'>Gaze all ye gods, and every goddess gaze,</a>
<a id='line_5076'>Yet eager would I bless the sweet disgrace."</a>
<a id='line_5077'></a>
<a id='line_5078'>Loud laugh the rest, e'en Neptune laughs aloud,</a>
<a id='line_5079'>Yet sues importunate to loose the god.</a>
<a id='line_5080'>"And free, (he cries) O Vulcan! free from shame</a>
<a id='line_5081'>Thy captives; I ensure the penal claim."</a>
<a id='line_5082'></a>
<a id='line_5083'>"Will Neptune (Vulcan then) the faithless trust?</a>
<a id='line_5084'>He suffers who gives surety for the unjust:</a>
<a id='line_5085'>But say, if that lewd scandal of the sky,</a>
<a id='line_5086'>To liberty restored, perfidious fly:</a>
<a id='line_5087'>Say, wilt thou bear the mulct?" He instant cries,</a>
<a id='line_5088'>"The mulct I bear, if Mars perfidious flies."</a>
<a id='line_5089'></a>
<a id='line_5090'>To whom appeased: "No more I urge delay;</a>
<a id='line_5091'>When Neptune sues, my part is to obey."</a>
<a id='line_5092'>Then to the snares his force the god applies;</a>
<a id='line_5093'>They burst; and Mars to Thrace indignant flies:</a>
<a id='line_5094'>To the soft Cyprian shores the goddess moves,</a>
<a id='line_5095'>To visit Paphos and her blooming groves,</a>
<a id='line_5096'>Where to the Power an hundred altars rise,</a>
<a id='line_5097'>And breathing odours scent the balmy skies;</a>
<a id='line_5098'>Concealed she bathes in consecrated bowers,</a>
<a id='line_5099'>The Graces unguents shed, ambrosial showers,</a>
<a id='line_5100'>Unguents that charm the gods! she last assumes</a>
<a id='line_5101'>Her wondrous robes; and full the goddess blooms.</a>
<a id='line_5102'></a>
<a id='line_5103'>Thus sung the bard: Ulysses hears with joy,</a>
<a id='line_5104'>And loud applauses read the vaulted sky.</a>
<a id='line_5105'></a>
<a id='line_5106'>Then to the sports his sons the king commands,</a>
<a id='line_5107'>Each blooming youth before the monarch stands,</a>
<a id='line_5108'>In dance unmatch'd! A wondrous ball is brought</a>
<a id='line_5109'>(The work of Polypus, divinely wrought);</a>
<a id='line_5110'>This youth with strength enormous bids it fly,</a>
<a id='line_5111'>And bending backward whirls it to the sky;</a>
<a id='line_5112'>His brother, springing with an active bound,</a>
<a id='line_5113'>At distance intercepts it from the ground.</a>
<a id='line_5114'>The ball dismissed, in dance they skim the strand,</a>
<a id='line_5115'>Turn and return, and scarce imprint the sand.</a>
<a id='line_5116'>The assembly gazes with astonished eyes,</a>
<a id='line_5117'>And sends in shouts applauses to the skies.</a>
<a id='line_5118'></a>
<a id='line_5119'>Then thus Ulysses: "Happy king, whose name</a>
<a id='line_5120'>The brightest shines in all the rolls of fame!</a>
<a id='line_5121'>In subjects happy with surprise I gaze;</a>
<a id='line_5122'>Thy praise was just; their skill transcends thy praise."</a>
<a id='line_5123'></a>
<a id='line_5124'>Pleas'd with his people's fame, the monarch hears,</a>
<a id='line_5125'>And thus benevolent accosts the peers:</a>
<a id='line_5126'>"Since wisdom's sacred guidance he pursues,</a>
<a id='line_5127'>Give to the stranger-guest a stranger's dues:</a>
<a id='line_5128'>Twelve princes in our realm dominion share,</a>
<a id='line_5129'>O'er whom supreme, imperial power I bear;</a>
<a id='line_5130'>Bring gold, a pledge of love: a talent bring,</a>
<a id='line_5131'>A vest, a robe, and imitate your king.</a>
<a id='line_5132'>Be swift to give: that he this night may share</a>
<a id='line_5133'>The social feast of joy, with joy sincere.</a>
<a id='line_5134'>And thou, Euryalus, redeem thy wrong;</a>
<a id='line_5135'>A generous heart repairs a slanderous tongue."</a>
<a id='line_5136'></a>
<a id='line_5137'>The assenting peers, obedient to the king,</a>
<a id='line_5138'>In haste their heralds send the gifts to bring.</a>
<a id='line_5139'>Then thus Euryalus: "O prince, whose sway</a>
<a id='line_5140'>Rules this bless'd realm, repentant I obey;</a>
<a id='line_5141'>Be his this sword, whose blade of brass displays</a>
<a id='line_5142'>A ruddy gleam; whose hilt a silver blaze;</a>
<a id='line_5143'>Whose ivory sheath, inwrought with curious pride,</a>
<a id='line_5144'>Adds graceful terror to the wearer's side."</a>
<a id='line_5145'></a>
<a id='line_5146'>He said, and to his hand the sword consign'd:</a>
<a id='line_5147'>"And if (he cried) my words affect thy mind,</a>
<a id='line_5148'>Far from thy mind those words, ye whirlwinds, bear,</a>
<a id='line_5149'>And scatter them, ye storms, in empty air!</a>
<a id='line_5150'>Crown, O ye heavens, with joy his peaceful hours,</a>
<a id='line_5151'>And grant him to his spouse, and native shores."</a>
<a id='line_5152'></a>
<a id='line_5153'>"And blest be thou, my friend, (Ulysses cries,)</a>
<a id='line_5154'>Crown him with every joy, ye favouring skies</a>
<a id='line_5155'>To thy calm hours continued peace afford,</a>
<a id='line_5156'>And never, never mayst thou want this sword,"</a>
<a id='line_5157'></a>
<a id='line_5158'>He said, and o'er his shoulder flung the blade.</a>
<a id='line_5159'>Now o'er the earth ascends the evening shade:</a>
<a id='line_5160'>The precious gifts the illustrious heralds bear,</a>
<a id='line_5161'>And to the court the embodied peers repair.</a>
<a id='line_5162'>Before the queen Alcinous' sons unfold</a>
<a id='line_5163'>The vests, the robes, and heaps of shining gold;</a>
<a id='line_5164'>Then to the radiant thrones they move in state:</a>
<a id='line_5165'>Aloft, the king in pomp imperial sate.</a>
<a id='line_5166'></a>
<a id='line_5167'>Thence to the queen: "O partner of our reign,</a>
<a id='line_5168'>O sole beloved! command thy menial train</a>
<a id='line_5169'>A polish'd chest and stately robes to bear,</a>
<a id='line_5170'>And healing waters for the bath prepare;</a>
<a id='line_5171'>That, bathed, our guest may bid his sorrows cease,</a>
<a id='line_5172'>Hear the sweet song, and taste the feast in peace.</a>
<a id='line_5173'>A bowl that flames with gold, of wondrous frame,</a>
<a id='line_5174'>Ourself we give, memorial of our name;</a>
<a id='line_5175'>To raise in offerings to almighty Jove,</a>
<a id='line_5176'>And every god that treads the courts above."</a>
<a id='line_5177'></a>
<a id='line_5178'>Instant the queen, observant of the king,</a>
<a id='line_5179'>Commands her train a spacious vase to bring,</a>
<a id='line_5180'>The spacious vase with ample streams suffice,</a>
<a id='line_5181'>Heap the high wood, and bid the flames arise.</a>
<a id='line_5182'>The flames climb round it with a fierce embrace,</a>
<a id='line_5183'>The fuming waters bubble o'er the blaze.</a>
<a id='line_5184'>Herself the chest prepares; in order roll'd</a>
<a id='line_5185'>The robes, the vests are ranged, and heaps of gold</a>
<a id='line_5186'>And adding a rich dress inwrought with art,</a>
<a id='line_5187'>A gift expressive of her bounteous heart.</a>
<a id='line_5188'>Thus spoke to Ithacus: "To guard with bands</a>
<a id='line_5189'>Insolvable these gifts, thy care demands;</a>
<a id='line_5190'>Lest, in thy slumbers on the watery main,</a>
<a id='line_5191'>The hand of rapine make our bounty vain."</a>
<a id='line_5192'></a>
<a id='line_5193'>Then bending with full force around he roll'd</a>
<a id='line_5194'>A labyrinth of bands in fold on fold,</a>
<a id='line_5195'>Closed with Circaean art. A train attends</a>
<a id='line_5196'>Around the bath: the bath the king ascends</a>
<a id='line_5197'>(Untasted joy, since that disastrous hour,</a>
<a id='line_5198'>He sail'd ill-fated from Calypso's bower);</a>
<a id='line_5199'>Where, happy as the gods that range the sky,</a>
<a id='line_5200'>He feasted every sense with every joy.</a>
<a id='line_5201'>He bathes; the damsels with officious toil,</a>
<a id='line_5202'>Shed sweets, shed unguents, in a shower of oil;</a>
<a id='line_5203'>Then o'er his limbs a gorgeous robe he spreads,</a>
<a id='line_5204'>And to the feast magnificently treads.</a>
<a id='line_5205'>Full where the dome its shining valves expands,</a>
<a id='line_5206'>Nausicaa blooming as a goddess stands;</a>
<a id='line_5207'>With wondering eyes the hero she survey'd,</a>
<a id='line_5208'>And graceful thus began the royal maid:</a>
<a id='line_5209'></a>
<a id='line_5210'>"Hail, godlike stranger! and when heaven restores</a>
<a id='line_5211'>To thy fond wish thy long-expected shores,</a>
<a id='line_5212'>This ever grateful in remembrance bear:</a>
<a id='line_5213'>To me thou owest, to me, the vital air."</a>
<a id='line_5214'></a>
<a id='line_5215'>"O royal maid! (Ulysses straight returns)</a>
<a id='line_5216'>Whose worth the splendours of thy race adorns,</a>
<a id='line_5217'>So may dread Jove (whose arm in vengeance forms</a>
<a id='line_5218'>The writhen bolt, and blackens heaven with storms),</a>
<a id='line_5219'>Restore me safe, through weary wanderings toss'd,</a>
<a id='line_5220'>To my dear country's ever-pleasing coast,</a>
<a id='line_5221'>As while the spirit in this bosom glows,</a>
<a id='line_5222'>To thee, my goddess, I address my vows;</a>
<a id='line_5223'>My life, thy gift I boast!" He said, and sate</a>
<a id='line_5224'>Fast by Alcinous on a throne of state.</a>
<a id='line_5225'></a>
<a id='line_5226'>Now each partakes the feast, the wine prepares,</a>
<a id='line_5227'>Portions the food, and each his portion shares.</a>
<a id='line_5228'>The bard a herald guides; the gazing throng</a>
<a id='line_5229'>Pay low obeisance as he moves along:</a>
<a id='line_5230'>Beneath a sculptur'd arch he sits enthroned,</a>
<a id='line_5231'>The peers encircling form an awful round.</a>
<a id='line_5232'>Then, from the chine, Ulysses carves with art</a>
<a id='line_5233'>Delicious food, an honorary part:</a>
<a id='line_5234'>"This, let the master of the lyre receive,</a>
<a id='line_5235'>A pledge of love! 'tis all a wretch can give.</a>
<a id='line_5236'>Lives there a man beneath the spacious skies</a>
<a id='line_5237'>Who sacred honours to the bard denies?</a>
<a id='line_5238'>The Muse the bard inspires, exalts his mind;</a>
<a id='line_5239'>The muse indulgent loves the harmonious kind."</a>
<a id='line_5240'></a>
<a id='line_5241'>The herald to his hand the charge conveys,</a>
<a id='line_5242'>Not fond of flattery, nor unpleased with praise.</a>
<a id='line_5243'></a>
<a id='line_5244'>When now the rage of hunger was allay'd,</a>
<a id='line_5245'>Thus to the lyrist wise Ulysses said:</a>
<a id='line_5246'>"O more than man! thy soul the muse inspires,</a>
<a id='line_5247'>Or Phoebus animates with all his fires;</a>
<a id='line_5248'>For who, by Phoebus uninform'd, could know</a>
<a id='line_5249'>The woe of Greece, and sing so well the woe?</a>
<a id='line_5250'>Just to the tale, as present at the fray,</a>
<a id='line_5251'>Or taught the labours of the dreadful day:</a>
<a id='line_5252'>The song recalls past horrors to my eyes,</a>
<a id='line_5253'>And bids proud Ilion from her ashes rise.</a>
<a id='line_5254'>Once more harmonious strike the sounding string,</a>
<a id='line_5255'>The Epaean fabric, framed by Pallas, sing:</a>
<a id='line_5256'>How stern Ulysses, furious to destroy,</a>
<a id='line_5257'>With latent heroes sack'd imperial Troy.</a>
<a id='line_5258'>If faithful thou record the tale of Fame,</a>
<a id='line_5259'>The god himself inspires thy breast with flame</a>
<a id='line_5260'>And mine shall be the task henceforth to raise</a>
<a id='line_5261'>In every land thy monument of praise."</a>
<a id='line_5262'></a>
<a id='line_5263'>Full of the god he raised his lofty strain:</a>
<a id='line_5264'>How the Greeks rush'd tumultuous to the main;</a>
<a id='line_5265'>How blazing tents illumined half the skies,</a>
<a id='line_5266'>While from the shores the winged navy flies;</a>
<a id='line_5267'>How e'en in Ilion's walls, in deathful bands,</a>
<a id='line_5268'>Came the stern Greeks by Troy's assisting hands:</a>
<a id='line_5269'>All Troy up-heaved the steed; of differing mind,</a>
<a id='line_5270'>Various the Trojans counsell'd: part consign'd</a>
<a id='line_5271'>The monster to the sword, part sentence gave</a>
<a id='line_5272'>To plunge it headlong in the whelming wave;</a>
<a id='line_5273'>The unwise award to lodge it in the towers,</a>
<a id='line_5274'>An offering sacred to the immortal powers:</a>
<a id='line_5275'>The unwise prevail, they lodge it in the walls,</a>
<a id='line_5276'>And by the gods' decree proud Ilion falls:</a>
<a id='line_5277'>Destruction enters in the treacherous wood,</a>
<a id='line_5278'>And vengeful slaughter, fierce for human blood.</a>
<a id='line_5279'></a>
<a id='line_5280'>He sung the Greeks stern-issuing from the steed,</a>
<a id='line_5281'>How Ilion burns, how all her fathers bleed;</a>
<a id='line_5282'>How to thy dome, Deiphobus! ascends</a>
<a id='line_5283'>The Spartan king; how Ithacus attends</a>
<a id='line_5284'>(Horrid as Mars); and how with dire alarms</a>
<a id='line_5285'>He fights--subdues, for Pallas strings his arms</a>
<a id='line_5286'></a>
<a id='line_5287'>Thus while he sung, Ulysses' griefs renew,</a>
<a id='line_5288'>Tears bathe his cheeks, and tears the ground bedew</a>
<a id='line_5289'>As some fond matron views in mortal fight</a>
<a id='line_5290'>Her husband falling in his country's right;</a>
<a id='line_5291'>Frantic through clashing swords she runs, she flies,</a>
<a id='line_5292'>As ghastly pale he groans, and faints and dies;</a>
<a id='line_5293'>Close to his breast she grovels on the ground,</a>
<a id='line_5294'>And bathes with floods of tears the gaping wound;</a>
<a id='line_5295'>She cries, she shrieks: the fierce insulting foe</a>
<a id='line_5296'>Relentless mocks her violence of woe:</a>
<a id='line_5297'>To chains condemn'd, as wildly she deplores;</a>
<a id='line_5298'>A widow, and a slave on foreign shores.</a>
<a id='line_5299'></a>
<a id='line_5300'>So from the sluices of Ulysses' eyes</a>
<a id='line_5301'>Fast fell the tears, and sighs succeeded sighs:</a>
<a id='line_5302'>Conceal'd he grieved: the king observed alone</a>
<a id='line_5303'>The silent tear, and heard the secret groan;</a>
<a id='line_5304'>Then to the bard aloud: "O cease to sing,</a>
<a id='line_5305'>Dumb be thy voice, and mute the tuneful string;</a>
<a id='line_5306'>To every note his tears responsive flow,</a>
<a id='line_5307'>And his great heart heaves with tumultuous woe;</a>
<a id='line_5308'>Thy lay too deeply moves: then cease the lay,</a>

<a id='line_5338'>A dreadful story, big with future woes;</a>
<a id='line_5339'>How Neptune raged, and how, by his command,</a>

<a id='line_5362'>THE ADVENTURES OF THE CICONS, LOTOPHAGI AND CYCLOPS</a>
<a id='line_5363'></a>
<a id='line_5364'>Ulysses begins the relation of his adventures: how, after the</a>
<a id='line_5365'>destruction of Troy, he with his companions made an incursion on</a>
<a id='line_5366'>the Cicons, by whom they were repulsed; and, meeting with a storm,</a>
<a id='line_5367'>were driven to the coast of the Lotophagi. From there they sailed</a>
<a id='line_5368'>to the land of the Cyclops, whose manners and situation are</a>
<a id='line_5369'>particularly characterised. The giant Polyphemus and his cave</a>
<a id='line_5370'>described; the usage Ulysses and his companions met with there;</a>
<a id='line_5371'>and, lastly, the method and artifice by which he escaped.</a>
<a id='line_5372'></a>
<a id='line_5373'></a>
<a id='line_5374'></a>
<a id='line_5375'>Then thus Ulysses: "Thou whom first in sway,</a>
<a id='line_5376'>As first in virtue, these thy realms obey;</a>
<a id='line_5377'>How sweet the products of a peaceful reign!</a>
<a id='line_5378'>The heaven-taught poet and enchanting strain;</a>
<a id='line_5379'>The well-filled palace, the perpetual feast,</a>
<a id='line_5380'>A land rejoicing, and a people bless'd!</a>
<a id='line_5381'>How goodly seems it ever to employ</a>
<a id='line_5382'>Man's social days in union and in joy;</a>
<a id='line_5383'>The plenteous hoard high-heap'd with cates divine,</a>
<a id='line_5384'>And o'er the foaming bowl the laughing wine!</a>
<a id='line_5385'></a>
<a id='line_5386'>"Amid these joys, why seels thy mind to know</a>
<a id='line_5387'>The unhappy series of a wanderer's woe?</a>
<a id='line_5388'>Rememberance sad, whose image to review,</a>
<a id='line_5389'>Alas, I must open all my wounds anew!</a>
<a id='line_5390'>And oh, what first, what last shall I relate,</a>
<a id='line_5391'>Of woes unnumbered sent by Heaven and Fate?</a>
<a id='line_5392'></a>
<a id='line_5393'>"Know first the man (though now a wretch distress'd)</a>

<a id='line_5395'>Behold Ulysses! no ignoble name,</a>
<a id='line_5396'>Earth sounds my wisdom and high heaven my fame.</a>

<a id='line_5401'>With shady mountains spread their isles around.</a>
<a id='line_5402'>(These to the north and night's dark regions run,</a>
<a id='line_5403'>Those to Aurora and the rising sun).</a>
<a id='line_5404'>Low lies our isle, yet bless'd in fruitful stores;</a>
<a id='line_5405'>Strong are her sons, though rocky are her shores;</a>
<a id='line_5406'>And none, ah none no lovely to my sight,</a>
<a id='line_5407'>Of all the lands that heaven o'erspreads with light.</a>
<a id='line_5408'>In vain Calypso long constrained my stay,</a>
<a id='line_5409'>With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay;</a>
<a id='line_5410'>With all her charms as vainly Circe strove,</a>
<a id='line_5411'>And added magic to secure my love.</a>
<a id='line_5412'>In pomps or joys, the palace or the grot,</a>
<a id='line_5413'>My country's image never was forgot;</a>
<a id='line_5414'>My absent parents rose before my sight,</a>
<a id='line_5415'>And distant lay contentment and delight.</a>
<a id='line_5416'></a>
<a id='line_5417'>"Hear, then, the woes which mighty Jove ordain'd</a>
<a id='line_5418'>To wait my passage from the Trojan land.</a>
<a id='line_5419'>The winds from Ilion to the Cicons' shore,</a>
<a id='line_5420'>Beneath cold Ismarus our vessels bore.</a>
<a id='line_5421'>We boldly landed on the hostile place,</a>
<a id='line_5422'>And sack'd the city, and destroy'd the race,</a>
<a id='line_5423'>Their wives made captive, their possessions shared,</a>
<a id='line_5424'>And every soldier found a like reward</a>
<a id='line_5425'>I then advised to fly; not so the rest,</a>
<a id='line_5426'>Who stay'd to revel, and prolong the feast:</a>
<a id='line_5427'>The fatted sheep and sable bulls they slay,</a>
<a id='line_5428'>And bowls flow round, and riot wastes the day.</a>
<a id='line_5429'>Meantime the Cicons, to their holds retired,</a>
<a id='line_5430'>Call on the Cicons, with new fury fired;</a>
<a id='line_5431'>With early morn the gather'd country swarms,</a>
<a id='line_5432'>And all the continent is bright with arms;</a>
<a id='line_5433'>Thick as the budding leaves or rising flowers</a>
<a id='line_5434'>O'erspread the land, when spring descends in showers:</a>
<a id='line_5435'>All expert soldiers, skill'd on foot to dare,</a>
<a id='line_5436'>Or from the bounding courser urge the war.</a>
<a id='line_5437'>Now fortune changes (so the Fates ordain);</a>
<a id='line_5438'>Our hour was come to taste our share of pain.</a>
<a id='line_5439'>Close at the ships the bloody fight began,</a>
<a id='line_5440'>Wounded they wound, and man expires on man.</a>
<a id='line_5441'>Long as the morning sun increasing bright</a>
<a id='line_5442'>O'er heaven's pure azure spreads the glowing light,</a>
<a id='line_5443'>Promiscuous death the form of war confounds,</a>
<a id='line_5444'>Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds;</a>
<a id='line_5445'>But when his evening wheels o'erhung the main,</a>
<a id='line_5446'>Then conquest crown'd the fierce Ciconian train.</a>
<a id='line_5447'>Six brave companions from each ship we lost,</a>
<a id='line_5448'>The rest escape in haste, and quit the coast,</a>
<a id='line_5449'>With sails outspread we fly the unequal strife,</a>
<a id='line_5450'>Sad for their loss, but joyful of our life.</a>
<a id='line_5451'>Yet as we fled, our fellows' rites we paid,</a>
<a id='line_5452'>And thrice we call'd on each unhappy shade,</a>
<a id='line_5453'></a>
<a id='line_5454'>"Meanwhile the god, whose hand the thunder forms,</a>
<a id='line_5455'>Drives clouds on clouds, and blackens heaven with storms:</a>
<a id='line_5456'>Wide o'er the waste the rage of Boreas sweeps,</a>
<a id='line_5457'>And night rush'd headlong on the shaded deeps.</a>
<a id='line_5458'>Now here, now there, the giddy ships are borne,</a>
<a id='line_5459'>And all the rattling shrouds in fragments torn.</a>
<a id='line_5460'>We furl'd the sail, we plied the labouring oar,</a>
<a id='line_5461'>Took down our masts, and row'd our ships to shore.</a>
<a id='line_5462'>Two tedious days and two long nights we lay,</a>
<a id='line_5463'>O'erwatch'd and batter'd in the naked bay.</a>
<a id='line_5464'>But the third morning when Aurora brings,</a>
<a id='line_5465'>We rear the masts, we spread the canvas wings;</a>
<a id='line_5466'>Refresh'd and careless on the deck reclined,</a>
<a id='line_5467'>We sit, and trust the pilot and the wind.</a>
<a id='line_5468'>Then to my native country had I sail'd:</a>
<a id='line_5469'>But, the cape doubled, adverse winds prevail'd.</a>
<a id='line_5470'>Strong was the tide, which by the northern blast</a>
<a id='line_5471'>Impell'd, our vessels on Cythera cast,</a>
<a id='line_5472'>Nine days our fleet the uncertain tempest bore</a>
<a id='line_5473'>Far in wide ocean, and from sight of shore:</a>
<a id='line_5474'>The tenth we touch'd, by various errors toss'd,</a>
<a id='line_5475'>The land of Lotus and the flowery coast.</a>
<a id='line_5476'>We climb'd the beach, and springs of water found,</a>
<a id='line_5477'>Then spread our hasty banquet on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_5478'>Three men were sent, deputed from the crew</a>
<a id='line_5479'>(A herald one) the dubious coast to view,</a>
<a id='line_5480'>And learn what habitants possess'd the place.</a>
<a id='line_5481'>They went, and found a hospitable race:</a>
<a id='line_5482'>Not prone to ill, nor strange to foreign guest,</a>
<a id='line_5483'>They eat, they drink, and nature gives the feast</a>
<a id='line_5484'>The trees around them all their food produce:</a>
<a id='line_5485'>Lotus the name: divine, nectareous juice!</a>
<a id='line_5486'>(Thence call'd Lo'ophagi); which whose tastes,</a>
<a id='line_5487'>Insatiate riots in the sweet repasts,</a>
<a id='line_5488'>Nor other home, nor other care intends,</a>
<a id='line_5489'>But quits his house, his country, and his friends.</a>
<a id='line_5490'>The three we sent, from off the enchanting ground</a>
<a id='line_5491'>We dragg'd reluctant, and by force we bound.</a>
<a id='line_5492'>The rest in haste forsook the pleasing shore,</a>
<a id='line_5493'>Or, the charm tasted, had return'd no more.</a>
<a id='line_5494'>Now placed in order on their banks, they sweep</a>
<a id='line_5495'>The sea's smooth face, and cleave the hoary deep:</a>
<a id='line_5496'>With heavy hearts we labour through the tide,</a>
<a id='line_5497'>To coasts unknown, and oceans yet untried.</a>
<a id='line_5498'></a>
<a id='line_5499'>"The land of Cyclops first, a savage kind,</a>
<a id='line_5500'>Nor tamed by manners, nor by laws confined:</a>
<a id='line_5501'>Untaught to plant, to turn the glebe, and sow,</a>
<a id='line_5502'>They all their products to free nature owe:</a>
<a id='line_5503'>The soil, untill'd, a ready harvest yields,</a>
<a id='line_5504'>With wheat and barley wave the golden fields;</a>
<a id='line_5505'>Spontaneous wines from weighty clusters pour,</a>
<a id='line_5506'>And Jove descends in each prolific shower,</a>
<a id='line_5507'>By these no statues and no rights are known,</a>
<a id='line_5508'>No council held, no monarch fills the throne;</a>
<a id='line_5509'>But high on hills, or airy cliffs, they dwell,</a>
<a id='line_5510'>Or deep in caves whose entrance leads to hell.</a>
<a id='line_5511'>Each rules his race, his neighbour not his care,</a>
<a id='line_5512'>Heedless of others, to his own severe.</a>
<a id='line_5513'></a>
<a id='line_5514'>"Opposed to the Cyclopean coast, there lay</a>
<a id='line_5515'>An isle, whose hill their subject fields survey;</a>
<a id='line_5516'>Its name Lachaea, crown'd with many a grove,</a>
<a id='line_5517'>Where savage goats through pathless thickets rove:</a>
<a id='line_5518'>No needy mortals here, with hunger bold,</a>
<a id='line_5519'>Or wretched hunters through the wintry cold</a>
<a id='line_5520'>Pursue their flight; but leave them safe to bound</a>
<a id='line_5521'>From hill to hill, o'er all the desert ground.</a>
<a id='line_5522'>Nor knows the soil to feed the fleecy care,</a>
<a id='line_5523'>Or feels the labours of the crooked share;</a>
<a id='line_5524'>But uninhabited, untill'd, unsown,</a>
<a id='line_5525'>It lies, and breeds the bleating goat alone.</a>
<a id='line_5526'>For there no vessel with vermilion prore,</a>
<a id='line_5527'>Or bark of traffic, glides from shore to shore;</a>
<a id='line_5528'>The rugged race of savages, unskill'd</a>
<a id='line_5529'>The seas to traverse, or the ships to build,</a>
<a id='line_5530'>Gaze on the coast, nor cultivate the soil,</a>
<a id='line_5531'>Unlearn'd in all the industrious art of toil,</a>

<a id='line_5533'>Sprung from the fruitful genius of the ground;</a>
<a id='line_5534'>Fields waving high with heavy crops are seen,</a>
<a id='line_5535'>And vines that flourish in eternal green,</a>
<a id='line_5536'>Refreshing meads along the murmuring main,</a>
<a id='line_5537'>And fountains streaming down the fruitful plain.</a>
<a id='line_5538'></a>
<a id='line_5539'>"A port there is, inclosed on either side,</a>
<a id='line_5540'>Where ships may rest, unanchor'd and untied;</a>

<a id='line_5542'>And the sea whitens with the rising gale,</a>
<a id='line_5543'>High at the head, from out the cavern'd rock,</a>
<a id='line_5544'>In living rills a gushing fountain broke:</a>
<a id='line_5545'>Around it, and above, for ever green,</a>

<a id='line_5547'>Hither some favouring god, beyond our thought,</a>

<a id='line_5560'>Roused by the woodland nymphs at early dawn,</a>
<a id='line_5561'>The mountain goats came bounding o'er the lawn:</a>
<a id='line_5562'>In haste our fellows to the ships repair,</a>
<a id='line_5563'>For arms and weapons of the sylvan war;</a>
<a id='line_5564'>Straight in three squadrons all our crew we part,</a>
<a id='line_5565'>And bend the bow, or wing the missile dart;</a>
<a id='line_5566'>The bounteous gods afford a copious prey,</a>
<a id='line_5567'>And nine fat goats each vessel bears away:</a>
<a id='line_5568'>The royal bark had ten. Our ships complete</a>
<a id='line_5569'>We thus supplied (for twelve were all the fleet).</a>
<a id='line_5570'></a>
<a id='line_5571'>"Here, till the setting sun roll'd down the light,</a>
<a id='line_5572'>We sat indulging in the genial rite:</a>

<a id='line_5574'>We drain'd, the prize of our Ciconian wars.</a>
<a id='line_5575'>The land of Cyclops lay in prospect near:</a>
<a id='line_5576'>The voice of goats and bleating flocks we hear,</a>
<a id='line_5577'>And from their mountains rising smokes appear.</a>
<a id='line_5578'>Now sunk the sun, and darkness cover'd o'er</a>
<a id='line_5579'>The face of things: along the sea-beat shore</a>
<a id='line_5580'>Satiate we slept: but, when the sacred dawn</a>
<a id='line_5581'>Arising glitter'd o'er the dewy lawn,</a>
<a id='line_5582'>I call'd my fellows, and these words address'd</a>
<a id='line_5583'>'My dear associates, here indulge your rest;</a>

<a id='line_5594'>Neptune's smooth face, and cleave the yielding deep.</a>
<a id='line_5595'>When to the nearest verge of land we drew,</a>
<a id='line_5596'>Fast by the sea a lonely cave we view,</a>

<a id='line_5605'>A form enormous! far unlike the race</a>

<a id='line_5608'>Crown'd with rough thickets, and a nodding wood.</a>

<a id='line_5622'>And twelve large vessels of unmingled wine,</a>
<a id='line_5623'>Mellifluous, undecaying, and divine!</a>
<a id='line_5624'>Which now, some ages from his race conceal'd,</a>
<a id='line_5625'>The hoary sire in gratitude reveal'd.</a>
<a id='line_5626'>Such was the wine: to quench whose fervent steam</a>
<a id='line_5627'>Scarce twenty measures from the living stream</a>
<a id='line_5628'>To cool one cup sufficed: the goblet crown'd</a>
<a id='line_5629'>Breathed aromatic fragrances around.</a>
<a id='line_5630'>Of this an ample vase we heaved aboard,</a>
<a id='line_5631'>And brought another with provisions stored.</a>
<a id='line_5632'>My soul foreboded I should find the bower</a>
<a id='line_5633'>Of some fell monster, fierce with barbarous power;</a>
<a id='line_5634'>Some rustic wretch, who lived in Heaven's despite,</a>
<a id='line_5635'>Contemning laws, and trampling on the right.</a>
<a id='line_5636'>The cave we found, but vacant all within</a>
<a id='line_5637'>(His flock the giant tended on the green):</a>
<a id='line_5638'>But round the grot we gaze; and all we view,</a>
<a id='line_5639'>In order ranged our admiration drew:</a>
<a id='line_5640'>The bending shelves with loads of cheeses press'd,</a>
<a id='line_5641'>The folded flocks each separate from the rest</a>
<a id='line_5642'>(The larger here, and there the lesser lambs,</a>
<a id='line_5643'>The new-fallen young here bleating for their dams:</a>
<a id='line_5644'>The kid distinguish'd from the lambkin lies);</a>
<a id='line_5645'>The cavern echoes with responsive cries.</a>
<a id='line_5646'>Capacious chargers all around were laid.</a>
<a id='line_5647'>Full pails, and vessels of the milking trade.</a>
<a id='line_5648'>With fresh provisions hence our fleet to store</a>
<a id='line_5649'>My friends advise me, and to quit the shore.</a>
<a id='line_5650'>Or drive a flock of sheep and goats away,</a>
<a id='line_5651'>Consult our safety, and put off to sea.</a>
<a id='line_5652'>Their wholesome counsel rashly I declined,</a>
<a id='line_5653'>Curious to view the man of monstrous kind,</a>
<a id='line_5654'>And try what social rites a savage lends:</a>
<a id='line_5655'>Dire rites, alas! and fatal to my friends</a>
<a id='line_5656'></a>
<a id='line_5657'>"Then first a fire we kindle, and prepare</a>
<a id='line_5658'>For his return with sacrifice and prayer;</a>
<a id='line_5659'>The loaden shelves afford us full repast;</a>
<a id='line_5660'>We sit expecting. Lo! he comes at last,</a>
<a id='line_5661'>Near half a forest on his back he bore,</a>
<a id='line_5662'>And cast the ponderous burden at the door.</a>
<a id='line_5663'>It thunder'd as it fell. We trembled then,</a>
<a id='line_5664'>And sought the deep recesses of the den.</a>
<a id='line_5665'>New driven before him through the arching rock,</a>
<a id='line_5666'>Came tumbling, heaps on heaps, the unnumber'd flock.</a>
<a id='line_5667'>Big-udder'd ewes, and goats of female kind</a>
<a id='line_5668'>(The males were penn'd in outward courts behind);</a>
<a id='line_5669'>Then, heaved on high, a rock's enormous weight</a>
<a id='line_5670'>To the cave's mouth he roll'd, and closed the gate</a>
<a id='line_5671'>(Scarce twenty four-wheel'd cars, compact and strong,</a>
<a id='line_5672'>The massy load could bear, or roll along).</a>
<a id='line_5673'>He next betakes him to his evening cares,</a>
<a id='line_5674'>And, sitting down, to milk his flocks prepares;</a>
<a id='line_5675'>Of half their udders eases first the dams,</a>
<a id='line_5676'>Then to the mother's teat submits the lambs;</a>
<a id='line_5677'>Half the white stream to hardening cheese be press'd,</a>
<a id='line_5678'>And high in wicker-baskets heap'd: the rest,</a>
<a id='line_5679'>Reserved in bowls, supplied his nightly feast.</a>
<a id='line_5680'>His labour done, he fired the pile, that gave</a>
<a id='line_5681'>A sudden blaze, and lighted all the cave.</a>
<a id='line_5682'>We stand discover'd by the rising fires;</a>
<a id='line_5683'>Askance the giant glares, and thus inquires:</a>
<a id='line_5684'></a>
<a id='line_5685'>"'What are ye, guests? on what adventure, say,</a>
<a id='line_5686'>Thus far ye wander through the watery way?</a>
<a id='line_5687'>Pirates perhaps, who seek through seas unknown</a>
<a id='line_5688'>The lives of others, and expose your own?'</a>
<a id='line_5689'></a>
<a id='line_5690'>"His voice like thunder through the cavern sounds;</a>
<a id='line_5691'>My bold companions thrilling fear confounds,</a>
<a id='line_5692'>Appall'd at sight of more than mortal man!</a>
<a id='line_5693'>At length, with heart recover'd, I began:</a>
<a id='line_5694'></a>
<a id='line_5695'>"'From Troy's famed fields, sad wanderers o'er the main,</a>
<a id='line_5696'>Behold the relics of the Grecian train:</a>
<a id='line_5697'>Through various seas, by various perils toss'd,</a>
<a id='line_5698'>And forced by storms, unwilling on your coast;</a>
<a id='line_5699'>Far from our destined course and native land,</a>
<a id='line_5700'>Such was our fate, and such high Jove's command!</a>
<a id='line_5701'>Nor what we are befits us to disclaim,</a>
<a id='line_5702'>Atrides' friends (in arms a mighty name),</a>
<a id='line_5703'>Who taught proud Troy and all her sons to bow;</a>
<a id='line_5704'>Victors of late, but humble suppliants now!</a>
<a id='line_5705'>Low at thy knee thy succour we implore;</a>
<a id='line_5706'>Respect us, human, and relieve us, poor.</a>
<a id='line_5707'>At least, some hospitable gift bestow;</a>
<a id='line_5708'>'Tis what the happy to the unhappy owe;</a>
<a id='line_5709'>'Tis what the gods require: those gods revere;</a>
<a id='line_5710'>The poor and stranger are their constant care;</a>
<a id='line_5711'>To Jove their cause, and their revenge belongs,</a>
<a id='line_5712'>He wanders with them, and he feels their wrongs."</a>
<a id='line_5713'></a>
<a id='line_5714'>"'Fools that ye are (the savage thus replies,</a>
<a id='line_5715'>His inward fury blazing at his eyes),</a>
<a id='line_5716'>Or strangers, distant far from our abodes,</a>
<a id='line_5717'>To bid me reverence or regard the gods.</a>
<a id='line_5718'>Know then, we Cyclops are a race above</a>

<a id='line_5721'>Not as he wills, but as ourselves incline.</a>
<a id='line_5722'>But answer, the good ship that brought ye o'er,</a>
<a id='line_5723'>Where lies she anchor'd? near or off the shore?'</a>
<a id='line_5724'></a>
<a id='line_5725'>"Thus he. His meditated fraud I find</a>
<a id='line_5726'>(Versed in the turns of various human-kind):</a>
<a id='line_5727'>And, cautious thus: 'Against a dreadful rock,</a>
<a id='line_5728'>Fast by your shore the gallant vessel broke.</a>
<a id='line_5729'>Scarce with these few I 'scaped; of all my train,</a>
<a id='line_5730'>Whom angry Neptune, whelm'd beneath the main,</a>
<a id='line_5731'>The scattered wreck the winds blew back again.'</a>
<a id='line_5732'></a>
<a id='line_5733'>"He answer'd with his deed: his bloody hand</a>
<a id='line_5734'>Snatch'd two, unhappy! of my martial band;</a>
<a id='line_5735'>And dash'd like dogs against the stony floor:</a>
<a id='line_5736'>The pavement swims with brains and mingled gore.</a>
<a id='line_5737'>Torn limb from limb, he spreads his horrid feast,</a>
<a id='line_5738'>And fierce devours it like a mountain beast:</a>
<a id='line_5739'>He sucks the marrow, and the blood he drains,</a>
<a id='line_5740'>Nor entrails, flesh, nor solid bone remains.</a>
<a id='line_5741'>We see the death from which we cannot move,</a>
<a id='line_5742'>And humbled groan beneath the hand of Jove.</a>
<a id='line_5743'>His ample maw with human carnage fill'd,</a>
<a id='line_5744'>A milky deluge next the giant swill'd;</a>
<a id='line_5745'>Then stretch'd in length o'er half the cavern'd rock,</a>
<a id='line_5746'>Lay senseless, and supine, amidst the flock.</a>
<a id='line_5747'>To seize the time, and with a sudden wound</a>
<a id='line_5748'>To fix the slumbering monster to the ground,</a>
<a id='line_5749'>My soul impels me! and in act I stand</a>
<a id='line_5750'>To draw the sword; but wisdom held my hand.</a>
<a id='line_5751'>A deed so rash had finished all our fate,</a>
<a id='line_5752'>No mortal forces from the lofty gate</a>
<a id='line_5753'>Could roll the rock. In hopeless grief we lay,</a>
<a id='line_5754'>And sigh, expecting the return of day.</a>
<a id='line_5755'>Now did the rosy-fingered morn arise,</a>
<a id='line_5756'>And shed her sacred light along the skies;</a>
<a id='line_5757'>He wakes, he lights the fire, he milks the dams,</a>
<a id='line_5758'>And to the mother's teats submits the lambs.</a>
<a id='line_5759'>The task thus finish'd of his morning hours,</a>
<a id='line_5760'>Two more he snatches, murders, and devours.</a>
<a id='line_5761'>Then pleased, and whistling, drives his flock before,</a>
<a id='line_5762'>Removes the rocky mountain from the door,</a>
<a id='line_5763'>And shuts again: with equal ease disposed,</a>
<a id='line_5764'>As a light quiver's lid is oped and closed.</a>
<a id='line_5765'>His giant voice the echoing region fills:</a>
<a id='line_5766'>His flocks, obedient, spread o'er all the hills.</a>
<a id='line_5767'></a>
<a id='line_5768'>"Thus left behind, even in the last despair</a>
<a id='line_5769'>I thought, devised, and Pallas heard my prayer.</a>
<a id='line_5770'>Revenge, and doubt, and caution, work'd my breast;</a>
<a id='line_5771'>But this of many counsels seem'd the best:</a>
<a id='line_5772'>The monster's club within the cave I spied,</a>
<a id='line_5773'>A tree of stateliest growth, and yet undried,</a>
<a id='line_5774'>Green from the wood: of height and bulk so vast,</a>
<a id='line_5775'>The largest ship might claim it for a mast.</a>
<a id='line_5776'>This shorten'd of its top, I gave my train</a>
<a id='line_5777'>A fathom's length, to shape it and to plane;</a>
<a id='line_5778'>The narrower end I sharpen'd to a spire,</a>
<a id='line_5779'>Whose point we harden'd with the force of fire,</a>
<a id='line_5780'>And hid it in the dust that strew'd the cave,</a>
<a id='line_5781'>Then to my few companions, bold and brave,</a>
<a id='line_5782'>Proposed, who first the venturous deed should try,</a>
<a id='line_5783'>In the broad orbit of his monstrous eye</a>
<a id='line_5784'>To plunge the brand and twirl the pointed wood,</a>
<a id='line_5785'>When slumber next should tame the man of blood.</a>
<a id='line_5786'>Just as I wished, the lots were cast on four:</a>
<a id='line_5787'>Myself the fifth. We stand and wait the hour.</a>
<a id='line_5788'>He comes with evening: all his fleecy flock</a>
<a id='line_5789'>Before him march, and pour into the rock:</a>
<a id='line_5790'>Not one, or male or female, stayed behind</a>
<a id='line_5791'>(So fortune chanced, or so some god designed);</a>
<a id='line_5792'>Then heaving high the stone's unwieldy weight,</a>
<a id='line_5793'>He roll'd it on the cave and closed the gate.</a>
<a id='line_5794'>First down he sits, to milk the woolly dams,</a>
<a id='line_5795'>And then permits their udder to the lambs.</a>
<a id='line_5796'>Next seized two wretches more, and headlong cast,</a>
<a id='line_5797'>Brain'd on the rock; his second dire repast.</a>
<a id='line_5798'>I then approach'd him reeking with their gore,</a>
<a id='line_5799'>And held the brimming goblet foaming o'er;</a>
<a id='line_5800'>'Cyclop! since human flesh has been thy feast,</a>
<a id='line_5801'>Now drain this goblet, potent to digest;</a>
<a id='line_5802'>Know hence what treasures in our ship we lost,</a>
<a id='line_5803'>And what rich liquors other climates boast.</a>
<a id='line_5804'>We to thy shore the precious freight shall bear,</a>
<a id='line_5805'>If home thou send us and vouchsafe to spare.</a>
<a id='line_5806'>But oh! thus furious, thirsting thus for gore,</a>
<a id='line_5807'>The sons of men shall ne'er approach thy shore,</a>
<a id='line_5808'>And never shalt thou taste this nectar more,'</a>
<a id='line_5809'></a>
<a id='line_5810'>"He heard, he took, and pouring down his throat,</a>
<a id='line_5811'>Delighted, swill'd the large luxurious draught,</a>
<a id='line_5812'>'More! give me more (he cried): the boon be thine,</a>
<a id='line_5813'>Whoe'er thou art that bear'st celestial wine!</a>
<a id='line_5814'>Declare thy name: not mortal is this juice,</a>
<a id='line_5815'>Such as the unbless'd Cyclopaean climes produce</a>
<a id='line_5816'>(Though sure our vine the largest cluster yields,</a>
<a id='line_5817'>And Jove's scorn'd thunder serves to drench our fields);</a>
<a id='line_5818'>But this descended from the bless'd abodes,</a>
<a id='line_5819'>A rill of nectar, streaming from the gods.'</a>
<a id='line_5820'></a>
<a id='line_5821'>"He said, and greedy grasped the heady bowl,</a>
<a id='line_5822'>Thrice drained, and poured the deluge on his soul.</a>
<a id='line_5823'>His sense lay covered with the dozy fume;</a>
<a id='line_5824'>While thus my fraudful speech I reassume.</a>
<a id='line_5825'>'Thy promised boon, O Cyclop! now I claim,</a>
<a id='line_5826'>And plead my title; Noman is my name.</a>

<a id='line_5834'></a>
<a id='line_5835'>"He said: then nodding with the fumes of wine</a>
<a id='line_5836'>Droop'd his huge head, and snoring lay supine.</a>
<a id='line_5837'>His neck obliquely o'er his shoulders hung,</a>
<a id='line_5838'>Press'd with the weight of sleep that tames the strong:</a>
<a id='line_5839'>There belch'd the mingled streams of wine and blood,</a>
<a id='line_5840'>And human flesh, his indigested food.</a>
<a id='line_5841'>Sudden I stir the embers, and inspire</a>
<a id='line_5842'>With animating breath the seeds of fire:</a>
<a id='line_5843'>Each drooping spirit with bold words repair,</a>
<a id='line_5844'>And urged my train the dreadful deed to dare.</a>
<a id='line_5845'>The stake now glow'd beneath the burning bed</a>
<a id='line_5846'>(Green as it was) and sparkled fiery red,</a>
<a id='line_5847'>Then forth the vengeful instrument I bring;</a>
<a id='line_5848'>With beating hearts my fellows form a ring.</a>
<a id='line_5849'>Urged my some present god, they swift let fall</a>
<a id='line_5850'>The pointed torment on his visual ball.</a>
<a id='line_5851'>Myself above them from a rising ground</a>
<a id='line_5852'>Guide the sharp stake, and twirl it round and round.</a>
<a id='line_5853'>As when a shipwright stands his workmen o'er,</a>
<a id='line_5854'>Who ply the wimble, some huge beam to bore;</a>
<a id='line_5855'>Urged on all hands, it nimbly spins about,</a>
<a id='line_5856'>The grain deep-piercing till it scoops it out:</a>
<a id='line_5857'>In his broad eye he whirls the fiery wood;</a>
<a id='line_5858'>From the pierced pupil spouts the boiling blood;</a>
<a id='line_5859'>Singed are his brows; the scorching lids grow black;</a>
<a id='line_5860'>The jelly bubbles, and the fibres crack.</a>
<a id='line_5861'>And as when armourers temper in the ford</a>
<a id='line_5862'>The keen-edged pole-axe, or the shining sword,</a>
<a id='line_5863'>The red-hot metal hisses in the lake,</a>
<a id='line_5864'>Thus in his eye-ball hiss'd the plunging stake.</a>
<a id='line_5865'>He sends a dreadful groan, the rocks around</a>
<a id='line_5866'>Through all their inmost winding caves resound.</a>
<a id='line_5867'>Scared we recoiled.  Forth with frantic hand,</a>
<a id='line_5868'>He tore and dash'd on earth and gory brand;</a>
<a id='line_5869'>Then calls the Cyclops, all that round him dwell,</a>
<a id='line_5870'>With voice like thunder, and a direful yell.</a>
<a id='line_5871'>From all their dens the one-eyed race repair,</a>
<a id='line_5872'>From rifted rocks, and mountains bleak in air.</a>
<a id='line_5873'>All haste assembled, at his well-known roar,</a>
<a id='line_5874'>Inquire the cause, and crowd the cavern door.</a>

<a id='line_5944'>"The giant spoke, and through the hollow rock</a>
<a id='line_5945'>Dismiss'd the ram, the father of the flock.</a>
<a id='line_5946'>No sooner freed, and through the inclosure pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_5947'>First I release myself, my fellows last:</a>
<a id='line_5948'>Fat sheep and goats in throngs we drive before,</a>
<a id='line_5949'>And reach our vessel on the winding shore.</a>
<a id='line_5950'>With joy the sailors view their friends return'd,</a>
<a id='line_5951'>And hail us living whom as dead they mourn'd</a>
<a id='line_5952'>Big tears of transport stand in every eye:</a>
<a id='line_5953'>I check their fondness, and command to fly.</a>
<a id='line_5954'>Aboard in haste they heave the wealthy sheep,</a>
<a id='line_5955'>And snatch their oars, and rush into the deep.</a>
<a id='line_5956'>"Now off at sea, and from the shallows clear,</a>
<a id='line_5957'>As far as human voice could reach the ear,</a>
<a id='line_5958'>With taunts the distant giant I accost:</a>
<a id='line_5959'>'Hear me, O Cyclop! hear, ungracious host!</a>
<a id='line_5960'>'Twas on no coward, no ignoble slave,</a>
<a id='line_5961'>Thou meditatest thy meal in yonder cave;</a>
<a id='line_5962'>But one, the vengeance fated from above</a>
<a id='line_5963'>Doom'd to inflict; the instrument of Jove.</a>
<a id='line_5964'>Thy barbarous breach of hospitable bands,</a>
<a id='line_5965'>The god, the god revenges by my hands.'</a>
<a id='line_5966'></a>
<a id='line_5967'>"These words the Cyclop's burning rage provoke;</a>
<a id='line_5968'>From the tall hill he rends a pointed rock;</a>
<a id='line_5969'>High o'er the billows flew the massy load,</a>
<a id='line_5970'>And near the ship came thundering on the flood.</a>
<a id='line_5971'>It almost brush'd the helm, and fell before:</a>
<a id='line_5972'>The whole sea shook, and refluent beat the shore,</a>
<a id='line_5973'>The strong concussion on the heaving tide</a>
<a id='line_5974'>Roll'd back the vessel to the island's side:</a>
<a id='line_5975'>Again I shoved her off: our fate to fly,</a>
<a id='line_5976'>Each nerve we stretch, and every oar we ply.</a>
<a id='line_5977'>Just 'scaped impending death, when now again</a>
<a id='line_5978'>We twice as far had furrow'd back the main,</a>
<a id='line_5979'>Once more I raise my voice; my friends, afraid,</a>
<a id='line_5980'>With mild entreaties my design dissuade:</a>
<a id='line_5981'>'What boots the godless giant to provoke,</a>
<a id='line_5982'>Whose arm may sink us at a single stroke?</a>
<a id='line_5983'>Already when the dreadful rock he threw,</a>
<a id='line_5984'>Old Ocean shook, and back his surges flew.</a>
<a id='line_5985'>The sounding voice directs his aim again;</a>
<a id='line_5986'>The rock o'erwhelms us, and we 'scaped in vain.'</a>
<a id='line_5987'></a>
<a id='line_5988'>"But I, of mind elate, and scorning fear,</a>
<a id='line_5989'>Thus with new taunts insult the monster's ear:</a>
<a id='line_5990'>'Cyclop! if any, pitying thy disgrace.</a>
<a id='line_5991'>Ask, who disfigured thus that eyeless face?</a>
<a id='line_5992'>Say 'twas Ulysses: 'twas his deed declare,</a>
<a id='line_5993'>Laertes' son, of Ithaca the fair;</a>
<a id='line_5994'>Ulysses, far in fighting fields renown'd,</a>
<a id='line_5995'>Before whose arm Troy tumbled to the ground.'</a>
<a id='line_5996'></a>
<a id='line_5997'>"The astonished savage with a roar replies:</a>
<a id='line_5998'>'Oh heavens! oh faith of ancient prophecies!</a>
<a id='line_5999'>This, Telemus Eurymedes foretold</a>
<a id='line_6000'>(The mighty seer who on these hills grew old;</a>

<a id='line_6003'>Long since he menaced, such was Fate's command;</a>
<a id='line_6004'>And named Ulysses as the destined hand.</a>
<a id='line_6005'>I deem'd some godlike giant to behold,</a>
<a id='line_6006'>Or lofty hero, haughty, brave, and bold;</a>
<a id='line_6007'>Not this weak pigmy wretch, of mean design,</a>
<a id='line_6008'>Who, not by strength subdued me, but by wine.</a>
<a id='line_6009'>But come, accept our gifts, and join to pray</a>
<a id='line_6010'>Great Neptune's blessing on the watery way;</a>

<a id='line_6012'>The immortal father no less boasts the son.</a>

<a id='line_6015'>"'Oh! could this arm (I thus aloud rejoin'd)</a>
<a id='line_6016'>From that vast bulk dislodge thy bloody mind,</a>

<a id='line_6018'>As sure as Neptune cannot give thee sight.'</a>
<a id='line_6019'>"Thus I; while raging he repeats his cries,</a>
<a id='line_6020'>With hands uplifted to the starry skies?</a>
<a id='line_6021'>'Hear me, O Neptune; thou whose arms are hurl'd</a>
<a id='line_6022'>From shore to shore, and gird the solid world;</a>
<a id='line_6023'>If thine I am, nor thou my birth disown,</a>
<a id='line_6024'>And if the unhappy Cyclop be thy son,</a>
<a id='line_6025'>Let not Ulysses breathe his native air,</a>
<a id='line_6026'>Laertes' son, of Ithaca the fair.</a>
<a id='line_6027'>If to review his country be his fate,</a>
<a id='line_6028'>Be it through toils and sufferings long and late;</a>

<a id='line_6032'>More near and deep, domestic woes succeed!'</a>
<a id='line_6033'>With imprecations thus he fill'd the air,</a>
<a id='line_6034'>And angry Neptune heard the unrighteous prayer,</a>
<a id='line_6035'>A larger rock then heaving from the plain,</a>
<a id='line_6036'>He whirl'd it round: it sung across the main;</a>
<a id='line_6037'>It fell, and brush'd the stern: the billows roar,</a>
<a id='line_6038'>Shake at the weight, and refluent beat the shore.</a>
<a id='line_6039'>With all our force we kept aloof to sea,</a>
<a id='line_6040'>And gain'd the island where our vessels lay.</a>
<a id='line_6041'>Our sight the whole collected navy cheer'd.</a>
<a id='line_6042'>Who, waiting long, by turns had hoped and fear'd.</a>
<a id='line_6043'>There disembarking on the green sea side,</a>

<a id='line_6048'>With pious mind to heaven I consecrate.</a>
<a id='line_6049'>But the great god, whose thunder rends the skies,</a>
<a id='line_6050'>Averse, beholds the smoking sacrifice;</a>

<a id='line_6069'>ARGUMENT.</a>
<a id='line_6070'></a>
<a id='line_6071'>ADVENTURES WITH AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONS, AND CIRCE.</a>
<a id='line_6072'></a>
<a id='line_6073'>Ulysses arrives at the island of AEolus, who gives him prosperous</a>
<a id='line_6074'>winds, and incloses the adverse ones in a bag, which his</a>
<a id='line_6075'>companions untying, they are driven back again and rejected.</a>
<a id='line_6076'>Then they sail to the Laestrygons, where they lose eleven ships,</a>
<a id='line_6077'>and, with only one remaining, proceed to the island of Circe.</a>
<a id='line_6078'>Eurylochus is sent first with some companions, all which, except</a>
<a id='line_6079'>Eurylochus, are transformed into swine. Ulysses then undertakes</a>
<a id='line_6080'>the adventure, and, by the help of Mercury, who gives him the herb</a>
<a id='line_6081'>Moly, overcomes the enchantress, and procures the restoration of</a>
<a id='line_6082'>his men. After a year's stay with her, he prepares, at her</a>
<a id='line_6083'>instigation, for his voyage to the infernal shades.</a>
<a id='line_6084'></a>
<a id='line_6085'></a>
<a id='line_6086'></a>
<a id='line_6087'>"AT length we reach'd AEolias's sea-girt shore,</a>
<a id='line_6088'>Where great Hippotades the sceptre bore,</a>
<a id='line_6089'>A floating isle! high-raised by toil divine,</a>
<a id='line_6090'>Strong walls of brass the rocky coast confine.</a>
<a id='line_6091'>Six blooming youths, in private grandeur bred,</a>
<a id='line_6092'>And six fair daughters, graced the royal bed;</a>
<a id='line_6093'>These sons their sisters wed, and all remain</a>
<a id='line_6094'>Their parents' pride, and pleasure of their reign.</a>
<a id='line_6095'>All day they feast, all day the bowls flow round,</a>
<a id='line_6096'>And joy and music through the isle resound;</a>
<a id='line_6097'>At night each pair on splendid carpets lay,</a>
<a id='line_6098'>And crown'd with love the pleasures of the day.</a>
<a id='line_6099'>This happy port affords our wandering fleet</a>
<a id='line_6100'>A month's reception, and a safe retreat.</a>
<a id='line_6101'>Full oft the monarch urged me to relate</a>
<a id='line_6102'>The fall of Ilion, and the Grecian fate;</a>
<a id='line_6103'>Full oft I told: at length for parting moved;</a>
<a id='line_6104'>The king with mighty gifts my suit approved.</a>
<a id='line_6105'>The adverse winds in leathern bags he braced,</a>
<a id='line_6106'>Compress'd their force, and lock'd each struggling blast.</a>
<a id='line_6107'>For him the mighty sire of gods assign'd</a>
<a id='line_6108'>The tempest's lood, the tyrant of the wind;</a>
<a id='line_6109'>His word alone the listening storms obey,</a>
<a id='line_6110'>To smooth the deep, or swell the foamy sea.</a>
<a id='line_6111'>These in my hollow ship the monarch hung,</a>
<a id='line_6112'>Securely fetter'd by a silver thong:</a>
<a id='line_6113'>But Zephyrus exempt, with friendly gales</a>
<a id='line_6114'>He charged to fill, and guide the swelling sails:</a>
<a id='line_6115'>Rare gift! but O, what gift to fools avails!</a>
<a id='line_6116'></a>
<a id='line_6117'>"Nine prosperous days we plied the labouring oar;</a>
<a id='line_6118'>The tenth presents our welcome native shore:</a>
<a id='line_6119'>The hills display the beacon's friendly light,</a>
<a id='line_6120'>And rising mountains gain upon our sight.</a>
<a id='line_6121'>Then first my eyes, by watchful toils oppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_6122'>Complied to take the balmy gifts of rest:</a>
<a id='line_6123'>Then first my hands did from the rudder part</a>
<a id='line_6124'>(So much the love of home possess'd my heart):</a>
<a id='line_6125'>When lo! on board a fond debate arose;</a>
<a id='line_6126'>What rare device those vessels might inclose?</a>
<a id='line_6127'>What sum, what prize from AEolus I brought?</a>
<a id='line_6128'>Whilst to his neighbour each express'd his thought:</a>
<a id='line_6129'></a>
<a id='line_6130'>"'Say, whence ye gods, contending nations strive</a>
<a id='line_6131'>Who most shall please, who most our hero give?</a>
<a id='line_6132'>Long have his coffers groan'd with Trojan spoils:</a>
<a id='line_6133'>Whilst we, the wretched partners of his toils,</a>
<a id='line_6134'>Reproach'd by want, our fruitless labours mourn,</a>
<a id='line_6135'>And only rich in barren fame return.</a>
<a id='line_6136'>Now AEolus, ye see, augments his store:</a>
<a id='line_6137'>But come, my friends, these mystic gifts explore,'</a>
<a id='line_6138'>They said: and (oh cursed fate!) the thongs unbound!</a>
<a id='line_6139'>The gushing tempest sweeps the ocean round;</a>
<a id='line_6140'>Snatch'd in the whirl, the hurried navy flew,</a>
<a id='line_6141'>The ocean widen'd and the shores withdrew.</a>
<a id='line_6142'>Roused from my fatal sleep I long debate</a>
<a id='line_6143'>If still to live, or desperate plunge to fate;</a>
<a id='line_6144'>Thus doubting, prostrate on the deck I lay,</a>
<a id='line_6145'>Till all the coward thoughts of death gave way.</a>
<a id='line_6146'></a>
<a id='line_6147'>"Meanwhile our vessels plough the liquid plain,</a>
<a id='line_6148'>And soon the known AEolian coast regain;</a>
<a id='line_6149'>Our groan the rocks remurmur'd to the main.</a>
<a id='line_6150'>We leap'd on shore, and with a scanty feast</a>
<a id='line_6151'>Our thirst and hunger hastily repress'd;</a>
<a id='line_6152'>That done, two chosen heralds straight attend</a>
<a id='line_6153'>Our second progress to my royal friend;</a>
<a id='line_6154'>And him amidst his jovial sons we found;</a>
<a id='line_6155'>The banquet steaming, and the goblets crown'd;</a>
<a id='line_6156'>There humbly stoop'd with conscious shame and awe,</a>
<a id='line_6157'>Nor nearer than the gate presumed to draw.</a>
<a id='line_6158'>But soon his sons their well-known guest descried,</a>
<a id='line_6159'>And starting from their couches loudly cried:</a>
<a id='line_6160'>'Ulysses here! what demon could'st thou meet</a>
<a id='line_6161'>To thwart thy passage, and repel thy fleet?</a>
<a id='line_6162'>Wast thou not furnish'd by our choicest care</a>
<a id='line_6163'>For Greece, for home and all thy soul held dear?'</a>
<a id='line_6164'>Thus they, In silence long my fate I mourn'd;</a>
<a id='line_6165'>At length these words with accents low return'd:</a>
<a id='line_6166'>'Me, lock'd in sleep, my faithless crew bereft</a>
<a id='line_6167'>Of all the blessing of your godlike gift!</a>
<a id='line_6168'>But grant, oh grant, our loss we may retrieve;</a>
<a id='line_6169'>A favour you, and you alone can give.'</a>
<a id='line_6170'></a>
<a id='line_6171'>"Thus I with art to move their pity tried,</a>
<a id='line_6172'>And touch'd the youths; but their stern sire replied:</a>
<a id='line_6173'>'Vile wretch, begone! this instant I command</a>
<a id='line_6174'>Thy fleet accursed to leave our hallow'd land.</a>
<a id='line_6175'>His baneful suit pollutes these bless'd abodes,</a>
<a id='line_6176'>Whose fate proclaims him hateful to the gods.'</a>
<a id='line_6177'></a>
<a id='line_6178'>"Thus fierce he said: we sighing went our way,</a>
<a id='line_6179'>And with desponding hearts put off to sea.</a>
<a id='line_6180'>The sailors spent with toils their folly mourn,</a>
<a id='line_6181'>But mourn in vain; no prospect of return</a>
<a id='line_6182'>Six days and nights a doubtful course we steer,</a>
<a id='line_6183'>The next proud Lamos' stately towers appear,</a>
<a id='line_6184'>And Laestrygonia's gates arise distinct in air.</a>
<a id='line_6185'>The shepherd, quitting here at night the plain,</a>
<a id='line_6186'>Calls, to succeed his cares, the watchful swain;</a>
<a id='line_6187'>But he that scorns the chains of sleep to wear,</a>
<a id='line_6188'>And adds the herdsman's to the shepherd's care,</a>
<a id='line_6189'>So near the pastures, and so short the way,</a>
<a id='line_6190'>His double toils may claim a double pay,</a>
<a id='line_6191'>And join the labours of the night and day.</a>
<a id='line_6192'></a>
<a id='line_6193'>"Within a long recess a bay there lies,</a>
<a id='line_6194'>Edged round with cliffs high pointing to the skies;</a>
<a id='line_6195'>The jutting shores that swell on either side</a>
<a id='line_6196'>Contract its mouth, and break the rushing tide.</a>
<a id='line_6197'>Our eager sailors seize the fair retreat,</a>
<a id='line_6198'>And bound within the port their crowded fleet:</a>
<a id='line_6199'>For here retired the sinking billows sleep,</a>
<a id='line_6200'>And smiling calmness silver'd o'er the deep.</a>
<a id='line_6201'>I only in the bay refused to moor,</a>
<a id='line_6202'>And fix'd without, my halsers to the shore.</a>
<a id='line_6203'></a>
<a id='line_6204'>"From thence we climb'd a point, whose airy brow</a>
<a id='line_6205'>Commands the prospect of the plains below;</a>
<a id='line_6206'>No tracks of beasts, or signs of men, we found,</a>
<a id='line_6207'>But smoky volumes rolling from the ground.</a>
<a id='line_6208'>Two with our herald thither we command,</a>
<a id='line_6209'>With speed to learn what men possess'd the land.</a>
<a id='line_6210'>They went, and kept the wheel's smooth-beaten road</a>
<a id='line_6211'>Which to the city drew the mountain wood;</a>
<a id='line_6212'>When lo! they met, beside a crystal spring,</a>
<a id='line_6213'>The daughter of Antiphates the king;</a>
<a id='line_6214'>She to Artacia's silver streams came down;</a>
<a id='line_6215'>(Artacia's streams alone supply the town);</a>
<a id='line_6216'>The damsel they approach, and ask'd what race</a>
<a id='line_6217'>The people were? who monarch of the place?</a>
<a id='line_6218'>With joy the maid the unwary strangers heard</a>
<a id='line_6219'>And show'd them where the royal dome appear'd.</a>
<a id='line_6220'>They went; but as they entering saw the queen</a>
<a id='line_6221'>Of size enormous, and terrific mien</a>
<a id='line_6222'>(Not yielding to some bulky mountain's height),</a>
<a id='line_6223'>A sudden horror struck their aching sight.</a>
<a id='line_6224'>Swift at her call her husband scour'd away</a>
<a id='line_6225'>To wreak his hunger on the destined prey;</a>
<a id='line_6226'>One for his food the raging glutton slew,</a>
<a id='line_6227'>But two rush'd out, and to the navy flew.</a>
<a id='line_6228'></a>
<a id='line_6229'>"Balk'd of his prey, the yelling monster flies,</a>
<a id='line_6230'>And fills the city with his hideous cries;</a>
<a id='line_6231'>A ghastly band of giants hear the roar,</a>
<a id='line_6232'>And, pouring down the mountains, crowd the shore.</a>
<a id='line_6233'>Fragments they rend from off the craggy brow</a>
<a id='line_6234'>And dash the ruins on the ships below;</a>
<a id='line_6235'>The crackling vessels burst; hoarse groans arise,</a>
<a id='line_6236'>And mingled horrors echo to the skies;</a>
<a id='line_6237'>The men like fish, they struck upon the flood,</a>
<a id='line_6238'>And cramm'd their filthy throats with human food.</a>
<a id='line_6239'>Whilst thus their fury rages at the bay,</a>
<a id='line_6240'>My sword our cables cut, I call'd to weigh;</a>
<a id='line_6241'>And charged my men, as they from fate would fly,</a>
<a id='line_6242'>Each nerve to strain, each bending oar to ply.</a>
<a id='line_6243'>The sailors catch the word, their oars they seize,</a>
<a id='line_6244'>And sweep with equal strokes the smoky seas;</a>
<a id='line_6245'>Clear of the rocks the impatient vessel flies;</a>
<a id='line_6246'>Whilst in the port each wretch encumber'd dies.</a>
<a id='line_6247'>With earnest haste my frighted sailors press,</a>
<a id='line_6248'>While kindling transports glow'd at our success;</a>
<a id='line_6249'>But the sad fate that did our friends destroy,</a>
<a id='line_6250'>Cool'd every breast, and damp'd the rising joy.</a>
<a id='line_6251'></a>
<a id='line_6252'>"Now dropp'd our anchors in the Aeaean bay,</a>
<a id='line_6253'>Where Circe dwelt, the daughter of the Day!</a>
<a id='line_6254'>Her mother Perse, of old Ocean's strain,</a>
<a id='line_6255'>Thus from the Lun descended, and the Main</a>
<a id='line_6256'>(From the same lineage stern Aeaetes came,</a>

<a id='line_6260'>Some god directing to this peaceful bay</a>

<a id='line_6263'>And now the third succeeding morning shone.</a>
<a id='line_6264'>I climb'd a cliff, with spear and sword in hand,</a>

<a id='line_6266'>To learn if aught of mortal works appear,</a>
<a id='line_6267'>Or cheerful voice of mortal strike the ear?</a>
<a id='line_6268'>From the high point I mark'd, in distant view,</a>
<a id='line_6269'>A stream of curling smoke ascending blue,</a>
<a id='line_6270'>And spiry tops, the tufted trees above,</a>
<a id='line_6271'>Of Circe's palace bosom'd in the grove.</a>
<a id='line_6272'></a>
<a id='line_6273'>"Thither to haste, the region to explore,</a>
<a id='line_6274'>Was first my thought: but speeding back to shore</a>
<a id='line_6275'>I deem'd it best to visit first my crew,</a>
<a id='line_6276'>And send our spies the dubious coast to view.</a>
<a id='line_6277'>As down the hill I solitary go,</a>
<a id='line_6278'>Some power divine, who pities human woe,</a>
<a id='line_6279'>Sent a tall stag, descending from the wood,</a>
<a id='line_6280'>To cool his fervour in the crystal flood;</a>
<a id='line_6281'>Luxuriant on the wave-worn bank he lay,</a>
<a id='line_6282'>Stretch'd forth and panting in the sunny ray.</a>
<a id='line_6283'>I launch'd my spear, and with a sudden wound</a>
<a id='line_6284'>Transpierced his back, and fix'd him to the ground.</a>
<a id='line_6285'>He falls, and mourns his fate with human cries:</a>
<a id='line_6286'>Through the wide wound the vital spirit flies.</a>
<a id='line_6287'>I drew, and casting on the river's side</a>
<a id='line_6288'>The bloody spear, his gather'd feet I tied</a>
<a id='line_6289'>With twining osiers which the bank supplied.</a>
<a id='line_6290'>An ell in length the pliant wisp I weaved,</a>
<a id='line_6291'>And the huge body on my shoulders heaved:</a>
<a id='line_6292'>Then leaning on my spear with both my hands,</a>
<a id='line_6293'>Upbore my load, and press'd the sinking sands</a>
<a id='line_6294'>With weighty steps, till at the ship I threw</a>
<a id='line_6295'>The welcome burden, and bespoke my crew:</a>
<a id='line_6296'></a>
<a id='line_6297'>"'Cheer up, my friends! it is not yet our fate</a>
<a id='line_6298'>To glide with ghosts through Pluto's gloomy gate.</a>

<a id='line_6303'>And on the future banquet feast their eyes,</a>
<a id='line_6304'>As huge in length extended lay the beast;</a>
<a id='line_6305'>Then wash their hands, and hasten to the feast.</a>
<a id='line_6306'>There, till the setting sun roll'd down the light,</a>
<a id='line_6307'>They sate indulging in the genial rite.</a>
<a id='line_6308'>When evening rose, and darkness cover'd o'er</a>
<a id='line_6309'>The face of things, we slept along the shore.</a>
<a id='line_6310'>But when the rosy morning warm'd the east,</a>
<a id='line_6311'>My men I summon'd, and these words address'd:</a>
<a id='line_6312'>"'Followers and friends, attend what I propose:</a>
<a id='line_6313'>Ye sad companions of Ulysses' woes!</a>

<a id='line_6315'>Or to what quarter now we turn our eyes,</a>
<a id='line_6316'>Or where the sun shall set, or where shall rise.</a>
<a id='line_6317'>Here let us think (if thinking be not vain)</a>
<a id='line_6318'>If any counsel, any hope remain.</a>
<a id='line_6319'>Alas! from yonder promontory's brow</a>
<a id='line_6320'>I view'd the coast, a region flat and low;</a>
<a id='line_6321'>An isle encircled with the boundless flood;</a>
<a id='line_6322'>A length of thickets, and entangled wood.</a>
<a id='line_6323'>Some smoke I saw amid the forest rise,</a>
<a id='line_6324'>And all around it only seas and skies!'</a>
<a id='line_6325'></a>
<a id='line_6326'>"With broken hearts my sad companions stood,</a>
<a id='line_6327'>Mindful of Cyclops and his human food,</a>
<a id='line_6328'>And horrid Laestrygons, the men of blood.</a>
<a id='line_6329'>Presaging tears apace began to rain;</a>
<a id='line_6330'>But tears in mortal miseries are vain.</a>
<a id='line_6331'>In equal parts I straight divide my band,</a>
<a id='line_6332'>And name a chief each party to command;</a>
<a id='line_6333'>I led the one, and of the other side</a>
<a id='line_6334'>Appointed brave Eurylochus the guide.</a>
<a id='line_6335'>Then in the brazen helm the lots we throw,</a>
<a id='line_6336'>And fortune casts Eurylochus to go;</a>
<a id='line_6337'>He march'd with twice eleven in his train;</a>
<a id='line_6338'>Pensive they march, and pensive we remain.</a>
<a id='line_6339'></a>
<a id='line_6340'>"The palace in a woody vale they found,</a>
<a id='line_6341'>High raised of stone; a shaded space around;</a>
<a id='line_6342'>Where mountain wolves and brindled lions roam,</a>
<a id='line_6343'>(By magic tamed,) familiar to the dome.</a>
<a id='line_6344'>With gentle blandishment our men they meet,</a>
<a id='line_6345'>And wag their tails, and fawning lick their feet.</a>
<a id='line_6346'>As from some feast a man returning late,</a>
<a id='line_6347'>His faithful dogs all meet him at the gate,</a>
<a id='line_6348'>Rejoicing round, some morsel to receive,</a>
<a id='line_6349'>(Such as the good man ever used to give,)</a>
<a id='line_6350'>Domestic thus the grisly beasts drew near;</a>
<a id='line_6351'>They gaze with wonder not unmix'd with fear.</a>
<a id='line_6352'>Now on the threshold of the dome they stood,</a>
<a id='line_6353'>And heard a voice resounding through the wood:</a>
<a id='line_6354'>Placed at her loom within, the goddess sung;</a>
<a id='line_6355'>The vaulted roofs and solid pavement rung.</a>
<a id='line_6356'>O'er the fair web the rising figures shine,</a>
<a id='line_6357'>Immortal labour! worthy hands divine.</a>
<a id='line_6358'>Polites to the rest the question moved</a>
<a id='line_6359'>(A gallant leader, and a man I loved):</a>
<a id='line_6360'></a>
<a id='line_6361'>"'What voice celestial, chanting to the loom</a>
<a id='line_6362'>(Or nymph, or goddess), echoes from the room?</a>
<a id='line_6363'>Say, shall we seek access?' With that they call;</a>
<a id='line_6364'>And wide unfold the portals of the hall.</a>
<a id='line_6365'></a>
<a id='line_6366'>"The goddess, rising, asks her guests to stay,</a>
<a id='line_6367'>Who blindly follow where she leads the way.</a>
<a id='line_6368'>Eurylochus alone of all the band,</a>
<a id='line_6369'>Suspecting fraud, more prudently remain'd.</a>
<a id='line_6370'>On thrones around with downy coverings graced,</a>
<a id='line_6371'>With semblance fair, the unhappy men she placed.</a>
<a id='line_6372'>Milk newly press'd, the sacred flour of wheat,</a>
<a id='line_6373'>And honey fresh, and Pramnian wines the treat:</a>
<a id='line_6374'>But venom'd was the bread, and mix'd the bowl,</a>
<a id='line_6375'>With drugs of force to darken all the soul:</a>
<a id='line_6376'>Soon in the luscious feast themselves they lost,</a>
<a id='line_6377'>And drank oblivion of their native coast.</a>
<a id='line_6378'>Instant her circling wand the goddess waves,</a>
<a id='line_6379'>To hogs transforms them, and the sty receives.</a>
<a id='line_6380'>No more was seen the human form divine;</a>
<a id='line_6381'>Head, face, and members, bristle into swine:</a>
<a id='line_6382'>Still cursed with sense, their minds remain alone,</a>
<a id='line_6383'>And their own voice affrights them when they groan.</a>
<a id='line_6384'>Meanwhile the goddess in disdain bestows</a>
<a id='line_6385'>The mast and acorn, brutal food! and strows</a>
<a id='line_6386'>The fruits and cornel, as their feast, around;</a>
<a id='line_6387'>Now prone and grovelling on unsavoury ground.</a>

<a id='line_6389'>"Eurylochus, with pensive steps and slow.</a>
<a id='line_6390'>Aghast returns; the messenger of woe,</a>
<a id='line_6391'>And bitter fate. To speak he made essay,</a>
<a id='line_6392'>In vain essay'd, nor would his tongue obey.</a>
<a id='line_6393'>His swelling heart denied the words their way:</a>
<a id='line_6394'>But speaking tears the want of words supply,</a>
<a id='line_6395'>And the full soul bursts copious from his eye.</a>
<a id='line_6396'>Affrighted, anxious for our fellows' fates,</a>

<a id='line_6407'>The goddess mild invites the guests to stay:</a>
<a id='line_6408'>They blindly follow where she leads the way.</a>
<a id='line_6409'>I only wait behind of all the train:</a>
<a id='line_6410'>I waited long, and eyed the doors in vain:</a>
<a id='line_6411'>The rest are vanish'd, none repass'd the gate,</a>
<a id='line_6412'>And not a man appears to tell their fate.'</a>
<a id='line_6413'></a>
<a id='line_6414'>"I heard, and instant o'er my shoulder flung</a>
<a id='line_6415'>The belt in which my weighty falchion hung</a>
<a id='line_6416'>(A beamy blade): then seized the bended bow,</a>
<a id='line_6417'>And bade him guide the way, resolved to go.</a>
<a id='line_6418'>He, prostrate falling, with both hands embraced</a>
<a id='line_6419'>My knees, and weeping thus his suit address'd:</a>

<a id='line_6423'>Never, alas! thou never shalt return,</a>
<a id='line_6424'>Or see the wretched for whose loss we mourn.</a>
<a id='line_6425'>With what remains from certain ruin fly,</a>
<a id='line_6426'>And save the few not fated yet to die.'</a>
<a id='line_6427'></a>
<a id='line_6428'>"I answer'd stern: 'Inglorious then remain,</a>

<a id='line_6430'>Alone, unfriended, will I tempt my way;</a>
<a id='line_6431'>The laws of fate compel, and I obey.'</a>
<a id='line_6432'>This said, and scornful turning from the shore</a>
<a id='line_6433'>My haughty step, I stalk'd the valley o'er.</a>
<a id='line_6434'>Till now approaching nigh the magic bower,</a>
<a id='line_6435'>Where dwelt the enchantress skill'd in herbs of power,</a>
<a id='line_6436'>A form divine forth issued from the wood</a>
<a id='line_6437'>(Immortal Hermes with the golden rod)</a>
<a id='line_6438'>In human semblance. On his bloomy face</a>
<a id='line_6439'>Youth smiled celestial, with each opening grace.</a>
<a id='line_6440'>He seized my hand, and gracious thus began:</a>
<a id='line_6441'>'Ah whither roam'st thou, much-enduring man?</a>
<a id='line_6442'>O blind to fate! what led thy steps to rove</a>
<a id='line_6443'>The horrid mazes of this magic grove?</a>
<a id='line_6444'>Each friend you seek in yon enclosure lies,</a>
<a id='line_6445'>All lost their form, and habitants of sties.</a>
<a id='line_6446'>Think'st thou by wit to model their escape?</a>
<a id='line_6447'>Sooner shalt thou, a stranger to thy shape,</a>
<a id='line_6448'>Fall prone their equal: first thy danger know,</a>
<a id='line_6449'>Then take the antidote the gods bestow.</a>
<a id='line_6450'>The plant I give through all the direful bower</a>
<a id='line_6451'>Shall guard thee, and avert the evil hour.</a>
<a id='line_6452'>Now hear her wicked arts: Before thy eyes</a>
<a id='line_6453'>The bowl shall sparkle, and the banquet rise;</a>
<a id='line_6454'>Take this, nor from the faithless feast abstain,</a>
<a id='line_6455'>For temper'd drugs and poison shall be vain.</a>
<a id='line_6456'>Soon as she strikes her wand, and gives the word,</a>
<a id='line_6457'>Draw forth and brandish thy refulgent sword,</a>
<a id='line_6458'>And menace death: those menaces shall move</a>
<a id='line_6459'>Her alter'd mind to blandishment and love.</a>
<a id='line_6460'>Nor shun the blessing proffer'd to thy arms,</a>
<a id='line_6461'>Ascend her bed, and taste celestial charms;</a>
<a id='line_6462'>So shall thy tedious toils a respite find,</a>
<a id='line_6463'>And thy lost friends return to human kind.</a>
<a id='line_6464'>But swear her first by those dread oaths that tie</a>
<a id='line_6465'>The powers below, the blessed in the sky;</a>
<a id='line_6466'>Lest to thee naked secret fraud be meant,</a>
<a id='line_6467'>Or magic bind thee cold and impotent.</a>
<a id='line_6468'></a>
<a id='line_6469'>"Thus while he spoke, the sovereign plant he drew</a>
<a id='line_6470'>Where on the all-bearing earth unmark'd it grew,</a>
<a id='line_6471'>And show'd its nature and its wondrous power:</a>
<a id='line_6472'>Black was the root, but milky white the flower;</a>
<a id='line_6473'>Moly the name, to mortals hard to find,</a>
<a id='line_6474'>But all is easy to the ethereal kind.</a>
<a id='line_6475'>This Hermes gave, then, gliding off the glade,</a>
<a id='line_6476'>Shot to Olympus from the woodland shade.</a>
<a id='line_6477'>While, full of thought, revolving fates to come,</a>
<a id='line_6478'>I speed my passage to the enchanted dome.</a>

<a id='line_6480'>The lofty gates the goddess wide display'd;</a>
<a id='line_6481'>She leads before, and to the feast invites;</a>
<a id='line_6482'>I follow sadly to the magic rites.</a>
<a id='line_6483'>Radiant with starry studs, a silver seat</a>
<a id='line_6484'>Received my limbs: a footstool eased my feet,</a>
<a id='line_6485'>She mix'd the potion, fraudulent of soul;</a>
<a id='line_6486'>The poison mantled in the golden bowl.</a>
<a id='line_6487'>I took, and quaff'd it, confident in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_6488'>Then waved the wand, and then the word was given.</a>
<a id='line_6489'>'Hence to thy fellows! (dreadful she began:)</a>
<a id='line_6490'>Go, be a beast!'--I heard, and yet was man.</a>
<a id='line_6491'></a>
<a id='line_6492'>"Then, sudden whirling, like a waving flame,</a>
<a id='line_6493'>My beamy falchion, I assault the dame.</a>
<a id='line_6494'>Struck with unusual fear, she trembling cries,</a>
<a id='line_6495'>She faints, she falls; she lifts her weeping eyes.</a>
<a id='line_6496'></a>
<a id='line_6497'>"'What art thou? say! from whence, from whom you came?</a>

<a id='line_6540'>And take the painful sense of toil away.</a>
<a id='line_6541'>A vest and tunic o'er me next she threw,</a>
<a id='line_6542'>Fresh from the bath, and dropping balmy dew;</a>

<a id='line_6831'>THE DESCENT INTO HELL.</a>
<a id='line_6832'></a>
<a id='line_6833'>Ulysses continues his narration. How he arrived at the land of the</a>
<a id='line_6834'>Cimmerians, and what ceremonies he performed to invoke the dead.</a>
<a id='line_6835'>The manner of his descent, and the apparition of the shades: his</a>
<a id='line_6836'>conversation with Elpenor, and with Tiresias, who informs him in a</a>
<a id='line_6837'>prophetic manner of his fortunes to come. He meets his mother</a>
<a id='line_6838'>Anticles, from whom he learns the state of his family. He sees the</a>
<a id='line_6839'>shades of the ancient heroines, afterwards of the heroes, and</a>
<a id='line_6840'>converses in particular with Agamemnon and Achilles. Ajax keeps at</a>
<a id='line_6841'>a sullen distance, and disdains to answer him. He then beholds</a>
<a id='line_6842'>Tityus, Tantalus, Sisyphus, Hercules; till he is deterred from</a>
<a id='line_6843'>further curiosity by the apparition of horrid spectres, and the</a>
<a id='line_6844'>cries of the wicked in torments.</a>
<a id='line_6845'></a>
<a id='line_6846'></a>
<a id='line_6847'></a>
<a id='line_6848'>"Now to the shores we bend, a mournful train,</a>
<a id='line_6849'>Climb the tall bark, and launch into the main;</a>
<a id='line_6850'>At once the mast we rear, at once unbind</a>
<a id='line_6851'>The spacious sheet, and stretch it to the wind;</a>
<a id='line_6852'>Then pale and pensive stand, with cares oppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_6853'>And solemn horror saddens every breast.</a>
<a id='line_6854'>A freshening breeze the magic power supplied,</a>
<a id='line_6855'>While the wing'd vessel flew along the tide;</a>
<a id='line_6856'>Our oars we shipp'd; all day the swelling sails</a>
<a id='line_6857'>Full from the guiding pilot catch'd the gales.</a>
<a id='line_6858'></a>
<a id='line_6859'>"Now sunk the sun from his aerial height,</a>
<a id='line_6860'>And o'er the shaded billows rush'd the night;</a>
<a id='line_6861'>When lo! we reach'd old Ocean's utmost bounds,</a>
<a id='line_6862'>Where rocks control his waves with ever-during mounds.</a>
<a id='line_6863'></a>
<a id='line_6864'>"There in a lonely land, and gloomy cells,</a>
<a id='line_6865'>The dusky nation of Cimmeria dwells;</a>

<a id='line_6867'>When radiant he advances, or retreats:</a>
<a id='line_6868'>Unhappy race! whom endless night invades,</a>
<a id='line_6869'>Clouds the dull air, and wraps them round in shades.</a>
<a id='line_6870'></a>
<a id='line_6871'>"The ship we moor on these obscure abodes;</a>
<a id='line_6872'>Disbark the sheep, an offering to the gods;</a>
<a id='line_6873'>And, hellward bending, o'er the beach descry</a>
<a id='line_6874'>The doleful passage to the infernal sky.</a>
<a id='line_6875'>The victims, vow'd to each Tartarian power,</a>
<a id='line_6876'>Eurylochus and Perimedes bore.</a>
<a id='line_6877'></a>
<a id='line_6878'>"Here open'd hell, all hell I here implored,</a>
<a id='line_6879'>And from the scabbard drew the shining sword:</a>
<a id='line_6880'>And trenching the black earth on every side,</a>
<a id='line_6881'>A cavern form'd, a cubit long and wide.</a>
<a id='line_6882'>New wine, with honey-temper'd milk, we bring,</a>
<a id='line_6883'>Then living waters from the crystal spring:</a>
<a id='line_6884'>O'er these was strew'd the consecrated flour,</a>
<a id='line_6885'>And on the surface shone the holy store.</a>
<a id='line_6886'></a>
<a id='line_6887'>"Now the wan shades we hail, the infernal gods,</a>
<a id='line_6888'>To speed our course, and waft us o'er the floods:</a>
<a id='line_6889'>So shall a barren heifer from the stall</a>
<a id='line_6890'>Beneath the knife upon your altars fall;</a>
<a id='line_6891'>So in our palace, at our safe return,</a>
<a id='line_6892'>Rich with unnumber'd gifts the pile shall burn;</a>
<a id='line_6893'>So shall a ram, the largest of the breed,</a>
<a id='line_6894'>Black as these regions, to Tiresias bleed.</a>
<a id='line_6895'></a>
<a id='line_6896'>"Thus solemn rites and holy vows we paid</a>
<a id='line_6897'>To all the phantom-nations of the dead;</a>
<a id='line_6898'>Then died the sheep: a purple torrent flow'd,</a>
<a id='line_6899'>And all the caverns smoked with streaming blood.</a>
<a id='line_6900'>When lo! appear'd along the dusky coasts,</a>
<a id='line_6901'>Thin, airy shoals of visionary ghosts:</a>
<a id='line_6902'>Fair, pensive youths, and soft enamour'd maids;</a>
<a id='line_6903'>And wither'd elders, pale and wrinkled shades;</a>
<a id='line_6904'>Ghastly with wounds the forms of warriors slain</a>
<a id='line_6905'>Stalk'd with majestic port, a martial train:</a>
<a id='line_6906'>These and a thousand more swarm'd o'er the ground,</a>
<a id='line_6907'>And all the dire assembly shriek'd around.</a>
<a id='line_6908'>Astonish'd at the sight, aghast I stood,</a>
<a id='line_6909'>And a cold fear ran shivering through my blood;</a>
<a id='line_6910'>Straight I command the sacrifice to haste,</a>
<a id='line_6911'>Straight the flay'd victims to the flames are cast,</a>
<a id='line_6912'>And mutter'd vows, and mystic song applied</a>
<a id='line_6913'>To grisly Pluto, and his gloomy bride.</a>
<a id='line_6914'></a>
<a id='line_6915'>"Now swift I waved my falchion o'er the blood;</a>
<a id='line_6916'>Back started the pale throngs, and trembling stood,</a>
<a id='line_6917'>Round the black trench the gore untasted flows,</a>
<a id='line_6918'>Till awful from the shades Tiresias rose.</a>

<a id='line_7910'>Where graze thy herds, illustrious source of day!</a>
<a id='line_7911'>Seven herds, seven flocks enrich the sacred plains,</a>
<a id='line_7912'>Each herd, each flock full fifty heads contains;</a>
<a id='line_7913'>The wondrous kind a length of age survey,</a>
<a id='line_7914'>By breed increase not, nor by death decay.</a>
<a id='line_7915'>Two sister goddesses possess the plain,</a>
<a id='line_7916'>The constant guardian of the woolly train;</a>
<a id='line_7917'>Lampetie fair, and Phaethusa young,</a>
<a id='line_7918'>From Phoebus and the bright Neaea sprung;</a>
<a id='line_7919'>Here, watchful o'er the flocks, in shady bowers</a>
<a id='line_7920'>And flowery meads, they waste the joyous hours.</a>
<a id='line_7921'>Rob not the gods! and so propitious gales</a>
<a id='line_7922'>Attend thy voyage, and impel thy sails;</a>
<a id='line_7923'>But if thy impious hands the flocks destroy,</a>
<a id='line_7924'>The gods, the gods avenge it, and ye die!</a>
<a id='line_7925'>'Tis thine alone (thy friends and navy lost)</a>
<a id='line_7926'>Through tedious toils to view thy native coast.'</a>
<a id='line_7927'></a>
<a id='line_7928'>She ceased: and now arose the morning ray;</a>
<a id='line_7929'>Swift to her dome the goddess held her way.</a>
<a id='line_7930'>Then to my mates I measured back the plain,</a>
<a id='line_7931'>Climb'd the tall bark, and rush'd into the main;</a>
<a id='line_7932'>Then, bending to the stroke, their oars they drew</a>
<a id='line_7933'>To their broad breasts, and swift the galley flew.</a>
<a id='line_7934'>Up sprung a brisker breeze; with freshening gales</a>
<a id='line_7935'>The friendly goddess stretch'd the swelling sails;</a>
<a id='line_7936'>We drop our oars; at ease the pilot guides;</a>
<a id='line_7937'>The vessel light along the level glides.</a>
<a id='line_7938'>When, rising sad and slow, with pensive look,</a>
<a id='line_7939'>Thus to the melancholy train I spoke:</a>
<a id='line_7940'></a>
<a id='line_7941'>"'O friends, oh ever partners of my woes,</a>
<a id='line_7942'>Attend while I what Heaven foredooms disclose.</a>
<a id='line_7943'>Hear all! Fate hangs o'er all; on you it lies</a>
<a id='line_7944'>To live or perish! to be safe, be wise!</a>
<a id='line_7945'></a>
<a id='line_7946'>"'In flowery meads the sportive Sirens play,</a>
<a id='line_7947'>Touch the soft lyre, and tune the vocal lay;</a>
<a id='line_7948'>Me, me alone, with fetters firmly bound,</a>
<a id='line_7949'>The gods allow to hear the dangerous sound.</a>
<a id='line_7950'>Hear and obey; if freedom I demand,</a>
<a id='line_7951'>Be every fetter strain'd, be added band to band.'</a>
<a id='line_7952'></a>
<a id='line_7953'>"While yet I speak the winged galley flies,</a>
<a id='line_7954'>And lo! the Siren shores like mists arise.</a>
<a id='line_7955'>Sunk were at once the winds; the air above,</a>
<a id='line_7956'>And waves below, at once forgot to move;</a>
<a id='line_7957'>Some demon calm'd the air and smooth'd the deep,</a>
<a id='line_7958'>Hush'd the loud winds, and charm'd the waves to sleep.</a>
<a id='line_7959'>Now every sail we furl, each oar we ply;</a>

<a id='line_7961'>The ductile wax with busy hands I mould,</a>
<a id='line_7962'>And cleft in fragments, and the fragments roll'd;</a>
<a id='line_7963'>The aerial region now grew warm with day,</a>
<a id='line_7964'>The wax dissolved beneath the burning ray;</a>
<a id='line_7965'>Then every ear I barr'd against the strain,</a>
<a id='line_7966'>And from access of frenzy lock'd the brain.</a>
<a id='line_7967'>Now round the masts my mates the fetters roll'd,</a>
<a id='line_7968'>And bound me limb by limb with fold on fold.</a>
<a id='line_7969'>Then bending to the stroke, the active train</a>
<a id='line_7970'>Plunge all at once their oars, and cleave the main.</a>
<a id='line_7971'></a>
<a id='line_7972'>"While to the shore the rapid vessel flies,</a>
<a id='line_7973'>Our swift approach the Siren choir descries;</a>
<a id='line_7974'>Celestial music warbles from their tongue,</a>
<a id='line_7975'>And thus the sweet deluders tune the song:</a>
<a id='line_7976'></a>
<a id='line_7977'>"'Oh stay, O pride of Greece! Ulysses, stay!</a>
<a id='line_7978'>Oh cease thy course, and listen to our lay!</a>

<a id='line_7980'>The song instructs the soul, and charms the ear.</a>
<a id='line_7981'>Approach! thy soul shall into raptures rise!</a>
<a id='line_7982'>Approach! and learn new wisdom from the wise!</a>

<a id='line_7985'>Whate'er beneath the sun's bright journey lies.</a>
<a id='line_7986'>Oh stay, and learn new wisdom from the wise!'</a>
<a id='line_7987'></a>
<a id='line_7988'>"Thus the sweet charmers warbled o'er the main;</a>
<a id='line_7989'>My soul takes wing to meet the heavenly strain;</a>

<a id='line_7991'>Swift row my mates, and shoot along the sea;</a>
<a id='line_7992'>New chains they add, and rapid urge the way,</a>
<a id='line_7993'>Till, dying off, the distant sounds decay;</a>
<a id='line_7994'>Then scudding swiftly from the dangerous ground,</a>
<a id='line_7995'>The deafen'd ear unlock'd, the chains unbound.</a>
<a id='line_7996'></a>
<a id='line_7997'>"Now all at once tremendous scenes unfold;</a>

<a id='line_8000'>All trembling, deafen'd, and aghast we stood!</a>
<a id='line_8001'>No more the vessel plough'd the dreadful wave,</a>

<a id='line_8003'>Each dropp'd his oar; but swift from man to man</a>
<a id='line_8004'>With looks serene I turn'd, and thus began:</a>

<a id='line_8010'>Lo! still the same Ulysses is your guide.</a>
<a id='line_8011'>Attend my words! your oars incessant ply;</a>

<a id='line_8015'>And thou, whose guiding hand directs our way,</a>
<a id='line_8016'>Pilot, attentive listen and obey!</a>
<a id='line_8017'>Bear wide thy course, nor plough those angry waves</a>
<a id='line_8018'>Where rolls yon smoke, yon tumbling ocean raves;</a>
<a id='line_8019'>Steer by the higher rock; lest whirl'd around</a>
<a id='line_8020'>We sink, beneath the circling eddy drown'd.'</a>
<a id='line_8021'>While yet I speak, at once their oars they seize,</a>
<a id='line_8022'>Stretch to the stroke, and brush the working seas.</a>
<a id='line_8023'>Cautious the name of Scylla I suppress'd;</a>
<a id='line_8024'>That dreadful sound had chill'd the boldest breast.</a>
<a id='line_8025'></a>
<a id='line_8026'>"Meantime, forgetful of the voice divine,</a>
<a id='line_8027'>All dreadful bright my limbs in armour shine;</a>
<a id='line_8028'>High on the deck I take my dangerous stand,</a>

<a id='line_8030'>Prepared to whirl the whizzing spear I stay,</a>
<a id='line_8031'>Till the fell fiend arise to seize her prey.</a>
<a id='line_8032'>Around the dungeon, studious to behold</a>
<a id='line_8033'>The hideous pest, my labouring eyes I roll'd;</a>
<a id='line_8034'>In vain! the dismal dungeon, dark as night,</a>

<a id='line_8041'>When the tide rushes from her rumbling caves,</a>
<a id='line_8042'>The rough rock roars, tumultuous boil the waves;</a>
<a id='line_8043'>They toss, they foam, a wild confusion raise,</a>
<a id='line_8044'>Like waters bubbling o'er the fiery blaze;</a>
<a id='line_8045'>Eternal mists obscure the aerial plain,</a>
<a id='line_8046'>And high above the rock she spouts the main;</a>
<a id='line_8047'>When in her gulfs the rushing sea subsides,</a>
<a id='line_8048'>She drains the ocean with the refluent tides;</a>
<a id='line_8049'>The rock re-bellows with a thundering sound;</a>
<a id='line_8050'>Deep, wondrous deep, below appears the ground.</a>
<a id='line_8051'></a>
<a id='line_8052'>"Struck with despair, with trembling hearts we view'd</a>
<a id='line_8053'>The yawning dungeon, and the tumbling flood;</a>
<a id='line_8054'>When lo! fierce Scylla stoop'd to seize her prey,</a>
<a id='line_8055'>Stretch'd her dire jaws, and swept six men away.</a>
<a id='line_8056'>Chiefs of renown! loud-echoing shrieks arise;</a>

<a id='line_8058'>They call, and aid with outstretch'd arms implore;</a>
<a id='line_8059'>In vain they call! those arms are stretch'd no more.</a>
<a id='line_8060'>As from some rock that overhangs the flood</a>
<a id='line_8061'>The silent fisher casts the insidious food,</a>
<a id='line_8062'>With fraudful care he waits the finny prize,</a>
<a id='line_8063'>And sudden lifts it quivering to the skies:</a>
<a id='line_8064'>So the foul monster lifts her prey on high,</a>
<a id='line_8065'>So pant the wretches struggling in the sky;</a>
<a id='line_8066'>In the wide dungeon she devours her food,</a>
<a id='line_8067'>And the flesh trembles while she churns the blood.</a>
<a id='line_8068'>Worn as I am with griefs, with care decay'd,</a>
<a id='line_8069'>Never, I never scene so dire survey'd!</a>
<a id='line_8070'>My shivering blood, congeal'd, forgot to flow;</a>

<a id='line_8072'></a>
<a id='line_8073'>"Now from the rocks the rapid vessel flies,</a>
<a id='line_8074'>And the hoarse din like distant thunder dies;</a>

<a id='line_8077'>There, sacred to the radiant god of day,</a>
<a id='line_8078'>Graze the fair herds, the flocks promiscuous stray:</a>
<a id='line_8079'>Then suddenly was heard along the main</a>
<a id='line_8080'>To low the ox, to blest the woolly train.</a>
<a id='line_8081'>Straight to my anxious thoughts the sound convey'd</a>
<a id='line_8082'>The words of Circe and the Theban shade;</a>

<a id='line_8089'>And Circe warn! Oh be their voice obey'd</a>
<a id='line_8090'>Some mighty woe relentless Heaven forebodes:</a>
<a id='line_8091'>Fly these dire regions, and revere the gods!'</a>
<a id='line_8092'></a>
<a id='line_8093'>"While yet I spoke, a sudden sorrow ran</a>
<a id='line_8094'>Through every breast, and spread from man to man,</a>
<a id='line_8095'>Till wrathful thus Eurylochus began:</a>
<a id='line_8096'></a>
<a id='line_8097'>"'O cruel thou! some Fury sure has steel'd</a>

<a id='line_8100'>And cruel' enviest thou a short repose?</a>
<a id='line_8101'>Still must we restless rove, new seas explore,</a>
<a id='line_8102'>The sun descending, and so near the shore?</a>
<a id='line_8103'>And lo! the night begins her groomy reign,</a>
<a id='line_8104'>And doubles all the terrors of the main:</a>
<a id='line_8105'>Oft in the dead of night loud winds rise,</a>
<a id='line_8106'>Lash the wild surge, and bluster in the skies.</a>
<a id='line_8107'>Oh, should the fierce south-west his rage display,</a>
<a id='line_8108'>And toss with rising storms the watery way,</a>
<a id='line_8109'>Though gods descend from heaven's aerial plain</a>
<a id='line_8110'>To lend us aid, the gods descend in vain.</a>

<a id='line_8140'>Air thunders, rolls the ocean, groans the ground.</a>
<a id='line_8141'>All night it raged: when morning rose to land</a>
<a id='line_8142'>We haul'd our bark, and moor'd it on the strand,</a>

<a id='line_8159'>Low through the grove, or touch the flowery plain:</a>
<a id='line_8160'>Then fail'd our food: then fish we make our prey,</a>
<a id='line_8161'>Or fowl that screaming haunt the watery way.</a>
<a id='line_8162'>Till now from sea or flood no succour found,</a>
<a id='line_8163'>Famine and meagre want besieged us round.</a>
<a id='line_8164'>Pensive and pale from grove to grove I stray'd,</a>
<a id='line_8165'>From the loud storms to find a sylvan shade;</a>

<a id='line_8235'></a>
<a id='line_8236'>"To fair Calypso, from the bright abodes,</a>
<a id='line_8237'>Hermes convey'd these counsels of the gods.</a>
<a id='line_8238'></a>
<a id='line_8239'>"Meantime from man to man my tongue exclaims,</a>
<a id='line_8240'>My wrath is kindled, and my soul in flames.</a>
<a id='line_8241'>In vain! I view perform'd the direful deed,</a>
<a id='line_8242'>Beeves, slain in heaps, along the ocean bleed.</a>
<a id='line_8243'></a>
<a id='line_8244'>"Now heaven gave signs of wrath: along the ground</a>
<a id='line_8245'>Crept the raw hides, and with a bellowing sound</a>
<a id='line_8246'>Roar'd the dead limbs; the burning entrails groan'd.</a>
<a id='line_8247'>Six guilty days my wretched mates employ</a>
<a id='line_8248'>In impious feasting, and unhallowed joy;</a>
<a id='line_8249'>The seventh arose, and now the sire of gods</a>
<a id='line_8250'>Rein'd the rough storms; and calm'd the tossing floods:</a>
<a id='line_8251'>With speed the bark we climb; the spacious sails.</a>
<a id='line_8252'>Loosed from the yards invite the impelling gales.</a>
<a id='line_8253'>Past sight of shore, along the surge we bound,</a>
<a id='line_8254'>And all above is sky, and ocean all around;</a>
<a id='line_8255'>When lo! a murky cloud the thunderer forms</a>
<a id='line_8256'>Full o'er our heads, and blackens heaven with storms.</a>
<a id='line_8257'>Night dwells o'er all the deep: and now outflies</a>
<a id='line_8258'>The gloomy west, and whistles in the skies.</a>
<a id='line_8259'>The mountain-billows roar! the furious blast</a>
<a id='line_8260'>Howls o'er the shroud, and rends it from the mast:</a>
<a id='line_8261'>The mast gives way, and, crackling as it bends,</a>
<a id='line_8262'>Tears up the deck; then all at once descends:</a>
<a id='line_8263'>The pilot by the tumbling ruin slain,</a>
<a id='line_8264'>Dash'd from the helm, falls headlong in the main.</a>
<a id='line_8265'>Then Jove in anger bids his thunders roll,</a>
<a id='line_8266'>And forky lightnings flash from pole to pole:</a>
<a id='line_8267'>Fierce at our heads his deadly bolt he aims,</a>
<a id='line_8268'>Red with uncommon wrath, and wrapp'd in flames:</a>
<a id='line_8269'>Full on the bark it fell; now high, now low,</a>
<a id='line_8270'>Toss'd and retoss'd, it reel'd beneath the blow;</a>
<a id='line_8271'>At once into the main the crew it shook:</a>
<a id='line_8272'>Sulphurous odours rose, and smouldering smoke.</a>
<a id='line_8273'>Like fowl that haunt the floods, they sink, they rise,</a>
<a id='line_8274'>Now lost, now seen, with shrieks and dreadful cries;</a>
<a id='line_8275'>And strive to gain the bark, but Jove denies.</a>
<a id='line_8276'>Firm at the helm I stand, when fierce the main</a>
<a id='line_8277'>Rush'd with dire noise, and dash'd the sides in twain;</a>
<a id='line_8278'>Again impetuous drove the furious blast,</a>
<a id='line_8279'>Snapp'd the strong helm, and bore to sea the mast.</a>
<a id='line_8280'>Firm to the mast with cords the helm I bind,</a>
<a id='line_8281'>And ride aloft, to Providence resign'd,</a>
<a id='line_8282'>Through tumbling billows and a war of wind.</a>
<a id='line_8283'>"Now sunk the west, and now a southern breeze,</a>
<a id='line_8284'>More dreadful than the tempest lash'd the seas;</a>
<a id='line_8285'>For on the rocks it bore where Scylla raves,</a>
<a id='line_8286'>And dire Charybdis rolls her thundering waves.</a>
<a id='line_8287'>All night I drove; and at the dawn of day,</a>
<a id='line_8288'>Fast by the rocks beheld the desperate way;</a>
<a id='line_8289'>Just when the sea within her gulfs subsides,</a>
<a id='line_8290'>And in the roaring whirlpools rush the tides,</a>
<a id='line_8291'>Swift from the float I vaulted with a bound,</a>
<a id='line_8292'>The lofty fig-tree seized, and clung around;</a>
<a id='line_8293'>So to the beam the bat tenacious clings,</a>
<a id='line_8294'>And pendent round it clasps his leather wings.</a>
<a id='line_8295'>High in the air the tree its boughs display'd,</a>
<a id='line_8296'>And o'er the dungeon cast a dreadful shade;</a>
<a id='line_8297'>All unsustain'd between the wave and sky,</a>
<a id='line_8298'>Beneath my feet the whirling billows fly.</a>
<a id='line_8299'>What time the judge forsakes the noisy bar</a>
<a id='line_8300'>To take repast, and stills the wordy war,</a>
<a id='line_8301'>Charybdis, rumbling from her inmost caves,</a>
<a id='line_8302'>The mast refunded on her refluent waves.</a>
<a id='line_8303'>Swift from the tree, the floating mass to gain,</a>
<a id='line_8304'>Sudden I dropp'd amidst the flashing main;</a>
<a id='line_8305'>Once more undaunted on the ruin rode,</a>
<a id='line_8306'>And oar'd with labouring arms along the flood.</a>
<a id='line_8307'>Unseen I pass'd by Scylla's dire abodes.</a>
<a id='line_8308'>So Jove decreed (dread sire of men and gods).</a>
<a id='line_8309'>Then nine long days I plow'd the calmer seas,</a>
<a id='line_8310'>Heaved by the surge, and wafted by the breeze.</a>
<a id='line_8311'>Weary and wet the Ogygian shores I gain,</a>
<a id='line_8312'>When the tenth sun descended to the main.</a>
<a id='line_8313'>There, in Calypso's ever-fragrant bowers,</a>
<a id='line_8314'>Refresh'd I lay, and joy beguiled the hours.</a>
<a id='line_8315'>"My following fates to thee, O king, are known,</a>
<a id='line_8316'>And the bright partner of thy royal throne.</a>

<a id='line_8325'></a>
<a id='line_8326'>THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.</a>
<a id='line_8327'></a>
<a id='line_8328'>Ulysses takes his leave of Alcinous and Arete, and embarks in the</a>
<a id='line_8329'>evening. Next morning the ship arrives at Ithaca; where the</a>
<a id='line_8330'>sailors, as Ulysses is yet sleeping, lay him on the shore with all</a>
<a id='line_8331'>his treasures. On their return, Neptune changes their ship into a</a>
<a id='line_8332'>rock. In the meantime Ulysses, awaking, knows not his native</a>
<a id='line_8333'>Ithaca, by reason of a mist which Pallas had cast around him. He</a>
<a id='line_8334'>breaks into loud lamentations; till the goddess appearing to him</a>
<a id='line_8335'>in the form of a shepherd, discovers the country to him, and</a>
<a id='line_8336'>points out the particular places. He then tells a feigned story of</a>
<a id='line_8337'>his adventures, upon which she manifests herself, and they consult</a>
<a id='line_8338'>together of the measures to be taken to destroy the suitors. To</a>
<a id='line_8339'>conceal his return, and disguise his person the more effectually,</a>
<a id='line_8340'>she changes him into the figure of an old beggar.</a>
<a id='line_8341'></a>
<a id='line_8342'></a>
<a id='line_8343'></a>
<a id='line_8344'>He ceased; but left so pleasing on their ear</a>
<a id='line_8345'>His voice, that listening still they seem'd to hear.</a>
<a id='line_8346'>A pause of silence hush'd the shady rooms:</a>
<a id='line_8347'>The grateful conference then the king resumes:</a>
<a id='line_8348'></a>
<a id='line_8349'>"Whatever toils the great Ulysses pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_8350'>Beneath this happy roof they end at last;</a>
<a id='line_8351'>No longer now from shore to shore to roam,</a>
<a id='line_8352'>Smooth seas and gentle winds invite him home.</a>
<a id='line_8353'>But hear me, princes! whom these walls inclose,</a>
<a id='line_8354'>For whom my chanter sings: and goblet flows</a>
<a id='line_8355'>With wine unmix'd (an honour due to age,</a>
<a id='line_8356'>To cheer the grave, and warm the poet's rage);</a>
<a id='line_8357'>Though labour'd gold and many a dazzling vest</a>
<a id='line_8358'>Lie heap'd already for our godlike guest;</a>
<a id='line_8359'>Without new treasures let him not remove,</a>
<a id='line_8360'>Large, and expressive of the public love:</a>
<a id='line_8361'>Each peer a tripod, each a vase bestow,</a>
<a id='line_8362'>A general tribute, which the state shall owe."</a>
<a id='line_8363'></a>
<a id='line_8364'>This sentence pleased: then all their steps address'd</a>
<a id='line_8365'>To separate mansions, and retired to rest.</a>
<a id='line_8366'></a>
<a id='line_8367'>Now did the rosy-finger'd morn arise,</a>
<a id='line_8368'>And shed her sacred light along the skies.</a>
<a id='line_8369'>Down to the haven and the ships in haste</a>
<a id='line_8370'>They bore the treasures, and in safety placed.</a>
<a id='line_8371'>The king himself the vases ranged with care;</a>
<a id='line_8372'>Then bade his followers to the feast prepare.</a>
<a id='line_8373'>A victim ox beneath the sacred hand</a>
<a id='line_8374'>Of great Alcinous falls, and stains the sand.</a>
<a id='line_8375'>To Jove the Eternal (power above all powers!</a>
<a id='line_8376'>Who wings the winds, and darkens heaven with showers)</a>
<a id='line_8377'>The flames ascend: till evening they prolong</a>
<a id='line_8378'>The rites, more sacred made by heavenly song;</a>
<a id='line_8379'>For in the midst, with public honours graced,</a>
<a id='line_8380'>Thy lyre divine, Demodocus! was placed.</a>
<a id='line_8381'>All, but Ulysses, heard with fix'd delight;</a>
<a id='line_8382'>He sate, and eyed the sun, and wish'd the night;</a>
<a id='line_8383'>Slow seem'd the sun to move, the hours to roll,</a>
<a id='line_8384'>His native home deep-imaged in his soul.</a>
<a id='line_8385'>As the tired ploughman, spent with stubborn toil,</a>
<a id='line_8386'>Whose oxen long have torn the furrow'd soil,</a>
<a id='line_8387'>Sees with delight the sun's declining ray,</a>
<a id='line_8388'>When home with feeble knees he bends his way</a>
<a id='line_8389'>To late repast (the day's hard labour done);</a>
<a id='line_8390'>So to Ulysses welcome set the sun;</a>
<a id='line_8391'>Then instant to Alcinous and the rest</a>
<a id='line_8392'>(The Scherian states) he turn'd, and thus address'd:</a>
<a id='line_8393'></a>
<a id='line_8394'>"O thou, the first in merit and command!</a>
<a id='line_8395'>And you the peers and princes of the land!</a>
<a id='line_8396'>May every joy be yours! nor this the least,</a>
<a id='line_8397'>When due libation shall have crown'd the feast,</a>
<a id='line_8398'>Safe to my home to send your happy guest.</a>
<a id='line_8399'>Complete are now the bounties you have given,</a>
<a id='line_8400'>Be all those bounties but confirm'd by Heaven!</a>
<a id='line_8401'>So may I find, when all my wanderings cease,</a>
<a id='line_8402'>My consort blameless, and my friends in peace.</a>
<a id='line_8403'>On you be every bliss; and every day,</a>
<a id='line_8404'>In home-felt joys, delighted roll away;</a>
<a id='line_8405'>Yourselves, your wives, your long-descending race,</a>
<a id='line_8406'>May every god enrich with every grace!</a>
<a id='line_8407'>Sure fix'd on virtue may your nation stand,</a>
<a id='line_8408'>And public evil never touch the land!"</a>
<a id='line_8409'></a>
<a id='line_8410'>His words well weigh'd, the general voice approved</a>
<a id='line_8411'>Benign, and instant his dismission moved,</a>
<a id='line_8412'>The monarch to Pontonus gave the sign.</a>
<a id='line_8413'>To fill the goblet high with rosy wine;</a>
<a id='line_8414'>"Great Jove the Father first (he cried) implore;'</a>
<a id='line_8415'>Then send the stranger to his native shore."</a>
<a id='line_8416'></a>
<a id='line_8417'>The luscious wine the obedient herald brought;</a>
<a id='line_8418'>Around the mansion flow'd the purple draught;</a>
<a id='line_8419'>Each from his seat to each immortal pours,</a>
<a id='line_8420'>Whom glory circles in the Olympian bowers</a>
<a id='line_8421'>Ulysses sole with air majestic stands,</a>
<a id='line_8422'>The bowl presenting to Arete's hands;</a>
<a id='line_8423'>Then thus: "O queen, farewell! be still possess'd</a>
<a id='line_8424'>Of dear remembrance, blessing still and bless'd!</a>
<a id='line_8425'>Till age and death shall gently call thee hence,</a>
<a id='line_8426'>(Sure fate of every mortal excellence!)</a>
<a id='line_8427'>Farewell! and joys successive ever spring</a>
<a id='line_8428'>To thee, to thine, the people, and the king!"</a>
<a id='line_8429'></a>
<a id='line_8430'>Thus he: then parting prints the sandy shore</a>
<a id='line_8431'>To the fair port: a herald march'd before,</a>
<a id='line_8432'>Sent by Alcinous; of Arete's train</a>
<a id='line_8433'>Three chosen maids attend him to the main;</a>
<a id='line_8434'>This does a tunic and white vest convey,</a>
<a id='line_8435'>A various casket that, of rich inlay,</a>
<a id='line_8436'>And bread and wine the third. The cheerful mates</a>
<a id='line_8437'>Safe in the hollow poop dispose the cates;</a>
<a id='line_8438'>Upon the deck soft painted robes they spread</a>
<a id='line_8439'>With linen cover'd, for the hero's bed.</a>
<a id='line_8440'>He climbed the lofty stern; then gently press'd</a>
<a id='line_8441'>The swelling couch, and lay composed to rest.</a>
<a id='line_8442'></a>
<a id='line_8443'>Now placed in order, the Phaeacian train</a>
<a id='line_8444'>Their cables loose, and launch into the main;</a>
<a id='line_8445'>At once they bend, and strike their equal oars,</a>
<a id='line_8446'>And leave the sinking hills and lessening shores.</a>
<a id='line_8447'>While on the deck the chief in silence lies,</a>
<a id='line_8448'>And pleasing slumbers steal upon his eyes.</a>
<a id='line_8449'>As fiery coursers in the rapid race</a>
<a id='line_8450'>Urged by fierce drivers through the dusty space,</a>
<a id='line_8451'>Toss their high heads, and scour along the plain,</a>
<a id='line_8452'>So mounts the bounding vessel o'er the main.</a>
<a id='line_8453'>Back to the stern the parted billows flow,</a>
<a id='line_8454'>And the black ocean foams and roars below.</a>
<a id='line_8455'></a>
<a id='line_8456'>Thus with spread sails the winged galley flies;</a>
<a id='line_8457'>Less swift an eagle cuts the liquid skies;</a>
<a id='line_8458'>Divine Ulysses was her sacred load,</a>
<a id='line_8459'>A man, in wisdom equal to a god!</a>
<a id='line_8460'>Much danger, long and mighty toils he bore,</a>
<a id='line_8461'>In storms by sea, and combats on the shore;</a>
<a id='line_8462'>All which soft sleep now banish'd from his breast,</a>
<a id='line_8463'>Wrapp'd in a pleasing, deep, and death-like rest.</a>
<a id='line_8464'></a>
<a id='line_8465'>But when the morning-star with early ray</a>
<a id='line_8466'>Flamed in the front of heaven, and promised day;</a>
<a id='line_8467'>Like distant clouds the mariner descries</a>
<a id='line_8468'>Fair Ithaca's emerging hills arise.</a>
<a id='line_8469'>Far from the town a spacious port appears,</a>
<a id='line_8470'>Sacred to Phorcys' power, whose name it bears;</a>
<a id='line_8471'>Two craggy rocks projecting to the main,</a>
<a id='line_8472'>The roaring wind's tempestuous rage restrain;</a>
<a id='line_8473'>Within the waves in softer murmurs glide,</a>
<a id='line_8474'>And ships secure without their halsers ride.</a>
<a id='line_8475'>High at the head a branching olive grows,</a>
<a id='line_8476'>And crowns the pointed cliffs with shady boughs.</a>
<a id='line_8477'>Beneath, a gloomy grotto's cool recess</a>
<a id='line_8478'>Delights the Nereids of the neighbouring seas,</a>
<a id='line_8479'>Where bowls and urns were form'd of living stone,</a>
<a id='line_8480'>And massy beams in native marble shone,</a>
<a id='line_8481'>On which the labours of the nymphs were roll'd,</a>
<a id='line_8482'>Their webs divine of purple mix'd with gold.</a>
<a id='line_8483'>Within the cave the clustering bees attend</a>
<a id='line_8484'>Their waxen works, or from the roof depend.</a>
<a id='line_8485'>Perpetual waters o'er the pavement glide;</a>
<a id='line_8486'>Two marble doors unfold on either side;</a>
<a id='line_8487'>Sacred the south, by which the gods descend;</a>
<a id='line_8488'>But mortals enter at the northern end.</a>
<a id='line_8489'>Thither they bent, and haul'd their ship to land</a>
<a id='line_8490'>(The crooked keel divides the yellow sand).</a>
<a id='line_8491'>Ulysses sleeping on his couch they bore,</a>
<a id='line_8492'>And gently placed him on the rocky shore.</a>
<a id='line_8493'>His treasures next, Alcinous' gifts, they laid</a>
<a id='line_8494'>In the wild olive's unfrequented shade,</a>
<a id='line_8495'>Secure from theft; then launch'd the bark again,</a>
<a id='line_8496'>Resumed their oars, and measured back the main,</a>
<a id='line_8497'>Nor yet forgot old Ocean's dread supreme,</a>
<a id='line_8498'>The vengeance vow'd for eyeless Polypheme.</a>
<a id='line_8499'>Before the throne of mighty Jove lie stood,</a>
<a id='line_8500'>And sought the secret counsels of the god.</a>
<a id='line_8501'></a>
<a id='line_8502'>"Shall then no more, O sire of gods! be mine</a>
<a id='line_8503'>The rights and honours of a power divine?</a>

<a id='line_8517'>To whom the Father of the immortal powers,</a>
<a id='line_8518'>Who swells the clouds, and gladdens earth with showers,</a>

<a id='line_8526'>He said. The shaker of the earth replies:</a>

<a id='line_8531'>No more unlicensed thus to brave the main.</a>

<a id='line_8543'>Swift as a swallow sweeps the liquid way,</a>
<a id='line_8544'>The winged pinnace shot along the sea.</a>
<a id='line_8545'>The god arrests her with a sudden stroke,</a>

<a id='line_8549'>What hands unseen the rapid bark restrain!</a>
<a id='line_8550'>And yet it swims, or seems to swim, the main!</a>
<a id='line_8551'>Thus they, unconscious of the deed divine;</a>

<a id='line_8581'>Meanwhile Ulysses in his country lay,</a>
<a id='line_8582'>Released from sleep, and round him might survey</a>
<a id='line_8583'>The solitary shore and rolling sea.</a>
<a id='line_8584'>Yet had his mind through tedious absence lost</a>
<a id='line_8585'>The dear resemblance of his native coast;</a>
<a id='line_8586'>Besides, Minerva, to secure her care,</a>
<a id='line_8587'>Diffused around a veil of thickened air;</a>
<a id='line_8588'>For so the gods ordain'd to keep unseen</a>
<a id='line_8589'>His royal person from his friends and queen;</a>
<a id='line_8590'>Till the proud suitors for their crimes afford</a>
<a id='line_8591'>An ample vengeance to their injured lord.</a>
<a id='line_8592'></a>
<a id='line_8593'>Now all the land another prospect bore,</a>
<a id='line_8594'>Another port appear'd, another shore.</a>
<a id='line_8595'>And long-continued ways, and winding floods,</a>
<a id='line_8596'>And unknown mountains, crown'd with unknown woods</a>
<a id='line_8597'>Pensive and slow, with sudden grief oppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_8598'>The king arose, and beat his careful breast,</a>
<a id='line_8599'>Cast a long look o'er all the coast and main,</a>
<a id='line_8600'>And sought, around, his native realm in vain;</a>
<a id='line_8601'>Then with erected eyes stood fix'd in woe,</a>
<a id='line_8602'>And as he spoke, the tears began to flow.</a>

<a id='line_8604'>"Ye gods (he cried), upon what barren coast,</a>
<a id='line_8605'>In what new region, is Ulysses toss'd?</a>

<a id='line_8607'>Or men whose bosom tender pity warms?</a>
<a id='line_8608'>Where shall this treasure now in safely be?</a>
<a id='line_8609'>And whither, whither its sad owner fly?</a>
<a id='line_8610'>Ah, why did I Alcinous' grace implore?</a>
<a id='line_8611'>Ah, why forsake Phaeacia's happy shore?</a>
<a id='line_8612'>Some juster prince perhaps had entertain'd,</a>
<a id='line_8613'>And safe restored me to my native land.</a>
<a id='line_8614'>Is this the promised, long-expected coast,</a>
<a id='line_8615'>And this the faith Phaeacia's rulers boast?</a>
<a id='line_8616'>O righteous gods! of all the great, how few</a>

<a id='line_8618'>But he, the power to whose all-seeing eyes</a>
<a id='line_8619'>The deeds of men appear without disguise,</a>

<a id='line_8623'>Their faith is mine; the rest belongs to Jove."</a>
<a id='line_8624'></a>
<a id='line_8625'>Then on the sands he ranged his wealthy store,</a>
<a id='line_8626'>The gold, the vests, the tripods number'd o'er:</a>
<a id='line_8627'>All these he found, but still in error lost,</a>
<a id='line_8628'>Disconsolate he wanders on the coast,</a>
<a id='line_8629'>Sighs for his country, and laments again</a>
<a id='line_8630'>To the deaf rocks, and hoarse-resounding main.</a>
<a id='line_8631'>When lo! the guardian goddess of the wise,</a>
<a id='line_8632'>Celestial Pallas, stood before his eyes;</a>
<a id='line_8633'>In show a youthful swain, of form divine,</a>
<a id='line_8634'>Who seem'd descended from some princely line.</a>
<a id='line_8635'>A graceful robe her slender body dress'd;</a>
<a id='line_8636'>Around her shoulders flew the waving vest;</a>
<a id='line_8637'>Her decent hand a shining javelin bore,</a>
<a id='line_8638'>And painted sandals on her feet she wore.</a>
<a id='line_8639'>To whom the king: "Whoe'er of human race</a>
<a id='line_8640'>Thou art, that wanderest in this desert place,</a>
<a id='line_8641'>With joy to thee, as to some god I bend,</a>

<a id='line_8644'>What air I breathe, what country I survey?</a>
<a id='line_8645'>The fruitful continent's extremest bound,</a>
<a id='line_8646'>Or some fair isle which Neptune's arms surround?</a>

<a id='line_8648'>"From what far clime (said she) remote from fame</a>
<a id='line_8649'>Arrivest thou here, a stranger to our name?</a>

<a id='line_8652'>Nor those that placed beneath his utmost reign</a>
<a id='line_8653'>Behold him sinking in the western main.</a>
<a id='line_8654'>The rugged soil allows no level space</a>
<a id='line_8655'>For flying chariots, or the rapid race;</a>
<a id='line_8656'>Yet, not ungrateful to the peasant's pain,</a>
<a id='line_8657'>Suffices fulness to the swelling grain;</a>
<a id='line_8658'>The loaded trees their various fruits produce,</a>
<a id='line_8659'>And clustering grapes afford a generous juice;</a>
<a id='line_8660'>Woods crown our mountains, and in every grove</a>
<a id='line_8661'>The bounding goats and frisking heifers rove;</a>
<a id='line_8662'>Soft rains and kindly dews refresh the field,</a>
<a id='line_8663'>And rising springs eternal verdure yield.</a>
<a id='line_8664'>E'en to those shores is Ithaca renown'd,</a>
<a id='line_8665'>Where Troy's majestic ruins strew the ground."</a>
<a id='line_8666'></a>
<a id='line_8667'>At this, the chief with transport was possess'd;</a>
<a id='line_8668'>His panting heart exulted in his breast;</a>
<a id='line_8669'>Yet, well dissembling his untimely joys,</a>
<a id='line_8670'>And veiling truth in plausible disguise,</a>
<a id='line_8671'>Thus, with an air sincere, in fiction bold,</a>
<a id='line_8672'>His ready tale the inventive hero told:</a>
<a id='line_8673'></a>
<a id='line_8674'>"Oft have I heard in Crete this island's name;</a>
<a id='line_8675'>For 'twas from Crete, my native soil, I came,</a>
<a id='line_8676'>Self-banished thence.  I sail'd before the wind,</a>
<a id='line_8677'>And left my children and my friends behind.</a>
<a id='line_8678'>From fierce Idomeneus' revenge I flew,</a>
<a id='line_8679'>Whose son, the swift Orsilochus, I slew</a>
<a id='line_8680'>(With brutal force he seized my Trojan prey,</a>
<a id='line_8681'>Due to the toils of many a bloody day).</a>
<a id='line_8682'>Unseen I 'scaped, and favour'd by the night,</a>
<a id='line_8683'>In a Phoenician vessel took my flight,</a>
<a id='line_8684'>For Pyle or Elis bound; but tempests toss'd</a>
<a id='line_8685'>And raging billows drove us on your coast.</a>
<a id='line_8686'>In dead of night an unknown port we gain'd;</a>
<a id='line_8687'>Spent with fatigue, and slept secure on land.</a>
<a id='line_8688'>But ere the rosy morn renew'd the day,</a>
<a id='line_8689'>While in the embrace of pleasing sleep I lay,</a>
<a id='line_8690'>Sudden, invited by auspicious gales,</a>
<a id='line_8691'>They land my goods, and hoist their flying sails.</a>
<a id='line_8692'>Abandon'd here, my fortune I deplore</a>
<a id='line_8693'>A hapless exile on a foreign shore,"</a>
<a id='line_8694'></a>
<a id='line_8695'>Thus while he spoke, the blue-eyed maid began</a>
<a id='line_8696'>With pleasing smiles to view the godlike man;</a>
<a id='line_8697'>Then changed her form: and now, divinely bright,</a>
<a id='line_8698'>Jove's heavenly daughter stood confess'd to sight;</a>
<a id='line_8699'>Like a fair virgin in her beauty's bloom,</a>
<a id='line_8700'>Skill'd in the illustrious labours of the loom.</a>
<a id='line_8701'></a>
<a id='line_8702'>"O still the same Ulysses! (she rejoin'd,)</a>
<a id='line_8703'>In useful craft successfully refined!</a>
<a id='line_8704'>Artful in speech, in action, and in mind!</a>
<a id='line_8705'>Sufficed it not, that, thy long labours pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_8706'>Secure thou seest thy native shore at last?</a>
<a id='line_8707'>But this to me? who, like thyself, excel</a>

<a id='line_8721'>Yield to the force of unresisted Fate,</a>
<a id='line_8722'>And bear unmoved the wrongs of base mankind,</a>
<a id='line_8723'>The last, and hardest, conquest of the mind."</a>
<a id='line_8724'></a>
<a id='line_8725'>"Goddess of wisdom! (Ithacus replies,)</a>
<a id='line_8726'>He who discerns thee must be truly wise,</a>
<a id='line_8727'>So seldom view'd and ever in disguise!</a>
<a id='line_8728'>When the bold Argives led their warring powers,</a>
<a id='line_8729'>Against proud Ilion's well-defended towers,</a>
<a id='line_8730'>Ulysses was thy care, celestial maid!</a>
<a id='line_8731'>Graced with thy sight, and favoured with thy aid.</a>
<a id='line_8732'>But when the Trojan piles in ashes lay,</a>
<a id='line_8733'>And bound for Greece we plough'd the watery way;</a>
<a id='line_8734'>Our fleet dispersed, and driven from coast to coast,</a>
<a id='line_8735'>Thy sacred presence from that hour I lost;</a>
<a id='line_8736'>Till I beheld thy radiant form once more,</a>
<a id='line_8737'>And heard thy counsels on Phaeacia's shore.</a>
<a id='line_8738'>But, by the almighty author of thy race,</a>
<a id='line_8739'>Tell me, oh tell, is this my native place?</a>
<a id='line_8740'>For much I fear, long tracts of land and sea</a>
<a id='line_8741'>Divide this coast from distant Ithaca;</a>
<a id='line_8742'>The sweet delusion kindly you impose,</a>
<a id='line_8743'>To soothe my hopes, and mitigate my woes."</a>
<a id='line_8744'></a>
<a id='line_8745'>Thus he. The blue-eyed goddess thus replies;</a>
<a id='line_8746'>"How prone to doubt, how cautious are the wise!</a>
<a id='line_8747'>Who, versed in fortune, fear the flattering show,</a>
<a id='line_8748'>And taste not half the bliss the gods bestow.</a>
<a id='line_8749'>The more shall Pallas aid thy just desires,</a>
<a id='line_8750'>And guard the wisdom which herself inspires.</a>
<a id='line_8751'>Others long absent from their native place,</a>
<a id='line_8752'>Straight seek their home, and fly with eager pace</a>
<a id='line_8753'>To their wives' arms, and children's dear embrace.</a>
<a id='line_8754'>Not thus Ulysses; he decrees to prove</a>
<a id='line_8755'>His subjects' faith, and queen's suspected love;</a>
<a id='line_8756'>Who mourn'd her lord twice ten revolving years,</a>
<a id='line_8757'>And wastes the days in grief, the nights in tears.</a>
<a id='line_8758'>But Pallas knew (thy friends and navy lost)</a>
<a id='line_8759'>Once more 'twas given thee to behold thy coast;</a>
<a id='line_8760'>Yet how could I with adverse Fate engage,</a>
<a id='line_8761'>And mighty Neptune's unrelenting rage?</a>
<a id='line_8762'>Now lift thy longing eyes, while I restore</a>
<a id='line_8763'>The pleasing prospect of thy native shore.</a>
<a id='line_8764'>Bebold the port of Phorcys! fenced around</a>
<a id='line_8765'>With rocky mountains, and with olives crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_8766'>Behold the gloomy grot! whose cool recess</a>
<a id='line_8767'>Delights the Nereids of the neighbouring seas;</a>
<a id='line_8768'>Whose now-neglected altars in thy reign</a>
<a id='line_8769'>Blush'd with the blood of sheep and oxen slain,</a>
<a id='line_8770'>Behold! where Neritus the clouds divides,</a>
<a id='line_8771'>And shakes the waving forests on his sides."</a>
<a id='line_8772'></a>
<a id='line_8773'>So spake the goddess; and the prospect clear'd,</a>
<a id='line_8774'>The mists dispersed, and all the coast appeared.</a>
<a id='line_8775'>The king with joy confess'd his place of birth,</a>
<a id='line_8776'>And on his knees salutes his mother earth;</a>
<a id='line_8777'>Then, with his suppliant hands upheld in air,</a>
<a id='line_8778'>Thus to the sea-green sisters sends his prayer;</a>
<a id='line_8779'></a>
<a id='line_8780'>"All hail! ye virgin daughters of the main!</a>
<a id='line_8781'>Ye streams, beyond my hopes, beheld again!</a>

<a id='line_8784'>If Jove prolong my days, and Pallas crown</a>
<a id='line_8785'>The growing virtues of my youthful son,</a>
<a id='line_8786'>To you shall rites divine be ever paid,</a>
<a id='line_8787'>And grateful offerings on your altars laid."</a>
<a id='line_8788'></a>
<a id='line_8789'>Thus then Minerva: "From that anxious breast</a>
<a id='line_8790'>Dismiss those cares, and leave to heaven the rest.</a>
<a id='line_8791'>Our task be now thy treasured stores to save,</a>
<a id='line_8792'>Deep in the close recesses of the cave;</a>
<a id='line_8793'>Then future means consult." She spoke, and trod</a>
<a id='line_8794'>The shady grot, that brighten'd with the god.</a>
<a id='line_8795'>The closest caverns of the grot she sought;</a>
<a id='line_8796'>The gold, the brass, the robes, Ulysses brought;</a>
<a id='line_8797'>These in the secret gloom the chief disposed;</a>
<a id='line_8798'>The entrance with a rock the goddess closed.</a>
<a id='line_8799'></a>
<a id='line_8800'>Now, seated in the olive's sacred shade,</a>
<a id='line_8801'>Confer the hero and the martial maid.</a>
<a id='line_8802'>The goddess of the azure eyes began:</a>
<a id='line_8803'>"Son of Laertes! much-experienced man!</a>
<a id='line_8804'>The suitor-train thy earliest care demand,</a>
<a id='line_8805'>Of that luxurious race to rid the land;</a>

<a id='line_8807'>And proud addresses to the matchless queen.</a>
<a id='line_8808'>But she thy absence mourns from day to day,</a>
<a id='line_8809'>And inly bleeds, and silent wastes away;</a>
<a id='line_8810'>Elusive of the bridal hour, she gives</a>
<a id='line_8811'>Fond hopes to all, and all with hopes deceives."</a>
<a id='line_8812'></a>
<a id='line_8813'>To this Ulysses: "O celestial maid!</a>
<a id='line_8814'>Praised be thy counsel, and thy timely aid;</a>
<a id='line_8815'>Else had I seen my native walls in vain,</a>
<a id='line_8816'>Like great Atrides, just restored and slain.</a>

<a id='line_8819'>Then, then be present, and my soul inspire,</a>

<a id='line_8895'>BOOK XIV.</a>
<a id='line_8896'></a>
<a id='line_8897'>ARGUMENT.</a>
<a id='line_8898'></a>
<a id='line_8899'>THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.</a>
<a id='line_8900'></a>
<a id='line_8901'>Ulysses arrives in disguise at the house of Eumaeus, where he is</a>
<a id='line_8902'>received, entertained, and lodged with the utmost hospitality. The</a>
<a id='line_8903'>several discourses of that faithful old servant, with the feigned</a>
<a id='line_8904'>story told by Ulysses to conceal himself, and other conversations</a>
<a id='line_8905'>on various subjects, take up this entire book.</a>
<a id='line_8906'></a>
<a id='line_8907'></a>
<a id='line_8908'></a>
<a id='line_8909'>But he, deep-musing, o'er the mountains stray'd</a>
<a id='line_8910'>Through mazy thickets of the woodland shade,</a>
<a id='line_8911'>And cavern'd ways, the shaggy coast along</a>
<a id='line_8912'>With cliffs and nodding forests overhung.</a>
<a id='line_8913'>Eumaeus at his sylvan lodge he sought,</a>
<a id='line_8914'>A faithful servant, and without a fault.</a>
<a id='line_8915'>Ulysses found him busied as he sate</a>
<a id='line_8916'>Before the threshold of his rustic gate;</a>
<a id='line_8917'>Around the mansion in a circle shone</a>
<a id='line_8918'>A rural portico of rugged stone</a>
<a id='line_8919'>(In absence of his lord with honest toil</a>
<a id='line_8920'>His own industrious hands had raised the pile).</a>
<a id='line_8921'>The wall was stone from neighbouring quarries borne,</a>
<a id='line_8922'>Encircled with a fence of native thorn,</a>
<a id='line_8923'>And strong with pales, by many a weary stroke</a>
<a id='line_8924'>Of stubborn labour hewn from heart of oak:</a>
<a id='line_8925'>Frequent and thick. Within the space were rear'd</a>
<a id='line_8926'>Twelve ample cells, the lodgments of his herd.</a>
<a id='line_8927'>Full fifty pregnant females each contain'd;</a>
<a id='line_8928'>The males without (a smaller race) remain'd;</a>
<a id='line_8929'>Doom'd to supply the suitors' wasteful feast,</a>
<a id='line_8930'>A stock by daily luxury decreased;</a>
<a id='line_8931'>Now scarce four hundred left. These to defend,</a>
<a id='line_8932'>Four savage dogs, a watchful guard, attend.</a>
<a id='line_8933'>Here sat Eumaeus, and his cares applied</a>
<a id='line_8934'>To form strong buskins of well-season'd hide.</a>
<a id='line_8935'>Of four assistants who his labour share,</a>
<a id='line_8936'>Three now were absent on the rural care;</a>
<a id='line_8937'>The fourth drove victims to a suitor train:</a>
<a id='line_8938'>But he, of ancient faith, a simple swain,</a>
<a id='line_8939'>Sigh'd, while he furnish'd the luxurious board,</a>
<a id='line_8940'>And wearied Heaven with wishes for his lord.</a>
<a id='line_8941'></a>
<a id='line_8942'>Soon as Ulysses near the inclosure drew,</a>
<a id='line_8943'>With open mouths the furious mastiffs flew:</a>
<a id='line_8944'>Down sat the sage, and cautious to withstand,</a>
<a id='line_8945'>Let fall the offensive truncheon from his hand.</a>
<a id='line_8946'>Sudden, the master runs; aloud he calls;</a>
<a id='line_8947'>And from his hasty hand the leather falls:</a>
<a id='line_8948'>With showers of stones he drives then far away:</a>
<a id='line_8949'>The scattering dogs around at distance bay.</a>
<a id='line_8950'></a>
<a id='line_8951'>"Unhappy stranger! (thus the faithful swain</a>
<a id='line_8952'>Began with accent gracious and humane),</a>
<a id='line_8953'>What sorrow had been mine, if at my gate</a>
<a id='line_8954'>Thy reverend age had met a shameful fate!</a>
<a id='line_8955'>Enough of woes already have I known;</a>
<a id='line_8956'>Enough my master's sorrows and my own.</a>
<a id='line_8957'>While here (ungrateful task!) his herds I feed,</a>
<a id='line_8958'>Ordain'd for lawless rioters to bleed!</a>
<a id='line_8959'>Perhaps, supported at another's board!</a>
<a id='line_8960'>Far from his country roams my hapless lord;</a>
<a id='line_8961'>Or sigh'd in exile forth his latest breath,</a>
<a id='line_8962'>Now cover'd with the eternal shade of death!</a>
<a id='line_8963'></a>
<a id='line_8964'>"But enter this my homely roof, and see</a>
<a id='line_8965'>Our woods not void of hospitality.</a>
<a id='line_8966'>Then tell me whence thou art, and what the share</a>
<a id='line_8967'>Of woes and wanderings thou wert born to bear."</a>
<a id='line_8968'></a>
<a id='line_8969'>He said, and, seconding the kind request,</a>
<a id='line_8970'>With friendly step precedes his unknown guest.</a>
<a id='line_8971'>A shaggy goat's soft hide beneath him spread,</a>
<a id='line_8972'>And with fresh rushes heap'd an ample bed;</a>
<a id='line_8973'>Jove touch'd the hero's tender soul, to find</a>
<a id='line_8974'>So just reception from a heart so kind:</a>
<a id='line_8975'>And "Oh, ye gods! with all your blessings grace</a>
<a id='line_8976'>(He thus broke forth) this friend of human race!"</a>
<a id='line_8977'></a>
<a id='line_8978'>The swain replied: "It never was our guise</a>
<a id='line_8979'>To slight the poor, or aught humane despise:</a>
<a id='line_8980'>For Jove unfold our hospitable door,</a>
<a id='line_8981'>'Tis Jove that sends the stranger and the poor,</a>
<a id='line_8982'>Little, alas! is all the good I can</a>
<a id='line_8983'>A man oppress'd, dependent, yet a man:</a>
<a id='line_8984'>Accept such treatment as a swain affords,</a>
<a id='line_8985'>Slave to the insolence of youthful lords!</a>
<a id='line_8986'>Far hence is by unequal gods removed</a>
<a id='line_8987'>That man of bounties, loving and beloved!</a>
<a id='line_8988'>To whom whate'er his slave enjoys is owed,</a>
<a id='line_8989'>And more, had Fate allow'd, had been bestow'd:</a>
<a id='line_8990'>But Fate condemn'd him to a foreign shore;</a>
<a id='line_8991'>Much have I sorrow'd, but my Master more.</a>
<a id='line_8992'>Now cold he lies, to death's embrace resign'd:</a>
<a id='line_8993'>Ah, perish Helen! perish all her kind!</a>
<a id='line_8994'>For whose cursed cause, in Agamemnon's name,</a>
<a id='line_8995'>He trod so fatally the paths of fame."</a>
<a id='line_8996'></a>
<a id='line_8997'>His vest succinct then girding round his waist,</a>
<a id='line_8998'>Forth rush'd the swain with hospitable haste.</a>
<a id='line_8999'>Straight to the lodgments of his herd he run,</a>
<a id='line_9000'>Where the fat porkers slept beneath the sun;</a>
<a id='line_9001'>Of two, his cutlass launch'd the spouting blood;</a>
<a id='line_9002'>These quarter'd, singed, and fix'd on forks of wood,</a>
<a id='line_9003'>All hasty on the hissing coals he threw;</a>
<a id='line_9004'>And smoking, back the tasteful viands drew.</a>
<a id='line_9005'>Broachers and all then an the board display'd</a>
<a id='line_9006'>The ready meal, before Ulysses laid</a>
<a id='line_9007'>With flour imbrown'd; next mingled wine yet new,</a>
<a id='line_9008'>And luscious as the bees' nectareous dew:</a>
<a id='line_9009'>Then sate, companion of the friendly feast,</a>
<a id='line_9010'>With open look; and thus bespoke his guest:</a>
<a id='line_9011'>"Take with free welcome what our hands prepare,</a>
<a id='line_9012'>Such food as falls to simple servants' share;</a>
<a id='line_9013'>The best our lords consume; those thoughtless peers,</a>
<a id='line_9014'>Rich without bounty, guilty without fears;</a>
<a id='line_9015'>Yet sure the gods their impious acts detest,</a>
<a id='line_9016'>And honour justice and the righteous breast.</a>
<a id='line_9017'>Pirates and conquerors of harden'd mind,</a>
<a id='line_9018'>The foes of peace, and scourges of mankind,</a>
<a id='line_9019'>To whom offending men are made a prey</a>
<a id='line_9020'>When Jove in vengeance gives a land away;</a>
<a id='line_9021'>E'en these, when of their ill-got spoils possess'd,</a>
<a id='line_9022'>Find sure tormentors in the guilty breast:</a>
<a id='line_9023'>Some voice of God close whispering from within,</a>
<a id='line_9024'>'Wretch! this is villainy, and this is sin.'</a>
<a id='line_9025'>But these, no doubt, some oracle explore,</a>
<a id='line_9026'>That tells, the great Ulysses is no more.</a>
<a id='line_9027'>Hence springs their confidence, and from our sighs</a>
<a id='line_9028'>Their rapine strengthens, and their riots rise:</a>
<a id='line_9029'>Constant as Jove the night and day bestows,</a>
<a id='line_9030'>Bleeds a whole hecatomb, a vintage flows.</a>
<a id='line_9031'>None match'd this hero's wealth, of all who reign</a>
<a id='line_9032'>O'er the fair islands of the neighbouring main.</a>
<a id='line_9033'>Nor all the monarchs whose far-dreaded sway</a>
<a id='line_9034'>The wide-extended continents obey:</a>
<a id='line_9035'>First, on the main land, of Ulysses' breed</a>
<a id='line_9036'>Twelve herds, twelve flocks, on ocean's margin feed;</a>
<a id='line_9037'>As many stalls for shaggy goats are rear'd;</a>
<a id='line_9038'>As many lodgments for the tusky herd;</a>
<a id='line_9039'>Two foreign keepers guard: and here are seen</a>
<a id='line_9040'>Twelve herds of goats that graze our utmost green;</a>
<a id='line_9041'>To native pastors is their charge assign'd,</a>
<a id='line_9042'>And mine the care to feed the bristly kind;</a>
<a id='line_9043'>Each day the fattest bleeds of either herd,</a>
<a id='line_9044'>All to the suitors' wasteful board preferr'd."</a>
<a id='line_9045'>Thus he, benevolent: his unknown guest</a>
<a id='line_9046'>With hunger keen devours the savoury feast;</a>
<a id='line_9047'>While schemes of vengeance ripen in his breast.</a>
<a id='line_9048'>Silent and thoughtful while the board he eyed,</a>
<a id='line_9049'>Eumaeus pours on high the purple tide;</a>
<a id='line_9050'>The king with smiling looks his joy express'd,</a>
<a id='line_9051'>And thus the kind inviting host address'd:</a>
<a id='line_9052'></a>
<a id='line_9053'>"Say now, what man is he, the man deplored,</a>
<a id='line_9054'>So rich, so potent, whom you style your lord?</a>
<a id='line_9055'>Late with such affluence and possessions bless'd,</a>
<a id='line_9056'>And now in honour's glorious bed at rest.</a>
<a id='line_9057'>Whoever was the warrior, he must be</a>
<a id='line_9058'>To fame no stranger, nor perhaps to me:</a>
<a id='line_9059'>Who (so the gods and so the Fates ordain'd)</a>
<a id='line_9060'>Have wander'd many a sea, and many a land."</a>
<a id='line_9061'></a>
<a id='line_9062'>"Small is the faith the prince and queen ascribe</a>
<a id='line_9063'>(Replied Eumaeus) to the wandering tribe.</a>
<a id='line_9064'>For needy strangers still to flattery fly,</a>
<a id='line_9065'>And want too oft betrays the tongue to lie.</a>
<a id='line_9066'>Each vagrant traveller, that touches here,</a>
<a id='line_9067'>Deludes with fallacies the royal ear,</a>
<a id='line_9068'>To dear remembrance makes his image rise,</a>
<a id='line_9069'>And calls the springing sorrows from her eyes.</a>
<a id='line_9070'>Such thou mayst be. But he whose name you crave</a>
<a id='line_9071'>Moulders in earth, or welters on the wave,</a>
<a id='line_9072'>Or food for fish or dogs his relics lie,</a>
<a id='line_9073'>Or torn by birds are scatter'd through the sky.</a>
<a id='line_9074'>So perish'd he: and left (for ever lost)</a>
<a id='line_9075'>Much woe to all, but sure to me the most.</a>
<a id='line_9076'>So mild a master never shall I find;</a>
<a id='line_9077'>Less dear the parents whom I left behind,</a>
<a id='line_9078'>Less soft my mother, less my father kind.</a>
<a id='line_9079'>Not with such transport would my eyes run o'er,</a>
<a id='line_9080'>Again to hail them in their native shore,</a>
<a id='line_9081'>As loved Ulysses once more to embrace,</a>
<a id='line_9082'>Restored and breathing in his natal place.</a>
<a id='line_9083'>That name for ever dread, yet ever dear,</a>
<a id='line_9084'>E'en in his absence I pronounce with fear:</a>
<a id='line_9085'>In my respect, he bears a prince's part;</a>
<a id='line_9086'>But lives a very brother in my heart."</a>
<a id='line_9087'></a>
<a id='line_9088'>Thus spoke the faithful swain, and thus rejoin'd</a>
<a id='line_9089'>The master of his grief, the man of patient mind:</a>
<a id='line_9090'>"Ulysses, friend! shall view his old abodes</a>
<a id='line_9091'>(Distrustful as thou art), nor doubt the gods.</a>
<a id='line_9092'>Nor speak I rashly, but with faith averr'd,</a>
<a id='line_9093'>And what I speak attesting Heaven has heard.</a>
<a id='line_9094'>If so, a cloak and vesture be my meed:</a>
<a id='line_9095'>Till his return no title shall I plead,</a>
<a id='line_9096'>Though certain be my news, and great my need.</a>
<a id='line_9097'>Whom want itself can force untruths to tell,</a>
<a id='line_9098'>My soul detests him as the gates of hell.</a>
<a id='line_9099'></a>
<a id='line_9100'>"Thou first be witness, hospitable Jove!</a>
<a id='line_9101'>And every god inspiring social love!</a>
<a id='line_9102'>And witness every household power that waits,</a>
<a id='line_9103'>Guard of these fires, and angel of these gates!</a>
<a id='line_9104'>Ere the next moon increase or this decay,</a>
<a id='line_9105'>His ancient realms Ulysses shall survey,</a>
<a id='line_9106'>In blood and dust each proud oppressor mourn,</a>
<a id='line_9107'>And the lost glories of his house return."</a>
<a id='line_9108'></a>
<a id='line_9109'>"Nor shall that meed be thine, nor ever more</a>
<a id='line_9110'>Shall loved Ulysses hail this happy shore.</a>
<a id='line_9111'>(Replied Eumaeus): to the present hour</a>
<a id='line_9112'>Now turn thy thought, and joys within our power.</a>
<a id='line_9113'>From sad reflection let my soul repose;</a>
<a id='line_9114'>The name of him awakes a thousand woes.</a>
<a id='line_9115'>But guard him, gods! and to these arms restore!</a>
<a id='line_9116'>Not his true consort can desire him more;</a>
<a id='line_9117'>Not old Laertes, broken with despair:</a>
<a id='line_9118'>Not young Telemachus, his blooming heir.</a>
<a id='line_9119'>Alas, Telemachus! my sorrows flow</a>
<a id='line_9120'>Afresh for thee, my second cause of woe!</a>
<a id='line_9121'>Like some fair plant set by a heavenly hand,</a>
<a id='line_9122'>He grew, he flourish'd, and he bless'd the land;</a>
<a id='line_9123'>In all the youth his father's image shined,</a>
<a id='line_9124'>Bright in his person, brighter in his mind.</a>
<a id='line_9125'>What man, or god, deceived his better sense,</a>
<a id='line_9126'>Far on the swelling seas to wander hence?</a>
<a id='line_9127'>To distant Pylos hapless is he gone,</a>
<a id='line_9128'>To seek his father's fate and find his own!</a>
<a id='line_9129'>For traitors wait his way, with dire design</a>
<a id='line_9130'>To end at once the great Arcesian line.</a>
<a id='line_9131'>But let us leave him to their wills above;</a>
<a id='line_9132'>The fates of men are in the hand of Jove.</a>
<a id='line_9133'>And now, my venerable guest! declare</a>
<a id='line_9134'>Your name, your parents, and your native air:</a>
<a id='line_9135'>Sincere from whence begun, your course relate,</a>
<a id='line_9136'>And to what ship I owe the friendly freight?"</a>
<a id='line_9137'></a>
<a id='line_9138'>Thus he: and thus (with prompt invention bold)</a>
<a id='line_9139'>The cautious chief his ready story told.</a>
<a id='line_9140'></a>
<a id='line_9141'>"On dark reserve what better can prevail,</a>
<a id='line_9142'>Or from the fluent tongue produce the tale,</a>
<a id='line_9143'>Than when two friends, alone, in peaceful place</a>
<a id='line_9144'>Confer, and wines and cates the table grace;</a>
<a id='line_9145'>But most, the kind inviter's cheerful face?</a>
<a id='line_9146'>Thus might we sit, with social goblets crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_9147'>Till the whole circle of the year goes round:</a>
<a id='line_9148'>Not the whole circle of the year would close</a>
<a id='line_9149'>My long narration of a life of woes.</a>
<a id='line_9150'>But such was Heaven's high will! Know then, I came</a>
<a id='line_9151'>From sacred Crete, and from a sire of fame:</a>
<a id='line_9152'>Castor Hylacides (that name he bore),</a>
<a id='line_9153'>Beloved and honour'd in his native shore;</a>
<a id='line_9154'>Bless'd in his riches, in his children more.</a>
<a id='line_9155'>Sprung of a handmaid, from a bought embrace,</a>
<a id='line_9156'>I shared his kindness with his lawful race:</a>
<a id='line_9157'>But when that fate, which all must undergo,</a>
<a id='line_9158'>From earth removed him to the shades below,</a>
<a id='line_9159'>The large domain his greedy sons divide,</a>
<a id='line_9160'>And each was portion'd as the lots decide.</a>
<a id='line_9161'>Little, alas! was left my wretched share,</a>
<a id='line_9162'>Except a house, a covert from the air:</a>
<a id='line_9163'>But what by niggard fortune was denied,</a>
<a id='line_9164'>A willing widow's copious wealth supplied.</a>
<a id='line_9165'>My valour was my plea, a gallant mind,</a>
<a id='line_9166'>That, true to honour, never lagg'd behind</a>
<a id='line_9167'>(The sex is ever to a soldier kind).</a>
<a id='line_9168'>Now wasting years my former strength confound,</a>
<a id='line_9169'>And added woes have bow'd me to the ground;</a>
<a id='line_9170'>Yet by the stubble you may guess the grain,</a>
<a id='line_9171'>And mark the ruins of no vulgar man.</a>
<a id='line_9172'>Me, Pallas gave to lead the martial storm,</a>
<a id='line_9173'>And the fair ranks of battle to deform;</a>
<a id='line_9174'>Me, Mars inspired to turn the foe to flight,</a>
<a id='line_9175'>And tempt the secret ambush of the night.</a>
<a id='line_9176'>Let ghastly Death in all his forms appear,</a>
<a id='line_9177'>I saw him not, it was not mine to fear.</a>
<a id='line_9178'>Before the rest I raised my ready steel,</a>
<a id='line_9179'>The first I met, he yielded, or he fell.</a>
<a id='line_9180'>But works of peace my soul disdain'd to bear,</a>
<a id='line_9181'>The rural labour, or domestic care.</a>
<a id='line_9182'>To raise the mast, the missile dart to wing,</a>
<a id='line_9183'>And send swift arrows from the bounding string,</a>
<a id='line_9184'>Were arts the gods made grateful to my mind;</a>
<a id='line_9185'>Those gods, who turn (to various ends design'd)</a>
<a id='line_9186'>The various thoughts and talents of mankind.</a>
<a id='line_9187'>Before the Grecians touch'd the Trojan plain,</a>
<a id='line_9188'>Nine times commander or by land or main,</a>
<a id='line_9189'>In foreign fields I spread my glory far,</a>
<a id='line_9190'>Great in the praise, rich in the spoils of war;</a>
<a id='line_9191'>Thence charged with riches, as increased in fame,</a>
<a id='line_9192'>To Crete return'd, an honourable name.</a>
<a id='line_9193'>But when great Jove that direful war decreed,</a>
<a id='line_9194'>Which roused all Greece, and made the mighty bleed;</a>
<a id='line_9195'>Our states myself and Idomen employ</a>
<a id='line_9196'>To lead their fleets, and carry death to Troy.</a>
<a id='line_9197'>Nine years we warr'd; the tenth saw Ilion fall;</a>
<a id='line_9198'>Homeward we sail'd, but heaven dispersed us all.</a>
<a id='line_9199'>One only month my wife enjoy'd my stay;</a>
<a id='line_9200'>So will'd the god who gives and takes away.</a>
<a id='line_9201'>Nine ships I mann'd, equipp'd with ready stores,</a>
<a id='line_9202'>Intent to voyage to the Aegyptian shores;</a>
<a id='line_9203'>In feast and sacrifice my chosen train</a>
<a id='line_9204'>Six days consum'd; the seventh we plough'd the main.</a>
<a id='line_9205'>Crete's ample fields diminish to our eye;</a>
<a id='line_9206'>Before the Boreal blast the vessels fly;</a>
<a id='line_9207'>Safe through the level seas we sweep our way;</a>
<a id='line_9208'>The steersman governs, and the ships obey.</a>
<a id='line_9209'>The fifth fair morn we stem the Aegyptian tide,</a>
<a id='line_9210'>And tilting o'er the bay the vessels ride:</a>
<a id='line_9211'>To anchor there my fellows I command,</a>
<a id='line_9212'>And spies commission to explore the land.</a>
<a id='line_9213'>But, sway'd by lust of gain, and headlong will,</a>
<a id='line_9214'>The coasts they ravage, and the natives kill.</a>
<a id='line_9215'>The spreading clamour to their city flies,</a>
<a id='line_9216'>And horse and foot in mingled tumult rise.</a>
<a id='line_9217'>The reddening dawn reveals the circling fields,</a>
<a id='line_9218'>Horrid with bristly spears, and glancing shields.</a>
<a id='line_9219'>Jove thunder'd on their side. Our guilty head</a>
<a id='line_9220'>We turn'd to flight; the gathering vengeance spread</a>
<a id='line_9221'>On all parts round, and heaps on heaps lie dead.</a>
<a id='line_9222'>I then explored my thought, what course to prove</a>
<a id='line_9223'>(And sure the thought was dictated by Jove):</a>
<a id='line_9224'>Oh, had he left me to that happier doom,</a>
<a id='line_9225'>And saved a life of miseries to come!</a>
<a id='line_9226'>The radiant helmet from my brows unlaced,</a>
<a id='line_9227'>And low on earth my shield and javelin cast,</a>
<a id='line_9228'>I meet the monarch with a suppliant's face,</a>
<a id='line_9229'>Approach his chariot, and his knees embrace,</a>
<a id='line_9230'>He heard, he saved, he placed me at his side;</a>
<a id='line_9231'>My state he pitied, and my tears he dried,</a>
<a id='line_9232'>Restrain'd the rage the vengeful foe express'd,</a>
<a id='line_9233'>And turn'd the deadly weapons from my breast.</a>
<a id='line_9234'>Pious! to guard the hospitable rite,</a>
<a id='line_9235'>And fearing Jove, whom mercy's works delight.</a>
<a id='line_9236'></a>
<a id='line_9237'>"In Aegypt thus with peace and plenty bless'd,</a>
<a id='line_9238'>I lived (and happy still have lived) a guest.</a>
<a id='line_9239'>On seven bright years successive blessings wait;</a>
<a id='line_9240'>The next changed all the colour of my fate.</a>
<a id='line_9241'>A false Phoenician, of insiduous mind,</a>
<a id='line_9242'>Versed in vile arts, and foe to humankind,</a>
<a id='line_9243'>With semblance fair invites me to his home;</a>
<a id='line_9244'>I seized the proffer (ever fond to roam):</a>
<a id='line_9245'>Domestic in his faithless roof I stay'd,</a>
<a id='line_9246'>Till the swift sun his annual circle made.</a>
<a id='line_9247'>To Libya then he mediates the way;</a>
<a id='line_9248'>With guileful art a stranger to betray,</a>
<a id='line_9249'>And sell to bondage in a foreign land:</a>
<a id='line_9250'>Much doubting, yet compell'd I quit the strand,</a>
<a id='line_9251'>Through the mid seas the nimble pinnace sails,</a>
<a id='line_9252'>Aloof from Crete, before the northern gales:</a>
<a id='line_9253'>But when remote her chalky cliffs we lost,</a>
<a id='line_9254'>And far from ken of any other coast,</a>
<a id='line_9255'>When all was wild expanse of sea and air,</a>
<a id='line_9256'>Then doom'd high Jove due vengeance to prepare.</a>
<a id='line_9257'>He hung a night of horrors o'er their head</a>
<a id='line_9258'>(The shaded ocean blacken'd as it spread):</a>
<a id='line_9259'>He launch'd the fiery bolt: from pole to pole</a>
<a id='line_9260'>Broad burst the lightnings, deep the thunders roll;</a>
<a id='line_9261'>In giddy rounds the whirling ship is toss'd,</a>
<a id='line_9262'>An all in clouds of smothering sulphur lost.</a>
<a id='line_9263'>As from a hanging rock's tremendous height,</a>
<a id='line_9264'>The sable crows with intercepted flight</a>
<a id='line_9265'>Drop endlong; scarr'd, and black with sulphurous hue,</a>
<a id='line_9266'>So from the deck are hurl'd the ghastly crew.</a>
<a id='line_9267'>Such end the wicked found! but Jove's intent</a>
<a id='line_9268'>Was yet to save the oppress'd and innocent.</a>
<a id='line_9269'>Placed on the mast (the last resource of life)</a>
<a id='line_9270'>With winds and waves I held unequal strife:</a>
<a id='line_9271'>For nine long days the billows tilting o'er,</a>
<a id='line_9272'>The tenth soft wafts me to Thesprotia's shore.</a>
<a id='line_9273'>The monarch's son a shipwreck'd wretch relieved,</a>
<a id='line_9274'>The sire with hospitable rites received,</a>
<a id='line_9275'>And in his palace like a brother placed,</a>
<a id='line_9276'>With gifts of price and gorgeous garments graced</a>
<a id='line_9277'>While here I sojourn'd, oft I heard the fame</a>
<a id='line_9278'>How late Ulysses to the country came.</a>
<a id='line_9279'>How loved, how honour'd in this court he stay'd,</a>
<a id='line_9280'>And here his whole collected treasure laid;</a>
<a id='line_9281'>I saw myself the vast unnumber'd store</a>
<a id='line_9282'>Of steel elaborate, and refulgent ore,</a>
<a id='line_9283'>And brass high heap'd amidst the regal dome;</a>
<a id='line_9284'>Immense supplies for ages yet to come!</a>
<a id='line_9285'>Meantime he voyaged to explore the will</a>
<a id='line_9286'>Of Jove, on high Dodona's holy hill,</a>
<a id='line_9287'>What means might best his safe return avail,</a>
<a id='line_9288'>To come in pomp, or bear a secret sail?</a>
<a id='line_9289'>Full oft has Phidon, whilst he pour'd the wine,</a>
<a id='line_9290'>Attesting solemn all the powers divine,</a>
<a id='line_9291'>That soon Ulysses would return, declared</a>
<a id='line_9292'>The sailors waiting, and the ships prepared.</a>
<a id='line_9293'>But first the king dismiss'd me from his shores,</a>
<a id='line_9294'>For fair Dulichium crown'd with fruitful stores;</a>
<a id='line_9295'>To good Acastus' friendly care consign'd:</a>
<a id='line_9296'>But other counsels pleased the sailors' mind:</a>
<a id='line_9297'>New frauds were plotted by the faithless train,</a>
<a id='line_9298'>And misery demands me once again.</a>
<a id='line_9299'>Soon as remote from shore they plough the wave,</a>
<a id='line_9300'>With ready hands they rush to seize their slave;</a>
<a id='line_9301'>Then with these tatter'd rags they wrapp'd me round</a>
<a id='line_9302'>(Stripp'd of my own), and to the vessel bound.</a>
<a id='line_9303'>At eve, at Ithaca's delightful land</a>
<a id='line_9304'>The ship arriv'd: forth issuing on the sand,</a>
<a id='line_9305'>They sought repast; while to the unhappy kind,</a>
<a id='line_9306'>The pitying gods themselves my chains unbind.</a>
<a id='line_9307'>Soft I descended, to the sea applied</a>
<a id='line_9308'>My naked breast, and shot along the tide.</a>
<a id='line_9309'>Soon pass'd beyond their sight, I left the flood,</a>
<a id='line_9310'>And took the spreading shelter of the wood.</a>
<a id='line_9311'>Their prize escaped the faithless pirates mourn'd;</a>
<a id='line_9312'>But deem'd inquiry vain, and to their ships return'd.</a>
<a id='line_9313'>Screen'd by protecting gods from hostile eyes,</a>
<a id='line_9314'>They led me to a good man and a wise,</a>
<a id='line_9315'>To live beneath thy hospitable care,</a>
<a id='line_9316'>And wait the woes Heaven dooms me yet to bear."</a>
<a id='line_9317'></a>
<a id='line_9318'>"Unhappy guest! whose sorrows touch my mind!</a>
<a id='line_9319'>(Thus good Eumaeus with a sigh rejoin'd,)</a>
<a id='line_9320'>For real sufferings since I grieve sincere,</a>
<a id='line_9321'>Check not with fallacies the springing tear:</a>
<a id='line_9322'>Nor turn the passion into groundless joy</a>
<a id='line_9323'>For him whom Heaven has destined to destroy.</a>
<a id='line_9324'>Oh! had he perish'd on some well-fought day,</a>
<a id='line_9325'>Or in his friend's embraces died away!</a>
<a id='line_9326'>That grateful Greece with streaming eyes might raise</a>
<a id='line_9327'>Historic marbles to record his praise;</a>
<a id='line_9328'>His praise, eternal on the faithful stone,</a>
<a id='line_9329'>Had with transmissive honours graced his son.</a>
<a id='line_9330'>Now, snatch'd by harpies to the dreary coast,</a>
<a id='line_9331'>Sunk is the hero, and his glory lost!</a>
<a id='line_9332'>While pensive in this solitary den,</a>
<a id='line_9333'>Far from gay cities and the ways of men,</a>
<a id='line_9334'>I linger life; nor to the court repair,</a>
<a id='line_9335'>But when my constant queen commands my care;</a>
<a id='line_9336'>Or when, to taste her hospitable board,</a>
<a id='line_9337'>Some guest arrives, with rumours of her lord;</a>
<a id='line_9338'>And these indulge their want, and those their woe,</a>
<a id='line_9339'>And here the tears and there the goblets flow.</a>
<a id='line_9340'>By many such have I been warn'd; but chief</a>
<a id='line_9341'>By one Aetolian robb'd of all belief,</a>
<a id='line_9342'>Whose hap it was to this our roof to roam,</a>
<a id='line_9343'>For murder banish'd from his native home.</a>
<a id='line_9344'>He swore, Ulysses on the coast of Crete</a>
<a id='line_9345'>Stay'd but a season to refit his fleet;</a>
<a id='line_9346'>A few revolving months should waft him o'er,</a>
<a id='line_9347'>Fraught with bold warriors, and a boundless store</a>
<a id='line_9348'>O thou! whom age has taught to understand,</a>
<a id='line_9349'>And Heaven has guided with a favouring hand!</a>
<a id='line_9350'>On god or mortal to obtrude a lie</a>
<a id='line_9351'>Forbear, and dread to flatter as to die.</a>
<a id='line_9352'>Nor for such ends my house and heart are free,</a>
<a id='line_9353'>But dear respect to Jove, and charity."</a>
<a id='line_9354'></a>
<a id='line_9355'>"And why, O swain of unbelieving mind!</a>
<a id='line_9356'>(Thus quick replied the wisest of mankind)</a>
<a id='line_9357'>Doubt you my oath? yet more my faith to try,</a>
<a id='line_9358'>A solemn compact let us ratify,</a>
<a id='line_9359'>And witness every power that rules the sky!</a>
<a id='line_9360'>If here Ulysses from his labours rest,</a>
<a id='line_9361'>Be then my prize a tunic and a vest;</a>
<a id='line_9362'>And where my hopes invite me, straight transport</a>
<a id='line_9363'>In safety to Dulichium's friendly court.</a>
<a id='line_9364'>But if he greets not thy desiring eye,</a>
<a id='line_9365'>Hurl me from yon dread precipice on high:</a>
<a id='line_9366'>The due reward of fraud and perjury."</a>
<a id='line_9367'></a>
<a id='line_9368'>"Doubtless, O guest! great laud and praise were mine</a>
<a id='line_9369'>(Replied the swain, for spotless faith divine),</a>
<a id='line_9370'>If after social rites and gifts bestow'd,</a>
<a id='line_9371'>I stain'd my hospitable hearth with blood.</a>
<a id='line_9372'>How would the gods my righteous toils succeed,</a>
<a id='line_9373'>And bless the hand that made a stranger bleed?</a>
<a id='line_9374'>No more--the approaching hours of silent night</a>
<a id='line_9375'>First claim refection, then to rest invite;</a>
<a id='line_9376'>Beneath our humble cottage let us haste,</a>
<a id='line_9377'>And here, unenvied, rural dainties taste."</a>
<a id='line_9378'></a>
<a id='line_9379'>Thus communed these; while to their lowly dome</a>
<a id='line_9380'>The full-fed swine return'd with evening home;</a>
<a id='line_9381'>Compell'd, reluctant, to their several sties,</a>
<a id='line_9382'>With din obstreperous, and ungrateful cries.</a>
<a id='line_9383'>Then to the slaves: "Now from the herd the best</a>
<a id='line_9384'>Select in honour of our foreign guest:</a>
<a id='line_9385'>With him let us the genial banquet share,</a>
<a id='line_9386'>For great and many are the griefs we bear;</a>
<a id='line_9387'>While those who from our labours heap their board</a>
<a id='line_9388'>Blaspheme their feeder, and forget their lord."</a>
<a id='line_9389'></a>
<a id='line_9390'>Thus speaking, with despatchful hand he took</a>
<a id='line_9391'>A weighty axe, and cleft the solid oak;</a>
<a id='line_9392'>This on the earth he piled; a boar full fed,</a>
<a id='line_9393'>Of five years' age, before the pile was led:</a>
<a id='line_9394'>The swain, whom acts of piety delight,</a>
<a id='line_9395'>Observant of the gods, begins the rite;</a>
<a id='line_9396'>First shears the forehead of the bristly boar,</a>
<a id='line_9397'>And suppliant stands, invoking every power</a>
<a id='line_9398'>To speed Ulysses to his native shore.</a>
<a id='line_9399'>A knotty stake then aiming at his head,</a>
<a id='line_9400'>Down dropped he groaning, and the spirit fled.</a>
<a id='line_9401'>The scorching flames climb round on every side;</a>
<a id='line_9402'>Then the singed members they with skill divide;</a>
<a id='line_9403'>On these, in rolls of fat involved with art,</a>
<a id='line_9404'>The choicest morsels lay from every part.</a>
<a id='line_9405'>Some in the flames bestrew'd with flour they threw;</a>
<a id='line_9406'>Some cut in fragments from the forks they drew:</a>
<a id='line_9407'>These while on several tables they dispose.</a>
<a id='line_9408'>A priest himself the blameless rustic rose;</a>
<a id='line_9409'>Expert the destined victim to dispart</a>
<a id='line_9410'>In seven just portions, pure of hand and heart.</a>
<a id='line_9411'>One sacred to the nymphs apart they lay:</a>
<a id='line_9412'>Another to the winged sons of May;</a>
<a id='line_9413'>The rural tribe in common share the rest,</a>
<a id='line_9414'>The king the chine, the honour of the feast,</a>
<a id='line_9415'>Who sate delighted at his servant's board;</a>
<a id='line_9416'>The faithful servant joy'd his unknown lord.</a>
<a id='line_9417'>"Oh be thou dear (Ulysses cried) to Jove,</a>
<a id='line_9418'>As well thou claim'st a grateful stranger's love!"</a>
<a id='line_9419'></a>
<a id='line_9420'>"Be then thy thanks (the bounteous swain replied)</a>
<a id='line_9421'>Enjoyment of the good the gods provide.</a>
<a id='line_9422'>From God's own hand descend our joys and woes;</a>
<a id='line_9423'>These he decrees, and he but suffers those:</a>
<a id='line_9424'>All power is his, and whatsoe'er he wills,</a>
<a id='line_9425'>The will itself, omnipotent, fulfils."</a>
<a id='line_9426'>This said, the first-fruits to the gods he gave;</a>
<a id='line_9427'>Then pour'd of offer'd wine the sable wave:</a>
<a id='line_9428'>In great Ulysses' hand he placed the bowl,</a>
<a id='line_9429'>He sate, and sweet refection cheer'd his soul.</a>
<a id='line_9430'>The bread from canisters Mesaulius gave</a>
<a id='line_9431'>(Eumaeus' proper treasure bought this slave,</a>
<a id='line_9432'>And led from Taphos, to attend his board,</a>
<a id='line_9433'>A servant added to his absent lord);</a>
<a id='line_9434'>His task it was the wheaten loaves to lay,</a>
<a id='line_9435'>And from the banquet take the bowls away.</a>
<a id='line_9436'>And now the rage of hunger was repress'd,</a>
<a id='line_9437'>And each betakes him to his couch to rest.</a>
<a id='line_9438'></a>
<a id='line_9439'>Now came the night, and darkness cover'd o'er</a>
<a id='line_9440'>The face of things; the winds began to roar;</a>
<a id='line_9441'>The driving storm the watery west-wind pours,</a>
<a id='line_9442'>And Jove descends in deluges of showers.</a>
<a id='line_9443'>Studious of rest and warmth, Ulysses lies,</a>
<a id='line_9444'>Foreseeing from the first the storm would rise</a>
<a id='line_9445'>In mere necessity of coat and cloak,</a>
<a id='line_9446'>With artful preface to his host he spoke:</a>
<a id='line_9447'>"Hear me, my friends! who this good banquet grace;</a>
<a id='line_9448'>'Tis sweet to play the fool in time and place,</a>
<a id='line_9449'>And wine can of their wits the wise beguile,</a>
<a id='line_9450'>Make the sage frolic, and the serious smile,</a>
<a id='line_9451'>The grave in merry measures frisk about,</a>
<a id='line_9452'>And many a long-repented word bring out.</a>
<a id='line_9453'>Since to be talkative I now commence,</a>
<a id='line_9454'>Let wit cast off the sullen yoke of sense.</a>
<a id='line_9455'>Once I was strong (would Heaven restore those days!)</a>
<a id='line_9456'>And with my betters claim'd a share of praise.</a>
<a id='line_9457'>Ulysses, Menelaus, led forth a band,</a>
<a id='line_9458'>And join'd me with them ('twas their own command);</a>
<a id='line_9459'>A deathful ambush for the foe to lay,</a>
<a id='line_9460'>Beneath Troy walls by night we took our way:</a>
<a id='line_9461'>There, clad in arms, along the marshes spread,</a>
<a id='line_9462'>We made the osier-fringed bank our bed.</a>
<a id='line_9463'>Full soon the inclemency of heaven I feel,</a>
<a id='line_9464'>Nor had these shoulders covering, but of steel.</a>
<a id='line_9465'>Sharp blew the north; snow whitening all the fields</a>
<a id='line_9466'>Froze with the blast, and gathering glazed our shields.</a>
<a id='line_9467'>There all but I, well fenced with cloak and vest,</a>
<a id='line_9468'>Lay cover'd by their ample shields at rest.</a>
<a id='line_9469'>Fool that I was! I left behind my own,</a>
<a id='line_9470'>The skill of weather and of winds unknown,</a>
<a id='line_9471'>And trusted to my coat and shield alone!</a>
<a id='line_9472'>When now was wasted more than half the night,</a>
<a id='line_9473'>And the stars faded at approaching light,</a>
<a id='line_9474'>Sudden I jogg'd Ulysses, who was laid</a>
<a id='line_9475'>Fast by my side, and shivering thus I said:</a>
<a id='line_9476'></a>
<a id='line_9477'>"'Here longer in this field I cannot lie;</a>
<a id='line_9478'>The winter pinches, and with cold I die,</a>
<a id='line_9479'>And die ashamed (O wisest of mankind),</a>
<a id='line_9480'>The only fool who left his cloak behind.'</a>
<a id='line_9481'></a>
<a id='line_9482'>"He thought and answer'd: hardly waking yet,</a>
<a id='line_9483'>Sprung in his mind a momentary wit</a>
<a id='line_9484'>(That wit, which or in council or in fight,</a>
<a id='line_9485'>Still met the emergence, and determined right).</a>
<a id='line_9486'>'Hush thee (he cried, soft whispering in my ear),</a>
<a id='line_9487'>Speak not a word, lest any Greek may hear'--</a>
<a id='line_9488'>And then (supporting on his arm his head),</a>
<a id='line_9489'>'Hear me, companions! (thus aloud he said:)</a>
<a id='line_9490'>Methinks too distant from the fleet we lie:</a>
<a id='line_9491'>E'en now a vision stood before my eye,</a>
<a id='line_9492'>And sure the warning vision was from high:</a>
<a id='line_9493'>Let from among us some swift courier rise,</a>
<a id='line_9494'>Haste to the general, and demand supplies.'</a>
<a id='line_9495'></a>
<a id='line_9496'>"Up started Thoas straight, Andraemon's son,</a>
<a id='line_9497'>Nimbly he rose, and cast his garment down!</a>
<a id='line_9498'>Instant, the racer vanish'd off the ground;</a>
<a id='line_9499'>That instant in his cloak I wrapp'd me round:</a>
<a id='line_9500'>And safe I slept, till brightly-dawning shone</a>
<a id='line_9501'>The morn conspicuous on her golden throne.</a>
<a id='line_9502'></a>
<a id='line_9503'>"Oh were my strength as then, as then my age!</a>
<a id='line_9504'>Some friend would fence me from the winter's rage.</a>
<a id='line_9505'>Yet, tatter'd as I look, I challenged then</a>
<a id='line_9506'>The honours and the offices of men:</a>
<a id='line_9507'>Some master, or some servant would allow</a>
<a id='line_9508'>A cloak and vest--but I am nothing now!"</a>
<a id='line_9509'></a>
<a id='line_9510'>"Well hast thou spoke (rejoin'd the attentive swain):</a>
<a id='line_9511'>Thy lips let fall no idle word or vain!</a>
<a id='line_9512'>Nor garment shalt thou want, nor aught beside,</a>
<a id='line_9513'>Meet for the wandering suppliant to provide.</a>
<a id='line_9514'>But in the morning take thy clothes again,</a>
<a id='line_9515'>For here one vest suffices every swain:</a>
<a id='line_9516'>No change of garments to our hinds is known;</a>
<a id='line_9517'>But when return'd, the good Ulysses' son</a>
<a id='line_9518'>With better hand shall grace with fit attires</a>
<a id='line_9519'>His guest, and send thee where thy soul desires."</a>
<a id='line_9520'></a>
<a id='line_9521'>The honest herdsman rose, as this he said,</a>
<a id='line_9522'>And drew before the hearth the stranger's bed;</a>
<a id='line_9523'>The fleecy spoils of sheep, a goat's rough hide</a>
<a id='line_9524'>He spreads; and adds a mantle thick and wide;</a>
<a id='line_9525'>With store to heap above him, and below,</a>
<a id='line_9526'>And guard each quarter as the tempests blow.</a>
<a id='line_9527'>There lay the king, and all the rest supine;</a>
<a id='line_9528'>All, but the careful master of the swine:</a>
<a id='line_9529'>Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care;</a>
<a id='line_9530'>Well arm'd, and fenced against nocturnal air:</a>
<a id='line_9531'>His weighty falchion o'er his shoulder tied:</a>
<a id='line_9532'>His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied:</a>
<a id='line_9533'>With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men,</a>
<a id='line_9534'>He seeks his lodging in the rocky den.</a>
<a id='line_9535'>There to the tusky herd he bends his way,</a>
<a id='line_9536'>Where, screen'd from Boreas, high o'erarch'd they lay.</a>

<a id='line_9546'>The goddess Minerva commands Telemachus in a vision to return to</a>
<a id='line_9547'>Ithaca. Pisistratus and he take leave of Menelaus, and arrive at</a>
<a id='line_9548'>Pylos, where they part: and Telemachus sets sail, after having</a>
<a id='line_9549'>received on board Theoclymenus the soothsayer. The scene then</a>
<a id='line_9550'>changes to the cottage of Eumaeus, who entertains Ulysses with a</a>
<a id='line_9551'>recital of his adventures. In the meantime Telemachus arrives on</a>
<a id='line_9552'>the coast, and sending the vessel to the town, proceeds by himself</a>
<a id='line_9553'>to the lodge of Eumaeus.</a>
<a id='line_9554'></a>
<a id='line_9555'></a>
<a id='line_9556'></a>
<a id='line_9557'>Now had Minerva reach'd those ample plains,</a>
<a id='line_9558'>Famed for the dance, where Menelaus reigns:</a>
<a id='line_9559'>Anxious she flies to great Ulysses' heir,</a>
<a id='line_9560'>His instant voyage challenged all her care.</a>
<a id='line_9561'>Beneath the royal portico display'd,</a>
<a id='line_9562'>With Nestor's son Telemachus was laid:</a>
<a id='line_9563'>In sleep profound the son of Nestor lies;</a>
<a id='line_9564'>Not thine, Ulysses! Care unseal'd his eyes:</a>
<a id='line_9565'>Restless he grieved, with various fears oppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_9566'>And all thy fortunes roll'd within his breast.</a>
<a id='line_9567'>When, "O Telemachus! (the goddess said)</a>
<a id='line_9568'>Too long in vain, too widely hast thou stray'd,</a>
<a id='line_9569'>Thus leaving careless thy paternal right</a>
<a id='line_9570'>The robbers' prize, the prey to lawless might.</a>
<a id='line_9571'>On fond pursuits neglectful while you roam,</a>
<a id='line_9572'>E'en now the hand of rapine sacks the dome.</a>
<a id='line_9573'>Hence to Atrides; and his leave implore</a>
<a id='line_9574'>To launch thy vessel for thy natal shore;</a>
<a id='line_9575'>Fly, whilst thy mother virtuous yet withstands</a>
<a id='line_9576'>Her kindred's wishes, and her sire's commands;</a>
<a id='line_9577'>Through both, Eurymachus pursues the dame,</a>
<a id='line_9578'>And with the noblest gifts asserts his claim.</a>
<a id='line_9579'>Hence, therefore, while thy stores thy own remain;</a>
<a id='line_9580'>Thou know'st the practice of the female train,</a>
<a id='line_9581'>Lost in the children of the present spouse,</a>
<a id='line_9582'>They slight the pledges of their former vows;</a>
<a id='line_9583'>Their love is always with the lover past;</a>
<a id='line_9584'>Still the succeeding flame expels the last.</a>
<a id='line_9585'>Let o'er thy house some chosen maid preside,</a>
<a id='line_9586'>Till Heaven decrees to bless thee in a bride.</a>
<a id='line_9587'>But now thy more attentive ears incline,</a>
<a id='line_9588'>Observe the warnings of a power divine;</a>
<a id='line_9589'>For thee their snares the suitor lords shall lay</a>
<a id='line_9590'>In Samos' sands, or straits of Ithaca;</a>
<a id='line_9591'>To seize thy life shall lurk the murderous band,</a>
<a id='line_9592'>Ere yet thy footsteps press thy native land.</a>
<a id='line_9593'>No!--sooner far their riot and their lust</a>
<a id='line_9594'>All-covering earth shall bury deep in dust!</a>
<a id='line_9595'>Then distant from the scatter'd islands steer,</a>
<a id='line_9596'>Nor let the night retard thy full career;</a>
<a id='line_9597'>Thy heavenly guardian shall instruct the gales</a>
<a id='line_9598'>To smooth thy passage and supply thy sails:</a>
<a id='line_9599'>And when at Ithaca thy labour ends,</a>
<a id='line_9600'>Send to the town the vessel with thy friends;</a>
<a id='line_9601'>But seek thou first the master of the swine</a>
<a id='line_9602'>(For still to thee his loyal thoughts incline);</a>
<a id='line_9603'>There pass the night: while he his course pursues</a>
<a id='line_9604'>To bring Penelope the wish'd-for news,</a>
<a id='line_9605'>That thou, safe sailing from the Pylian strand,</a>
<a id='line_9606'>Art come to bless her in thy native land."</a>
<a id='line_9607'>Thus spoke the goddess, and resumed her flight</a>
<a id='line_9608'>To the pure regions of eternal light,</a>
<a id='line_9609'>Meanwhile Pisistratus he gently shakes,</a>
<a id='line_9610'>And with these words the slumbering youth awakes:</a>
<a id='line_9611'></a>
<a id='line_9612'>"Rise, son of Nestor; for the road prepare,</a>
<a id='line_9613'>And join the harness'd coursers to the car."</a>
<a id='line_9614'></a>
<a id='line_9615'>"What cause (he cried) can justify our flight</a>
<a id='line_9616'>To tempt the dangers of forbidding night?</a>
<a id='line_9617'>Here wait we rather, till approaching day</a>
<a id='line_9618'>Shall prompt our speed, and point the ready way.</a>
<a id='line_9619'>Nor think of flight before the Spartan king</a>
<a id='line_9620'>Shall bid farewell, and bounteous presents bring;</a>
<a id='line_9621'>Gifts, which to distant ages safely stored,</a>
<a id='line_9622'>The sacred act of friendship shall record."</a>
<a id='line_9623'></a>
<a id='line_9624'>Thus he. But when the dawn bestreak'd the east,</a>
<a id='line_9625'>The king from Helen rose, and sought his guest.</a>
<a id='line_9626'>As soon as his approach the hero knew,</a>
<a id='line_9627'>The splendid mantle round him first he threw,</a>
<a id='line_9628'>Then o'er his ample shoulders whirl'd the cloak,</a>
<a id='line_9629'>Respectful met the monarch, and bespoke:</a>
<a id='line_9630'></a>
<a id='line_9631'>"Hail, great Atrides, favour'd of high Jove!</a>
<a id='line_9632'>Let not thy friends in vain for licence move.</a>
<a id='line_9633'>Swift let us measure back the watery way,</a>
<a id='line_9634'>Nor check our speed, impatient of delay."</a>
<a id='line_9635'></a>
<a id='line_9636'>"If with desire so strong thy bosom glows,</a>
<a id='line_9637'>Ill (said the king) should I thy wish oppose;</a>
<a id='line_9638'>For oft in others freely I reprove</a>
<a id='line_9639'>The ill-timed efforts of officious love;</a>
<a id='line_9640'>Who love too much, hate in the like extreme,</a>
<a id='line_9641'>And both the golden mean alike condemn.</a>
<a id='line_9642'>Alike he thwarts the hospitable end,</a>
<a id='line_9643'>Who drives the free, or stays the hasty friend:</a>
<a id='line_9644'>True friendship's laws are by this rule express'd,</a>
<a id='line_9645'>Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest.</a>
<a id='line_9646'>Yet, stay, my friends, and in your chariot take</a>
<a id='line_9647'>The noblest presents that our love can make;</a>
<a id='line_9648'>Meantime commit we to our women's care</a>
<a id='line_9649'>Some choice domestic viands to prepare;</a>
<a id='line_9650'>The traveller, rising from the banquet gay,</a>
<a id='line_9651'>Eludes the labours of the tedious way,</a>
<a id='line_9652'>Then if a wider course shall rather please,</a>
<a id='line_9653'>Through spacious Argos and the realms of Greece,</a>
<a id='line_9654'>Atrides in his chariot shall attend;</a>
<a id='line_9655'>Himself thy convoy to each royal friend.</a>
<a id='line_9656'>No prince will let Ulysses' heir remove</a>
<a id='line_9657'>Without some pledge, some monument of love:</a>
<a id='line_9658'>These will the caldron, these the tripod give;</a>
<a id='line_9659'>From those the well-pair'd mules we shall receive,</a>
<a id='line_9660'>Or bowl emboss'd whose golden figures live."</a>
<a id='line_9661'></a>
<a id='line_9662'>To whom the youth, for prudence famed, replied:</a>
<a id='line_9663'>"O monarch, care of heaven! thy people's pride!</a>
<a id='line_9664'>No friend in Ithaca my place supplies,</a>
<a id='line_9665'>No powerful hands are there, no watchful eyes:</a>
<a id='line_9666'>My stores exposed and fenceless house demand</a>
<a id='line_9667'>The speediest succour from my guardian hand;</a>
<a id='line_9668'>Lest, in a search too anxious and too vain,</a>
<a id='line_9669'>Of one lost joy, I lose what yet remain."</a>
<a id='line_9670'></a>
<a id='line_9671'>His purpose when the generous warrior heard,</a>
<a id='line_9672'>He charged the household cates to be prepared.</a>
<a id='line_9673'>Now with the dawn, from his adjoining home,</a>
<a id='line_9674'>Was Boethoedes Eteoneus come;</a>
<a id='line_9675'>Swift at the word he forms the rising blaze,</a>
<a id='line_9676'>And o'er the coals the smoking fragments lays.</a>
<a id='line_9677'>Meantime the king, his son, and Helen went</a>
<a id='line_9678'>Where the rich wardrobe breathed a costly scent;</a>
<a id='line_9679'>The king selected from the glittering rows</a>
<a id='line_9680'>A bowl; the prince a silver beaker chose.</a>
<a id='line_9681'>The beauteous queen revolved with careful eyes</a>
<a id='line_9682'>Her various textures of unnumber'd dyes,</a>
<a id='line_9683'>And chose the largest; with no vulgar art</a>
<a id='line_9684'>Her own fair hands embroider'd every part;</a>
<a id='line_9685'>Beneath the rest it lay divinely bright,</a>
<a id='line_9686'>Like radiant Hesper o'er the gems of night,</a>
<a id='line_9687'>Then with each gift they hasten'd to their guest,</a>
<a id='line_9688'>And thus the king Ulysses' heir address'd:</a>
<a id='line_9689'>"Since fix'd are thy resolves, may thundering Jove</a>
<a id='line_9690'>With happiest omens thy desires approve!</a>
<a id='line_9691'>This silver bowl, whose costly margins shine</a>
<a id='line_9692'>Enchased with old, this valued gift be thine;</a>
<a id='line_9693'>To me this present, of Vulcanian frame,</a>
<a id='line_9694'>From Sidon's hospitable monarch came;</a>
<a id='line_9695'>To thee we now consign the precious load,</a>
<a id='line_9696'>The pride of kings, and labour of a god."</a>
<a id='line_9697'></a>
<a id='line_9698'>Then gave the cup, while Megapenthe brought</a>
<a id='line_9699'>The silver vase with living sculpture wrought.</a>
<a id='line_9700'>The beauteous queen, advancing next, display'd</a>
<a id='line_9701'>The shining veil, and thus endearing said:</a>
<a id='line_9702'></a>
<a id='line_9703'>"Accept, dear youth, this monument of love,</a>
<a id='line_9704'>Long since, in better days, by Helen wove:</a>
<a id='line_9705'>Safe in thy mother's care the vesture lay,</a>
<a id='line_9706'>To deck thy bride and grace thy nuptial day.</a>
<a id='line_9707'>Meantime may'st thou with happiest speed regain</a>
<a id='line_9708'>Thy stately palace, and thy wide domain."</a>
<a id='line_9709'></a>
<a id='line_9710'>She said, and gave the veil; with grateful look</a>
<a id='line_9711'>The prince the variegated present took.</a>
<a id='line_9712'>And now, when through the royal dome they pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_9713'>High on a throne the king each stranger placed.</a>
<a id='line_9714'>A golden ewer the attendant damsel brings,</a>
<a id='line_9715'>Replete with water from the crystal springs;</a>
<a id='line_9716'>With copious streams the shining vase supplies</a>
<a id='line_9717'>A silver layer of capacious size.</a>
<a id='line_9718'>They wash. The tables in fair order spread,</a>
<a id='line_9719'>The glittering canisters are crown'd with bread;</a>
<a id='line_9720'>Viands of various kinds allure the taste,</a>
<a id='line_9721'>Of choicest sort and savour; rich repast!</a>
<a id='line_9722'>Whilst Eteoneus portions out the shares</a>
<a id='line_9723'>Atrides' son the purple draught prepares,</a>
<a id='line_9724'>And now (each sated with the genial feast,</a>
<a id='line_9725'>And the short rage of thirst and hunger ceased)</a>
<a id='line_9726'>Ulysses' son, with his illustrious friend,</a>
<a id='line_9727'>The horses join, the polish'd car ascend,</a>
<a id='line_9728'>Along the court the fiery steeds rebound,</a>
<a id='line_9729'>And the wide portal echoes to the sound.</a>
<a id='line_9730'>The king precedes; a bowl with fragrant wine</a>
<a id='line_9731'>(Libation destined to the powers divine)</a>
<a id='line_9732'>His right hand held: before the steed he stands,</a>
<a id='line_9733'>Then, mix'd with prayers, he utters these commands:</a>
<a id='line_9734'></a>
<a id='line_9735'>"Farewell, and prosper, youths! let Nestor know</a>
<a id='line_9736'>What grateful thoughts still in this bosom glow,</a>
<a id='line_9737'>For all the proofs of his paternal care,</a>
<a id='line_9738'>Through the long dangers of the ten years' war."</a>
<a id='line_9739'>"Ah! doubt not our report (the prince rejoin'd)</a>
<a id='line_9740'>Of all the virtues of thy generous mind.</a>
<a id='line_9741'>And oh! return'd might we Ulysses meet!</a>
<a id='line_9742'>To him thy presents show, thy words repeat:</a>
<a id='line_9743'>How will each speech his grateful wonder raise!</a>
<a id='line_9744'>How will each gift indulge us in thy praise!"</a>
<a id='line_9745'></a>
<a id='line_9746'>Scarce ended thus the prince, when on the right</a>
<a id='line_9747'>Advanced the bird of Jove: auspicious sight!</a>
<a id='line_9748'>A milk-white fowl his clinching talons bore,</a>
<a id='line_9749'>With care domestic pampered at the floor.</a>
<a id='line_9750'>Peasants in vain with threatening cries pursue,</a>
<a id='line_9751'>In solemn speed the bird majestic flew</a>
<a id='line_9752'>Full dexter to the car; the prosperous sight</a>
<a id='line_9753'>Fill'd every breast with wonder and delight.</a>
<a id='line_9754'></a>
<a id='line_9755'>But Nestor's son the cheerful silence broke,</a>
<a id='line_9756'>And in these words the Spartan chief bespoke:</a>
<a id='line_9757'>"Say if to us the gods these omens send,</a>
<a id='line_9758'>Or fates peculiar to thyself portend?"</a>
<a id='line_9759'></a>
<a id='line_9760'>Whilst yet the monarch paused, with doubts oppress'd</a>
<a id='line_9761'>The beauteous queen relieved his labouring breast:</a>
<a id='line_9762'>"Hear me (she cried), to whom the gods have given</a>
<a id='line_9763'>To read this sign, and mystic sense of heaven,</a>
<a id='line_9764'>As thus the plumy sovereign of the air</a>
<a id='line_9765'>Left on the mountain's brow his callow care,</a>
<a id='line_9766'>And wander'd through the wide ethereal way</a>
<a id='line_9767'>To pour his wrath on yon luxurious prey;</a>
<a id='line_9768'>So shall thy godlike father, toss'd in vain</a>
<a id='line_9769'>Through all the dangers of the boundless main,</a>
<a id='line_9770'>Arrive (or if perchance already come)</a>
<a id='line_9771'>From slaughter'd gluttons to release the dome."</a>
<a id='line_9772'></a>
<a id='line_9773'>"Oh! if this promised bliss by thundering Jove</a>
<a id='line_9774'>(The prince replied) stand fix'd in fate above;</a>
<a id='line_9775'>To thee, as to some god, I'll temples raise.</a>
<a id='line_9776'>And crown thy altars with the costly blaze."</a>
<a id='line_9777'></a>
<a id='line_9778'>He said; and bending o'er his chariot, flung</a>
<a id='line_9779'>Athwart the fiery steeds the smarting thong;</a>
<a id='line_9780'>The bounding shafts upon the harness play,</a>
<a id='line_9781'>Till night descending intercepts the way.</a>
<a id='line_9782'>To Diocles at Pherae they repair,</a>
<a id='line_9783'>Whose boasted sire was sacred Alpheus' heir;</a>
<a id='line_9784'>With him all night the youthful stranger stay'd,</a>
<a id='line_9785'>Nor found the hospitable rites unpaid,</a>
<a id='line_9786'>But soon as morning from her orient bed</a>
<a id='line_9787'>Had tinged the mountains with her earliest red,</a>
<a id='line_9788'>They join'd the steeds, and on the chariot sprung,</a>
<a id='line_9789'>The brazen portals in their passage rung.</a>
<a id='line_9790'></a>
<a id='line_9791'>To Pylos soon they came; when thus begun</a>
<a id='line_9792'>To Nestor's heir Ulysses' godlike son:</a>
<a id='line_9793'></a>
<a id='line_9794'>"Let not Pisistratus in vain be press'd,</a>
<a id='line_9795'>Nor unconsenting hear his friend's request;</a>
<a id='line_9796'>His friend by long hereditary claim,</a>
<a id='line_9797'>In toils his equal, and in years the same.</a>
<a id='line_9798'>No farther from our vessel, I implore,</a>
<a id='line_9799'>The courses drive; but lash them to the shore.</a>
<a id='line_9800'>Too long thy father would his friend detain;</a>
<a id='line_9801'>I dread his proffer'd kindness urged in vain."</a>
<a id='line_9802'></a>
<a id='line_9803'>The hero paused, and ponder'd this request,</a>
<a id='line_9804'>While love and duty warr'd within his breast.</a>
<a id='line_9805'>At length resolved, he turn'd his ready hand,</a>
<a id='line_9806'>And lash'd his panting coursers to the strand.</a>
<a id='line_9807'>There, while within the poop with care he stored</a>
<a id='line_9808'>The regal presents of the Spartan lord,</a>
<a id='line_9809'>"With speed begone (said he); call every mate,</a>
<a id='line_9810'>Ere yet to Nestor I the tale relate:</a>
<a id='line_9811'>'Tis true, the fervour of his generous heart</a>
<a id='line_9812'>Brooks no repulse, nor couldst thou soon depart:</a>
<a id='line_9813'>Himself will seek thee here, nor wilt thou find,</a>
<a id='line_9814'>In words alone, the Pylian monarch kind.</a>
<a id='line_9815'>But when, arrived, he thy return shall know</a>
<a id='line_9816'>How will his breast with honest fury glow!"</a>
<a id='line_9817'>This said, the sounding strokes his horses fire,</a>
<a id='line_9818'>And soon he reached the palace of his sire.</a>
<a id='line_9819'></a>
<a id='line_9820'>"Now (cried Telemachus) with speedy care</a>
<a id='line_9821'>Hoist every sail, and every oar prepare."</a>
<a id='line_9822'>Swift as the word his willing mates obey,</a>
<a id='line_9823'>And seize their seats, impatient for the sea.</a>
<a id='line_9824'></a>
<a id='line_9825'>Meantime the prince with sacrifice adores</a>
<a id='line_9826'>Minerva, and her guardian aid implores;</a>
<a id='line_9827'>When lo! a wretch ran breathless to the shore,</a>
<a id='line_9828'>New from his crime; and reeking yet with gore.</a>
<a id='line_9829'>A seer he was, from great Melampus sprung,</a>
<a id='line_9830'>Melampus, who in Pylos flourish'd long,</a>
<a id='line_9831'>Till, urged by wrongs, a foreign realm he chose,</a>
<a id='line_9832'>Far from the hateful cause of all his woes.</a>
<a id='line_9833'>Neleus his treasures one long year detains,</a>
<a id='line_9834'>As long he groan'd in Philacus' chains:</a>
<a id='line_9835'>Meantime, what anguish and what rage combined</a>
<a id='line_9836'>For lovely Pero rack'd his labouring mind!</a>
<a id='line_9837'>Yet 'scaped he death; and vengeful of his wrong</a>
<a id='line_9838'>To Pylos drove the lowing herds along:</a>
<a id='line_9839'>Then (Neleus vanquish'd, and consign'd the fair</a>
<a id='line_9840'>To Bias' arms) he so sought a foreign air;</a>
<a id='line_9841'>Argos the rich for his retreat he chose,</a>
<a id='line_9842'>There form'd his empire; there his palace rose.</a>
<a id='line_9843'>From him Antiphates and Mantius came:</a>
<a id='line_9844'>The first begot Oicleus great in fame,</a>
<a id='line_9845'>And he Amphiaraus, immortal name!</a>
<a id='line_9846'>The people's saviour, and divinely wise,</a>
<a id='line_9847'>Beloved by Jove, and him who gilds the skies;</a>
<a id='line_9848'>Yet short his date of life! by female pride he dies.</a>
<a id='line_9849'>From Mantius Clitus, whom Aurora's love</a>
<a id='line_9850'>Snatch'd for his beauty to the thrones above;</a>
<a id='line_9851'>And Polyphides, on whom Phoebus shone</a>
<a id='line_9852'>With fullest rays, Amphiaraus now gone;</a>
<a id='line_9853'>In Hyperesia's groves he made abode,</a>
<a id='line_9854'>And taught mankind the counsels of the god.</a>
<a id='line_9855'>From him sprung Theoclymenus, who found</a>
<a id='line_9856'>(The sacred wine yet foaming on the ground)</a>
<a id='line_9857'>Telemachus: whom, as to Heaven he press'd</a>
<a id='line_9858'>His ardent vows, the stranger thus address'd:</a>
<a id='line_9859'></a>
<a id='line_9860'>"O thou! that dost thy happy course prepare</a>
<a id='line_9861'>With pure libations and with solemn prayer:</a>
<a id='line_9862'>By that dread power to whom thy vows are paid;</a>
<a id='line_9863'>By all the lives of these; thy own dear head,</a>
<a id='line_9864'>Declare sincerely to no foe's demand</a>
<a id='line_9865'>Thy name, thy lineage, and paternal land."</a>
<a id='line_9866'></a>
<a id='line_9867'>"Prepare, then (said Telemachus), to know</a>
<a id='line_9868'>A tale from falsehood free, not free from woe.</a>
<a id='line_9869'>From Ithaca, of royal birth I came,</a>
<a id='line_9870'>And great Ulysses (ever honour'd name!)</a>
<a id='line_9871'>Once was my sire, though now, for ever lost,</a>
<a id='line_9872'>In Stygian gloom he glides a pensive ghost!</a>
<a id='line_9873'>Whose fate inquiring through the world we rove;</a>
<a id='line_9874'>The last, the wretched proof of filial love."</a>

<a id='line_9876'>The stranger then: "Nor shall I aught conceal,</a>
<a id='line_9877'>But the dire secret of my fate reveal.</a>
<a id='line_9878'>Of my own tribe an Argive wretch I slew;</a>
<a id='line_9879'>Whose powerful friends the luckless deed pursue</a>

<a id='line_9891'>The chief his order gives: the obedient band,</a>
<a id='line_9892'>With due observance wait the chief's command:</a>
<a id='line_9893'>With speed the mast they rear, with speed unbind</a>
<a id='line_9894'>The spacious sheet, and stretch it to the wind.</a>
<a id='line_9895'>Minerva calls; the ready gales obey</a>
<a id='line_9896'>With rapid speed to whirl them o'er the sea.</a>
<a id='line_9897'>Crunus they pass'd, next Chalcis roll'd away,</a>
<a id='line_9898'>With thickening darkness closed the doubtful day;</a>
<a id='line_9899'>The silver Phaea's glittering rills they lost,</a>

<a id='line_9903'></a>
<a id='line_9904'>Meantime, the king, Eumaeus, and the rest,</a>
<a id='line_9905'>Sate in the cottage, at their rural feast:</a>
<a id='line_9906'>The banquet pass'd, and satiate every man,</a>
<a id='line_9907'>To try his host, Ulysses thus began:</a>

<a id='line_10197'>Swift to the town the well-row'd galley flew:</a>
<a id='line_10198'>The hero trod the margin of the main,</a>

<a id='line_10207'>THE DISCOVERY OF ULYSSES TO TELEMACHUS.</a>
<a id='line_10208'></a>
<a id='line_10209'>Telemachus arriving at the lodge of Eumaeus, sends him to carry</a>
<a id='line_10210'>Penelope the news of his return. Minerva appearing to Ulysses,</a>
<a id='line_10211'>commands him to discover himself to his son. The princes, who had</a>
<a id='line_10212'>lain in ambush to intercept Telemachus in his way, their project</a>
<a id='line_10213'>being defeated, return to Ithaca.</a>
<a id='line_10214'></a>
<a id='line_10215'></a>
<a id='line_10216'></a>
<a id='line_10217'>Soon as the morning blush'd along the plains,</a>
<a id='line_10218'>Ulysses, and the monarch of the swains,</a>
<a id='line_10219'>Awake the sleeping fires, their meals prepare,</a>
<a id='line_10220'>And forth to pasture send the bristly care.</a>
<a id='line_10221'>The prince's near approach the dogs descry,</a>
<a id='line_10222'>And fawning round his feet confess their joy.</a>
<a id='line_10223'>Their gentle blandishment the king survey'd,</a>
<a id='line_10224'>Heard his resounding step, and instant said:</a>
<a id='line_10225'></a>
<a id='line_10226'>"Some well-known friend, Eumaeus, bends this way;</a>
<a id='line_10227'>His steps I hear; the dogs familiar play."</a>
<a id='line_10228'></a>
<a id='line_10229'>While yet he spoke, the prince advancing drew</a>
<a id='line_10230'>Nigh to the lodge, and now appear'd in view.</a>
<a id='line_10231'>Transported from his seat Eumaeus sprung,</a>
<a id='line_10232'>Dropp'd the full bowl, and round his bosom hung;</a>
<a id='line_10233'>Kissing his cheek, his hand, while from his eye</a>
<a id='line_10234'>The tears rain'd copious in a shower of joy,</a>
<a id='line_10235'>As some fond sire who ten long winters grieves,</a>
<a id='line_10236'>From foreign climes an only son receives</a>
<a id='line_10237'>(Child of his age), with strong paternal joy,</a>
<a id='line_10238'>Forward he springs, and clasps the favourite boy:</a>
<a id='line_10239'>So round the youth his arms Eumaeus spread,</a>
<a id='line_10240'>As if the grave had given him from the dead.</a>
<a id='line_10241'></a>
<a id='line_10242'>"And is it thou? my ever-dear delight!</a>
<a id='line_10243'>Oh, art thou come to bless my longing sight?</a>
<a id='line_10244'>Never, I never hoped to view this day,</a>
<a id='line_10245'>When o'er the waves you plough'd the desperate way.</a>
<a id='line_10246'>Enter, my child! Beyond my hopes restored,</a>
<a id='line_10247'>Oh give these eyes to feast upon their lord.</a>
<a id='line_10248'>Enter, oh seldom seen! for lawless powers</a>
<a id='line_10249'>Too much detain thee from these sylvan bowers,"</a>
<a id='line_10250'>The prince replied: "Eumaeus, I obey;</a>
<a id='line_10251'>To seek thee, friend, I hither took my way.</a>
<a id='line_10252'>But say, if in the court the queen reside</a>
<a id='line_10253'>Severely chaste, or if commenced a bride?"</a>
<a id='line_10254'></a>
<a id='line_10255'>Thus he; and thus the monarch of the swains:</a>
<a id='line_10256'>"Severely chaste Penelope remains;</a>
<a id='line_10257'>But, lost to every joy, she wastes the day</a>
<a id='line_10258'>In tedious cares, and weeps the night away."</a>
<a id='line_10259'></a>
<a id='line_10260'>He ended, and (receiving as they pass</a>
<a id='line_10261'>The javelin pointed with a star of brass),</a>
<a id='line_10262'>They reach'd the dome; the dome with marble shined.</a>
<a id='line_10263'>His seat Ulysses to the prince resign'd.</a>
<a id='line_10264'>"Not so (exclaims the prince with decent grace)</a>
<a id='line_10265'>For me, this house shall find an humbler place:</a>
<a id='line_10266'>To usurp the honours due to silver hairs</a>
<a id='line_10267'>And reverend strangers modest youth forbears."</a>
<a id='line_10268'>Instant the swain the spoils of beasts supplies,</a>
<a id='line_10269'>And bids the rural throne with osiers rise.</a>
<a id='line_10270'>There sate the prince: the feast Eumaeus spread,</a>
<a id='line_10271'>And heap'd the shining canisters with bread.</a>
<a id='line_10272'>Thick o'er the board the plenteous viands lay,</a>
<a id='line_10273'>The frugal remnants of the former day.</a>
<a id='line_10274'>Then in a bowl he tempers generous wines,</a>
<a id='line_10275'>Around whose verge a mimic ivy twines.</a>
<a id='line_10276'>And now, the rage of thirst and hunger fled,</a>
<a id='line_10277'>Thus young Ulysses to Eumaeus said:</a>
<a id='line_10278'></a>
<a id='line_10279'>"Whence, father, from what shore this stranger, say?</a>
<a id='line_10280'>What vessel bore him o'er the watery way?</a>
<a id='line_10281'>To human step our land impervious lies,</a>
<a id='line_10282'>And round the coast circumfluent oceans rise."</a>
<a id='line_10283'></a>
<a id='line_10284'>The swain returns: "A tale of sorrows hear:</a>
<a id='line_10285'>In spacious Crete he drew his natal air;</a>
<a id='line_10286'>Long doom'd to wander o'er the land and main,</a>
<a id='line_10287'>For Heaven has wove his thread of life with pain.</a>
<a id='line_10288'>Half breathless 'scaping to the land he flew</a>
<a id='line_10289'>From Thesprot mariners, a murderous crew.</a>
<a id='line_10290'>To thee, my son, the suppliant I resign;</a>
<a id='line_10291'>I gave him my protection, grant him thine."</a>
<a id='line_10292'></a>
<a id='line_10293'>"Hard task (he cries) thy virtue gives thy friend,</a>
<a id='line_10294'>Willing to aid, unable to defend.</a>
<a id='line_10295'>Can strangers safely in the court reside,</a>
<a id='line_10296'>'Midst the swell'd insolence of lust and pride?</a>
<a id='line_10297'>E'en I unsafe: the queen in doubt to wed,</a>
<a id='line_10298'>Or pay due honours to the nuptial bed.</a>
<a id='line_10299'>Perhaps she weds regardless of her fame,</a>
<a id='line_10300'>Deaf to the mighty Ulyssean name.</a>
<a id='line_10301'>However, stranger! from our grace receive</a>
<a id='line_10302'>Such honours as befit a prince to give;</a>
<a id='line_10303'>Sandals, a sword and robes, respect to prove,</a>
<a id='line_10304'>And safe to sail with ornaments of love.</a>
<a id='line_10305'>Till then, thy guest amid the rural train,</a>
<a id='line_10306'>Far from the court, from danger far, detain.</a>
<a id='line_10307'>'Tis mine with food the hungry to supply,</a>
<a id='line_10308'>And clothe the naked from the inclement sky.</a>
<a id='line_10309'>Here dwell in safety from the suitors' wrongs,</a>
<a id='line_10310'>And the rude insults of ungovern'd tongues.</a>
<a id='line_10311'>For should'st thou suffer, powerless to relieve,</a>
<a id='line_10312'>I must behold it, and can only grieve.</a>
<a id='line_10313'>The brave, encompass'd by an hostile train,</a>
<a id='line_10314'>O'erpower'd by numbers, is but brave in vain."</a>
<a id='line_10315'></a>
<a id='line_10316'>To whom, while anger in his bosom glows,</a>
<a id='line_10317'>With warmth replies the man of mighty woes:</a>
<a id='line_10318'>"Since audience mild is deign'd, permit my tongue</a>
<a id='line_10319'>At once to pity and resent thy wrong.</a>
<a id='line_10320'>My heart weeps blood to see a soul so brave</a>
<a id='line_10321'>Live to base insolence or power a slave,</a>
<a id='line_10322'>But tell me, dost thou, prince, dost thou behold,</a>
<a id='line_10323'>And hear their midnight revels uncontroll'd?</a>
<a id='line_10324'>Say, do thy subjects in bold faction rise,</a>
<a id='line_10325'>Or priests in fabled oracles advise?</a>
<a id='line_10326'>Or are thy brothers, who should aid thy power,</a>
<a id='line_10327'>Turn'd mean deserters in the needful hour?</a>
<a id='line_10328'>Oh that I were from great Ulysses sprung,</a>
<a id='line_10329'>Or that these wither'd nerves like thine were strung,</a>
<a id='line_10330'>Or, heavens! might he return! (and soon appear</a>
<a id='line_10331'>He shall, I trust; a hero scorns despair:)</a>
<a id='line_10332'>Might he return, I yield my life a prey</a>
<a id='line_10333'>To my worst foe, if that avenging day</a>
<a id='line_10334'>Be not their last: but should I lose my life,</a>
<a id='line_10335'>Oppress'd by numbers in the glorious strife,</a>
<a id='line_10336'>I chose the nobler part, and yield my breath,</a>
<a id='line_10337'>Rather than bear dishonor, worse than death;</a>
<a id='line_10338'>Than see the hand of violence invade</a>
<a id='line_10339'>The reverend stranger and the spotless maid;</a>
<a id='line_10340'>Than see the wealth of kings consumed in waste,</a>
<a id='line_10341'>The drunkard's revel, and the gluttons' feast."</a>
<a id='line_10342'></a>
<a id='line_10343'>Thus he, with anger flashing from his eye;</a>
<a id='line_10344'>Sincere the youthful hero made reply:</a>
<a id='line_10345'>"Nor leagued in factious arms my subjects rise,</a>
<a id='line_10346'>Nor priests in fabled oracles advise;</a>
<a id='line_10347'>Nor are my brothers, who should aid my power,</a>
<a id='line_10348'>Turn'd mean deserters in the needful hour.</a>
<a id='line_10349'>Ah me! I boast no brother; heaven's dread King</a>
<a id='line_10350'>Gives from our stock an only branch to spring:</a>
<a id='line_10351'>Alone Laertes reign'd Arcesius' heir,</a>
<a id='line_10352'>Alone Ulysses drew the vital air,</a>
<a id='line_10353'>And I alone the bed connubial graced,</a>
<a id='line_10354'>An unbless'd offspring of a sire unbless'd!</a>
<a id='line_10355'>Each neighbouring realm, conducive to our woe,</a>
<a id='line_10356'>Sends forth her peers, and every peer a foe:</a>
<a id='line_10357'>The court proud Samos and Dulichium fills,</a>
<a id='line_10358'>And lofty Zacinth crown'd with shady hills.</a>
<a id='line_10359'>E'en Ithaca and all her lords invade</a>
<a id='line_10360'>The imperial sceptre, and the regal bed:</a>
<a id='line_10361'>The queen, averse to love, yet awed by power,</a>
<a id='line_10362'>Seems half to yield, yet flies the bridal hour:</a>
<a id='line_10363'>Meantime their licence uncontroll'd I bear;</a>
<a id='line_10364'>E'en now they envy me the vital air:</a>
<a id='line_10365'>But Heaven will sure revenge, and gods there are.</a>
<a id='line_10366'></a>
<a id='line_10367'>"But go Eumaeus! to the queen impart</a>
<a id='line_10368'>Our safe return, and ease a mother's heart.</a>
<a id='line_10369'>Yet secret go; for numerous are my foes,</a>
<a id='line_10370'>And here at least I may in peace repose."</a>
<a id='line_10371'></a>
<a id='line_10372'>To whom the swain: "I hear and I obey:</a>
<a id='line_10373'>But old Laertes weeps his life away,</a>
<a id='line_10374'>And deems thee lost: shall I speed employ</a>

<a id='line_10376'>The mournful hour that tore his son away</a>
<a id='line_10377'>Sent the sad sire in solitude to stray;</a>
<a id='line_10378'>Yet busied with his slaves, to ease his woe,</a>
<a id='line_10379'>He dress'd the vine, and bade the garden blow,</a>
<a id='line_10380'>Nor food nor wine refused; but since the day</a>
<a id='line_10381'>That you to Pylos plough'd the watery way,</a>
<a id='line_10382'>Nor wine nor food he tastes; but, sunk in woes,</a>
<a id='line_10383'>Wild springs the vine, no more the garden blows,</a>
<a id='line_10384'>Shut from the walks of men, to pleasure lost,</a>
<a id='line_10385'>Pensive and pale he wanders half a ghost."</a>
<a id='line_10386'></a>
<a id='line_10387'>"Wretched old man! (with tears the prince returns)</a>
<a id='line_10388'>Yet cease to go--what man so blest but mourns?</a>
<a id='line_10389'>Were every wish indulged by favouring skies,</a>
<a id='line_10390'>This hour should give Ulysses to my eyes.</a>

<a id='line_10395'></a>
<a id='line_10396'>While yet he spoke, impatient of delay,</a>
<a id='line_10397'>He braced his sandals on, and strode away:</a>
<a id='line_10398'>Then from the heavens the martial goddess flies</a>
<a id='line_10399'>Through the wild fields of air, and cleaves the skies:</a>
<a id='line_10400'>In form, a virgin in soft beauty's bloom,</a>
<a id='line_10401'>Skill'd in the illustrious labours of the loom.</a>
<a id='line_10402'>Alone to Ithaca she stood display'd,</a>
<a id='line_10403'>But unapparent as a viewless shade</a>
<a id='line_10404'>Escaped Telemachus (the powers above,</a>
<a id='line_10405'>Seen or unseen, o'er earth at pleasure move):</a>
<a id='line_10406'>The dogs intelligent confess'd the tread</a>
<a id='line_10407'>Of power divine, and howling, trembling, fled.</a>
<a id='line_10408'>The goddess, beckoning, waves her deathless hands:</a>
<a id='line_10409'>Dauntless the king before the goddess stands:</a>
<a id='line_10410'></a>
<a id='line_10411'>"Then why (she said), O favour'd of the skies!</a>
<a id='line_10412'>Why to thy godlike son this long disguise?</a>
<a id='line_10413'>Stand forth reveal'd; with him thy cares employ</a>
<a id='line_10414'>Against thy foes; be valiant and destroy!</a>
<a id='line_10415'>Lo! I descend in that avenging hour,</a>
<a id='line_10416'>To combat by thy side, thy guardian power."</a>
<a id='line_10417'></a>
<a id='line_10418'>She said, and o'er him waves her wand of gold</a>
<a id='line_10419'>Imperial robes his manly limbs infold;</a>
<a id='line_10420'>At once with grace divine his frame improves;</a>
<a id='line_10421'>At once with majesty enlarged he moves:</a>
<a id='line_10422'>Youth flush'd his reddening cheek, and from his brows</a>
<a id='line_10423'>A length of hair in sable ringlets flows;</a>
<a id='line_10424'>His blackening chin receives a deeper shade;</a>
<a id='line_10425'>Then from his eyes upsprung the warrior-maid.</a>
<a id='line_10426'></a>
<a id='line_10427'>The hero reascends: the prince o'erawed</a>
<a id='line_10428'>Scarce lifts his eyes, and bows as to a god,</a>
<a id='line_10429'>Then with surprise (surprise chastised by fears):</a>
<a id='line_10430'>"How art thou changed! (he cried)--a god appears!</a>
<a id='line_10431'>Far other vests thy limbs majestic grace,</a>
<a id='line_10432'>Far other glories lighten from thy face!</a>
<a id='line_10433'>If heaven be thy abode, with pious care,</a>
<a id='line_10434'>Lo! I the ready sacrifice prepare:</a>
<a id='line_10435'>Lo! gifts of labour'd gold adorn thy shrine,</a>

<a id='line_10437'></a>
<a id='line_10438'>"Few are my days (Ulysses made reply),</a>

<a id='line_10444'></a>
<a id='line_10445'>Then, rushing to his arms, he kiss'd his boy</a>

<a id='line_10470'></a>
<a id='line_10471'>He spoke and sate. The prince with transport flew,</a>
<a id='line_10472'>Hung round his neck, while tears his cheek bedew;</a>
<a id='line_10473'>Nor less the father pour'd a social flood;</a>
<a id='line_10474'>They wept abundant, and they wept aloud.</a>
<a id='line_10475'>As the bold eagle with fierce sorrow stung,</a>
<a id='line_10476'>Or parent vulture, mourns her ravish'd young;</a>
<a id='line_10477'>They cry, they scream, their unfledged brood a prey</a>
<a id='line_10478'>To some rude churl, and borne by stealth away:</a>
<a id='line_10479'>So they aloud: and tears in tides had run,</a>
<a id='line_10480'>Their grief unfinish'd with the setting sun;</a>
<a id='line_10481'>But checking the full torrent in its flow,</a>
<a id='line_10482'>The prince thus interrupts the solemn woe.</a>
<a id='line_10483'>"What ship transported thee, O father, say;</a>
<a id='line_10484'>And what bless'd hands have oar'd thee on the way?"</a>

<a id='line_10733'>The martial goddess to Ulysses flies:</a>
<a id='line_10734'>She waves her golden wand, and reassumes</a>

<a id='line_10738'>Lest to the queen the swain with transport fly,</a>
<a id='line_10739'>Unable to contain the unruly joy;</a>

<a id='line_10768'></a>
<a id='line_10769'>Telemachus returning to the city, relates to Penelope the sum of</a>
<a id='line_10770'>his travels. Ulysses is conducted by Eumaeus to the palace, where</a>
<a id='line_10771'>his old dog Argus acknowledges his master, after an absence of</a>
<a id='line_10772'>twenty years, and dies with joy. Eumaeus returns into the country,</a>
<a id='line_10773'>and Ulysses remains among the suitors, whose behaviour is</a>
<a id='line_10774'>described.</a>
<a id='line_10775'></a>
<a id='line_10776'></a>
<a id='line_10777'></a>
<a id='line_10778'>Soon as Aurora, daughter of the dawn,</a>
<a id='line_10779'>Sprinkled with roseate light the dewy lawn,</a>
<a id='line_10780'>In haste the prince arose, prepared to part;</a>
<a id='line_10781'>His hand impatient grasps the pointed dart;</a>
<a id='line_10782'>Fair on his feet the polish'd sandals shine,</a>
<a id='line_10783'>And thus he greets the master of the swine:</a>
<a id='line_10784'></a>
<a id='line_10785'>"My friend, adieu! let this short stay suffice;</a>
<a id='line_10786'>I haste to meet my mother's longing eyes,</a>
<a id='line_10787'>And end her tears, her sorrows and her sighs.</a>
<a id='line_10788'>But thou, attentive, what we order heed:</a>
<a id='line_10789'>This hapless stranger to the city lead:</a>
<a id='line_10790'>By public bounty let him there be fed,</a>
<a id='line_10791'>And bless the hand that stretches forth the bread.</a>
<a id='line_10792'>To wipe the tears from all afflicted eyes,</a>
<a id='line_10793'>My will may covet, but my power denies.</a>
<a id='line_10794'>If this raise anger in the stranger's thought,</a>
<a id='line_10795'>The pain of anger punishes the fault:</a>
<a id='line_10796'>The very truth I undisguised declare;</a>
<a id='line_10797'>For what so easy as to be sincere?"</a>
<a id='line_10798'></a>
<a id='line_10799'>To this Ulysses: "What the prince requires</a>
<a id='line_10800'>Of swift removal, seconds my desires.</a>
<a id='line_10801'>To want like mine the peopled town can yield</a>
<a id='line_10802'>More hopes of comfort than the lonely field:</a>
<a id='line_10803'>Nor fits my age to till the labour'd lands,</a>
<a id='line_10804'>Or stoop to tasks a rural lord demands.</a>
<a id='line_10805'>Adieu! but since this ragged garb can bear</a>
<a id='line_10806'>So ill the inclemencies of morning air,</a>
<a id='line_10807'>A few hours' space permit me here to stay:</a>
<a id='line_10808'>My steps Eumaeus shall to town convey,</a>
<a id='line_10809'>With riper beams when Phoebus warms the day."</a>
<a id='line_10810'></a>
<a id='line_10811'>Thus he: nor aught Telemachus replied,</a>
<a id='line_10812'>But left the mansion with a lofty stride:</a>
<a id='line_10813'>Schemes of revenge his pondering breast elate,</a>
<a id='line_10814'>Revolving deep the suitors' sudden fate,</a>
<a id='line_10815'>Arriving now before the imperial hall,</a>
<a id='line_10816'>He props his spear against the pillar'd wall;</a>
<a id='line_10817'>Then like a lion o'er the threshold bounds;</a>
<a id='line_10818'>The marble pavement with his steps resounds:</a>
<a id='line_10819'>His eye first glanced where Euryclea spreads</a>
<a id='line_10820'>With furry spoils of beasts the splendid beds:</a>
<a id='line_10821'>She saw, she wept, she ran with eager pace,</a>
<a id='line_10822'>And reach'd her master with a long embrace.</a>
<a id='line_10823'>All crowded round, the family appears</a>
<a id='line_10824'>With wild entrancement, and ecstatic tears.</a>
<a id='line_10825'>Swift from above descends the royal fair</a>
<a id='line_10826'>(Her beauteous cheeks the blush of Venus wear,</a>
<a id='line_10827'>Chasten'd with coy Diana's pensive air);</a>
<a id='line_10828'>Hangs o'er her son, in his embraces dies;</a>
<a id='line_10829'>Rains kisses on his neck, his face, his eyes:</a>
<a id='line_10830'>Few words she spoke, though much she had to say;</a>

<a id='line_10956'></a>
<a id='line_10957'>He ceased; nor made the pensive queen reply,</a>

<a id='line_10978'>(Scene of their insolence) the lords resort:</a>
<a id='line_10979'>Athwart the spacious square each tries his art,</a>
<a id='line_10980'>To whirl the disk, or aim the missile dart.</a>
<a id='line_10981'>Now did the hour of sweet repast arrive,</a>
<a id='line_10982'>And from the field the victim flocks they drive:</a>
<a id='line_10983'>Medon the herald (one who pleased them best,</a>

<a id='line_10985'>To bid the banquet, interrupts their play:</a>
<a id='line_10986'>Swift to the hall they haste; aside they lay</a>
<a id='line_10987'>Their garments, and succinct the victims slay.</a>
<a id='line_10988'>Then sheep, and goats, and bristly porkers bled,</a>
<a id='line_10989'>And the proud steer was o'er the marble spread.</a>
<a id='line_10990'>While thus the copious banquet they provide,</a>
<a id='line_10991'>Along the road, conversing side by side,</a>
<a id='line_10992'>Proceed Ulysses and the faithful swain;</a>

<a id='line_11007'>Across his shoulders then the scrip he flung,</a>
<a id='line_11008'>Wide-patch'd, and fasten'd by a twisted thong.</a>
<a id='line_11009'>A staff Eumaeus gave. Along the way</a>
<a id='line_11010'>Cheerly they fare: behind, the keepers stay:</a>
<a id='line_11011'>These with their watchful dogs (a constant guard)</a>
<a id='line_11012'>Supply his absence, and attend the herd.</a>
<a id='line_11013'>And now his city strikes the monarch's eyes,</a>
<a id='line_11014'>Alas! how changed! a man of miseries;</a>
<a id='line_11015'>Propp'd on a staff, a beggar old and bare</a>
<a id='line_11016'>In rags dishonest fluttering with the air!</a>
<a id='line_11017'>Now pass'd the rugged road, they journey down</a>
<a id='line_11018'>The cavern'd way descending to the town,</a>
<a id='line_11019'>Where, from the rock, with liquid drops distils</a>
<a id='line_11020'>A limpid fount; that spread in parting rills</a>
<a id='line_11021'>Its current thence to serve the city brings;</a>
<a id='line_11022'>An useful work, adorn'd by ancient kings.</a>
<a id='line_11023'>Neritus, Ithacus, Polyctor, there,</a>
<a id='line_11024'>In sculptured stone immortalized their care,</a>
<a id='line_11025'>In marble urns received it from above,</a>
<a id='line_11026'>And shaded with a green surrounding grove;</a>

<a id='line_11028'>Drink the cool stream, and tremble to the wind.</a>
<a id='line_11029'>Beneath, sequester'd to the nymphs, is seen</a>
<a id='line_11030'>A mossy altar, deep embower'd in green;</a>
<a id='line_11031'>Where constant vows by travellers are paid,</a>
<a id='line_11032'>And holy horrors solemnize the shade.</a>
<a id='line_11033'></a>
<a id='line_11034'>Here with his goats (not vow'd to sacred fame,</a>
<a id='line_11035'>But pamper'd luxury) Melanthias came:</a>
<a id='line_11036'>Two grooms attend him. With an envious look</a>
<a id='line_11037'>He eyed the stranger, and imperious spoke:</a>

<a id='line_11039'>"The good old proverb how this pair fulfil!</a>
<a id='line_11040'>One rogue is usher to another still.</a>

<a id='line_11044'>That giant-glutton, dreadful at a feast!</a>
<a id='line_11045'>Full many a post have those broad shoulders worn,</a>

<a id='line_11049'>To beg, than work, he better understands,</a>
<a id='line_11050'>Or we perhaps might take him off thy hands.</a>
<a id='line_11051'>For any office could the slave be good,</a>
<a id='line_11052'>To cleanse the fold, or help the kids to food.</a>
<a id='line_11053'>If any labour those big joints could learn,</a>
<a id='line_11054'>Some whey, to wash his bowels, he might earn.</a>

<a id='line_11060'>With many a footstool thundering at thy head."</a>
<a id='line_11061'></a>
<a id='line_11062'>He thus: nor insolent of word alone,</a>
<a id='line_11063'>Spurn'd with his rustic heel his king unknown;</a>
<a id='line_11064'>Spurn'd, but not moved: he like a pillar stood,</a>
<a id='line_11065'>Nor stirr'd an inch, contemptuous, from the road:</a>
<a id='line_11066'>Doubtful, or with his staff to strike him dead,</a>
<a id='line_11067'>Or greet the pavement with his worthless head.</a>
<a id='line_11068'>Short was that doubt; to quell his rage inured,</a>
<a id='line_11069'>The hero stood self-conquer'd, and endured.</a>
<a id='line_11070'>But hateful of the wretch, Eumaeus heaved</a>
<a id='line_11071'>His hands obtesting, and this prayer conceived:</a>
<a id='line_11072'>"Daughters of Jove! who from the ethereal bowers</a>

<a id='line_11079'>Oh, be some god his convoy to our shore!</a>
<a id='line_11080'>Due pains shall punish then this slave's offence,</a>
<a id='line_11081'>And humble all his airs of insolence,</a>
<a id='line_11082'>Who, proudly stalking, leaves the herds at large,</a>
<a id='line_11083'>Commences courtier, and neglects his charge."</a>
<a id='line_11084'></a>
<a id='line_11085'>"What mutters he? (Melanthius sharp rejoins;)</a>
<a id='line_11086'>This crafty miscreant, big with dark designs?</a>
<a id='line_11087'>The day shall come--nay, 'tis already near--</a>

<a id='line_11095'></a>
<a id='line_11096'>So spoke the wretch, but, shunning farther fray,</a>
<a id='line_11097'>Turn'd his proud step, and left them on their way.</a>
<a id='line_11098'>Straight to the feastful palace he repair'd,</a>
<a id='line_11099'>Familiar enter'd, and the banquet shared;</a>
<a id='line_11100'>Beneath Eurymachus, his patron lord,</a>
<a id='line_11101'>He took his place, and plenty heap'd the board.</a>
<a id='line_11102'></a>
<a id='line_11103'>Meantime they heard, soft circling in the sky</a>
<a id='line_11104'>Sweet airs ascend, and heavenly minstrelsy</a>
<a id='line_11105'>(For Phemius to the lyre attuned the strain):</a>
<a id='line_11106'>Ulysses hearken'd, then address'd the swain:</a>
<a id='line_11107'></a>
<a id='line_11108'>"Well may this palace admiration claim,</a>
<a id='line_11109'>Great and respondent to the master's fame!</a>

<a id='line_11118'></a>
<a id='line_11119'>Then thus Eumaeus: "Judge we which were best;</a>
<a id='line_11120'>Amidst yon revellers a sudden guest</a>
<a id='line_11121'>Choose you to mingle, while behind I stay?</a>

<a id='line_11124'>This is the house of violence and wrong:</a>

<a id='line_11140'></a>
<a id='line_11141'>Thus, near the gates conferring as they drew,</a>

<a id='line_11145'>Bred by Ulysses, nourish'd at his board,</a>
<a id='line_11146'>But, ah! not fated long to please his lord;</a>
<a id='line_11147'>To him, his swiftness and his strength were vain;</a>
<a id='line_11148'>The voice of glory call'd him o'er the main.</a>
<a id='line_11149'>Till then in every sylvan chase renown'd,</a>
<a id='line_11150'>With Argus, Argus, rung the woods around;</a>
<a id='line_11151'>With him the youth pursued the goat or fawn,</a>

<a id='line_11156'>Obscene with reptiles, took his sordid bed.</a>

<a id='line_11159'>In vain he strove to crawl and kiss his feet;</a>
<a id='line_11160'>Yet (all he could) his tail, his tears, his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_11161'>Salute his master, and confess his joys.</a>
<a id='line_11162'>Soft pity touch'd the mighty master's soul;</a>
<a id='line_11163'>Adown his cheek a tear unbidden stole,</a>
<a id='line_11164'>Stole unperceived: he turn'd his head and dried</a>
<a id='line_11165'>The drop humane: then thus impassion'd cried:</a>

<a id='line_11194'></a>
<a id='line_11195'>This said, the honest herdsman strode before;</a>
<a id='line_11196'>The musing monarch pauses at the door:</a>
<a id='line_11197'>The dog, whom Fate had granted to behold</a>
<a id='line_11198'>His lord, when twenty tedious years had roll'd,</a>
<a id='line_11199'>Takes a last look, and having seen him, dies;</a>
<a id='line_11200'>So closed for ever faithful Argus' eyes!</a>
<a id='line_11201'></a>
<a id='line_11202'>And now Telemachus, the first of all,</a>
<a id='line_11203'>Observed Eumaeus entering in the hall;</a>
<a id='line_11204'>Distant he saw, across the shady dome;</a>
<a id='line_11205'>Then gave a sign, and beckon'd him to come:</a>
<a id='line_11206'>There stood an empty seat, where late was placed,</a>
<a id='line_11207'>In order due, the steward of the feast,</a>
<a id='line_11208'>(Who now was busied carving round the board,)</a>
<a id='line_11209'>Eumaeus took, and placed it near his lord.</a>
<a id='line_11210'>Before him instant was the banquet spread,</a>
<a id='line_11211'>And the bright basket piled with loaves of bread.</a>
<a id='line_11212'></a>
<a id='line_11213'>Next came Ulysses lowly at the door,</a>
<a id='line_11214'>A figure despicable, old, and poor.</a>
<a id='line_11215'>In squalid vests, with many a gaping rent,</a>
<a id='line_11216'>Propp'd or a staff, and trembling as he went.</a>
<a id='line_11217'>Then, resting on the threshold of the gate,</a>
<a id='line_11218'>Against a cypress pillar lean'd his weight</a>
<a id='line_11219'>Smooth'd by the workman to a polish'd plane);</a>
<a id='line_11220'>The thoughtful son beheld, and call'd his swain</a>
<a id='line_11221'></a>
<a id='line_11222'>"These viands, and this bread, Eumaeus! bear,</a>
<a id='line_11223'>And let yon mendicant our plenty share:</a>
<a id='line_11224'>And let him circle round the suitors' board,</a>
<a id='line_11225'>And try the bounty of each gracious lord.</a>
<a id='line_11226'>Bold let him ask, encouraged thus by me:</a>
<a id='line_11227'>How ill, alas! do want and shame agree!"</a>
<a id='line_11228'></a>
<a id='line_11229'>His lord's command the faithful servant bears:</a>

<a id='line_11235'>Long has the minstrel swept the sounding wire,</a>
<a id='line_11236'>He fed, and ceased when silence held the lyre.</a>
<a id='line_11237'>Soon as the suitors from the banquet rose,</a>
<a id='line_11238'>Minerva prompts the man of mighty woes</a>
<a id='line_11239'>To tempt their bounties with a suppliant's art,</a>

<a id='line_11265'></a>
<a id='line_11266'>To whom the hospitable swain rejoins:</a>
<a id='line_11267'>"Thy passion, prince, belies thy knowing mind.</a>

<a id='line_11269'>The poor, distinguish'd by their wants alone?</a>
<a id='line_11270'>Round the wide world are sought those men divine</a>
<a id='line_11271'>Who public structures raise, or who design;</a>
<a id='line_11272'>Those to whose eyes the gods their ways reveal,</a>
<a id='line_11273'>Or bless with salutary arts to heal;</a>

<a id='line_11279'>A wretch unhappy, merely for his need!</a>
<a id='line_11280'>Unjust to me, and all that serve the state,</a>

<a id='line_11287'>Injurious minds just answers but provoke"--</a>
<a id='line_11288'>Then turning to Antinous, thus he spoke:</a>

<a id='line_11296'>So much more sweet to spoil than to bestow?"</a>
<a id='line_11297'></a>
<a id='line_11298'>"Whence, great Telemachus! this lofty strain?</a>
<a id='line_11299'>(Antinous cries with insolent disdain):</a>
<a id='line_11300'>Portions like mine if every suitor gave,</a>
<a id='line_11301'>Our walls this twelvemonth should not see the slave."</a>
<a id='line_11302'></a>
<a id='line_11303'>He spoke, and lifting high above the board</a>
<a id='line_11304'>His ponderous footstool, shook it at his lord.</a>
<a id='line_11305'>The rest with equal hand conferr'd the bread:</a>
<a id='line_11306'>He fill'd his scrip, and to the threshold sped;</a>
<a id='line_11307'>But first before Antinous stopp'd, and said:</a>
<a id='line_11308'>"Bestow, my friend! thou dost not seem the worst</a>

<a id='line_11313'>Whate'er gives man the envied name of great;</a>
<a id='line_11314'>Wealth, servants, friends, were mine in better days</a>
<a id='line_11315'>And hospitality was then my praise;</a>
<a id='line_11316'>In every sorrowing soul I pour'd delight,</a>
<a id='line_11317'>And poverty stood smiling in my sight.</a>
<a id='line_11318'>But Jove, all-governing, whose only will</a>
<a id='line_11319'>Determines fate, and mingles good with ill,</a>
<a id='line_11320'>Sent me (to punish my pursuit of gain)</a>
<a id='line_11321'>With roving pirates o'er the Egyptian main</a>
<a id='line_11322'>By Egypt's silver flood our ships we moor;</a>

<a id='line_11324'>But impotent of mind, the lawless will</a>
<a id='line_11325'>The country ravage, and the natives kill.</a>
<a id='line_11326'>The spreading clamour to their city flies,</a>
<a id='line_11327'>And horse and foot in mingled tumults rise:</a>
<a id='line_11328'>The reddening dawn reveals the hostile fields,</a>
<a id='line_11329'>Horrid with bristly spears, and gleaming shields:</a>
<a id='line_11330'>Jove thunder'd on their side: our guilty head</a>
<a id='line_11331'>We turn'd to flight; the gathering vengeance spread</a>
<a id='line_11332'>On all parts round, and heaps on heaps lay dead.</a>
<a id='line_11333'>Some few the foe in servitude detain;</a>
<a id='line_11334'>Death ill exchanged for bondage and for pain!</a>
<a id='line_11335'>Unhappy me a Cyprian took aboard,</a>

<a id='line_11361'>He said, and high the whirling tripod flung.</a>
<a id='line_11362'>His shoulder-blade received the ungentle shock;</a>
<a id='line_11363'>He stood, and moved not, like a marble rock;</a>

<a id='line_11529'>THE FIGHT OF ULYSSES AND IRUS.</a>
<a id='line_11530'></a>
<a id='line_11531'>The beggar Irus insults Ulysses; the suitors promote the quarrel,</a>
<a id='line_11532'>in which Irus is worsted, and miserably handled. Penelope</a>
<a id='line_11533'>descends, and receives the presents of the suitors. The dialogue</a>

<a id='line_11536'></a>
<a id='line_11537'></a>
<a id='line_11538'>While fix'd in thought the pensive hero sate,</a>
<a id='line_11539'>A mendicant approach'd the royal gate;</a>
<a id='line_11540'>A surly vagrant of the giant kind,</a>
<a id='line_11541'>The stain of manhood, of a coward mind:</a>
<a id='line_11542'>From feast to feast, insatiate to devour,</a>
<a id='line_11543'>He flew, attendant on the genial hour.</a>
<a id='line_11544'>Him on his mother's knees, when babe he lay,</a>
<a id='line_11545'>She named Arnaeus on his natal day:</a>
<a id='line_11546'>But Irus his associates call'd the boy,</a>
<a id='line_11547'>Practised the common messenger to fly;</a>
<a id='line_11548'>Irus, a name expressive of the employ.</a>
<a id='line_11549'></a>
<a id='line_11550'>From his own roof, with meditated blows,</a>
<a id='line_11551'>He strove to drive the man of mighty woes:</a>

<a id='line_11553'>"Hence, dotard! hence, and timely speed thy way,</a>
<a id='line_11554'>Lest dragg'd in vengeance thou repent thy stay;</a>
<a id='line_11555'>See how with nods assent yon princely train!</a>
<a id='line_11556'>But honouring age, in mercy I refrain:</a>
<a id='line_11557'>In peace away! lest, if persuasions fail,</a>
<a id='line_11558'>This arm with blows more eloquent prevail."</a>
<a id='line_11559'>To whom, with stern regard: "O insolence,</a>
<a id='line_11560'>Indecently to rail without offence!</a>
<a id='line_11561'>What bounty gives without a rival share;</a>
<a id='line_11562'>I ask, what harms not thee, to breathe this air:</a>
<a id='line_11563'>Alike on alms we both precarious live:</a>
<a id='line_11564'>And canst thou envy when the great relieve?</a>
<a id='line_11565'>Know, from the bounteous heavens all riches flow,</a>

<a id='line_11567'>Proud as thou art, henceforth no more be proud,</a>

<a id='line_11571'></a>
<a id='line_11572'>"Mere woman-glutton! (thus the churl replied;)</a>
<a id='line_11573'>A tongue so flippant, with a throat so wide!</a>
<a id='line_11574'>Why cease I gods! to dash those teeth away,</a>
<a id='line_11575'>Like some wild boar's, that, greedy of his prey,</a>
<a id='line_11576'>Uproots the bearded corn? Rise, try the fight,</a>
<a id='line_11577'>Gird well thy loins, approach, and feel my might:</a>

<a id='line_11579'>Unequal fight, when youth contends with age!"</a>
<a id='line_11580'></a>
<a id='line_11581'>Thus in a wordy war their tongues display</a>
<a id='line_11582'>More fierce intents, preluding to the fray;</a>
<a id='line_11583'>Antinous hears, and in a jovial vein,</a>
<a id='line_11584'>Thus with loud laughter to the suitor train:</a>
<a id='line_11585'></a>
<a id='line_11586'>"This happy day in mirth, my friends, employ,</a>
<a id='line_11587'>And lo! the gods conspire to crown our joy;</a>
<a id='line_11588'>See ready for the fight, and hand to hand,</a>
<a id='line_11589'>Yon surly mendicants contentious stand:</a>
<a id='line_11590'>Why urge we not to blows!" Well pleased they spring</a>
<a id='line_11591'>Swift from their seats, and thickening form a ring.</a>
<a id='line_11592'></a>
<a id='line_11593'>To whom Antinous: "Lo! enrich'd with blood,</a>
<a id='line_11594'>A kid's well-fatted entrails (tasteful food)</a>
<a id='line_11595'>On glowing embers lie; on him bestow</a>
<a id='line_11596'>The choicest portion who subdues his foe;</a>
<a id='line_11597'>Grant him unrivall'd in these walls to stay,</a>
<a id='line_11598'>The sole attendant on the genial day."</a>
<a id='line_11599'></a>
<a id='line_11600'>The lords applaud: Ulysses then with art,</a>
<a id='line_11601'>And fears well-feign'd, disguised his dauntless heart.</a>
<a id='line_11602'></a>
<a id='line_11603'>"Worn as I am with age, decay'd with woe;</a>
<a id='line_11604'>Say, is it baseness to decline the foe?</a>
<a id='line_11605'>Hard conflict! when calamity and age</a>
<a id='line_11606'>With vigorous youth, unknown to cares, engage!</a>
<a id='line_11607'>Yet, fearful of disgrace, to try the day</a>
<a id='line_11608'>Imperious hunger bids, and I obey;</a>
<a id='line_11609'>But swear, impartial arbiters of right,</a>
<a id='line_11610'>Swear to stand neutral, while we cope in fight."</a>
<a id='line_11611'></a>
<a id='line_11612'>The peers assent: when straight his sacred head</a>
<a id='line_11613'>Telemachus upraised, and sternly said:</a>
<a id='line_11614'>"Stranger, if prompted to chastise the wrong</a>
<a id='line_11615'>Of this bold insolent, confide, be strong!</a>
<a id='line_11616'>The injurious Greek that dares attempt a blow,</a>
<a id='line_11617'>That instant makes Telemachus his foe;</a>
<a id='line_11618'>And these my friends shall guard the sacred ties</a>
<a id='line_11619'>Of hospitality, for they are wise."</a>
<a id='line_11620'></a>
<a id='line_11621'>Then, girding his strong loins, the king prepares</a>
<a id='line_11622'>To close in combat, and his body bares;</a>
<a id='line_11623'>Broad spread his shoulders, and his nervous thighs</a>
<a id='line_11624'>By just degrees, like well-turn'd columns, rise</a>
<a id='line_11625'>Ample his chest, his arms are round and long,</a>
<a id='line_11626'>And each strong joint Minerva knits more strong</a>
<a id='line_11627'>(Attendant on her chief): the suitor-crowd</a>
<a id='line_11628'>With wonder gaze, and gazing speak aloud:</a>
<a id='line_11629'>"Irus! alas! shall Irus be no more?</a>
<a id='line_11630'>Black fate impends, and this the avenging hour!</a>
<a id='line_11631'>Gods! how his nerves a matchless strength proclaim,</a>
<a id='line_11632'>Swell o'er his well-strong limbs, and brace his frame!"</a>
<a id='line_11633'></a>
<a id='line_11634'>Then pale with fears, and sickening at the sight;</a>
<a id='line_11635'>They dragg'd the unwilling Irus to the fight;</a>
<a id='line_11636'>From his blank visage fled the coward blood,</a>
<a id='line_11637'>And his flesh trembled as aghast he stood.</a>
<a id='line_11638'></a>
<a id='line_11639'>"O that such baseness should disgrace the light?</a>
<a id='line_11640'>O hide it, death, in everlasting night!</a>
<a id='line_11641'>(Exclaims Antinous;) can a vigorous foe</a>
<a id='line_11642'>Meanly decline to combat age and woe?</a>

<a id='line_11645'>Instant thou sail'st, to Eschetus resign'd;</a>
<a id='line_11646'>A tyrant, fiercest of the tyrant kind,</a>
<a id='line_11647'>Who casts thy mangled ears and nose a prey</a>
<a id='line_11648'>To hungry dogs, and lops the man away."</a>
<a id='line_11649'></a>
<a id='line_11650'>While with indignant scorn he sternly spoke,</a>
<a id='line_11651'>In every joint the trembling Irus shook.</a>
<a id='line_11652'>Now front to front each frowning champion stands,</a>
<a id='line_11653'>And poises high in air his adverse hands.</a>
<a id='line_11654'>The chief yet doubts, or to the shades below</a>
<a id='line_11655'>To fell the giant at one vengeful blow,</a>
<a id='line_11656'>Or save his life, and soon his life to save</a>
<a id='line_11657'>The king resolves, for mercy sways the brave</a>
<a id='line_11658'>That instant Irus his huge arm extends,</a>
<a id='line_11659'>Full on his shoulder the rude weight descends;</a>
<a id='line_11660'>The sage Ulysses, fearful to disclose</a>
<a id='line_11661'>The hero latent in the man of woes,</a>
<a id='line_11662'>Check'd half his might; yet rising to the stroke,</a>
<a id='line_11663'>His jawbone dash'd, the crashing jawbone broke:</a>
<a id='line_11664'>Down dropp'd he stupid from the stunning wound;</a>
<a id='line_11665'>His feet extended quivering, beat the ground;</a>
<a id='line_11666'>His mouth and nostrils spout a purple flood;</a>
<a id='line_11667'>His teeth, all shatter'd, rush inmix'd with blood.</a>
<a id='line_11668'></a>
<a id='line_11669'>The peers transported, as outstretch'd he lies,</a>
<a id='line_11670'>With bursts of laughter rend the vaulted skies;</a>
<a id='line_11671'>Then dragg'd along, all bleeding from the wound,</a>
<a id='line_11672'>His length of carcase trailing prints the ground:</a>
<a id='line_11673'>Raised on his feet, again he reels, he falls,</a>
<a id='line_11674'>Till propp'd, reclining on the palace walls:</a>
<a id='line_11675'>Then to his hand a staff the victor gave,</a>
<a id='line_11676'>And thus with just reproach address'd the slave:</a>
<a id='line_11677'>"There terrible, affright with dogs, and reign</a>
<a id='line_11678'>A dreaded tyrant o'er the bestial train!</a>
<a id='line_11679'>But mercy to the poor and stranger show,</a>
<a id='line_11680'>Lest Heaven in vengeance send some mightier woe."</a>
<a id='line_11681'></a>
<a id='line_11682'>Scornful he spoke, and o'er his shoulder flung</a>
<a id='line_11683'>The broad-patch'd scrip in tatters hung</a>
<a id='line_11684'>Ill join'd, and knotted to a twisted thong.</a>
<a id='line_11685'>Then, turning short, disdain'd a further stay;</a>
<a id='line_11686'>But to the palace measured back the way.</a>
<a id='line_11687'>There, as he rested gathering in a ring,</a>
<a id='line_11688'>The peers with smiles address'd their unknown king:</a>
<a id='line_11689'>"Stranger, may Jove and all the aerial powers</a>
<a id='line_11690'>With every blessing crown thy happy hours!</a>
<a id='line_11691'>Our freedom to thy prowess'd arm we owe</a>
<a id='line_11692'>From bold intrusion of thy coward foe:</a>
<a id='line_11693'>Instant the flying sail the slave shall wing</a>
<a id='line_11694'>To Eschetus, the monster of a king."</a>
<a id='line_11695'></a>
<a id='line_11696'>While pleased he hears, Antinous bears the food,</a>
<a id='line_11697'>A kid's well-fatted entrails, rich with blood;</a>
<a id='line_11698'>The bread from canisters of shining mould</a>
<a id='line_11699'>Amphinomus; and wines that laugh in gold:</a>
<a id='line_11700'>"And oh! (he mildly cries) may Heaven display</a>
<a id='line_11701'>A beam of glory o'er thy future day!</a>
<a id='line_11702'>Alas, the brave too oft is doom'd to bear</a>
<a id='line_11703'>The gripes of poverty and stings of care."</a>
<a id='line_11704'></a>
<a id='line_11705'>To whom with thought mature the king replies:</a>
<a id='line_11706'>"The tongue speaks wisely, when the soul is wise:</a>
<a id='line_11707'>Such was thy father! in imperial state,</a>

<a id='line_11709'>Nor from the sire art thou, the son, declin'd;</a>
<a id='line_11710'>Then hear my words, and grace them in thy mind!</a>
<a id='line_11711'>Of all that breathes, or grovelling creeps on earth,</a>
<a id='line_11712'>Most man in vain! calamitous by birth:</a>
<a id='line_11713'>To-day, with power elate, in strength he blooms;</a>
<a id='line_11714'>The haughty creature on that power presumes:</a>
<a id='line_11715'>Anon from Heaven a sad reverse he feels:</a>
<a id='line_11716'>Untaught to bear, 'gainst Heaven the wretch rebels.</a>
<a id='line_11717'>For man is changeful, as his bliss or woe!</a>
<a id='line_11718'>Too high when prosperous, when distress'd too low.</a>
<a id='line_11719'>There was a day, when with the scornful great</a>
<a id='line_11720'>I swell'd in pomp and arrogance of state;</a>
<a id='line_11721'>Proud of the power that to high birth belongs;</a>
<a id='line_11722'>And used that power to justify my wrongs.</a>
<a id='line_11723'>Then let not man be proud; but firm of mind,</a>
<a id='line_11724'>Bear the best humbly; and the worst resign'd;</a>
<a id='line_11725'>Be dumb when Heaven afflicts! unlike yon train</a>
<a id='line_11726'>Of haughty spoilers, insolently vain;</a>
<a id='line_11727'>Who make their queen and all her wealth a prey:</a>
<a id='line_11728'>But vengeance and Ulysses wing their way.</a>
<a id='line_11729'>O may'st thou, favour'd by some guardian power,</a>
<a id='line_11730'>Far, far be distant in that deathful hour!</a>
<a id='line_11731'>For sure I am, if stern Ulysses breathe,</a>
<a id='line_11732'>These lawless riots end in blood and death."</a>
<a id='line_11733'></a>
<a id='line_11734'>Then to the gods the rosy juice he pours,</a>
<a id='line_11735'>And the drain'd goblet to the chief restores.</a>
<a id='line_11736'>Stung to the soul, o'ercast with holy dread,</a>
<a id='line_11737'>He shook the graceful honours of his head;</a>
<a id='line_11738'>His boding mind the future woe forestalls,</a>
<a id='line_11739'>In vain! by great Telemachus he falls,</a>
<a id='line_11740'>For Pallas seals his doom: all sad he turns</a>
<a id='line_11741'>To join the peers; resumes his throne, and mourns.</a>

<a id='line_11744'>Thy soul, Penelope, from Heaven inspires;</a>
<a id='line_11745'>With flattering hopes the suitors to betray,</a>

<a id='line_11782'>She pours, a pleasing, deep and death-like rest,</a>
<a id='line_11783'>With every beauty every feature arms,</a>
<a id='line_11784'>Bids her cheeks glow, and lights up all her charms;</a>
<a id='line_11785'>In her love-darting eyes awakes the fires</a>
<a id='line_11786'>(Immortal gifts! to kindle soft desires);</a>
<a id='line_11787'>From limb to limb an air majestic sheds,</a>
<a id='line_11788'>And the pure ivory o'er her bosom spreads.</a>
<a id='line_11789'>Such Venus shines, when with a measured bound</a>
<a id='line_11790'>She smoothly gliding swims the harmonious round,</a>
<a id='line_11791'>When with the Graces in the dance she moves,</a>
<a id='line_11792'>And fires the gazing gods with ardent loves.</a>
<a id='line_11793'></a>
<a id='line_11794'>Then to the skies her flight Minerva bends,</a>
<a id='line_11795'>And to the queen the damsel train descends;</a>
<a id='line_11796'>Waked at their steps, her flowing eyes unclose;</a>
<a id='line_11797'>The tears she wipes, and thus renews her woes:</a>
<a id='line_11798'>"Howe'er 'tis well that sleep awhile can free,</a>
<a id='line_11799'>With soft forgetfulness a wretch like me;</a>
<a id='line_11800'>Oh! were it given to yield this transient breath,</a>
<a id='line_11801'>Send, O Diana! send the sleep of death!</a>
<a id='line_11802'>Why must I waste a tedious life in tears,</a>
<a id='line_11803'>Nor bury in the silent grave my cares?</a>
<a id='line_11804'>O my Ulysses! ever honour'd name!</a>
<a id='line_11805'>For thee I mourn till death dissolves my frame."</a>
<a id='line_11806'></a>
<a id='line_11807'>Thus wailing, slow and sadly she descends,</a>
<a id='line_11808'>On either band a damsel train attends:</a>
<a id='line_11809'>Full where the dome its shining valves expands,</a>
<a id='line_11810'>Radiant before the gazing peers she stands;</a>
<a id='line_11811'>A veil translucent o'er her brow display'd,</a>
<a id='line_11812'>Her beauty seems, and only seems, to shade:</a>
<a id='line_11813'>Sudden she lightens in their dazzled eyes,</a>
<a id='line_11814'>And sudden flames in every bosom rise;</a>
<a id='line_11815'>They send their eager souls with every look.</a>
<a id='line_11816'>Till silence thus the imperial matron broke:</a>
<a id='line_11817'></a>
<a id='line_11818'>"O why! my son, why now no more appears</a>
<a id='line_11819'>That warmth of soul that urged thy younger years?</a>
<a id='line_11820'>Thy riper days no growing worth impart,</a>
<a id='line_11821'>A man in stature, still a boy in heart!</a>
<a id='line_11822'>Thy well-knit frame unprofitably strong,</a>
<a id='line_11823'>Speaks thee a hero, from a hero sprung:</a>

<a id='line_11826'>Heavens! could a stranger feel oppression's hand</a>
<a id='line_11827'>Beneath thy roof, and couldst thou tamely stand!</a>

<a id='line_11829'>His is the sufferance, but the shame is thine."</a>
<a id='line_11830'></a>
<a id='line_11831'>To whom, with filial awe, the prince returns:</a>
<a id='line_11832'>"That generous soul with just resentment burns;</a>

<a id='line_11834'>For others' good, and melt at others' woe;</a>
<a id='line_11835'>But, impotent those riots to repel,</a>

<a id='line_11838'>And numbers leagued in impious union dread;</a>
<a id='line_11839'>But now no crime is theirs: this wrong proceeds</a>
<a id='line_11840'>From Irus, and the guilty Irus bleeds.</a>

<a id='line_11848'>The coward wretch the privilege to fly."</a>
<a id='line_11849'></a>
<a id='line_11850'>Then to the queen Eurymachus replies:</a>

<a id='line_11852'>Should Greece through all her hundred states survey</a>

<a id='line_12068'>Ulysses and his son remove the weapons out of the armoury.</a>
<a id='line_12069'>Ulysses, in conversation with Penelope, gives a fictitious account</a>
<a id='line_12070'>of his adventures; then assures her he had formerly entertained</a>

<a id='line_12072'>affirms to have heard of him in Phaeacia and Thesprotia, and that</a>
<a id='line_12073'>his return is certain, and within a month. He then goes to bathe,</a>
<a id='line_12074'>and is attended by Euryclea, who discovers him to be Ulysses by</a>
<a id='line_12075'>the scar upon his leg, which he formerly received in hunting the</a>
<a id='line_12076'>wild boar on Parnassus. The poet inserts a digression relating</a>

<a id='line_12731'>My mind, reflective, in a thorny maze</a>
<a id='line_12732'>Devious from care to care incessant strays.</a>
<a id='line_12733'>Now, wavering doubt succeeds to long despair;</a>
<a id='line_12734'>Shall I my virgin nuptial vow revere;</a>
<a id='line_12735'>And, joining to my son's my menial train,</a>
<a id='line_12736'>Partake his counsels, and assist his reign?</a>
<a id='line_12737'>Or, since, mature in manhood, he deplores</a>
<a id='line_12738'>His dome dishonour'd, and exhausted stores;</a>
<a id='line_12739'>Shall I, reluctant! to his will accord;</a>

<a id='line_12743'>A visionary thought I'll now relate;</a>
<a id='line_12744'>Illustrate, if you know, the shadow'd fate:</a>

<a id='line_12746'>"A team of twenty geese (a snow-white train!)</a>
<a id='line_12747'>Fed near the limpid lake with golden grain,</a>
<a id='line_12748'>Amuse my pensive hours. The bird of Jove</a>
<a id='line_12749'>Fierce from his mountain-eyrie downward drove;</a>
<a id='line_12750'>Each favourite fowl he pounced with deathful sway,</a>
<a id='line_12751'>And back triumphant wing'd his airy way.</a>
<a id='line_12752'>My pitying eyes effused a plenteous stream,</a>
<a id='line_12753'>To view their death thus imaged in a dream;</a>
<a id='line_12754'>With tender sympathy to soothe my soul,</a>
<a id='line_12755'>A troop of matrons, fancy-form'd, condole.</a>
<a id='line_12756'>But whilst with grief and rage my bosom burn'd,</a>
<a id='line_12757'>Sudden the tyrant of the skies returned;</a>
<a id='line_12758'>Perch'd on the battlements he thus began</a>
<a id='line_12759'>(In form an eagle, but in voice a man):</a>

<a id='line_12778'>Two portals firm the various phantoms keep;</a>
<a id='line_12779'>Of ivory one; whence flit, to mock the brain,</a>
<a id='line_12780'>Of winged lies a light fantastic train;</a>
<a id='line_12781'>The gate opposed pellucid valves adorn,</a>

<a id='line_12832'>BOOK XX.</a>
<a id='line_12833'></a>
<a id='line_12834'>ARGUMENT.</a>
<a id='line_12835'></a>
<a id='line_12836'>While Ulysses lies in the vestibule of the palace, he is witness</a>
<a id='line_12837'>to the disorders of the women. Minerva comforts him, and casts him</a>
<a id='line_12838'>asleep. At his waking he desires a favourable sign from Jupiter,</a>
<a id='line_12839'>which is granted. The feast of Apollo is celebrated by the people,</a>
<a id='line_12840'>and the suitors banquet in the palace. Telemachus exerts his</a>
<a id='line_12841'>authority amongst them; notwithstanding which, Ulysses is insulted</a>
<a id='line_12842'>by Caesippus, and the rest continue in their excesses. Strange</a>
<a id='line_12843'>prodigies are seen by Theoclymenus, the augur, who explains them</a>
<a id='line_12844'>to the destruction of the wooers.</a>
<a id='line_12845'></a>
<a id='line_12846'></a>
<a id='line_12847'></a>
<a id='line_12848'>An ample hide devine Ulysses spread.</a>
<a id='line_12849'>And form'd of fleecy skins his humble bed</a>
<a id='line_12850'>(The remnants of the spoil the suitor-crowd</a>
<a id='line_12851'>In festival devour'd, and victims vow'd).</a>
<a id='line_12852'>Then o'er the chief, Eurynome the chaste</a>
<a id='line_12853'>With duteous care a downy carpet cast:</a>
<a id='line_12854'>With dire revenge his thoughtful bosom glows,</a>
<a id='line_12855'>And, ruminating wrath, he scorns repose.</a>
<a id='line_12856'></a>
<a id='line_12857'>As thus pavilion'd in the porch he lay,</a>
<a id='line_12858'>Scenes of lewd loves his wakeful eyes survey,</a>
<a id='line_12859'>Whilst to nocturnal joys impure repair,</a>
<a id='line_12860'>With wanton glee, the prostituted fair.</a>
<a id='line_12861'>His heart with rage this new dishonour stung,</a>
<a id='line_12862'>Wavering his thoughts in dubious balance hung:</a>
<a id='line_12863'>Or instant should he quench the guilty flame</a>
<a id='line_12864'>With their own blood, and intercept the shame:</a>
<a id='line_12865'>Or to their lust indulge a last embrace,</a>
<a id='line_12866'>And let the peers consummate the disgrace</a>
<a id='line_12867'>Round his swoln heart the murmurous fury rolls,</a>
<a id='line_12868'>As o'er her young the mother-mastiff growls,</a>
<a id='line_12869'>And bays the stranger groom: so wrath compress'd,</a>
<a id='line_12870'>Recoiling, mutter'd thunder in his breast.</a>
<a id='line_12871'>"Poor suffering heart! (he cried,) support the pain</a>
<a id='line_12872'>Of wounded honour, and thy rage restrain.</a>
<a id='line_12873'>Not fiercer woes thy fortitude could foil,</a>
<a id='line_12874'>When the brave partners of thy ten years' toil</a>
<a id='line_12875'>Dire Polypheme devour'd; I then was freed</a>
<a id='line_12876'>By patient prudence from the death decreed."</a>
<a id='line_12877'></a>
<a id='line_12878'>Thus anchor'd safe on reason's peaceful coast,</a>
<a id='line_12879'>Tempests of wrath his soul no longer toss'd;</a>
<a id='line_12880'>Restless his body rolls, to rage resign'd</a>
<a id='line_12881'>As one who long with pale-eyed famine pined,</a>
<a id='line_12882'>The savoury cates on glowing embers cast</a>
<a id='line_12883'>Incessant turns, impatient for repast</a>
<a id='line_12884'>Ulysses so, from side to side-devolved,</a>
<a id='line_12885'>In self-debate the suitor's doom resolved</a>
<a id='line_12886'>When in the form of mortal nymph array'd,</a>
<a id='line_12887'>From heaven descends the Jove-born martial maid;</a>
<a id='line_12888'>And'hovering o'er his head in view confess'd,</a>
<a id='line_12889'>The goddess thus her favourite care address'd:</a>
<a id='line_12890'></a>
<a id='line_12891'>"O thou, of mortals most inured to woes!</a>
<a id='line_12892'>Why roll those eyes unfriended of repose?</a>
<a id='line_12893'>Beneath thy palace-roof forget thy care;</a>
<a id='line_12894'>Bless'd in thy queen! bless'd in thy blooming heir!</a>
<a id='line_12895'>Whom, to the gods when suppliant fathers bow</a>
<a id='line_12896'>They name the standard of their dearest vow."</a>
<a id='line_12897'></a>
<a id='line_12898'>"Just is thy kind reproach (the chief rejoin'd),</a>
<a id='line_12899'>Deeds full of fate distract my various mind,</a>
<a id='line_12900'>In contemplation wrapp'd. This hostile crew</a>
<a id='line_12901'>What single arm hath prowess to subdue?</a>
<a id='line_12902'>Or if, by Jove's and thy auxiliar aid,</a>
<a id='line_12903'>They're doom'd to bleed; O say, celestial maid!</a>
<a id='line_12904'>Where shall Ulysses shun, or how sustain</a>
<a id='line_12905'>Nations embattled to revenge the slain?"</a>
<a id='line_12906'></a>
<a id='line_12907'>"Oh impotence of faith! (Minerva cries,)</a>
<a id='line_12908'>If man on frail unknowing man relies,</a>
<a id='line_12909'>Doubt you the gods? Lo, Pallas' self descends,</a>
<a id='line_12910'>Inspires thy counsels, and thy toils attends.</a>
<a id='line_12911'>In me affianced, fortify thy breast,</a>
<a id='line_12912'>Though myriads leagued thy rightful claim contest</a>
<a id='line_12913'>My sure divinity shall bear the shield,</a>
<a id='line_12914'>And edge thy sword to reap the glorious field.</a>
<a id='line_12915'>Now, pay the debt to craving nature due,</a>
<a id='line_12916'>Her faded powers with balmy rest renew."</a>
<a id='line_12917'>She ceased, ambrosial slumbers seal his eyes;</a>
<a id='line_12918'>Her care dissolves in visionary joys</a>
<a id='line_12919'>The goddess, pleased, regains her natal skies.</a>
<a id='line_12920'></a>
<a id='line_12921'>Not so the queen; the downy bands of sleep</a>
<a id='line_12922'>By grief relax'd she waked again to weep:</a>
<a id='line_12923'>A gloomy pause ensued of dumb despair;</a>
<a id='line_12924'>Then thus her fate invoked, with fervent prayer</a>
<a id='line_12925'></a>
<a id='line_12926'>"Diana! speed thy deathful ebon dart,</a>
<a id='line_12927'>And cure the pangs of this convulsive heart.</a>
<a id='line_12928'>Snatch me, ye whirlwinds! far from human race,</a>
<a id='line_12929'>Toss'd through the void illimitable space</a>
<a id='line_12930'>Or if dismounted from the rapid cloud,</a>
<a id='line_12931'>Me with his whelming wave let Ocean shroud!</a>
<a id='line_12932'>So, Pandarus, thy hopes, three orphan fair;</a>
<a id='line_12933'>Were doom'd to wander through the devious air;</a>
<a id='line_12934'>Thyself untimely, and thy consort died,</a>
<a id='line_12935'>But four celestials both your cares supplied.</a>
<a id='line_12936'>Venus in tender delicacy rears</a>
<a id='line_12937'>With honey, milk, and wine their infant years;</a>
<a id='line_12938'>Imperial Juno to their youth assigned</a>
<a id='line_12939'>A form majestic, and sagacious mind;</a>
<a id='line_12940'>With shapely growth Diana graced their bloom;</a>
<a id='line_12941'>And Pallas taught the texture of the loom.</a>
<a id='line_12942'>But whilst, to learn their lots in nuptial love,</a>
<a id='line_12943'>Bright Cytherea sought the bower of Jove</a>
<a id='line_12944'>(The God supreme, to whose eternal eye</a>
<a id='line_12945'>The registers of fate expanded lie;</a>

<a id='line_12947'>And to the Furies bore a grateful prey.</a>
<a id='line_12948'>Be such my lot! Or thou, Diana, speed</a>
<a id='line_12949'>Thy shaft, and send me joyful to the dead;</a>
<a id='line_12950'>To seek my lord among the warrior train,</a>
<a id='line_12951'>Ere second vows my bridal faith profane.</a>
<a id='line_12952'>When woes the waking sense alone assail,</a>
<a id='line_12953'>Whilst Night extends her soft oblivious veil,</a>
<a id='line_12954'>Of other wretches' care the torture ends;</a>
<a id='line_12955'>No truce the warfare of my heart suspends!</a>
<a id='line_12956'>The night renews the day distracting theme,</a>
<a id='line_12957'>And airy terrors sable every dream.</a>
<a id='line_12958'>The last alone a kind illusion wrought,</a>
<a id='line_12959'>And to my bed my loved Ulysses brought,</a>
<a id='line_12960'>In manly bloom, and each majestic grace,</a>
<a id='line_12961'>As when for Troy he left my fond embrace;</a>

<a id='line_12963'>I deem it sure a vision of the skies."</a>
<a id='line_12964'></a>
<a id='line_12965'>Thus, whilst Aurora mounts her purple throne,</a>
<a id='line_12966'>In audible laments she breathes her moan;</a>
<a id='line_12967'>The sounds assault Ulysses' wakeful ear;</a>
<a id='line_12968'>Misjudging of the cause, a sudden fear</a>
<a id='line_12969'>Of his arrival known, the chief alarms;</a>

<a id='line_12973'>(The hide, without, imbibed the morning air);</a>
<a id='line_12974'>And thus the gods invoked with ardent prayer:</a>

<a id='line_13372'>discovers himself to them; then returning, desires leave to try</a>
<a id='line_13373'>his strength at the bow, which, though refused with indignation by</a>
<a id='line_13374'>the suitors, Penelope and Telemachus cause it to be delivered to</a>
<a id='line_13375'>his hands. He bends it immediately, and shoots through all the</a>
<a id='line_13376'>rings. Jupiter at the same instant thunders from heaven; Ulysses</a>
<a id='line_13377'>accepts the omen, and gives a sign to Telemachus, who stands ready</a>
<a id='line_13378'>armed at his side.</a>
<a id='line_13379'></a>
<a id='line_13380'></a>
<a id='line_13381'></a>
<a id='line_13382'>And Pallas now, to raise the rivals' fires,</a>
<a id='line_13383'>With her own art Penelope inspires</a>
<a id='line_13384'>Who now can bend Ulysses' bow, and wing</a>
<a id='line_13385'>The well-aim'd arrow through the distant ring,</a>
<a id='line_13386'>Shall end the strife, and win the imperial dame:</a>
<a id='line_13387'>But discord and black death await the game!</a>
<a id='line_13388'></a>
<a id='line_13389'>The prudent queen the lofty stair ascends:</a>
<a id='line_13390'>At distance due a virgin-train attends;</a>
<a id='line_13391'>A brazen key she held, the handle turn'd,</a>
<a id='line_13392'>With steel and polish'd elephant adorn'd:</a>
<a id='line_13393'>Swift to the inmost room she bent her way,</a>
<a id='line_13394'>Where, safe reposed, the royal treasures lay:</a>
<a id='line_13395'>There shone high heap'd the labour'd brass and ore,</a>
<a id='line_13396'>And there the bow which great Ulysses bore;</a>
<a id='line_13397'>And there the quiver, where now guiltless slept</a>
<a id='line_13398'>Those winged deaths that many a matron wept.</a>
<a id='line_13399'></a>
<a id='line_13400'>This gift, long since when Sparta's shore he trod,</a>
<a id='line_13401'>On young Ulysses Iphitus bestowed:</a>
<a id='line_13402'>Beneath Orsilochus' roof they met;</a>
<a id='line_13403'>One loss was private, one a public debt;</a>
<a id='line_13404'>Messena's state from Ithaca detains</a>
<a id='line_13405'>Three hundred sheep, and all the shepherd swains;</a>
<a id='line_13406'>And to the youthful prince to urge the laws,</a>
<a id='line_13407'>The king and elders trust their common cause.</a>
<a id='line_13408'>But Iphitus, employed on other cares,</a>
<a id='line_13409'>Search'd the wide country for his wandering mares,</a>
<a id='line_13410'>And mules, the strongest of the labouring kind;</a>
<a id='line_13411'>Hapless to search; more hapless still to find!</a>
<a id='line_13412'>For journeying on to Hercules, at length</a>
<a id='line_13413'>That lawless wretch, that man of brutal strength,</a>
<a id='line_13414'>Deaf to Heaven's voice, the social rites transgress'd;</a>
<a id='line_13415'>And for the beauteous mares destroy'd his guest.</a>
<a id='line_13416'>He gave the bow; and on Ulysses' part</a>
<a id='line_13417'>Received a pointed sword, and missile dart:</a>
<a id='line_13418'>Of luckless friendship on a foreign shore</a>
<a id='line_13419'>Their first, last pledges! for they met no more.</a>
<a id='line_13420'>The bow, bequeath'd by this unhappy hand,</a>
<a id='line_13421'>Ulysses bore not from his native land;</a>
<a id='line_13422'>Nor in the front of battle taught to bend,</a>
<a id='line_13423'>But kept in dear memorial of his friend.</a>
<a id='line_13424'></a>
<a id='line_13425'>Now gently winding up the fair ascent,</a>
<a id='line_13426'>By many an easy step the matron went;</a>
<a id='line_13427'>Then o'er the pavement glides with grace divine</a>
<a id='line_13428'>(With polish'd oak the level pavements shine);</a>
<a id='line_13429'>The folding gates a dazzling light display'd,</a>
<a id='line_13430'>With pomp of various architrave o'erlaid.</a>
<a id='line_13431'>The bolt, obedient to the silken string,</a>
<a id='line_13432'>Forsakes the staple as she pulls the ring;</a>
<a id='line_13433'>The wards respondent to the key turn round;</a>
<a id='line_13434'>The bars fall back; the flying valves resound;</a>
<a id='line_13435'>Loud as a bull makes hill and valley ring,</a>
<a id='line_13436'>So roar'd the lock when it released the spring.</a>
<a id='line_13437'>She moves majestic through the wealthy room,</a>
<a id='line_13438'>Where treasured garments cast a rich perfume;</a>
<a id='line_13439'>There from the column where aloft it hung,</a>
<a id='line_13440'>Reach'd in its splendid case, the bow unstrung;</a>
<a id='line_13441'>Across her knees she laid the well-known bow,</a>
<a id='line_13442'>And pensive sate, and tears began to flow.</a>
<a id='line_13443'>To full satiety of grief she mourns,</a>
<a id='line_13444'>Then silent to the joyous hall returns,</a>
<a id='line_13445'>To the proud suitors bears in pensive state</a>
<a id='line_13446'>The unbended bow, and arrows winged with fate.</a>
<a id='line_13447'></a>
<a id='line_13448'>Behind, her train the polish'd coffer brings,</a>
<a id='line_13449'>Which held the alternate brass and silver rings.</a>
<a id='line_13450'>Full in the portal the chaste queen appears,</a>
<a id='line_13451'>And with her veil conceals the coming tears:</a>
<a id='line_13452'>On either side awaits a virgin fair;</a>
<a id='line_13453'>While thus the matron, with majestic air:</a>
<a id='line_13454'></a>
<a id='line_13455'>"Say you, when these forbidden walls inclose,</a>
<a id='line_13456'>For whom my victims bleed, my vintage flows:</a>
<a id='line_13457'>If these neglected, faded charms can move?</a>
<a id='line_13458'>Or is it but a vain pretence, you love?</a>
<a id='line_13459'>If I the prize, if me you seek to wife,</a>
<a id='line_13460'>Hear the conditions, and commence the strife.</a>
<a id='line_13461'>Who first Ulysses' wondrous bow shall bend,</a>
<a id='line_13462'>And through twelve ringlets the fleet arrow send;</a>
<a id='line_13463'>Him will I follow, and forsake my home,</a>
<a id='line_13464'>For him forsake this loved, this wealthy dome,</a>
<a id='line_13465'>Long, long the scene of all my past delight,</a>
<a id='line_13466'>And still to last, the vision of my night!"</a>
<a id='line_13467'></a>
<a id='line_13468'>Graceful she said, and bade Eumaeus show</a>
<a id='line_13469'>The rival peers the ringlets and the bow.</a>
<a id='line_13470'>From his full eyes the tears unbidden spring,</a>
<a id='line_13471'>Touch'd at the dear memorials of his king.</a>
<a id='line_13472'>Philaetius too relents, but secret shed</a>
<a id='line_13473'>The tender drops. Antinous saw, and said:</a>
<a id='line_13474'></a>
<a id='line_13475'>"Hence to your fields, ye rustics! hence away,</a>
<a id='line_13476'>Nor stain with grief the pleasures of the day;</a>
<a id='line_13477'>Nor to the royal heart recall in vain</a>
<a id='line_13478'>The sad remembrance of a perish'd man.</a>
<a id='line_13479'>Enough her precious tears already flow--</a>
<a id='line_13480'>Or share the feast with due respect; or go</a>
<a id='line_13481'>To weep abroad, and leave to us the bow,</a>
<a id='line_13482'>No vulgar task! Ill suits this courtly crew</a>
<a id='line_13483'>That stubborn horn which brave Ulysses drew.</a>
<a id='line_13484'>I well remember (for I gazed him o'er</a>
<a id='line_13485'>While yet a child), what majesty he bore!</a>
<a id='line_13486'>And still (all infant as I was) retain</a>
<a id='line_13487'>The port, the strength, the grandeur of the man."</a>
<a id='line_13488'></a>
<a id='line_13489'>He said, but in his soul fond joys arise,</a>
<a id='line_13490'>And his proud hopes already win the prize.</a>
<a id='line_13491'>To speed the flying shaft through every ring,</a>
<a id='line_13492'>Wretch! is not thine: the arrows of the king</a>
<a id='line_13493'>Shall end those hopes, and fate is on the wing!</a>
<a id='line_13494'></a>
<a id='line_13495'>Then thus Telemachus: "Some god I find</a>
<a id='line_13496'>With pleasing frenzy has possess'd my mind;</a>
<a id='line_13497'>When a loved mother threatens to depart,</a>
<a id='line_13498'>Why with this ill-timed gladness leaps my heart?</a>
<a id='line_13499'>Come then, ye suitors! and dispute a prize</a>
<a id='line_13500'>Richer than all the Achaian state supplies,</a>
<a id='line_13501'>Than all proud Argos, or Mycaena knows,</a>
<a id='line_13502'>Than all our isles or continents inclose;</a>
<a id='line_13503'>A woman matchless, and almost divine,</a>
<a id='line_13504'>Fit for the praise of every tongue but mine.</a>
<a id='line_13505'>No more excuses then, no more delay;</a>
<a id='line_13506'>Haste to the trial--Lo! I lead the way.</a>
<a id='line_13507'></a>
<a id='line_13508'>"I too may try, and if this arm can wing</a>
<a id='line_13509'>The feather'd arrow through the destined ring,</a>
<a id='line_13510'>Then if no happier night the conquest boast,</a>
<a id='line_13511'>I shall not sorrow for a mother lost;</a>
<a id='line_13512'>But, bless'd in her, possess those arms alone,</a>
<a id='line_13513'>Heir of my father's strength, as well as throne."</a>
<a id='line_13514'></a>
<a id='line_13515'>He spoke; then rising, his broad sword unbound,</a>
<a id='line_13516'>And cast his purple garment on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_13517'>A trench he open'd: in a line he placed.</a>
<a id='line_13518'>The level axes, and the points made fast</a>
<a id='line_13519'>(His perfect skill the wondering gazers eyed,</a>
<a id='line_13520'>The game as yet unseen, as yet untried).</a>
<a id='line_13521'>Then, with a manly pace, he took his stand:</a>
<a id='line_13522'>And grasp'd the bow, and twang'd it in his hand.</a>
<a id='line_13523'>Three times, with beating heart, he made essay:</a>
<a id='line_13524'>Three times, unequal to the task, gave way;</a>
<a id='line_13525'>A modest boldness on his cheek appear'd:</a>
<a id='line_13526'>And thrice he hoped, and thrice again he fear'd.</a>
<a id='line_13527'>The fourth had drawn it. The great sire with joy</a>
<a id='line_13528'>Beheld, but with a sign forbade the boy.</a>
<a id='line_13529'>His ardour straight the obedient prince suppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_13530'>And, artful, thus the suitor-train address'd:</a>
<a id='line_13531'></a>
<a id='line_13532'>"O lay the cause on youth yet immature!</a>
<a id='line_13533'>(For heaven forbid such weakness should endure!)</a>
<a id='line_13534'>How shall this arm, unequal to the bow,</a>
<a id='line_13535'>Retort an insult, or repel a foe?</a>
<a id='line_13536'>But you! whom Heaven with better nerves has bless'd,</a>
<a id='line_13537'>Accept the trial, and the prize contest."</a>
<a id='line_13538'></a>
<a id='line_13539'>He cast the bow before him, and apart</a>
<a id='line_13540'>Against the polish'd quiver propp'd the dart.</a>
<a id='line_13541'>Resuming then his seat, Eupithes' son,</a>
<a id='line_13542'>The bold Antinous, to the rest begun:</a>
<a id='line_13543'>"From where the goblet first begins to flow,</a>
<a id='line_13544'>From right to left in order take the bow;</a>
<a id='line_13545'>And prove your several strengths." The princes heard</a>
<a id='line_13546'>And first Leiodes, blameless priest'd, appear'd:</a>
<a id='line_13547'>The eldest born of Oenops' noble race,</a>
<a id='line_13548'>Who next the goblet held his holy place:</a>
<a id='line_13549'>He, only he, of all the suitor throng,</a>
<a id='line_13550'>Their deeds detested, and abjured the wrong.</a>
<a id='line_13551'>With tender hands the stubborn horn he strains,</a>
<a id='line_13552'>The stubborn horn resisted all his pains!</a>
<a id='line_13553'>Already in despair he gives it o'er:</a>
<a id='line_13554'>"Take it who will (he cries), I strive no more,</a>
<a id='line_13555'>What numerous deaths attend this fatal bow!</a>
<a id='line_13556'>What souls and spirits shall it send below!</a>
<a id='line_13557'>Better, indeed, to die, and fairly give</a>
<a id='line_13558'>Nature her debt, than disappointed live,</a>
<a id='line_13559'>With each new sun to some new hope a prey,</a>
<a id='line_13560'>Yet still to-morrow falser than to-day.</a>
<a id='line_13561'>How long in vain Penelope we sought!</a>
<a id='line_13562'>This bow shall ease us of that idle thought,</a>
<a id='line_13563'>And send us with some humbler wife to live,</a>
<a id='line_13564'>Whom gold shall gain, or destiny shall give."</a>
<a id='line_13565'></a>
<a id='line_13566'>Thus speaking, on the floor the bow he placed</a>
<a id='line_13567'>(With rich inlay the various floor was graced):</a>
<a id='line_13568'>At distance far the feather'd shaft he throws,</a>
<a id='line_13569'>And to the seat returns from whence he rose.</a>
<a id='line_13570'></a>
<a id='line_13571'>To him Antinous thus with fury said:</a>
<a id='line_13572'>"What words ill-omen'd from thy lips have fled?</a>
<a id='line_13573'>Thy coward-function ever is in fear!</a>
<a id='line_13574'>Those arms are dreadful which thou canst not bear,</a>
<a id='line_13575'>Why should this bow be fatal to the brave?</a>
<a id='line_13576'>Because the priest is born a peaceful slave.</a>
<a id='line_13577'>Mark then what others can." He ended there,</a>
<a id='line_13578'>And bade Melanthius a vast pile prepare;</a>
<a id='line_13579'>He gives it instant flame, then fast beside</a>
<a id='line_13580'>Spreads o'er an ample board a bullock's hide.</a>
<a id='line_13581'>With melted lard they soak the weapon o'er,</a>
<a id='line_13582'>Chafe every knot, and supple every pore.</a>
<a id='line_13583'>Vain all their art, and all their strength as vain;</a>
<a id='line_13584'>The bow inflexible resists their pain.</a>
<a id='line_13585'>The force of great Eurymachus alone</a>
<a id='line_13586'>And bold Antinous, yet untired, unknown:</a>
<a id='line_13587'>Those only now remain'd; but those confess'd</a>
<a id='line_13588'>Of all the train the mightiest and the best.</a>
<a id='line_13589'></a>
<a id='line_13590'>Then from the hall, and from the noisy crew,</a>
<a id='line_13591'>The masters of the herd and flock withdrew.</a>
<a id='line_13592'>The king observes them, he the hall forsakes,</a>
<a id='line_13593'>And, past the limits of the court, o'ertakes.</a>
<a id='line_13594'>Then thus with accent mild Ulysses spoke:</a>
<a id='line_13595'>"Ye faithful guardians of the herd and flock!</a>
<a id='line_13596'>Shall I the secret of my breast conceal,</a>
<a id='line_13597'>Or (as my soul now dictates) shall I tell?</a>
<a id='line_13598'>Say, should some favouring god restore again</a>
<a id='line_13599'>The lost Ulysses to his native reign,</a>
<a id='line_13600'>How beat your hearts? what aid would you afford</a>
<a id='line_13601'>To the proud suitors, or your ancient lord?"</a>
<a id='line_13602'></a>
<a id='line_13603'>Philaetius thus: "O were thy word not vain!</a>
<a id='line_13604'>Would mighty Jove restore that man again!</a>
<a id='line_13605'>These aged sinews, with new vigour strung,</a>
<a id='line_13606'>In his blest cause should emulate the young."</a>
<a id='line_13607'>With equal vows Eumaeus too implored</a>
<a id='line_13608'>Each power above, with wishes for his lord.</a>
<a id='line_13609'></a>
<a id='line_13610'>He saw their secret souls, and thus began:</a>
<a id='line_13611'>"Those vows the gods accord; behold the man!</a>
<a id='line_13612'>Your own Ulysses! twice ten years detain'd</a>
<a id='line_13613'>By woes and wanderings from this hapless land:</a>
<a id='line_13614'>At length he comes; but comes despised, unknown,</a>
<a id='line_13615'>And finding faithful you, and you alone.</a>
<a id='line_13616'>All else have cast him from their very thought,</a>
<a id='line_13617'>E'en in their wishes and their prayers forgot!</a>
<a id='line_13618'>Hear then, my friends: If Jove this arm succeed,</a>
<a id='line_13619'>And give yon impious revellers to bleed,</a>
<a id='line_13620'>My care shall be to bless your future lives</a>
<a id='line_13621'>With large possessions and with faithful wives;</a>
<a id='line_13622'>Fast by my palace shall your domes ascend,</a>
<a id='line_13623'>And each on young Telemachus attend,</a>
<a id='line_13624'>And each be call'd his brother and my friend.</a>
<a id='line_13625'>To give you firmer faith, now trust your eye;</a>
<a id='line_13626'>Lo! the broad scar indented on my thigh,</a>
<a id='line_13627'>When with Autolycus' sons, of yore,</a>
<a id='line_13628'>On Parnass' top I chased the tusky boar."</a>
<a id='line_13629'>His ragged vest then drawn aside disclosed</a>
<a id='line_13630'>The sign conspicuous, and the scar exposed:</a>
<a id='line_13631'>Eager they view'd, with joy they stood amazed</a>
<a id='line_13632'>With tearful eyes o'er all their master gazed:</a>
<a id='line_13633'>Around his neck their longing arms they cast,</a>
<a id='line_13634'>His head, his shoulders, and his knees embraced;</a>
<a id='line_13635'>Tears followed tears; no word was in their power;</a>
<a id='line_13636'>In solemn silence fell the kindly shower.</a>
<a id='line_13637'>The king too weeps, the king too grasps their hands;</a>
<a id='line_13638'>And moveless, as a marble fountain, stands.</a>
<a id='line_13639'></a>
<a id='line_13640'>Thus had their joy wept down the setting sun,</a>
<a id='line_13641'>But first the wise man ceased, and thus begun:</a>
<a id='line_13642'>"Enough--on other cares your thought employ,</a>
<a id='line_13643'>For danger waits on all untimely joy.</a>
<a id='line_13644'>Full many foes and fierce, observe us near;</a>
<a id='line_13645'>Some may betray, and yonder walls may hear.</a>
<a id='line_13646'>Re-enter then, not all at once, but stay</a>
<a id='line_13647'>Some moments you, and let me lead the way.</a>
<a id='line_13648'>To me, neglected as I am I know</a>
<a id='line_13649'>The haughty suitors will deny the bow;</a>
<a id='line_13650'>But thou, Eumaeus, as 'tis borne away,</a>
<a id='line_13651'>Thy master's weapon to his hand convey.</a>
<a id='line_13652'>At every portal let some matron wait,</a>
<a id='line_13653'>And each lock fast the well-compacted gate:</a>
<a id='line_13654'>Close let them keep, whate'er invades their ear;</a>
<a id='line_13655'>Though arms, or shouts, or dying groans they hear.</a>
<a id='line_13656'>To thy strict charge, Philaetius, we consign</a>
<a id='line_13657'>The court's main gate: to guard that pass be thine."</a>
<a id='line_13658'></a>
<a id='line_13659'>This said, he first return'd; the faithful swains</a>
<a id='line_13660'>At distance follow, as their king ordains.</a>
<a id='line_13661'>Before the flame Eurymachus now stands,</a>
<a id='line_13662'>And turns the bow, and chafes it with his hands</a>
<a id='line_13663'>Still the tough bow unmoved. The lofty man</a>
<a id='line_13664'>Sigh'd from his mighty soul, and thus began:</a>
<a id='line_13665'></a>
<a id='line_13666'>"I mourn the common cause: for, oh, my friends,</a>
<a id='line_13667'>On me, on all, what grief, what shame attends!</a>
<a id='line_13668'>Not the lost nuptials can affect me more</a>
<a id='line_13669'>(For Greece has beauteous dames on every shore),</a>
<a id='line_13670'>But baffled thus! confess'd so far below</a>
<a id='line_13671'>Ulysses' strength, as not to bend his bow!</a>
<a id='line_13672'>How shall all ages our attempt deride!</a>
<a id='line_13673'>Our weakness scorn!" Antinous thus replied:</a>
<a id='line_13674'></a>
<a id='line_13675'>"Not so, Eurymachus: that no man draws</a>
<a id='line_13676'>The wondrous bow, attend another cause.</a>
<a id='line_13677'>Sacred to Phoebus is the solemn day,</a>
<a id='line_13678'>Which thoughtless we in games would waste away:</a>
<a id='line_13679'>Till the next dawn this ill-timed strife forego,</a>
<a id='line_13680'>And here leave fixed the ringlets in a row.</a>
<a id='line_13681'>Now bid the sewer approach, and let us join</a>
<a id='line_13682'>In due libations, and in rites divine,</a>
<a id='line_13683'>So end our night: before the day shall spring,</a>
<a id='line_13684'>The choicest offerings let Melanthius bring:</a>
<a id='line_13685'>Let then to Phoebus' name the fatted thighs</a>
<a id='line_13686'>Feed the rich smokes high curling to the skies.</a>
<a id='line_13687'>So shall the patron of these arts bestow</a>
<a id='line_13688'>(For his the gift) the skill to bend the bow."</a>

<a id='line_13690'>They heard well pleased: the ready heralds bring</a>
<a id='line_13691'>The cleansing waters from the limpid spring:</a>
<a id='line_13692'>The goblet high with rosy wine they crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_13693'>In order circling to the peers around.</a>
<a id='line_13694'>That rite complete, uprose the thoughtful man,</a>
<a id='line_13695'>And thus his meditated scheme began:</a>
<a id='line_13696'></a>
<a id='line_13697'>"If what I ask your noble minds approve,</a>
<a id='line_13698'>Ye peers and rivals in the royal love!</a>

<a id='line_13700'>(Whose sage decision I with wonder hear),</a>
<a id='line_13701'>And if Eurymachus the motion please:</a>
<a id='line_13702'>Give Heaven this day and rest the bow in peace.</a>

<a id='line_13706'>Trust it one moment to my hands to-day:</a>
<a id='line_13707'>Fain would I prove, before your judging eyes,</a>
<a id='line_13708'>What once I was, whom wretched you despise:</a>
<a id='line_13709'>If yet this arm its ancient force retain;</a>

<a id='line_13712'></a>
<a id='line_13713'>Rage flash'd in lightning from the suitors' eyes,</a>
<a id='line_13714'>Yet mixed with terror at the bold emprise.</a>
<a id='line_13715'>Antinous then: "O miserable guest!</a>

<a id='line_13728'>And sent him sober'd home, with better wit.</a>
<a id='line_13729'>Hence with long war the double race was cursed,</a>
<a id='line_13730'>Fatal to all, but to the aggressor first.</a>

<a id='line_13738'>Cease the mad strife and share our bounty here."</a>
<a id='line_13739'></a>
<a id='line_13740'>To this the queen her just dislike express'd:</a>

<a id='line_13793'>Mature beyond his years, the queen admired</a>

<a id='line_13795'>There in her chamber as she sate apart,</a>
<a id='line_13796'>Revolved his words, and placed them in her heart.</a>
<a id='line_13797'>On her Ulysses then she fix'd her soul;</a>
<a id='line_13798'>Down her fair cheek the tears abundant roll,</a>
<a id='line_13799'>Till gentle Pallas, piteous of her cries,</a>
<a id='line_13800'>In slumber closed her silver-streaming eyes.</a>
<a id='line_13801'></a>
<a id='line_13802'>Now through the press the bow Eumaeus bore,</a>
<a id='line_13803'>And all was riot, noise, and wild uproar.</a>
<a id='line_13804'>"Hold! lawless rustic! whither wilt thou go?</a>
<a id='line_13805'>To whom, insensate, dost thou bear the bow?</a>
<a id='line_13806'>Exiled for this to some sequester'd den,</a>
<a id='line_13807'>Far from the sweet society of men,</a>
<a id='line_13808'>To thy own dogs a prey thou shalt be made;</a>
<a id='line_13809'>If Heaven and Phoebus lend the suitors aid."</a>
<a id='line_13810'>Thus they. Aghast he laid the weapon down,</a>
<a id='line_13811'>But bold Telemachus thus urged him on:</a>
<a id='line_13812'>"Proceed, false slave, and slight their empty words:</a>
<a id='line_13813'>What! hopes the fool to please so many lords?</a>
<a id='line_13814'>Young as I am, thy prince's vengeful hand</a>
<a id='line_13815'>Stretch'd forth in wrath shall drive thee from the land.</a>
<a id='line_13816'>Oh! could the vigour of this arm as well</a>
<a id='line_13817'>The oppressive suitors from my walls expel!</a>
<a id='line_13818'>Then what a shoal of lawless men should go</a>
<a id='line_13819'>To fill with tumult the dark courts below!"</a>
<a id='line_13820'></a>
<a id='line_13821'>The suitors with a scornful smile survey</a>
<a id='line_13822'>The youth, indulging in the genial day.</a>
<a id='line_13823'>Eumaeus, thus encouraged, hastes to bring</a>
<a id='line_13824'>The strifeful bow and gives it to the king.</a>
<a id='line_13825'>Old Euryclea calling them aside,</a>
<a id='line_13826'>"Hear what Telemachus enjoins (he cried):</a>
<a id='line_13827'>At every portal let some matron wait,</a>
<a id='line_13828'>And each lock fast the well-compacted gate;</a>
<a id='line_13829'>And if unusual sounds invade their ear,</a>
<a id='line_13830'>If arms, or shouts, or dying groans they hear,</a>
<a id='line_13831'>Let none to call or issue forth presume,</a>
<a id='line_13832'>But close attend the labours of the loom."</a>
<a id='line_13833'></a>
<a id='line_13834'>Her prompt obedience on his order waits;</a>
<a id='line_13835'>Closed in an instant were the palace gates.</a>
<a id='line_13836'>In the same moment forth Philaetius flies,</a>
<a id='line_13837'>Secures the court, and with a cable ties</a>
<a id='line_13838'>The utmost gate (the cable strongly wrought</a>
<a id='line_13839'>Of Byblos' reed, a ship from Egypt brought);</a>
<a id='line_13840'>Then unperceived and silent at the board</a>
<a id='line_13841'>His seat he takes, his eyes upon his lord.</a>
<a id='line_13842'></a>
<a id='line_13843'>And now his well-known bow the master bore,</a>
<a id='line_13844'>Turn'd on all sides, and view'd it o'er and o'er;</a>
<a id='line_13845'>Lest time or worms had done the weapon wrong,</a>
<a id='line_13846'>Its owner absent, and untried so long.</a>
<a id='line_13847'>While some deriding--"How he turns the bow!</a>
<a id='line_13848'>Some other like it sure the man must know,</a>
<a id='line_13849'>Or else would copy; or in bows he deals;</a>
<a id='line_13850'>Perhaps he makes them, or perhaps he steals."</a>
<a id='line_13851'>"Heaven to this wretch (another cried) be kind!</a>
<a id='line_13852'>And bless, in all to which he stands inclined.</a>
<a id='line_13853'>With such good fortune as he now shall find."</a>
<a id='line_13854'></a>
<a id='line_13855'>Heedless he heard them: but disdain'd reply;</a>
<a id='line_13856'>The bow perusing with exactest eye.</a>
<a id='line_13857'>Then, as some heavenly minstrel, taught to sing</a>
<a id='line_13858'>High notes responsive to the trembling string,</a>
<a id='line_13859'>To some new strain when he adapts the lyre,</a>
<a id='line_13860'>Or the dumb lute refits with vocal wire,</a>
<a id='line_13861'>Relaxes, strains, and draws them to and fro;</a>
<a id='line_13862'>So the great master drew the mighty bow,</a>
<a id='line_13863'>And drew with ease. One hand aloft display'd</a>
<a id='line_13864'>The bending horns, and one the string essay'd.</a>
<a id='line_13865'>From his essaying hand the string, let fly,</a>
<a id='line_13866'>Twang'd short and sharp like the shrill swallow's cry.</a>
<a id='line_13867'>A general horror ran through all the race,</a>
<a id='line_13868'>Sunk was each heart, and pale was every face,</a>
<a id='line_13869'>Signs from above ensued: the unfolding sky</a>
<a id='line_13870'>In lightning burst; Jove thunder'd from on high.</a>
<a id='line_13871'>Fired at the call of heaven's almighty Lord,</a>
<a id='line_13872'>He snatch'd the shaft that glitter'd on the board</a>
<a id='line_13873'>(Fast by, the rest lay sleeping in the sheath,</a>
<a id='line_13874'>But soon to fly the messengers of death).</a>
<a id='line_13875'></a>
<a id='line_13876'>Now sitting as he was, the cord he drew,</a>
<a id='line_13877'>Through every ringlet levelling his view:</a>
<a id='line_13878'>Then notch'd the shaft, released, and gave it wing;</a>
<a id='line_13879'>The whizzing arrow vanished from the string,</a>
<a id='line_13880'>Sung on direct, and threaded every ring.</a>
<a id='line_13881'>The solid gate its fury scarcely bounds;</a>
<a id='line_13882'>Pierced through and through the solid gate resounds,</a>
<a id='line_13883'>Then to the prince: "Nor have I wrought thee shame;</a>
<a id='line_13884'>Nor err'd this hand unfaithful to its aim;</a>
<a id='line_13885'>Nor prov'd the toil too hard; nor have I lost</a>
<a id='line_13886'>That ancient vigour, once my pride and boast.</a>
<a id='line_13887'>Ill I deserved these haughty peers' disdain;</a>
<a id='line_13888'>Now let them comfort their dejected train,</a>
<a id='line_13889'>In sweet repast their present hour employ,</a>
<a id='line_13890'>Nor wait till evening for the genial joy:</a>
<a id='line_13891'>Then to the lute's soft voice prolong the night;</a>
<a id='line_13892'>Music, the banquet's most refined delight."</a>
<a id='line_13893'></a>
<a id='line_13894'>He said, then gave a nod; and at the word</a>
<a id='line_13895'>Telemachus girds on his shining sword.</a>
<a id='line_13896'>Fast by his father's side he takes his stand:</a>
<a id='line_13897'>The beamy javelin lightens in his hand.</a>

<a id='line_13905'>THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.</a>
<a id='line_13906'></a>
<a id='line_13907'>Ulysses begins the slaughter of the suitors by the death of</a>
<a id='line_13908'>Antinous. He declares himself, and lets fly his arrows at the</a>
<a id='line_13909'>rest. Telemachus assists and brings arms for his father, himself,</a>
<a id='line_13910'>Eumaeus, and Philaetius. Melanthius does the same for the wooers.</a>
<a id='line_13911'>Minerva encourages Ulysses in the shape of Mentor. The suitors are</a>
<a id='line_13912'>all slain, only Medon and Phemius are spared. Melanthius and the</a>
<a id='line_13913'>unfaithful servants are executed. The rest acknowledge their</a>
<a id='line_13914'>master with all demonstrations of joy.</a>
<a id='line_13915'></a>
<a id='line_13916'></a>
<a id='line_13917'></a>
<a id='line_13918'>Then fierce the hero o'er the threshold strode;</a>
<a id='line_13919'>Stripp'd of his rags, he blazed out like a god.</a>
<a id='line_13920'>Full in their face the lifted bow he bore,</a>
<a id='line_13921'>And quiver'd deaths, a formidable store;</a>
<a id='line_13922'>Before his feet the rattling shower he threw,</a>
<a id='line_13923'>And thus, terrific, to the suitor-crew:</a>
<a id='line_13924'></a>
<a id='line_13925'>"One venturous game this hand hath won to-day,</a>
<a id='line_13926'>Another, princes! yet remains to play;</a>
<a id='line_13927'>Another mark our arrow must attain.</a>
<a id='line_13928'>Phoebus, assist! nor be the labour vain."</a>
<a id='line_13929'>Swift as the word the parting arrow sings,</a>
<a id='line_13930'>And bears thy fate, Antinous, on its wings:</a>
<a id='line_13931'>Wretch that he was, of unprophetic soul!</a>
<a id='line_13932'>High in his hands he rear'd the golden bowl!</a>
<a id='line_13933'>E'en then to drain it lengthen'd out his breath;</a>
<a id='line_13934'>Changed to the deep, the bitter draught of death:</a>
<a id='line_13935'>For fate who fear'd amidst a feastful band?</a>
<a id='line_13936'>And fate to numbers, by a single hand?</a>
<a id='line_13937'>Full through his throat Ulysses' weapon pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_13938'>And pierced his neck. He falls, and breathes his last.</a>
<a id='line_13939'>The tumbling goblet the wide floor o'erflows,</a>
<a id='line_13940'>A stream of gore burst spouting from his nose;</a>
<a id='line_13941'>Grim in convulsive agonies be sprawls:</a>
<a id='line_13942'>Before him spurn'd the loaded table falls,</a>
<a id='line_13943'>And spreads the pavement with a mingled flood</a>
<a id='line_13944'>Of floating meats, and wine, and human blood.</a>
<a id='line_13945'>Amazed, confounded, as they saw him fall,</a>
<a id='line_13946'>Up rose he throngs tumultuous round the hall:</a>
<a id='line_13947'>O'er all the dome they cast a haggard eye,</a>
<a id='line_13948'>Each look'd for arms--in vain; no arms were nigh:</a>
<a id='line_13949'>"Aim'st thou at princes? (all amazed they said;)</a>
<a id='line_13950'>Thy last of games unhappy hast thou play'd;</a>
<a id='line_13951'>Thy erring shaft has made our bravest bleed,</a>
<a id='line_13952'>And death, unlucky guest, attends thy deed.</a>
<a id='line_13953'>Vultures shall tear thee." Thus incensed they spoke,</a>
<a id='line_13954'>While each to chance ascribed the wondrous stroke:</a>
<a id='line_13955'>Blind as they were: for death e'en now invades</a>
<a id='line_13956'>His destined prey, and wraps them all in shades.</a>
<a id='line_13957'>Then, grimly frowning, with a dreadful look,</a>
<a id='line_13958'>That wither'd all their hearts, Ulysses spoke:</a>
<a id='line_13959'></a>
<a id='line_13960'>"Dogs, ye have had your day! ye fear'd no more</a>
<a id='line_13961'>Ulysses vengeful from the Trojan shore;</a>
<a id='line_13962'>While, to your lust and spoil a guardless prey,</a>
<a id='line_13963'>Our house, our wealth, our helpless handmaids lay:</a>
<a id='line_13964'>Not so content, with bolder frenzy fired,</a>
<a id='line_13965'>E'en to our bed presumptuous you aspired:</a>
<a id='line_13966'>Laws or divine or human fail'd to move,</a>
<a id='line_13967'>Or shame of men, or dread of gods above;</a>
<a id='line_13968'>Heedless alike of infamy or praise,</a>
<a id='line_13969'>Or Fame's eternal voice in future days;</a>
<a id='line_13970'>The hour of vengeance, wretches, now is come;</a>
<a id='line_13971'>Impending fate is yours, and instant doom."</a>
<a id='line_13972'></a>
<a id='line_13973'>Thus dreadful he. Confused the suitors stood,</a>
<a id='line_13974'>From their pale cheeks recedes the flying blood:</a>
<a id='line_13975'>Trembling they sought their guilty heads to hide.</a>
<a id='line_13976'>Alone the bold Eurymachus replied:</a>
<a id='line_13977'></a>
<a id='line_13978'>"If, as thy words import (he thus began),</a>
<a id='line_13979'>Ulysses lives, and thou the mighty man,</a>
<a id='line_13980'>Great are thy wrongs, and much hast thou sustain'd</a>
<a id='line_13981'>In thy spoil'd palace, and exhausted land;</a>
<a id='line_13982'>The cause and author of those guilty deeds,</a>
<a id='line_13983'>Lo! at thy feet unjust Antinous bleeds</a>
<a id='line_13984'>Not love, but wild ambition was his guide;</a>
<a id='line_13985'>To slay thy son, thy kingdom to divide,</a>
<a id='line_13986'>These were his aims; but juster Jove denied.</a>
<a id='line_13987'>Since cold in death the offender lies, oh spare</a>
<a id='line_13988'>Thy suppliant people, and receive their prayer!</a>
<a id='line_13989'>Brass, gold, and treasures, shall the spoil defray,</a>
<a id='line_13990'>Two hundred oxen every prince shall pay:</a>
<a id='line_13991'>The waste of years refunded in a day.</a>
<a id='line_13992'>Till then thy wrath is just." Ulysses burn'd</a>
<a id='line_13993'>With high disdain, and sternly thus return'd:</a>
<a id='line_13994'></a>
<a id='line_13995'>"All, all the treasure that enrich'd our throne</a>
<a id='line_13996'>Before your rapines, join'd with all your own,</a>
<a id='line_13997'>If offer'd, vainly should for mercy call;</a>
<a id='line_13998'>'Tis you that offer, and I scorn them all;</a>
<a id='line_13999'>Your blood is my demand, your lives the prize,</a>
<a id='line_14000'>Till pale as yonder wretch each suitor lies.</a>
<a id='line_14001'>Hence with those coward terms; or fight or fly;</a>
<a id='line_14002'>This choice is left you, to resist or die:</a>
<a id='line_14003'>And die I trust ye shall." He sternly spoke:</a>
<a id='line_14004'>With guilty fears the pale assembly shook.</a>
<a id='line_14005'>Alone Eurymachus exhorts the train:</a>
<a id='line_14006'>"Yon archer, comrades, will not shoot in vain;</a>
<a id='line_14007'>But from the threshold shall his darts be sped,</a>
<a id='line_14008'>(Whoe'er he be), till every prince lie dead?</a>
<a id='line_14009'>Be mindful of yourselves, draw forth your swords,</a>
<a id='line_14010'>And to his shafts obtend these ample boards</a>
<a id='line_14011'>(So need compels). Then, all united, strive</a>
<a id='line_14012'>The bold invader from his post to drive:</a>
<a id='line_14013'>The city roused shall to our rescue haste,</a>
<a id='line_14014'>And this mad archer soon have shot his last."</a>
<a id='line_14015'>Swift as he spoke, he drew his traitor sword,</a>
<a id='line_14016'>And like a lion rush'd against his lord:</a>
<a id='line_14017'>The wary chief the rushing foe repress'd,</a>
<a id='line_14018'>Who met the point and forced it in his breast:</a>
<a id='line_14019'>His falling hand deserts the lifted sword,</a>
<a id='line_14020'>And prone he falls extended o'er the board!</a>
<a id='line_14021'>Before him wide, in mix'd effusion roll</a>
<a id='line_14022'>The untasted viands, and the jovial bowl.</a>
<a id='line_14023'>Full through his liver pass'd the mortal wound,</a>
<a id='line_14024'>With dying rage his forehead beats the ground;</a>
<a id='line_14025'>He spurn'd the seat with fury as he fell,</a>
<a id='line_14026'>And the fierce soul to darkness dived, and hell.</a>
<a id='line_14027'>Next bold Amphinomus his arm extends</a>
<a id='line_14028'>To force the pass; the godlike man defends.</a>
<a id='line_14029'>Thy spear, Telemachus, prevents the attack,</a>
<a id='line_14030'>The brazen weapon driving through his back.</a>
<a id='line_14031'>Thence through his breast its bloody passage tore;</a>
<a id='line_14032'>Flat falls he thundering on the marble floor,</a>
<a id='line_14033'>And his crush'd forehead marks the stone with gore.</a>
<a id='line_14034'>He left his javelin in the dead, for fear</a>
<a id='line_14035'>The long encumbrance of the weighty spear</a>
<a id='line_14036'>To the fierce foe advantage might afford,</a>
<a id='line_14037'>To rash between and use the shorten'd sword.</a>
<a id='line_14038'>With speedy ardour to his sire he flies,</a>
<a id='line_14039'>And, "Arm, great father! arm (in haste he cries).</a>
<a id='line_14040'>Lo, hence I run for other arms to wield,</a>
<a id='line_14041'>For missive javelins, and for helm and shield;</a>
<a id='line_14042'>Fast by our side let either faithful swain</a>
<a id='line_14043'>In arms attend us, and their part sustain."</a>
<a id='line_14044'></a>
<a id='line_14045'>"Haste, and return (Ulysses made reply)</a>
<a id='line_14046'>While yet the auxiliar shafts this hand supply;</a>
<a id='line_14047'>Lest thus alone, encounter'd by an host,</a>
<a id='line_14048'>Driven from the gate, the important past be lost."</a>
<a id='line_14049'></a>
<a id='line_14050'>With speed Telemachus obeys, and flies</a>
<a id='line_14051'>Where piled in heaps the royal armour lies;</a>
<a id='line_14052'>Four brazen helmets, eight refulgent spears,</a>
<a id='line_14053'>And four broad bucklers to his sire he bears:</a>
<a id='line_14054'>At once in brazen panoply they shone.</a>
<a id='line_14055'>At once each servant braced his armour on;</a>
<a id='line_14056'>Around their king a faithful guard they stand.</a>
<a id='line_14057'>While yet each shaft flew deathful from his hand:</a>
<a id='line_14058'>Chief after chief expired at every wound,</a>
<a id='line_14059'>And swell'd the bleeding mountain on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_14060'>Soon as his store of flying fates was spent.</a>
<a id='line_14061'>Against the wall he set the bow unbent;</a>
<a id='line_14062'>And now his shoulders bear the massy shield,</a>
<a id='line_14063'>And now his hands two beamy javelins wield:</a>
<a id='line_14064'>He frowns beneath his nodding plume, that play'd</a>
<a id='line_14065'>O'er the high crest, and cast a dreadful shade.</a>
<a id='line_14066'></a>
<a id='line_14067'>There stood a window near, whence looking down</a>
<a id='line_14068'>From o'er the porch appear'd the subject town.</a>
<a id='line_14069'>A double strength of valves secured the place,</a>
<a id='line_14070'>A high and narrow; but the only pass:</a>
<a id='line_14071'>The cautious king, with all-preventing care,</a>
<a id='line_14072'>To guard that outlet, placed Eumaeus there;</a>
<a id='line_14073'>When Agelaus thus: "Has none the sense</a>
<a id='line_14074'>To mount yon window, and alarm from thence</a>
<a id='line_14075'>The neighbour-town? the town shall force the door,</a>
<a id='line_14076'>And this bold archer soon shall shoot no more."</a>
<a id='line_14077'>Melanthius then: "That outlet to the gate</a>
<a id='line_14078'>So near adjoins, that one may guard the strait.</a>
<a id='line_14079'>But other methods of defence remain;</a>
<a id='line_14080'>Myself with arms can furnish all the train;</a>
<a id='line_14081'>Stores from the royal magazine I bring,</a>
<a id='line_14082'>And their own darts shall pierce the prince and king."</a>
<a id='line_14083'></a>
<a id='line_14084'>He said; and mounting up the lofty stairs,</a>
<a id='line_14085'>Twelve shields, twelve lances, and twelve helmets bears:</a>
<a id='line_14086'>All arm, and sudden round the hall appears</a>
<a id='line_14087'>A blaze of bucklers, and a wood of spears.</a>
<a id='line_14088'></a>
<a id='line_14089'>The hero stands oppress'd with mighty woe,</a>
<a id='line_14090'>On every side he sees the labour grow;</a>
<a id='line_14091'>"Oh cursed event! and oh unlook'd for aid!</a>
<a id='line_14092'>Melanthius or the women have betray'd--</a>
<a id='line_14093'>Oh my dear son!"--The father with a sigh</a>
<a id='line_14094'>Then ceased; the filial virtue made reply;</a>
<a id='line_14095'></a>
<a id='line_14096'>"Falsehood is folly, and 'tis just to own</a>
<a id='line_14097'>The fault committed: this was mine alone;</a>
<a id='line_14098'>My haste neglected yonder door to bar,</a>
<a id='line_14099'>And hence the villain has supplied their war.</a>
<a id='line_14100'>Run, good Eumaeus, then, and (what before</a>
<a id='line_14101'>I thoughtless err'd in) well secure that door:</a>
<a id='line_14102'>Learn, if by female fraud this deed were done,</a>
<a id='line_14103'>Or (as my thought misgives) by Dolius' son."</a>
<a id='line_14104'></a>
<a id='line_14105'>While yet they spoke, in quest of arms again</a>
<a id='line_14106'>To the high chamber stole the faithless swain,</a>
<a id='line_14107'>Not unobserved. Eumaeus watchful eyed,</a>
<a id='line_14108'>And thus address'd Ulysses near his side:</a>
<a id='line_14109'></a>
<a id='line_14110'>"The miscreant we suspected takes that way;</a>
<a id='line_14111'>Him, if this arm be powerful, shall I slay?</a>
<a id='line_14112'>Or drive him hither, to receive the meed</a>
<a id='line_14113'>From thy own hand, of this detested deed?"</a>
<a id='line_14114'></a>
<a id='line_14115'>"Not so (replied Ulysses); leave him there,</a>
<a id='line_14116'>For us sufficient is another care;</a>
<a id='line_14117'>Within the structure of this palace wall</a>
<a id='line_14118'>To keep enclosed his masters till they fall.</a>
<a id='line_14119'>Go you, and seize the felon; backward bind</a>
<a id='line_14120'>His arms and legs, and fix a plank behind:</a>
<a id='line_14121'>On this his body by strong cords extend,</a>
<a id='line_14122'>And on a column near the roof suspend:</a>
<a id='line_14123'>So studied tortures his vile days shall end."</a>
<a id='line_14124'></a>
<a id='line_14125'>The ready swains obey'd with joyful haste,</a>
<a id='line_14126'>Behind the felon unperceived they pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_14127'>As round the room in quest of arms he goes</a>
<a id='line_14128'>(The half-shut door conceal'd his lurking foes):</a>
<a id='line_14129'>One hand sustain'd a helm, and one the shield</a>
<a id='line_14130'>Which old Laertes wont in youth to wield,</a>
<a id='line_14131'>Cover'd with dust, with dryness chapp'd and worn,</a>
<a id='line_14132'>The brass corroded, and the leather torn.</a>
<a id='line_14133'>Thus laden, o'er the threshold as he stepp'd,</a>
<a id='line_14134'>Fierce on the villain from each side they leap'd,</a>
<a id='line_14135'>Back by the hair the trembling dastard drew,</a>
<a id='line_14136'>And down reluctant on the pavement threw.</a>
<a id='line_14137'>Active and pleased the zealous swains fulfil</a>
<a id='line_14138'>At every point their master's rigid will;</a>
<a id='line_14139'>First, fast behind, his hands and feet they bound,</a>
<a id='line_14140'>Then straighten'd cords involved his body round;</a>
<a id='line_14141'>So drawn aloft, athwart the column tied,</a>
<a id='line_14142'>The howling felon swung from side to side.</a>
<a id='line_14143'></a>
<a id='line_14144'>Eumaeus scoffing then with keen disdain:</a>
<a id='line_14145'>"There pass thy pleasing night, O gentle swain!</a>
<a id='line_14146'>On that soft pillow, from that envied height,</a>
<a id='line_14147'>First may'st thou see the springing dawn of light;</a>
<a id='line_14148'>So timely rise, when morning streaks the east,</a>
<a id='line_14149'>To drive thy victims to the suitors' feast."</a>
<a id='line_14150'></a>
<a id='line_14151'>This said, they, left him, tortured as he lay,</a>
<a id='line_14152'>Secured the door, and hasty strode away:</a>
<a id='line_14153'>Each, breathing death, resumed his dangerous post</a>
<a id='line_14154'>Near great Ulysses; four against an host,</a>
<a id='line_14155'>When lo! descending to her hero's aid,</a>
<a id='line_14156'>Jove's daughter, Pallas, War's triumphant maid:</a>
<a id='line_14157'>In Mentor's friendly form she join'd his side:</a>
<a id='line_14158'>Ulysses saw, and thus with transport cried:</a>
<a id='line_14159'></a>
<a id='line_14160'>"Come, ever welcome, and thy succour lend;</a>
<a id='line_14161'>O every sacred name in one, my friend!</a>
<a id='line_14162'>Early we loved, and long our loves have grown;</a>
<a id='line_14163'>Whate'er through life's whole series I have done,</a>
<a id='line_14164'>Or good, or grateful, now to mind recall,</a>
<a id='line_14165'>And, aiding this one hour, repay it all."</a>
<a id='line_14166'></a>
<a id='line_14167'>Thus he; but pleasing hopes his bosom warm</a>
<a id='line_14168'>Of Pallas latent in the friendly form.</a>
<a id='line_14169'>The adverse host the phantom-warrior eyed,</a>
<a id='line_14170'>And first, loud-threatening, Agelaus cried:</a>
<a id='line_14171'></a>
<a id='line_14172'>"Mentor, beware, nor let that tongue persuade</a>
<a id='line_14173'>Thy frantic arm to lend Ulysses aid;</a>
<a id='line_14174'>Our force successful shall our threat make good,</a>
<a id='line_14175'>And with the sire and son commix thy blood.</a>
<a id='line_14176'>What hopest thou here? Thee first the sword shall slay,</a>
<a id='line_14177'>Then lop thy whole posterity away;</a>
<a id='line_14178'>Far hence thy banish'd consort shall we send;</a>
<a id='line_14179'>With his thy forfeit lands and treasures blend;</a>
<a id='line_14180'>Thus, and thus only, shalt thou join thy friend."</a>
<a id='line_14181'></a>
<a id='line_14182'>His barbarous insult even the goddess fires,</a>
<a id='line_14183'>Who thus the warrior to revenge inspires:</a>
<a id='line_14184'></a>
<a id='line_14185'>"Art thou Ulysses? where then shall we find</a>
<a id='line_14186'>The patient body and the constant mind?</a>
<a id='line_14187'>That courage, once the Trojans' daily dread,</a>
<a id='line_14188'>Known nine long years, and felt by heroes dead?</a>
<a id='line_14189'>And where that conduct, which revenged the lust</a>
<a id='line_14190'>Of Priam's race, and laid proud Troy in dust?</a>
<a id='line_14191'>If this, when Helen was the cause, were done;</a>
<a id='line_14192'>What for thy country now, thy queen, thy son?</a>
<a id='line_14193'>Rise then in combat, at my side attend;</a>
<a id='line_14194'>Observe what vigour gratitude can lend,</a>
<a id='line_14195'>And foes how weak, opposed against a friend!"</a>
<a id='line_14196'></a>
<a id='line_14197'>She spoke; but willing longer to survey</a>
<a id='line_14198'>The sire and son's great acts withheld the day!</a>
<a id='line_14199'>By farther toils decreed the brave to try,</a>
<a id='line_14200'>And level poised the wings of victory;</a>
<a id='line_14201'>Then with a change of form eludes their sight,</a>
<a id='line_14202'>Perch'd like a swallow on a rafter's height,</a>
<a id='line_14203'>And unperceived enjoys the rising fight.</a>
<a id='line_14204'></a>
<a id='line_14205'>Damastor's son, bold Agelaus, leads,</a>
<a id='line_14206'>The guilty war, Eurynomus succeeds;</a>
<a id='line_14207'>With these, Pisander, great Polyctor's son,</a>
<a id='line_14208'>Sage Polybus, and stern Amphimedon,</a>
<a id='line_14209'>With Demoptolemus: these six survive:</a>
<a id='line_14210'>The best of all the shafts had left alive.</a>
<a id='line_14211'>Amidst the carnage, desperate as they stand,</a>
<a id='line_14212'>Thus Agelaus roused the lagging band:</a>
<a id='line_14213'></a>
<a id='line_14214'>"The hour has come, when yon fierce man no more</a>
<a id='line_14215'>With bleeding princes shall bestrew the floor;</a>
<a id='line_14216'>Lo! Mentor leaves him with an empty boast;</a>
<a id='line_14217'>The four remain, but four against an host.</a>
<a id='line_14218'>Let each at once discharge the deadly dart,</a>
<a id='line_14219'>One sure of six shall reach Ulysses' heart:</a>
<a id='line_14220'>The rest must perish, their great leader slain:</a>
<a id='line_14221'>Thus shall one stroke the glory lost regain."</a>
<a id='line_14222'></a>
<a id='line_14223'>Then all at once their mingled lances threw,</a>
<a id='line_14224'>And thirsty all of one man's blood they flew;</a>
<a id='line_14225'>In vain! Minerva turned them with her breath,</a>
<a id='line_14226'>And scattered short, or wide, the points of death!</a>
<a id='line_14227'>With deaden'd sound one on the threshold falls,</a>
<a id='line_14228'>One strikes the gate, one rings against the walls:</a>
<a id='line_14229'>The storm passed innocent. The godlike man</a>
<a id='line_14230'>Now loftier trod, and dreadful thus began:</a>
<a id='line_14231'>"'Tis now (brave friends) our turn, at once to throw,</a>

<a id='line_14234'>Would add our blood, injustice still proceeds."</a>
<a id='line_14235'></a>
<a id='line_14236'>He spoke: at once their fiery lances flew:</a>
<a id='line_14237'>Great Demoptolemus Ulysses slew;</a>
<a id='line_14238'>Euryades received the prince's dart;</a>
<a id='line_14239'>The goatherd's quiver'd in Pisander's heart;</a>
<a id='line_14240'>Fierce Elatus by thine, Eumaeus, falls;</a>
<a id='line_14241'>Their fall in thunder echoes round the walls.</a>
<a id='line_14242'>The rest retreat: the victors now advance,</a>
<a id='line_14243'>Each from the dead resumes his bloody lance.</a>
<a id='line_14244'>Again the foe discharge the steely shower;</a>
<a id='line_14245'>Again made frustrate by the virgin-power.</a>
<a id='line_14246'>Some, turn'd by Pallas, on the threshold fall,</a>
<a id='line_14247'>Some wound the gate, some ring against the wall;</a>
<a id='line_14248'>Some weak, or ponderous with the brazen head,</a>
<a id='line_14249'>Drop harmless on the pavement, sounding dead.</a>
<a id='line_14250'></a>
<a id='line_14251'>Then bold Amphimedon his javelin cast:</a>
<a id='line_14252'>Thy hand, Telemachus, it lightly razed:</a>
<a id='line_14253'>And from Ctesippus' arm the spear elanced:</a>
<a id='line_14254'>On good Eumaeus' shield and shoulder glanced;</a>
<a id='line_14255'>Not lessened of their force (so light the wound)</a>
<a id='line_14256'>Each sung along and dropped upon the ground.</a>
<a id='line_14257'>Fate doom'd thee next, Eurydamus, to bear,</a>
<a id='line_14258'>Thy death ennobled by Ulysses' spear.</a>
<a id='line_14259'>By the bold son Amphimedon was slain,</a>
<a id='line_14260'>And Polybus renown'd, the faithful swain.</a>
<a id='line_14261'>Pierced through the breast the rude Ctesippus bled,</a>
<a id='line_14262'>And thus Philaetius gloried o'er the dead:</a>
<a id='line_14263'></a>
<a id='line_14264'>"There end thy pompous vaunts and high disdain;</a>
<a id='line_14265'>O sharp in scandal, voluble and vain!</a>
<a id='line_14266'>How weak is mortal pride! To Heaven alone</a>
<a id='line_14267'>The event of actions and our fates are known:</a>
<a id='line_14268'>Scoffer, behold what gratitude we bear:</a>
<a id='line_14269'>The victim's heel is answered with this spear."</a>
<a id='line_14270'></a>
<a id='line_14271'>Ulysses brandish'd high his vengeful steel,</a>

<a id='line_14273'>Fast by Leocritus expiring lay,</a>
<a id='line_14274'>The prince's javelin tore its bloody way</a>
<a id='line_14275'>Through all his bowels: down he tumbled prone,</a>
<a id='line_14276'>His batter'd front and brains besmear the stone.</a>
<a id='line_14277'></a>
<a id='line_14278'>Now Pallas shines confess'd; aloft she spreads</a>
<a id='line_14279'>The arm of vengeance o'er their guilty heads:</a>

<a id='line_14281'>Amazed they see, they tremble, and they fly:</a>
<a id='line_14282'>Confused, distracted, through he rooms they fling:</a>
<a id='line_14283'>Like oxen madden'd by the breeze's sting,</a>
<a id='line_14284'>When sultry days, and long, succeed the gentle spring,</a>
<a id='line_14285'>Not half so keen fierce vultures of the chase</a>
<a id='line_14286'>Stoop from the mountains on the feather'd race,</a>
<a id='line_14287'>When, the wide field extended snares beset,</a>
<a id='line_14288'>With conscious dread they shun the quivering net:</a>
<a id='line_14289'>No help, no flight; but wounded every way,</a>
<a id='line_14290'>Headlong they drop; the fowlers seize their prey.</a>
<a id='line_14291'>On all sides thus they double wound on wound,</a>
<a id='line_14292'>In prostrate heaps the wretches beat the ground,</a>
<a id='line_14293'>Unmanly shrieks precede each dying groan,</a>
<a id='line_14294'>And a red deluge floats the reaking stone.</a>
<a id='line_14295'></a>
<a id='line_14296'>Leiodes first before the victor falls:</a>

<a id='line_14412'>Fate and their crime have sunk them to the dust.</a>
<a id='line_14413'>Nor heeded these the censure of mankind,</a>
<a id='line_14414'>The good and bad were equal in their mind</a>
<a id='line_14415'>Justly the price of worthlessness they paid,</a>
<a id='line_14416'>And each now wails an unlamented shade.</a>
<a id='line_14417'>But thou sincere! O Euryclea, say,</a>
<a id='line_14418'>What maids dishonour us, and what obey?"</a>
<a id='line_14419'></a>
<a id='line_14420'>Then she: "In these thy kingly walls remain</a>

<a id='line_14431'>"Not so (Ulysses, more sedate, replied),</a>
<a id='line_14432'>Bring first the crew who wrought these guilty deeds."</a>
<a id='line_14433'>In haste the matron parts: the king proceeds;</a>
<a id='line_14434'>"Now to dispose the dead, the care remains</a>
<a id='line_14435'>To you, my son, and you, my faithfull swains;</a>
<a id='line_14436'>The offending females to that task we doom,</a>
<a id='line_14437'>To wash, to scent, and purify the room;</a>
<a id='line_14438'>These (every table cleansed, and every throne,</a>
<a id='line_14439'>And all the melancholy labour done)</a>
<a id='line_14440'>Drive to yon court, without the palace wall,</a>
<a id='line_14441'>There the revenging sword shall smite them all;</a>
<a id='line_14442'>So with the suitors let them mix in dust,</a>
<a id='line_14443'>Stretch'd in a long oblivion of their lust."</a>
<a id='line_14444'>He said: the lamentable train appear,</a>
<a id='line_14445'>Each vents a groan, and drops a tender tear;</a>
<a id='line_14446'>Each heaved her mournful burden, and beneath</a>
<a id='line_14447'>The porch deposed the ghastly heap of death.</a>
<a id='line_14448'>The chief severe, compelling each to move,</a>
<a id='line_14449'>Urged the dire task imperious from above;</a>
<a id='line_14450'>With thirsty sponge they rub the tables o'er</a>
<a id='line_14451'>(The swains unite their toil); the walls, the floor,</a>
<a id='line_14452'>Wash'd with the effusive wave, are purged of gore.</a>
<a id='line_14453'>Once more the palace set in fair array,</a>
<a id='line_14454'>To the base court the females take their way;</a>
<a id='line_14455'>There compass'd close between the dome and wall</a>
<a id='line_14456'>(Their life's last scene) they trembling wait their fall.</a>
<a id='line_14457'></a>
<a id='line_14458'>Then thus the prince: "To these shall we afford</a>
<a id='line_14459'>A fate so pure as by the martial sword?</a>
<a id='line_14460'>To these, the nightly prostitutes to shame,</a>
<a id='line_14461'>And base revilers of our house and name?"</a>
<a id='line_14462'></a>
<a id='line_14463'>Thus speaking, on the circling wall he strung</a>
<a id='line_14464'>A ship's tough cable from a column hung;</a>
<a id='line_14465'>Near the high top he strain'd it strongly round,</a>
<a id='line_14466'>Whence no contending foot could reach the ground.</a>
<a id='line_14467'>Their heads above connected in a row,</a>
<a id='line_14468'>They beat the air with quivering feet below:</a>
<a id='line_14469'>Thus on some tree hung struggling in the snare,</a>
<a id='line_14470'>The doves or thrushes flap their wings in air.</a>
<a id='line_14471'>Soon fled the soul impure, and left behind</a>
<a id='line_14472'>The empty corse to waver with the wind.</a>
<a id='line_14473'></a>
<a id='line_14474'>Then forth they led Melanthius, and began</a>
<a id='line_14475'>Their bloody work; they lopp'd away the man,</a>
<a id='line_14476'>Morsel for dogs! then trimm'd with brazen shears</a>
<a id='line_14477'>The wretch, and shorten'd of his nose and ears;</a>
<a id='line_14478'>His hands and feet last felt the cruel steel:</a>
<a id='line_14479'>He roar'd, and torments gave his soul to hell.</a>
<a id='line_14480'>They wash, and to Ulysses take their way:</a>
<a id='line_14481'>So ends the bloody business of the day.</a>
<a id='line_14482'></a>
<a id='line_14483'>To Euryclea then address'd the king:</a>
<a id='line_14484'>("Bring hither fire, and hither sulphur bring,</a>
<a id='line_14485'>To purge the palace: then the queen attend,</a>
<a id='line_14486'>And let her with her matron-train descend;</a>
<a id='line_14487'>The matron-train, with all the virgin-band,</a>
<a id='line_14488'>Assemble here, to learn their lord's command."</a>
<a id='line_14489'></a>
<a id='line_14490'>Then Euryclea: "Joyful I obey,</a>
<a id='line_14491'>But cast those mean dishonest rags away;</a>
<a id='line_14492'>Permit me first the royal robes to bring:</a>
<a id='line_14493'>Ill suits this garb the shoulders of a king."</a>
<a id='line_14494'>"Bring sulphur straight, and fire" (the monarch cries).</a>
<a id='line_14495'>She hears, and at the word obedient flies.</a>
<a id='line_14496'>With fire and sulphur, cure of noxious fumes,</a>
<a id='line_14497'>He purged the walls, and blood-polluted rooms.</a>
<a id='line_14498'>Again the matron springs with eager pace,</a>
<a id='line_14499'>And spreads her lord's return from place to place.</a>
<a id='line_14500'>They hear, rush forth, and instant round him stand,</a>
<a id='line_14501'>A gazing throng, a torch in every hand.</a>
<a id='line_14502'>They saw, they knew him, and with fond embrace</a>
<a id='line_14503'>Each humbly kiss'd his knee, or hand, or face;</a>
<a id='line_14504'>He knows them all, in all such truth appears,</a>
<a id='line_14505'>E'en he indulges the sweet joy of tears.</a>

<a id='line_14511'>ARGUMENT.</a>
<a id='line_14512'></a>
<a id='line_14513'>Euryclea awakens Penelope with the news of Ulysses' return, and</a>
<a id='line_14514'>the death of the suitors. Penelope scarcely credits her; but</a>
<a id='line_14515'>supposes some god has punished them, and descends from her</a>
<a id='line_14516'>department in doubt. At the first interview of Ulysses and</a>
<a id='line_14517'>Penelope, she is quite unsatisfied. Minerva restores him to the</a>
<a id='line_14518'>beauty of his youth; but the queen continues incredulous, till by</a>
<a id='line_14519'>some circumstances she is convinced, and falls into all the</a>
<a id='line_14520'>transports of passion and tenderness. They recount to each other</a>
<a id='line_14521'>all that has passed during their long separation. The next morning</a>
<a id='line_14522'>Ulysses, arming himself and his friends, goes from the city to</a>
<a id='line_14523'>visit his father.</a>
<a id='line_14524'></a>
<a id='line_14525'></a>
<a id='line_14526'></a>
<a id='line_14527'>Then to the queen, as in repose she lay,</a>
<a id='line_14528'>The nurse with eager rapture speeds her way:</a>
<a id='line_14529'>The transports of her faithful heart supply</a>
<a id='line_14530'>A sudden youth, and give her wings to fly.</a>
<a id='line_14531'></a>
<a id='line_14532'>"And sleeps my child? (the reverend matron cries)</a>
<a id='line_14533'>Ulysses lives! arise, my child, arise!</a>
<a id='line_14534'>At length appears the long-expected hour!</a>
<a id='line_14535'>Ulysses comes! the suitors are no more!</a>
<a id='line_14536'>No more they view the golden light of day!</a>
<a id='line_14537'>Arise, and bless thee with the glad survey?"</a>
<a id='line_14538'></a>
<a id='line_14539'>Touch'd at her words, the mournful queen rejoin'd:</a>
<a id='line_14540'>"Ah! whither wanders thy distemper'd mind?</a>
<a id='line_14541'>The righteous powers, who tread the starry skies,</a>
<a id='line_14542'>The weak enlighten, and confound the wise,</a>
<a id='line_14543'>And human thought, with unresisted sway,</a>
<a id='line_14544'>Depress or raise, enlarge or take away:</a>
<a id='line_14545'>Truth, by their high decree, thy voice forsakes,</a>
<a id='line_14546'>And folly with the tongue of wisdom speaks.</a>
<a id='line_14547'>Unkind, the fond illusion to impose!</a>
<a id='line_14548'>Was it to flatter or deride my woes?</a>
<a id='line_14549'>Never did I sleep so sweet enjoy,</a>
<a id='line_14550'>Since my dear lord left Ithaca for Troy.</a>
<a id='line_14551'>Why must I wake to grieve, and curse thy shore,</a>
<a id='line_14552'>O Troy?--may never tongue pronounce thee more!</a>
<a id='line_14553'>Begone! another might have felt our rage,</a>
<a id='line_14554'>But age is sacred, and we spare thy age."</a>
<a id='line_14555'></a>
<a id='line_14556'>To whom with warmth: "My soul a lie disdains;</a>
<a id='line_14557'>Ulysses lives, thy own Ulysses reigns:</a>
<a id='line_14558'>That stranger, patient of the suitors' wrongs,</a>

<a id='line_14560'>He, he is thine! Thy son his latent guest</a>

<a id='line_14562'>With well concerted art to end his woes,</a>
<a id='line_14563'>And burst at once in vengeance on the foes."</a>
<a id='line_14564'></a>
<a id='line_14565'>While yet she spoke, the queen in transport sprung</a>
<a id='line_14566'>Swift from the couch, and round the matron hung;</a>
<a id='line_14567'>Fast from her eye descends the rolling tear:</a>
<a id='line_14568'>"Say, once more say, is my Ulysses here?</a>
<a id='line_14569'>How could that numerous and outrageous band</a>
<a id='line_14570'>By one be slain, though by a hero's hand?"</a>
<a id='line_14571'></a>
<a id='line_14572'>"I saw it not (she cries), but heard alone,</a>
<a id='line_14573'>When death was busy, a loud dying groan;</a>
<a id='line_14574'>The damsel-train turn'd pale at every wound,</a>
<a id='line_14575'>Immured we sate, and catch'd each passing sound;</a>
<a id='line_14576'>When death had seized her prey, thy son attends,</a>
<a id='line_14577'>And at his nod the damsel-train descends;</a>
<a id='line_14578'>There terrible in arms Ulysses stood,</a>
<a id='line_14579'>And the dead suitors almost swam in blood:</a>
<a id='line_14580'>Thy heart had leap'd the hero to survey,</a>
<a id='line_14581'>Stern as the surly lion o'er his prey,</a>

<a id='line_14583'>The dome he purges, now the flame aspires;</a>
<a id='line_14584'>Heap'd lie the dead without the palace walls--</a>
<a id='line_14585'>Haste, daughter, haste, thy own Ulysses calls!</a>
<a id='line_14586'>Thy every wish the bounteous gods bestow;</a>

<a id='line_14599'>The good they hated, and the powers defied!</a>
<a id='line_14600'>But heaven is just, and by a god they died.</a>
<a id='line_14601'>For never must Ulysses view this shore;</a>
<a id='line_14602'>Never! the loved Ulysses is no more!"</a>
<a id='line_14603'></a>
<a id='line_14604'>"What words (the matron cries) have reach'd my ears?</a>
<a id='line_14605'>Doubt we his presence, when he now appears!</a>

<a id='line_14610'>And wild with transport had reveal'd the wound;</a>
<a id='line_14611'>But ere I spoke, he rose, and check'd the sound.</a>
<a id='line_14612'>Then, daughter, haste away! and if a lie</a>
<a id='line_14613'>Flow from this tongue, then let thy servant die!"</a>
<a id='line_14614'>To whom with dubious joy the queen replies:</a>
<a id='line_14615'>"Wise is thy soul, but errors seize the wise;</a>

<a id='line_14619'>The paths of death, by man, or by a god."</a>
<a id='line_14620'>Thus speaks the queen, and no reply attends,</a>
<a id='line_14621'>But with alternate joy and fear descends;</a>
<a id='line_14622'>At every step debates her lord to prove;</a>

<a id='line_14624'>Then gliding through the marble valves, in state</a>
<a id='line_14625'>Opposed, before the shining sire she sate.</a>
<a id='line_14626'>The monarch, by a column high enthroned,</a>
<a id='line_14627'>His eye withdrew, and fix'd it on the ground;</a>
<a id='line_14628'>Curious to hear his queen the silence break:</a>
<a id='line_14629'>Amazed she sate, and impotent to speak;</a>
<a id='line_14630'>O'er all the man her eyes she rolls in vain,</a>
<a id='line_14631'>Now hopes, now fears, now knows, then doubts again.</a>
<a id='line_14632'>At length Telemachus: "Oh, who can find</a>

<a id='line_14634'>Why thus in silence? why with winning charms</a>
<a id='line_14635'>Thus slow to fly with rapture to his arms?</a>
<a id='line_14636'>Stubborn the breast that with no transport glows,</a>

<a id='line_14641'>Distracting fears confound my labouring mind;</a>
<a id='line_14642'>Powerless to speak. I scarce uplift my eyes,</a>

<a id='line_14664'>"Then instant to the bath (the monarch cries),</a>
<a id='line_14665'>Bid the gay youth and sprightly virgins rise,</a>

<a id='line_14686'>Meanwhile the wearied king the bath ascends;</a>
<a id='line_14687'>With faithful cares Eurynome attends,</a>
<a id='line_14688'>O'er every limb a shower of fragrance sheds;</a>
<a id='line_14689'>Then, dress'd in pomp, magnificent he treads.</a>
<a id='line_14690'>The warrior-goddess gives his frame to shine</a>
<a id='line_14691'>With majesty enlarged, and grace divine.</a>
<a id='line_14692'>Back from his brows in wavy ringlets fly</a>
<a id='line_14693'>His thick large locks of hyacinthine dye.</a>

<a id='line_14733'>The huge trunk rose, and heaved into the sky;</a>
<a id='line_14734'>Around the tree I raised a nuptial bower,</a>

<a id='line_14737'>And the fair dome with polished marble shines.</a>
<a id='line_14738'>I lopp'd the branchy head: aloft in twain</a>

<a id='line_14740'>Then posts, capacious of the frame, I raise,</a>
<a id='line_14741'>And bore it, regular, from space to space:</a>

<a id='line_14957'></a>
<a id='line_14958'>The souls of the suitors are conducted by Mercury to the infernal</a>
<a id='line_14959'>shades. Ulysses in the country goes to the retirement of his</a>
<a id='line_14960'>father, Laertes; he finds him busied in his garden all alone; the</a>
<a id='line_14961'>manner of his discovery to him is beautifully described. They</a>
<a id='line_14962'>return together to his lodge, and the king is acknowledged by</a>
<a id='line_14963'>Dolius and the servants. The Ithacensians, led by Eupithes, the</a>
<a id='line_14964'>father of Antinous, rise against Ulysses, who gives them battle in</a>
<a id='line_14965'>which Eupithes is killed by Laertes: and the goddess Pallas makes</a>
<a id='line_14966'>a lasting peace between Ulysses and his subjects, which concludes</a>
<a id='line_14967'>the Odyssey.</a>

<a id='line_14971'>Cylenius now to Pluto's dreary reign</a>
<a id='line_14972'>Conveys the dead, a lamentable train!</a>
<a id='line_14973'>The golden wand, that causes sleep to fly,</a>
<a id='line_14974'>Or in soft slumber seals the wakeful eye,</a>
<a id='line_14975'>That drives the ghosts to realms of night or day,</a>
<a id='line_14976'>Points out the long uncomfortable way.</a>
<a id='line_14977'>Trembling the spectres glide, and plaintive vent</a>
<a id='line_14978'>Thin, hollow screams, along the deep descent.</a>
<a id='line_14979'>As in the cavern of some rifted den,</a>
<a id='line_14980'>Where flock nocturnal bats, and birds obscene;</a>
<a id='line_14981'>Cluster'd they hang, till at some sudden shock</a>
<a id='line_14982'>They move, and murmurs run through all the rock!</a>
<a id='line_14983'>So cowering fled the sable heaps of ghosts,</a>
<a id='line_14984'>And such a scream fill'd all the dismal coasts.</a>
<a id='line_14985'>And now they reach'd the earth's remotest ends,</a>
<a id='line_14986'>And now the gates where evening Sol descends,</a>
<a id='line_14987'>And Leucas' rock, and Ocean's utmost streams,</a>
<a id='line_14988'>And now pervade the dusky land of dreams,</a>
<a id='line_14989'>And rest at last, where souls unbodied dwell</a>
<a id='line_14990'>In ever-flowing meads of asphodel.</a>
<a id='line_14991'>The empty forms of men inhabit there,</a>
<a id='line_14992'>Impassive semblance, images of air!</a>
<a id='line_14993'>Naught else are all that shined on earth before:</a>
<a id='line_14994'>Ajax and great Achilles are no more!</a>
<a id='line_14995'>Yet still a master ghost, the rest he awed,</a>
<a id='line_14996'>The rest adored him, towering as he trod;</a>
<a id='line_14997'>Still at his side is Nestor's son survey'd,</a>
<a id='line_14998'>And loved Patroclus still attends his shade.</a>
<a id='line_14999'></a>
<a id='line_15000'>New as they were to that infernal shore,</a>
<a id='line_15001'>The suitors stopp'd, and gazed the hero o'er.</a>
<a id='line_15002'>When, moving slow, the regal form they view'd</a>
<a id='line_15003'>Of great Atrides: him in pomp pursued</a>
<a id='line_15004'>And solemn sadness through the gloom of hell,</a>

<a id='line_15013'>Condemn'd to pay the great arrear so soon,</a>
<a id='line_15014'>The lot, which all lament, and none can shun!</a>
<a id='line_15015'>Oh! better hadst thou sunk in Trojan ground,</a>
<a id='line_15016'>With all thy full-blown honours cover'd round;</a>
<a id='line_15017'>Then grateful Greece with streaming eyes might raise</a>
<a id='line_15018'>Historic marbles to record thy praise:</a>
<a id='line_15019'>Thy praise eternal on the faithful stone</a>

<a id='line_15023'></a>
<a id='line_15024'>"O son of Peleus! greater than mankind!</a>

<a id='line_15030'>And deluges of blood flow'd round you every way.</a>
<a id='line_15031'>Nor ceased the strife till Jove himself opposed,</a>

<a id='line_15033'>Then to the fleet we bore thy honour'd load,</a>
<a id='line_15034'>And decent on the funeral bed bestow'd;</a>
<a id='line_15035'>Then unguents sweet and tepid streams we shed;</a>
<a id='line_15036'>Tears flow'd from every eye, and o'er the dead</a>
<a id='line_15037'>Each clipp'd the curling honours of his head.</a>
<a id='line_15038'>Struck at the news, thy azure mother came,</a>
<a id='line_15039'>The sea-green sisters waited on the dame:</a>
<a id='line_15040'>A voice of loud lament through all the main</a>
<a id='line_15041'>Was heard; and terror seized the Grecian train:</a>
<a id='line_15042'>Back to their ships the frighted host had fled;</a>

<a id='line_15044'>(From old experience Nestor's counsel springs,</a>

<a id='line_15050'>Round thee, the Muses, with alternate strain,</a>
<a id='line_15051'>In ever-consecrating verse, complain.</a>
<a id='line_15052'>Each warlike Greek the moving music hears,</a>

<a id='line_15161'>Propp'd on a staff, deform'd with age and care,</a>

<a id='line_15165'>Ill-used by all! to every wrong resigned,</a>

<a id='line_15167'>But when, arising in his wrath to obey</a>
<a id='line_15168'>The will of Jove, he gave the vengeance way:</a>
<a id='line_15169'>The scattered arms that hung around the dome</a>
<a id='line_15170'>Careful he treasured in a private room;</a>
<a id='line_15171'>Then to her suitors bade his queen propose</a>

<a id='line_15179'>Fierce on the threshold then in arms he stood;</a>
<a id='line_15180'>Poured forth the darts that thirsted for our blood,</a>

<a id='line_15215'>The ground himself had purchased with his pain,</a>

<a id='line_15218'>With useful buildings round the lowly court;</a>
<a id='line_15219'>Where the few servants that divide his care</a>

<a id='line_15223'></a>
<a id='line_15224'>Here now arriving, to his rustic band</a>
<a id='line_15225'>And martial son, Ulysses gave command:</a>

<a id='line_15233'>Then to his train he gives his spear and shield;</a>

<a id='line_15235'>Through rows of shade, with various fruitage crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_15236'>And labour'd scenes of richest verdure round.</a>
<a id='line_15237'>Nor aged Dolius; nor his sons, were there,</a>
<a id='line_15238'>Nor servants, absent on another care;</a>
<a id='line_15239'>To search the woods for sets of flowery thorn,</a>
<a id='line_15240'>Their orchard bounds to strengthen and adorn.</a>
<a id='line_15241'></a>
<a id='line_15242'>But all alone the hoary king he found;</a>

<a id='line_15248'>In this array the kingly gardener stood,</a>
<a id='line_15249'>And clear'd a plant, encumber'd with its wood.</a>
<a id='line_15250'></a>
<a id='line_15251'>Beneath a neighbouring tree, the chief divine</a>

<a id='line_15254'>With age, yet still majestic in decay!</a>
<a id='line_15255'>Sudden his eyes released their watery store;</a>
<a id='line_15256'>The much-enduring man could bear no more.</a>

<a id='line_15258'>His aged limbs, to kiss his reverend face,</a>
<a id='line_15259'>With eager transport to disclose the whole,</a>
<a id='line_15260'>And pour at once the torrent of his soul.--</a>
<a id='line_15261'>Not so: his judgment takes the winding way</a>
<a id='line_15262'>Of question distant, and of soft essay;</a>
<a id='line_15263'>More gentle methods on weak age employs:</a>
<a id='line_15264'>And moves the sorrows to enhance the joys.</a>
<a id='line_15265'>Then, to his sire with beating heart he moves,</a>
<a id='line_15266'>And with a tender pleasantry reproves;</a>
<a id='line_15267'>Who digging round the plant still hangs his bead,</a>
<a id='line_15268'>Nor aught remits the work, while thus he said:</a>
<a id='line_15269'></a>
<a id='line_15270'>"Great is thy skill, O father! great thy toil,</a>
<a id='line_15271'>Thy careful hand is stamp'd on all the soil,</a>
<a id='line_15272'>Thy squadron'd vineyards well thy art declare,</a>
<a id='line_15273'>The olive green, blue fig, and pendent pear;</a>
<a id='line_15274'>And not one empty spot escapes thy care.</a>
<a id='line_15275'>On every plant and tree thy cares are shown,</a>
<a id='line_15276'>Nothing neglected, but thyself alone.</a>
<a id='line_15277'>Forgive me, father, if this fault I blame;</a>
<a id='line_15278'>Age so advanced, may some indulgence claim.</a>
<a id='line_15279'>Not for thy sloth, I deem thy lord unkind:</a>
<a id='line_15280'>Nor speaks thy form a mean or servile mind;</a>
<a id='line_15281'>I read a monarch in that princely air,</a>
<a id='line_15282'>The same thy aspect, if the same thy care;</a>
<a id='line_15283'>Soft sleep, fair garments, and the joys of wine,</a>
<a id='line_15284'>These are the rights of age, and should be thine.</a>
<a id='line_15285'>Who then thy master, say? and whose the land</a>
<a id='line_15286'>So dress'd and managed by thy skilful hand?</a>
<a id='line_15287'>But chief, oh tell me! (what I question most)</a>
<a id='line_15288'>Is this the far-famed Ithacensian coast?</a>
<a id='line_15289'>For so reported the first man I view'd</a>
<a id='line_15290'>(Some surly islander, of manners rude),</a>
<a id='line_15291'>Nor farther conference vouchsafed to stay;</a>
<a id='line_15292'>Heedless he whistled, and pursued his way.</a>
<a id='line_15293'>But thou whom years have taught to understand,</a>
<a id='line_15294'>Humanely hear, and answer my demand:</a>
<a id='line_15295'>A friend I seek, a wise one and a brave:</a>
<a id='line_15296'>Say, lives he yet, or moulders in the grave?</a>
<a id='line_15297'>Time was (my fortunes then were at the best)</a>
<a id='line_15298'>When at my house I lodged this foreign guest;</a>
<a id='line_15299'>He said, from Ithaca's fair isle he came,</a>
<a id='line_15300'>And old Laertes was his father's name.</a>
<a id='line_15301'>To him, whatever to a guest is owed</a>
<a id='line_15302'>I paid, and hospitable gifts bestow'd:</a>
<a id='line_15303'>To him seven talents of pure ore I told,</a>
<a id='line_15304'>Twelve cloaks, twelve vests, twelve tunics stiff with gold:</a>
<a id='line_15305'>A bowl, that rich with polish'd silver flames,</a>
<a id='line_15306'>And skill'd in female works, four lovely dames."</a>
<a id='line_15307'></a>
<a id='line_15308'>At this the father, with a father's fears</a>
<a id='line_15309'>(His venerable eyes bedimm'd with tears):</a>
<a id='line_15310'>"This is the land; but ah! thy gifts are lost,</a>
<a id='line_15311'>For godless men, and rude possess the coast:</a>
<a id='line_15312'>Sunk is the glory of this once-famed shore!</a>
<a id='line_15313'>Thy ancient friend, O stranger, is no more!</a>
<a id='line_15314'>Full recompense thy bounty else had borne:</a>
<a id='line_15315'>For every good man yields a just return:</a>
<a id='line_15316'>So civil rights demand; and who begins</a>
<a id='line_15317'>The track of friendship, not pursuing, sins.</a>
<a id='line_15318'>But tell me, stranger, be the truth confess'd,</a>
<a id='line_15319'>What years have circled since thou saw'st that guest?</a>
<a id='line_15320'>That hapless guest, alas! for ever gone!</a>
<a id='line_15321'>Wretch that he was! and that I am! my son!</a>
<a id='line_15322'>If ever man to misery was born,</a>
<a id='line_15323'>'Twas his to suffer, and 'tis mine to mourn!</a>
<a id='line_15324'>Far from his friends, and from his native reign,</a>
<a id='line_15325'>He lies a prey to monsters of the main;</a>
<a id='line_15326'>Or savage beasts his mangled relics tear,</a>
<a id='line_15327'>Or screaming vultures scatter through the air:</a>
<a id='line_15328'>Nor could his mother funeral unguents shed;</a>
<a id='line_15329'>Nor wail'd his father o'er the untimely dead:</a>
<a id='line_15330'>Nor his sad consort, on the mournful bier,</a>
<a id='line_15331'>Seal'd his cold eyes, or dropp'd a tender tear!</a>
<a id='line_15332'></a>
<a id='line_15333'>"But, tell me who thou art? and what thy race?</a>
<a id='line_15334'>Thy town, thy parents, and thy native place?</a>
<a id='line_15335'>Or, if a merchant in pursuit of gain,</a>
<a id='line_15336'>What port received thy vessel from the main?</a>
<a id='line_15337'>Or comest thou single, or attend thy train?"</a>
<a id='line_15338'></a>
<a id='line_15339'>Then thus the son: "From Alybas I came,</a>
<a id='line_15340'>My palace there; Eperitus my name</a>
<a id='line_15341'>Not vulgar born: from Aphidas, the king</a>
<a id='line_15342'>Of Polyphemon's royal line, I spring.</a>
<a id='line_15343'>Some adverse demon from Sicania bore</a>
<a id='line_15344'>Our wandering course, and drove us on your shore;</a>
<a id='line_15345'>Far from the town, an unfrequented bay</a>
<a id='line_15346'>Relieved our wearied vessel from the sea.</a>
<a id='line_15347'>Five years have circled since these eyes pursued</a>
<a id='line_15348'>Ulysses parting through the sable flood:</a>
<a id='line_15349'>Prosperous he sail'd, with dexter auguries,</a>
<a id='line_15350'>And all the wing'd good omens of the skies.</a>
<a id='line_15351'>Well hoped we then to meet on this fair shore,</a>
<a id='line_15352'>Whom Heaven, alas! decreed to meet no more."</a>
<a id='line_15353'></a>
<a id='line_15354'>Quick through the father's heart these accents ran;</a>
<a id='line_15355'>Grief seized at once, and wrapp'd up all the man:</a>
<a id='line_15356'>Deep from his soul lie sigh'd, and sorrowing spread</a>
<a id='line_15357'>A cloud of ashes on his hoary head.</a>
<a id='line_15358'>Trembling with agonies of strong delight</a>
<a id='line_15359'>Stood the great son, heart-wounded with the sight:</a>
<a id='line_15360'>He ran, he seized him with a strict embrace,</a>
<a id='line_15361'>With thousand kisses wander'd o'er his face:</a>
<a id='line_15362'>"I, I am he; O father, rise! behold</a>
<a id='line_15363'>Thy son, with twenty winters now grown old;</a>
<a id='line_15364'>Thy son, so long desired, so long detain'd,</a>
<a id='line_15365'>Restored, and breathing in his native land:</a>
<a id='line_15366'>These floods of sorrow, O my sire, restrain!</a>
<a id='line_15367'>The vengeance is complete; the suitor train,</a>
<a id='line_15368'>Stretch'd in our palace, by these hands lie slain."</a>
<a id='line_15369'></a>
<a id='line_15370'>Amazed, Laertes: "Give some certain sign</a>
<a id='line_15371'>(If such thou art) to manifest thee mine."</a>
<a id='line_15372'></a>
<a id='line_15373'>"Lo here the wound (he cries) received of yore,</a>
<a id='line_15374'>The scar indented by the tusky boar,</a>
<a id='line_15375'>When, by thyself, and by Anticlea sent,</a>
<a id='line_15376'>To old Autolycus' realms I went.</a>
<a id='line_15377'>Yet by another sign thy offspring know;</a>
<a id='line_15378'>The several trees you gave me long ago,</a>
<a id='line_15379'>While yet a child, these fields I loved to trace,</a>
<a id='line_15380'>And trod thy footsteps with unequal pace;</a>
<a id='line_15381'>To every plant in order as we came,</a>
<a id='line_15382'>Well-pleased, you told its nature and its name,</a>
<a id='line_15383'>Whate'er my childish fancy ask'd, bestow'd:</a>
<a id='line_15384'>Twelve pear-trees, bowing with their pendent load,</a>
<a id='line_15385'>And ten, that red with blushing apples glow'd;</a>
<a id='line_15386'>Full fifty purple figs; and many a row</a>
<a id='line_15387'>Of various vines that then began to blow,</a>
<a id='line_15388'>A future vintage! when the Hours produce</a>
<a id='line_15389'>Their latent buds, and Sol exalts the juice."</a>
<a id='line_15390'></a>
<a id='line_15391'>Smit with the signs which all his doubts explain,</a>
<a id='line_15392'>His heart within him melt; his knees sustain</a>
<a id='line_15393'>Their feeble weight no more: his arms alone</a>
<a id='line_15394'>Support him, round the loved Ulysses thrown;</a>
<a id='line_15395'>He faints, he sinks, with mighty joys oppress'd:</a>
<a id='line_15396'>Ulysses clasps him to his eager breast.</a>
<a id='line_15397'>Soon as returning life regains its seat,</a>
<a id='line_15398'>And his breath lengthens, and his pulses beat:</a>
<a id='line_15399'>"Yes, I believe (he cries) almighty Jove!</a>
<a id='line_15400'>Heaven rules us yet, and gods there are above.</a>
<a id='line_15401'>'Tis so--the suitors for their wrongs have paid--</a>
<a id='line_15402'>But what shall guard us, if the town invade?</a>
<a id='line_15403'>If, while the news through every city flies,</a>
<a id='line_15404'>All Ithaca and Cephalenia rise?"</a>
<a id='line_15405'>To this Ulysses: "As the gods shall please</a>
<a id='line_15406'>Be all the rest: and set thy soul at ease.</a>
<a id='line_15407'>Haste to the cottage by this orchard's side,</a>
<a id='line_15408'>And take the banquet which our cares provide;</a>
<a id='line_15409'>There wait thy faithful band of rural friends,</a>
<a id='line_15410'>And there the young Telemachus attends."</a>
<a id='line_15411'></a>
<a id='line_15412'>Thus, having said, they traced the garden o'er</a>
<a id='line_15413'>And stooping entered at the lowly door.</a>
<a id='line_15414'>The swains and young Telemachus they found.</a>
<a id='line_15415'>The victim portion'd and the goblet crown'd.</a>
<a id='line_15416'>The hoary king, his old Sicilian maid</a>
<a id='line_15417'>Perfum'd and wash'd, and gorgeously arrayed.</a>
<a id='line_15418'>Pallas attending gives his frame to shine</a>
<a id='line_15419'>With awful port, and majesty divine;</a>
<a id='line_15420'>His gazing son admires the godlike grace,</a>
<a id='line_15421'>And air celestial dawning o'er his face.</a>
<a id='line_15422'>"What god (he cried) my father's form improves!</a>
<a id='line_15423'>How high he treads and how enlarged he moves!"</a>
<a id='line_15424'></a>
<a id='line_15425'>"Oh! would to all the deathless powers on high,</a>
<a id='line_15426'>Pallas and Jove, and him who gilds the sky!</a>
<a id='line_15427'>(Replied the king elated with his praise)</a>
<a id='line_15428'>My strength were still, as once in better days:</a>
<a id='line_15429'>When the bold Cephalens the leaguer form'd.</a>
<a id='line_15430'>And proud Nericus trembled as I storm'd.</a>
<a id='line_15431'>Such were I now, not absent from your deed</a>
<a id='line_15432'>When the last sun beheld the suitors bleed,</a>
<a id='line_15433'>This arm had aided yours, this hand bestrown</a>
<a id='line_15434'>Our shores with death, and push'd the slaughter on;</a>
<a id='line_15435'>Nor had the sire been separate from the son."</a>
<a id='line_15436'></a>
<a id='line_15437'>They communed thus; while homeward bent their way</a>
<a id='line_15438'>The swains, fatigued with labours of the day:</a>
<a id='line_15439'>Dolius, the first, the venerable man;</a>
<a id='line_15440'>And next his sons, a long succeeding train.</a>
<a id='line_15441'>For due refection to the bower they came,</a>
<a id='line_15442'>Call'd by the careful old Sicilian dame,</a>
<a id='line_15443'>Who nursed the children, and now tends the sire,</a>
<a id='line_15444'>They see their lord, they gaze, and they admire.</a>
<a id='line_15445'>On chairs and beds in order seated round,</a>
<a id='line_15446'>They share the gladsome board; the roofs resound,</a>
<a id='line_15447'>While thus Ulysses to his ancient friend:</a>
<a id='line_15448'>"Forbear your wonder, and the feast attend:</a>
<a id='line_15449'>The rites have waited long." The chief commands</a>
<a id='line_15450'>Their love in vain; old Dolius spreads his hands,</a>
<a id='line_15451'>Springs to his master with a warm embrace,</a>
<a id='line_15452'>And fastens kisses on his hands and face;</a>
<a id='line_15453'>Then thus broke out: "O long, O daily mourn'd!</a>
<a id='line_15454'>Beyond our hopes, and to our wish return'd!</a>
<a id='line_15455'>Conducted sure by Heaven! for Heaven alone</a>
<a id='line_15456'>Could work this wonder: welcome to thy own!</a>
<a id='line_15457'>And joys and happiness attend thy throne!</a>
<a id='line_15458'>Who knows thy bless'd, thy wish'd return? oh say,</a>
<a id='line_15459'>To the chaste queen shall we the news convey?</a>
<a id='line_15460'>Or hears she, and with blessings loads the day?"</a>
<a id='line_15461'></a>
<a id='line_15462'>"Dismiss that care, for to the royal bride</a>
<a id='line_15463'>Already is it known" (the king replied,</a>
<a id='line_15464'>And straight resumed his seat); while round him bows</a>
<a id='line_15465'>Each faithful youth, and breathes out ardent vows:</a>
<a id='line_15466'>Then all beneath their father take their place,</a>
<a id='line_15467'>Rank'd by their ages, and the banquet grace.</a>
<a id='line_15468'></a>
<a id='line_15469'>Now flying Fame the swift report had spread</a>
<a id='line_15470'>Through all the city, of the suitors dead,</a>
<a id='line_15471'>In throngs they rise, and to the palace crowd;</a>
<a id='line_15472'>Their sighs were many and the tumult loud.</a>
<a id='line_15473'>Weeping they bear the mangled heaps of slain;</a>
<a id='line_15474'>Inhume the natives in their native plain,</a>
<a id='line_15475'>The rest in ships are wafted o'er the main.</a>
<a id='line_15476'>Then sad in council all the seniors sate,</a>
<a id='line_15477'>Frequent and full, assembled to debate:</a>
<a id='line_15478'>Amid the circle first Eupithes rose,</a>
<a id='line_15479'>Big was his eye with tears, his heart with woes:</a>
<a id='line_15480'>The bold Antinous was his age's pride,</a>
<a id='line_15481'>The first who by Ulysses' arrow died.</a>
<a id='line_15482'>Down his wan cheek the trickling torrent ran,</a>
<a id='line_15483'>As mixing words with sighs he thus began:</a>
<a id='line_15484'></a>
<a id='line_15485'>"Great deeds, O friends! this wondrous man has wrought,</a>
<a id='line_15486'>And mighty blessings to his country brought!</a>
<a id='line_15487'>With ships he parted, and a numerous train,</a>
<a id='line_15488'>Those, and their ships, he buried in the main.</a>
<a id='line_15489'>Now he returns, and first essays his hand</a>
<a id='line_15490'>In the best blood of all his native land.</a>
<a id='line_15491'>Haste, then, and ere to neighbouring Pyle he flies,</a>
<a id='line_15492'>Or sacred Elis, to procure supplies;</a>
<a id='line_15493'>Arise (or ye for ever fall), arise!</a>
<a id='line_15494'>Shame to this age, and all that shall succeed!</a>
<a id='line_15495'>If unrevenged your sons and brothers bleed.</a>
<a id='line_15496'>Prove that we live, by vengeance on his head,</a>
<a id='line_15497'>Or sink at once forgotten with the dead."</a>
<a id='line_15498'>Here ceased he, but indignant tears let fall</a>
<a id='line_15499'>Spoke when he ceased: dumb sorrow touch'd them all.</a>
<a id='line_15500'>When from the palace to the wondering throng</a>
<a id='line_15501'>Sage Medon came, and Phemius came along</a>
<a id='line_15502'>(Restless and early sleep's soft bands they broke);</a>
<a id='line_15503'>And Medon first the assembled chiefs bespoke;</a>
<a id='line_15504'></a>
<a id='line_15505'>"Hear me, ye peers and elders of the land,</a>
<a id='line_15506'>Who deem this act the work of mortal hand;</a>
<a id='line_15507'>As o'er the heaps of death Ulysses strode,</a>
<a id='line_15508'>These eyes, these eyes beheld a present god,</a>
<a id='line_15509'>Who now before him, now beside him stood,</a>
<a id='line_15510'>Fought as he fought, and mark'd his way with blood:</a>
<a id='line_15511'>In vain old Mentor's form the god belied;</a>
<a id='line_15512'>'Twas Heaven that struck, and Heaven was on his side."</a>
<a id='line_15513'></a>
<a id='line_15514'>A sudden horror all the assembly shook,</a>
<a id='line_15515'>When slowly rising, Halitherses spoke</a>
<a id='line_15516'>(Reverend and wise, whose comprehensive view</a>
<a id='line_15517'>At once the present and the future knew):</a>
<a id='line_15518'>"Me too, ye fathers, hear! from you proceed</a>
<a id='line_15519'>The ills ye mourn; your own the guilty deed.</a>
<a id='line_15520'>Ye gave your sons, your lawless sons, the rein</a>
<a id='line_15521'>(Oft warn'd by Mentor and myself in vain);</a>
<a id='line_15522'>An absent hero's bed they sought to soil,</a>
<a id='line_15523'>An absent hero's wealth they made their spoil;</a>
<a id='line_15524'>Immoderate riot, and intemperate lust!</a>
<a id='line_15525'>The offence was great, the punishment was just.</a>
<a id='line_15526'>Weigh then my counsels in an equal scale,</a>
<a id='line_15527'>Nor rush to ruin. Justice will prevail."</a>
<a id='line_15528'></a>
<a id='line_15529'>His moderate words some better minds persuade:</a>
<a id='line_15530'>They part, and join him: but the number stay'd.</a>
<a id='line_15531'>They storm, they shout, with hasty frenzy fired,</a>
<a id='line_15532'>And second all Eupithes' rage inspired.</a>
<a id='line_15533'>They case their limbs in brass; to arms they run;</a>
<a id='line_15534'>The broad effulgence blazes in the sun.</a>
<a id='line_15535'>Before the city, and in ample plain,</a>
<a id='line_15536'>They meet: Eupithes heads the frantic train.</a>
<a id='line_15537'>Fierce for his son, he breathes his threats in air;</a>
<a id='line_15538'>Fate bears them not, and Death attends him there.</a>
<a id='line_15539'></a>
<a id='line_15540'>This pass'd on earth, while in the realms above</a>

<a id='line_15545'>Or peaceful amity or stern debate?</a>
<a id='line_15546'>Declare thy purpose, for thy will is fate."</a>
<a id='line_15547'></a>
<a id='line_15548'>"Is not thy thought my own? (the god replies</a>

<a id='line_15551'>The chief's return should make the guilty bleed.</a>
<a id='line_15552'>'Tis done, and at thy will the Fates succeed.</a>
<a id='line_15553'>Yet hear the issue: Since Ulysses' hand</a>

<a id='line_15566'>Now sat Ulysses at the rural feast</a>
<a id='line_15567'>The rage of hunger and of thirst repress'd:</a>
<a id='line_15568'>To watch the foe a trusty spy he sent:</a>
<a id='line_15569'>A son of Dolius on the message went,</a>
<a id='line_15570'>Stood in the way, and at a glance beheld</a>
<a id='line_15571'>The foe approach, embattled on the field.</a>
<a id='line_15572'>With backward step he hastens to the bower,</a>
<a id='line_15573'>And tells the news. They arm with all their power.</a>
<a id='line_15574'>Four friends alone Ulysses' cause embrace,</a>
<a id='line_15575'>And six were all the sons of Dolius' race:</a>
<a id='line_15576'>Old Dolius too his rusted arms put on;</a>
<a id='line_15577'>And, still more old, in arms Laertes shone.</a>
<a id='line_15578'>Trembling with warmth, the hoary heroes stand,</a>
<a id='line_15579'>And brazen panoply invests the band.</a>
<a id='line_15580'>The opening gates at once their war display:</a>
<a id='line_15581'>Fierce they rush forth: Ulysses leads the way.</a>
<a id='line_15582'>That moment joins them with celestial aid,</a>
<a id='line_15583'>In Mentor's form, the Jove-descended maid:</a>
<a id='line_15584'>The suffering hero felt his patient breast</a>
<a id='line_15585'>Swell with new joy, and thus his son address'd:</a>
<a id='line_15586'></a>
<a id='line_15587'>"Behold, Telemachus! (nor fear the sight,)</a>
<a id='line_15588'>The brave embattled, the grim front of fight!</a>
<a id='line_15589'>The valiant with the valiant must contend.</a>
<a id='line_15590'>Shame not the line whence glorious you descend.</a>
<a id='line_15591'>Wide o'er the world their martial fame was spread;</a>
<a id='line_15592'>Regard thyself, the living and the dead."</a>
<a id='line_15593'></a>
<a id='line_15594'>"Thy eyes, great father! on this battle cast,</a>
<a id='line_15595'>Shall learn from me Penelope was chaste."</a>
<a id='line_15596'></a>
<a id='line_15597'>So spoke Telemachus: the gallant boy</a>
<a id='line_15598'>Good old Laertes heard with panting joy.</a>
<a id='line_15599'>"And bless'd! thrice bless'd this happy day! (he cries,)</a>
<a id='line_15600'>The day that shows me, ere I close my eyes,</a>
<a id='line_15601'>A son and grandson of the Arcesian name</a>
<a id='line_15602'>Strive for fair virtue, and contest for fame!"</a>
<a id='line_15603'></a>
<a id='line_15604'>Then thus Minerva in Laertes' ear:</a>
<a id='line_15605'>"Son of Arcesius, reverend warrior, hear!</a>
<a id='line_15606'>Jove and Jove's daughter first implore in prayer,</a>
<a id='line_15607'>Then, whirling high, discharge thy lance in air."</a>
<a id='line_15608'>She said, infusing courage with the word.</a>
<a id='line_15609'>Jove and Jove's daughter then the chief implored,</a>
<a id='line_15610'>And, whirling high, dismiss'd the lance in air.</a>
<a id='line_15611'>Full at Eupithes drove the deathful spear:</a>
<a id='line_15612'>The brass-cheek'd helmet opens to the wound;</a>
<a id='line_15613'>He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound.</a>
<a id='line_15614'>Before the father and the conquering son</a>
<a id='line_15615'>Heaps rush on heaps, they fight, they drop, they run</a>
<a id='line_15616'>Now by the sword, and now the javelin, fall</a>
<a id='line_15617'>The rebel race, and death had swallow'd all;</a>
<a id='line_15618'>But from on high the blue-eyed virgin cried;</a>
<a id='line_15619'>Her awful voice detain'd the headlong tide:</a>
<a id='line_15620'>"Forbear, ye nations, your mad hands forbear</a>
<a id='line_15621'>From mutual slaughter; Peace descends to spare."</a>
<a id='line_15622'>Fear shook the nations: at the voice divine</a>
<a id='line_15623'>They drop their javelins, and their rage resign.</a>
<a id='line_15624'>All scatter'd round their glittering weapons lie;</a>
<a id='line_15625'>Some fall to earth, and some confusedly fly.</a>
<a id='line_15626'>With dreadful shouts Ulysses pour'd along,</a>
<a id='line_15627'>Swift as an eagle, as an eagle strong.</a>
<a id='line_15628'>But Jove's red arm the burning thunder aims:</a>
<a id='line_15629'>Before Minerva shot the livid flames;</a>
<a id='line_15630'>Blazing they fell, and at her feet expired;</a>
<a id='line_15631'>Then stopped the goddess, trembled and retired.</a>
<a id='line_15632'></a>
<a id='line_15633'>"Descended from the gods! Ulysses, cease;</a>
<a id='line_15634'>Offend not Jove: obey, and give the peace."</a>
<a id='line_15635'></a>
<a id='line_15636'>So Pallas spoke: the mandate from above</a>
<a id='line_15637'>The king obey'd. The virgin-seed of Jove,</a>
<a id='line_15638'>In Mentor's form, confirm'd the full accord,</a>
<a id='line_15639'>And willing nations knew their lawful lord.</a>
