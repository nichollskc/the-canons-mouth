                    <a id='line_0'>The Book of the Prophet Ezekiel</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month,</a>
<a id='line_4'>in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river</a>
<a id='line_5'>of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>1:2 In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king</a>
<a id='line_8'>Jehoiachin’s captivity, 1:3 The word of the LORD came expressly unto</a>
<a id='line_9'>Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by</a>
<a id='line_10'>the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.</a>
<a id='line_11'></a>
<a id='line_12'>1:4 And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a</a>
<a id='line_13'>great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about</a>
<a id='line_14'>it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the</a>
<a id='line_15'>midst of the fire.</a>
<a id='line_16'></a>
<a id='line_17'>1:5 Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living</a>
<a id='line_18'>creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a</a>
<a id='line_19'>man.</a>
<a id='line_20'></a>
<a id='line_21'>1:6 And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.</a>
<a id='line_22'></a>
<a id='line_23'>1:7 And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was</a>
<a id='line_24'>like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkled like the colour of</a>
<a id='line_25'>burnished brass.</a>
<a id='line_26'></a>
<a id='line_27'>1:8 And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four</a>
<a id='line_28'>sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>1:9 Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they</a>
<a id='line_31'>went; they went every one straight forward.</a>
<a id='line_32'></a>
<a id='line_33'>1:10 As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a</a>
<a id='line_34'>man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the</a>
<a id='line_35'>face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an</a>
<a id='line_36'>eagle.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>1:11 Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two</a>
<a id='line_39'>wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their</a>
<a id='line_40'>bodies.</a>
<a id='line_41'></a>
<a id='line_42'>1:12 And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was</a>
<a id='line_43'>to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.</a>
<a id='line_44'></a>
<a id='line_45'>1:13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was</a>
<a id='line_46'>like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went</a>
<a id='line_47'>up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and</a>
<a id='line_48'>out of the fire went forth lightning.</a>
<a id='line_49'></a>
<a id='line_50'>1:14 And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a</a>
<a id='line_51'>flash of lightning.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>1:15 Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the</a>
<a id='line_54'>earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.</a>
<a id='line_55'></a>
<a id='line_56'>1:16 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the</a>
<a id='line_57'>colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their</a>
<a id='line_58'>appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a</a>
<a id='line_59'>wheel.</a>
<a id='line_60'></a>
<a id='line_61'>1:17 When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned</a>
<a id='line_62'>not when they went.</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>1:18 As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful;</a>
<a id='line_65'>and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.</a>
<a id='line_66'></a>
<a id='line_67'>1:19 And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and</a>
<a id='line_68'>when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels</a>
<a id='line_69'>were lifted up.</a>
<a id='line_70'></a>
<a id='line_71'>1:20 Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their</a>
<a id='line_72'>spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the</a>
<a id='line_73'>spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</a>
<a id='line_74'></a>
<a id='line_75'>1:21 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood;</a>
<a id='line_76'>and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted</a>
<a id='line_77'>up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the</a>
<a id='line_78'>wheels.</a>
<a id='line_79'></a>
<a id='line_80'>1:22 And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living</a>
<a id='line_81'>creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth</a>
<a id='line_82'>over their heads above.</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>1:23 And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward</a>
<a id='line_85'>the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every</a>
<a id='line_86'>one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.</a>
<a id='line_87'></a>
<a id='line_88'>1:24 And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the</a>
<a id='line_89'>noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of</a>
<a id='line_90'>speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their</a>
<a id='line_91'>wings.</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>1:25 And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their</a>
<a id='line_94'>heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.</a>
<a id='line_95'></a>
<a id='line_96'>1:26 And above the firmament that was over their heads was the</a>
<a id='line_97'>likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon</a>
<a id='line_98'>the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man</a>
<a id='line_99'>above upon it.</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>1:27 And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round</a>
<a id='line_102'>about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and</a>
<a id='line_103'>from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the</a>
<a id='line_104'>appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>1:28 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of</a>
<a id='line_107'>rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was</a>
<a id='line_108'>the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I</a>
<a id='line_109'>saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.</a>
<a id='line_110'></a>
<a id='line_111'>2:1 And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will</a>
<a id='line_112'>speak unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_113'></a>
<a id='line_114'>2:2 And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me</a>
<a id='line_115'>upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.</a>
<a id='line_116'></a>
<a id='line_117'>2:3 And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of</a>
<a id='line_118'>Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and</a>
<a id='line_119'>their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.</a>
<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>2:4 For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee</a>
<a id='line_122'>unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_123'></a>
<a id='line_124'>2:5 And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear,</a>
<a id='line_125'>(for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been</a>
<a id='line_126'>a prophet among them.</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>2:6 And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of</a>
<a id='line_129'>their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost</a>
<a id='line_130'>dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed</a>
<a id='line_131'>at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</a>
<a id='line_132'></a>
<a id='line_133'>2:7 And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear,</a>
<a id='line_134'>or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>2:8 But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou</a>
<a id='line_137'>rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I</a>
<a id='line_138'>give thee.</a>
<a id='line_139'></a>
<a id='line_140'>2:9 And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a</a>
<a id='line_141'>roll of a book was therein; 2:10 And he spread it before me; and it</a>
<a id='line_142'>was written within and without: and there was written therein</a>
<a id='line_143'>lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</a>
<a id='line_144'></a>
<a id='line_145'>3:1 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat</a>
<a id='line_146'>this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>3:2 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</a>
<a id='line_149'></a>
<a id='line_150'>3:3 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill</a>
<a id='line_151'>thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it</a>
<a id='line_152'>was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>3:4 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of</a>
<a id='line_155'>Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>3:5 For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an</a>
<a id='line_158'>hard language, but to the house of Israel; 3:6 Not to many people of a</a>
<a id='line_159'>strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not</a>
<a id='line_160'>understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened</a>
<a id='line_161'>unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_162'></a>
<a id='line_163'>3:7 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will</a>
<a id='line_164'>not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and</a>
<a id='line_165'>hardhearted.</a>
<a id='line_166'></a>
<a id='line_167'>3:8 Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy</a>
<a id='line_168'>forehead strong against their foreheads.</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>3:9 As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear</a>
<a id='line_171'>them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a</a>
<a id='line_172'>rebellious house.</a>
<a id='line_173'></a>
<a id='line_174'>3:10 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall</a>
<a id='line_175'>speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>3:11 And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of</a>
<a id='line_178'>thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord</a>
<a id='line_179'>GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>3:12 Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a</a>
<a id='line_182'>great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his</a>
<a id='line_183'>place.</a>
<a id='line_184'></a>
<a id='line_185'>3:13 I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that</a>
<a id='line_186'>touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them,</a>
<a id='line_187'>and a noise of a great rushing.</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>3:14 So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in</a>
<a id='line_190'>bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was</a>
<a id='line_191'>strong upon me.</a>
<a id='line_192'></a>
<a id='line_193'>3:15 Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by</a>
<a id='line_194'>the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there</a>
<a id='line_195'>astonished among them seven days.</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>3:16 And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of</a>
<a id='line_198'>the LORD came unto me, saying, 3:17 Son of man, I have made thee a</a>
<a id='line_199'>watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my</a>
<a id='line_200'>mouth, and give them warning from me.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>3:18 When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou</a>
<a id='line_203'>givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his</a>
<a id='line_204'>wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his</a>
<a id='line_205'>iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_206'></a>
<a id='line_207'>3:19 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness,</a>
<a id='line_208'>nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast</a>
<a id='line_209'>delivered thy soul.</a>
<a id='line_210'></a>
<a id='line_211'>3:20 Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and</a>
<a id='line_212'>commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die:</a>
<a id='line_213'>because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and</a>
<a id='line_214'>his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his</a>
<a id='line_215'>blood will I require at thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>3:21 Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous</a>
<a id='line_218'>sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is</a>
<a id='line_219'>warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.</a>
<a id='line_220'></a>
<a id='line_221'>3:22 And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me,</a>
<a id='line_222'>Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>3:23 Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the</a>
<a id='line_225'>glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river</a>
<a id='line_226'>of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>3:24 Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and</a>
<a id='line_229'>spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>3:25 But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee,</a>
<a id='line_232'>and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</a>
<a id='line_233'>3:26 And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that</a>
<a id='line_234'>thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are</a>
<a id='line_235'>a rebellious house.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>3:27 But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_238'>say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear;</a>
<a id='line_239'>and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious</a>
<a id='line_240'>house.</a>
<a id='line_241'></a>
<a id='line_242'>4:1 Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee,</a>
<a id='line_243'>and pourtray upon it the city, even Jerusalem: 4:2 And lay siege</a>
<a id='line_244'>against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it;</a>
<a id='line_245'>set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round</a>
<a id='line_246'>about.</a>
<a id='line_247'></a>
<a id='line_248'>4:3 Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of</a>
<a id='line_249'>iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it</a>
<a id='line_250'>shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be</a>
<a id='line_251'>a sign to the house of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_252'></a>
<a id='line_253'>4:4 Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the</a>
<a id='line_254'>house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou</a>
<a id='line_255'>shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_256'></a>
<a id='line_257'>4:5 For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according</a>
<a id='line_258'>to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt</a>
<a id='line_259'>thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_260'></a>
<a id='line_261'>4:6 And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side,</a>
<a id='line_262'>and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I</a>
<a id='line_263'>have appointed thee each day for a year.</a>
<a id='line_264'></a>
<a id='line_265'>4:7 Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_266'>and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>4:8 And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn</a>
<a id='line_269'>thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy</a>
<a id='line_270'>siege.</a>
<a id='line_271'></a>
<a id='line_272'>4:9 Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and</a>
<a id='line_273'>lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and</a>
<a id='line_274'>make thee bread thereof, according to the number of the days that thou</a>
<a id='line_275'>shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat</a>
<a id='line_276'>thereof.</a>
<a id='line_277'></a>
<a id='line_278'>4:10 And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty</a>
<a id='line_279'>shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>4:11 Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin:</a>
<a id='line_282'>from time to time shalt thou drink.</a>
<a id='line_283'></a>
<a id='line_284'>4:12 And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it</a>
<a id='line_285'>with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.</a>
<a id='line_286'></a>
<a id='line_287'>4:13 And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat</a>
<a id='line_288'>their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.</a>
<a id='line_289'></a>
<a id='line_290'>4:14 Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted:</a>
<a id='line_291'>for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which</a>
<a id='line_292'>dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable</a>
<a id='line_293'>flesh into my mouth.</a>
<a id='line_294'></a>
<a id='line_295'>4:15 Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s</a>
<a id='line_296'>dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.</a>
<a id='line_297'></a>
<a id='line_298'>4:16 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the</a>
<a id='line_299'>staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and</a>
<a id='line_300'>with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with</a>
<a id='line_301'>astonishment: 4:17 That they may want bread and water, and be astonied</a>
<a id='line_302'>one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_303'></a>
<a id='line_304'>5:1 And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a</a>
<a id='line_305'>barber’s razor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy</a>
<a id='line_306'>beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair.</a>
<a id='line_307'></a>
<a id='line_308'>5:2 Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city,</a>
<a id='line_309'>when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third</a>
<a id='line_310'>part, and smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_311'>scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.</a>
<a id='line_312'></a>
<a id='line_313'>5:3 Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy</a>
<a id='line_314'>skirts.</a>
<a id='line_315'></a>
<a id='line_316'>5:4 Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire,</a>
<a id='line_317'>and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into</a>
<a id='line_318'>all the house of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_319'></a>
<a id='line_320'>5:5 Thus saith the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the</a>
<a id='line_321'>midst of the nations and countries that are round about her.</a>
<a id='line_322'></a>
<a id='line_323'>5:6 And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the</a>
<a id='line_324'>nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about</a>
<a id='line_325'>her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not</a>
<a id='line_326'>walked in them.</a>
<a id='line_327'></a>
<a id='line_328'>5:7 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than</a>
<a id='line_329'>the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my</a>
<a id='line_330'>statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according</a>
<a id='line_331'>to the judgments of the nations that are round about you; 5:8</a>
<a id='line_332'>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against thee,</a>
<a id='line_333'>and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the</a>
<a id='line_334'>nations.</a>
<a id='line_335'></a>
<a id='line_336'>5:9 And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I</a>
<a id='line_337'>will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.</a>
<a id='line_338'></a>
<a id='line_339'>5:10 Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee,</a>
<a id='line_340'>and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in</a>
<a id='line_341'>thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.</a>
<a id='line_342'></a>
<a id='line_343'>5:11 Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou</a>
<a id='line_344'>hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all</a>
<a id='line_345'>thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall</a>
<a id='line_346'>mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity.</a>
<a id='line_347'></a>
<a id='line_348'>5:12 A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with</a>
<a id='line_349'>famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part</a>
<a id='line_350'>shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third</a>
<a id='line_351'>part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.</a>
<a id='line_352'></a>
<a id='line_353'>5:13 Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury</a>
<a id='line_354'>to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I</a>
<a id='line_355'>the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury</a>
<a id='line_356'>in them.</a>
<a id='line_357'></a>
<a id='line_358'>5:14 Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations</a>
<a id='line_359'>that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.</a>
<a id='line_360'></a>
<a id='line_361'>5:15 So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an</a>
<a id='line_362'>astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall</a>
<a id='line_363'>execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes.</a>
<a id='line_364'>I the LORD have spoken it.</a>
<a id='line_365'></a>
<a id='line_366'>5:16 When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which</a>
<a id='line_367'>shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you:</a>
<a id='line_368'>and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of</a>
<a id='line_369'>bread: 5:17 So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they</a>
<a id='line_370'>shall bereave thee: and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee;</a>
<a id='line_371'>and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken it.</a>
<a id='line_372'></a>
<a id='line_373'>6:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 6:2 Son of man, set</a>
<a id='line_374'>thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,</a>
<a id='line_375'>6:3 And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD;</a>
<a id='line_376'>Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the</a>
<a id='line_377'>rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon</a>
<a id='line_378'>you, and I will destroy your high places.</a>
<a id='line_379'></a>
<a id='line_380'>6:4 And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be</a>
<a id='line_381'>broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.</a>
<a id='line_382'></a>
<a id='line_383'>6:5 And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before</a>
<a id='line_384'>their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.</a>
<a id='line_385'></a>
<a id='line_386'>6:6 In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the</a>
<a id='line_387'>high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and</a>
<a id='line_388'>made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images</a>
<a id='line_389'>may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.</a>
<a id='line_390'></a>
<a id='line_391'>6:7 And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know</a>
<a id='line_392'>that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_393'></a>
<a id='line_394'>6:8 Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall</a>
<a id='line_395'>escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through</a>
<a id='line_396'>the countries.</a>
<a id='line_397'></a>
<a id='line_398'>6:9 And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations</a>
<a id='line_399'>whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their</a>
<a id='line_400'>whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which</a>
<a id='line_401'>go a whoring after their idols: and they shall lothe themselves for</a>
<a id='line_402'>the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.</a>
<a id='line_403'></a>
<a id='line_404'>6:10 And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said</a>
<a id='line_405'>in vain that I would do this evil unto them.</a>
<a id='line_406'></a>
<a id='line_407'>6:11 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with</a>
<a id='line_408'>thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of</a>
<a id='line_409'>Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the</a>
<a id='line_410'>pestilence.</a>
<a id='line_411'></a>
<a id='line_412'>6:12 He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is</a>
<a id='line_413'>near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged</a>
<a id='line_414'>shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.</a>
<a id='line_415'></a>
<a id='line_416'>6:13 Then shall ye know that I am the LORD, when their slain men shall</a>

<a id='line_418'>in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and</a>
<a id='line_419'>under every thick oak, the place where they did offer sweet savour to</a>
<a id='line_420'>all their idols.</a>
<a id='line_421'></a>
<a id='line_422'>6:14 So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land</a>
<a id='line_423'>desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in</a>

<a id='line_425'></a>
<a id='line_426'>7:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 7:2 Also, thou</a>
<a id='line_427'>son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end,</a>
<a id='line_428'>the end is come upon the four corners of the land.</a>
<a id='line_429'></a>
<a id='line_430'>7:3 Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon</a>
<a id='line_431'>thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense</a>
<a id='line_432'>upon thee all thine abominations.</a>
<a id='line_433'></a>
<a id='line_434'>7:4 And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I</a>
<a id='line_435'>will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in</a>
<a id='line_436'>the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_437'></a>
<a id='line_438'>7:5 Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.</a>
<a id='line_439'></a>
<a id='line_440'>7:6 An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it</a>

<a id='line_442'></a>
<a id='line_443'>7:7 The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land:</a>
<a id='line_444'>the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding</a>
<a id='line_445'>again of the mountains.</a>
<a id='line_446'></a>
<a id='line_447'>7:8 Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine</a>
<a id='line_448'>anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will</a>
<a id='line_449'>recompense thee for all thine abominations.</a>
<a id='line_450'></a>
<a id='line_451'>7:9 And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will</a>
<a id='line_452'>recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are</a>
<a id='line_453'>in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that</a>
<a id='line_454'>smiteth.</a>
<a id='line_455'></a>
<a id='line_456'>7:10 Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth;</a>
<a id='line_457'>the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.</a>
<a id='line_458'></a>
<a id='line_459'>7:11 Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall</a>
<a id='line_460'>remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither shall</a>
<a id='line_461'>there be wailing for them.</a>
<a id='line_462'></a>
<a id='line_463'>7:12 The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer</a>
<a id='line_464'>rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude</a>
<a id='line_465'>thereof.</a>
<a id='line_466'></a>
<a id='line_467'>7:13 For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although</a>
<a id='line_468'>they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude</a>
<a id='line_469'>thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself</a>
<a id='line_470'>in the iniquity of his life.</a>
<a id='line_471'></a>
<a id='line_472'>7:14 They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none</a>
<a id='line_473'>goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.</a>
<a id='line_474'></a>
<a id='line_475'>7:15 The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within:</a>
<a id='line_476'>he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in</a>
<a id='line_477'>the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.</a>
<a id='line_478'></a>
<a id='line_479'>7:16 But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the</a>
<a id='line_480'>mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one</a>
<a id='line_481'>for his iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_482'></a>
<a id='line_483'>7:17 All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.</a>
<a id='line_484'></a>
<a id='line_485'>7:18 They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall</a>
<a id='line_486'>cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all</a>
<a id='line_487'>their heads.</a>
<a id='line_488'></a>
<a id='line_489'>7:19 They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall</a>
<a id='line_490'>be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver</a>
<a id='line_491'>them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their</a>
<a id='line_492'>souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of</a>
<a id='line_493'>their iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_494'></a>
<a id='line_495'>7:20 As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they</a>
<a id='line_496'>made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things</a>
<a id='line_497'>therein: therefore have I set it far from them.</a>
<a id='line_498'></a>
<a id='line_499'>7:21 And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey,</a>
<a id='line_500'>and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.</a>
<a id='line_501'></a>
<a id='line_502'>7:22 My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my</a>
<a id='line_503'>secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.</a>
<a id='line_504'></a>
<a id='line_505'>7:23 Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city</a>
<a id='line_506'>is full of violence.</a>
<a id='line_507'></a>
<a id='line_508'>7:24 Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall</a>
<a id='line_509'>possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to</a>
<a id='line_510'>cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.</a>
<a id='line_511'></a>
<a id='line_512'>7:25 Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be</a>
<a id='line_513'>none.</a>
<a id='line_514'></a>
<a id='line_515'>7:26 Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon</a>
<a id='line_516'>rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law</a>
<a id='line_517'>shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.</a>
<a id='line_518'></a>
<a id='line_519'>7:27 The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with</a>
<a id='line_520'>desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled:</a>
<a id='line_521'>I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts</a>
<a id='line_522'>will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_523'></a>
<a id='line_524'>8:1 And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the</a>
<a id='line_525'>fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of</a>
<a id='line_526'>Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.</a>
<a id='line_527'></a>
<a id='line_528'>8:2 Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from</a>
<a id='line_529'>the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins</a>
<a id='line_530'>even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.</a>
<a id='line_531'></a>
<a id='line_532'>8:3 And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of</a>
<a id='line_533'>mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the</a>
<a id='line_534'>heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door</a>
<a id='line_535'>of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of</a>
<a id='line_536'>the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.</a>
<a id='line_537'></a>
<a id='line_538'>8:4 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according</a>
<a id='line_539'>to the vision that I saw in the plain.</a>
<a id='line_540'></a>
<a id='line_541'>8:5 Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way</a>
<a id='line_542'>toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north,</a>
<a id='line_543'>and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy</a>
<a id='line_544'>in the entry.</a>
<a id='line_545'></a>
<a id='line_546'>8:6 He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do?</a>
<a id='line_547'>even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here,</a>
<a id='line_548'>that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again,</a>
<a id='line_549'>and thou shalt see greater abominations.</a>
<a id='line_550'></a>
<a id='line_551'>8:7 And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked,</a>
<a id='line_552'>behold a hole in the wall.</a>
<a id='line_553'></a>
<a id='line_554'>8:8 Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I</a>
<a id='line_555'>had digged in the wall, behold a door.</a>
<a id='line_556'></a>
<a id='line_557'>8:9 And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations</a>
<a id='line_558'>that they do here.</a>
<a id='line_559'></a>
<a id='line_560'>8:10 So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things,</a>
<a id='line_561'>and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_562'>pourtrayed upon the wall round about.</a>
<a id='line_563'></a>
<a id='line_564'>8:11 And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the</a>
<a id='line_565'>house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of</a>
<a id='line_566'>Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of</a>
<a id='line_567'>incense went up.</a>
<a id='line_568'></a>
<a id='line_569'>8:12 Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the</a>
<a id='line_570'>ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the</a>
<a id='line_571'>chambers of his imagery? for they say, the LORD seeth us not; the LORD</a>
<a id='line_572'>hath forsaken the earth.</a>
<a id='line_573'></a>
<a id='line_574'>8:13 He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see</a>
<a id='line_575'>greater abominations that they do.</a>
<a id='line_576'></a>
<a id='line_577'>8:14 Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD’s house</a>
<a id='line_578'>which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for</a>
<a id='line_579'>Tammuz.</a>
<a id='line_580'></a>
<a id='line_581'>8:15 Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn</a>
<a id='line_582'>thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these.</a>
<a id='line_583'></a>
<a id='line_584'>8:16 And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD’s house, and,</a>
<a id='line_585'>behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and</a>
<a id='line_586'>the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the</a>
<a id='line_587'>temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they</a>
<a id='line_588'>worshipped the sun toward the east.</a>
<a id='line_589'></a>
<a id='line_590'>8:17 Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a</a>
<a id='line_591'>light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations</a>
<a id='line_592'>which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence,</a>
<a id='line_593'>and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch</a>
<a id='line_594'>to their nose.</a>
<a id='line_595'></a>
<a id='line_596'>8:18 Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare,</a>
<a id='line_597'>neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud</a>
<a id='line_598'>voice, yet will I not hear them.</a>
<a id='line_599'></a>
<a id='line_600'>9:1 He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them</a>
<a id='line_601'>that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his</a>
<a id='line_602'>destroying weapon in his hand.</a>
<a id='line_603'></a>
<a id='line_604'>9:2 And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which</a>
<a id='line_605'>lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand;</a>
<a id='line_606'>and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer’s inkhorn</a>
<a id='line_607'>by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar.</a>
<a id='line_608'></a>
<a id='line_609'>9:3 And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub,</a>
<a id='line_610'>whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the</a>
<a id='line_611'>man clothed with linen, which had the writer’s inkhorn by his side;</a>
<a id='line_612'>9:4 And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city,</a>
<a id='line_613'>through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of</a>
<a id='line_614'>the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done</a>
<a id='line_615'>in the midst thereof.</a>
<a id='line_616'></a>
<a id='line_617'>9:5 And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through</a>
<a id='line_618'>the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: 9:6</a>
<a id='line_619'>Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and</a>
<a id='line_620'>women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at</a>
<a id='line_621'>my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the</a>
<a id='line_622'>house.</a>
<a id='line_623'></a>
<a id='line_624'>9:7 And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with</a>
<a id='line_625'>the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.</a>
<a id='line_626'></a>
<a id='line_627'>9:8 And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left,</a>
<a id='line_628'>that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou</a>
<a id='line_629'>destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon</a>
<a id='line_630'>Jerusalem?  9:9 Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of</a>
<a id='line_631'>Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood,</a>
<a id='line_632'>and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath</a>
<a id='line_633'>forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.</a>
<a id='line_634'></a>
<a id='line_635'>9:10 And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have</a>
<a id='line_636'>pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head.</a>
<a id='line_637'></a>
<a id='line_638'>9:11 And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by</a>
<a id='line_639'>his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast</a>
<a id='line_640'>commanded me.</a>
<a id='line_641'></a>
<a id='line_642'>10:1 Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the</a>
<a id='line_643'>head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire</a>
<a id='line_644'>stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.</a>
<a id='line_645'></a>
<a id='line_646'>10:2 And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in</a>
<a id='line_647'>between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with</a>
<a id='line_648'>coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the</a>
<a id='line_649'>city. And he went in in my sight.</a>
<a id='line_650'></a>
<a id='line_651'>10:3 Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the</a>
<a id='line_652'>man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.</a>
<a id='line_653'></a>
<a id='line_654'>10:4 Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood</a>
<a id='line_655'>over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the</a>
<a id='line_656'>cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD’s glory.</a>
<a id='line_657'></a>
<a id='line_658'>10:5 And the sound of the cherubims’ wings was heard even to the outer</a>
<a id='line_659'>court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.</a>
<a id='line_660'></a>
<a id='line_661'>10:6 And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed</a>
<a id='line_662'>with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between</a>
<a id='line_663'>the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.</a>
<a id='line_664'></a>
<a id='line_665'>10:7 And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the</a>
<a id='line_666'>cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took</a>
<a id='line_667'>thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen:</a>
<a id='line_668'>who took it, and went out.</a>
<a id='line_669'></a>
<a id='line_670'>10:8 And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man’s hand</a>
<a id='line_671'>under their wings.</a>
<a id='line_672'></a>
<a id='line_673'>10:9 And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one</a>
<a id='line_674'>wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the</a>
<a id='line_675'>appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone.</a>
<a id='line_676'></a>
<a id='line_677'>10:10 And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if</a>
<a id='line_678'>a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.</a>
<a id='line_679'></a>
<a id='line_680'>10:11 When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not</a>
<a id='line_681'>as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed</a>
<a id='line_682'>it; they turned not as they went.</a>
<a id='line_683'></a>
<a id='line_684'>10:12 And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and</a>
<a id='line_685'>their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the</a>
<a id='line_686'>wheels that they four had.</a>
<a id='line_687'></a>
<a id='line_688'>10:13 As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O</a>
<a id='line_689'>wheel.</a>
<a id='line_690'></a>
<a id='line_691'>10:14 And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a</a>
<a id='line_692'>cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the</a>
<a id='line_693'>face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</a>
<a id='line_694'></a>
<a id='line_695'>10:15 And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature</a>
<a id='line_696'>that I saw by the river of Chebar.</a>
<a id='line_697'></a>
<a id='line_698'>10:16 And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when</a>
<a id='line_699'>the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the</a>
<a id='line_700'>same wheels also turned not from beside them.</a>
<a id='line_701'></a>
<a id='line_702'>10:17 When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up,</a>
<a id='line_703'>these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature</a>
<a id='line_704'>was in them.</a>
<a id='line_705'></a>
<a id='line_706'>10:18 Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of</a>
<a id='line_707'>the house, and stood over the cherubims.</a>
<a id='line_708'></a>
<a id='line_709'>10:19 And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the</a>
<a id='line_710'>earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside</a>
<a id='line_711'>them, and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD’s</a>
<a id='line_712'>house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.</a>
<a id='line_713'></a>
<a id='line_714'>10:20 This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel</a>
<a id='line_715'>by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims.</a>
<a id='line_716'></a>
<a id='line_717'>10:21 Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and</a>
<a id='line_718'>the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.</a>
<a id='line_719'></a>
<a id='line_720'>10:22 And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw</a>
<a id='line_721'>by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went</a>
<a id='line_722'>every one straight forward.</a>
<a id='line_723'></a>
<a id='line_724'>11:1 Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east</a>
<a id='line_725'>gate of the LORD’s house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the</a>
<a id='line_726'>door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the</a>
<a id='line_727'>son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.</a>
<a id='line_728'></a>
<a id='line_729'>11:2 Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise</a>
<a id='line_730'>mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city: 11:3 Which say, It is</a>
<a id='line_731'>not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, and we be the</a>
<a id='line_732'>flesh.</a>
<a id='line_733'></a>
<a id='line_734'>11:4 Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.</a>
<a id='line_735'></a>
<a id='line_736'>11:5 And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak;</a>
<a id='line_737'>Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know</a>
<a id='line_738'>the things that come into your mind, every one of them.</a>
<a id='line_739'></a>
<a id='line_740'>11:6 Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled</a>
<a id='line_741'>the streets thereof with the slain.</a>
<a id='line_742'></a>
<a id='line_743'>11:7 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid</a>
<a id='line_744'>in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron:</a>
<a id='line_745'>but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.</a>
<a id='line_746'></a>
<a id='line_747'>11:8 Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you,</a>
<a id='line_748'>saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_749'></a>
<a id='line_750'>11:9 And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you</a>
<a id='line_751'>into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.</a>
<a id='line_752'></a>
<a id='line_753'>11:10 Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of</a>
<a id='line_754'>Israel; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_755'></a>
<a id='line_756'>11:11 This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the</a>
<a id='line_757'>flesh in the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border of</a>
<a id='line_758'>Israel: 11:12 And ye shall know that I am the LORD: for ye have not</a>
<a id='line_759'>walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done</a>
<a id='line_760'>after the manners of the heathen that are round about you.</a>
<a id='line_761'></a>
<a id='line_762'>11:13 And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of</a>
<a id='line_763'>Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud</a>
<a id='line_764'>voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant</a>
<a id='line_765'>of Israel?  11:14 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</a>
<a id='line_766'>11:15 Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy</a>
<a id='line_767'>kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the</a>
<a id='line_768'>inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us</a>
<a id='line_769'>is this land given in possession.</a>
<a id='line_770'></a>
<a id='line_771'>11:16 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast</a>
<a id='line_772'>them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them</a>
<a id='line_773'>among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in</a>
<a id='line_774'>the countries where they shall come.</a>
<a id='line_775'></a>
<a id='line_776'>11:17 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you</a>
<a id='line_777'>from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have</a>
<a id='line_778'>been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_779'></a>
<a id='line_780'>11:18 And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the</a>
<a id='line_781'>detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from</a>
<a id='line_782'>thence.</a>
<a id='line_783'></a>
<a id='line_784'>11:19 And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit</a>
<a id='line_785'>within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and</a>
<a id='line_786'>will give them an heart of flesh: 11:20 That they may walk in my</a>
<a id='line_787'>statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my</a>
<a id='line_788'>people, and I will be their God.</a>
<a id='line_789'></a>
<a id='line_790'>11:21 But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their</a>
<a id='line_791'>detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way</a>
<a id='line_792'>upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_793'></a>
<a id='line_794'>11:22 Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels</a>
<a id='line_795'>beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.</a>
<a id='line_796'></a>
<a id='line_797'>11:23 And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city,</a>
<a id='line_798'>and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.</a>
<a id='line_799'></a>
<a id='line_800'>11:24 Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by</a>
<a id='line_801'>the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the</a>
<a id='line_802'>vision that I had seen went up from me.</a>
<a id='line_803'></a>
<a id='line_804'>11:25 Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the</a>
<a id='line_805'>LORD had shewed me.</a>
<a id='line_806'></a>
<a id='line_807'>12:1 The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying, 12:2 Son of man,</a>
<a id='line_808'>thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to</a>
<a id='line_809'>see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a</a>
<a id='line_810'>rebellious house.</a>
<a id='line_811'></a>
<a id='line_812'>12:3 Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and</a>
<a id='line_813'>remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to</a>
<a id='line_814'>another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though</a>
<a id='line_815'>they be a rebellious house.</a>
<a id='line_816'></a>
<a id='line_817'>12:4 Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as</a>
<a id='line_818'>stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as</a>
<a id='line_819'>they that go forth into captivity.</a>
<a id='line_820'></a>
<a id='line_821'>12:5 Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.</a>
<a id='line_822'></a>
<a id='line_823'>12:6 In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry</a>
<a id='line_824'>it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not</a>
<a id='line_825'>the ground: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_826'></a>
<a id='line_827'>12:7 And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day,</a>
<a id='line_828'>as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the wall with</a>
<a id='line_829'>mine hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bare it upon my</a>
<a id='line_830'>shoulder in their sight.</a>
<a id='line_831'></a>
<a id='line_832'>12:8 And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,</a>
<a id='line_833'>12:9 Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house,</a>
<a id='line_834'>said unto thee, What doest thou?  12:10 Say thou unto them, Thus saith</a>
<a id='line_835'>the Lord GOD; This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all</a>
<a id='line_836'>the house of Israel that are among them.</a>
<a id='line_837'></a>
<a id='line_838'>12:11 Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done</a>
<a id='line_839'>unto them: they shall remove and go into captivity.</a>
<a id='line_840'></a>
<a id='line_841'>12:12 And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder</a>
<a id='line_842'>in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall</a>
<a id='line_843'>to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the</a>
<a id='line_844'>ground with his eyes.</a>
<a id='line_845'></a>
<a id='line_846'>12:13 My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my</a>
<a id='line_847'>snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans;</a>
<a id='line_848'>yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.</a>
<a id='line_849'></a>
<a id='line_850'>12:14 And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to</a>
<a id='line_851'>help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.</a>
<a id='line_852'></a>
<a id='line_853'>12:15 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter</a>
<a id='line_854'>them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.</a>
<a id='line_855'></a>
<a id='line_856'>12:16 But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the</a>
<a id='line_857'>famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their</a>
<a id='line_858'>abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know</a>
<a id='line_859'>that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_860'></a>
<a id='line_861'>12:17 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 12:18 Son of</a>
<a id='line_862'>man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling</a>
<a id='line_863'>and with carefulness; 12:19 And say unto the people of the land, Thus</a>
<a id='line_864'>saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of</a>
<a id='line_865'>Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their</a>
<a id='line_866'>water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that</a>
<a id='line_867'>is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.</a>
<a id='line_868'></a>
<a id='line_869'>12:20 And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the</a>
<a id='line_870'>land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_871'></a>
<a id='line_872'>12:21 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 12:22 Son of man,</a>
<a id='line_873'>what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The</a>
<a id='line_874'>days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?  12:23 Tell them</a>
<a id='line_875'>therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease,</a>
<a id='line_876'>and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto</a>
<a id='line_877'>them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.</a>
<a id='line_878'></a>
<a id='line_879'>12:24 For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering</a>
<a id='line_880'>divination within the house of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_881'></a>
<a id='line_882'>12:25 For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak</a>
<a id='line_883'>shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O</a>
<a id='line_884'>rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the</a>
<a id='line_885'>Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_886'></a>
<a id='line_887'>12:26 Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying.</a>
<a id='line_888'></a>
<a id='line_889'>12:27 Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision</a>
<a id='line_890'>that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the</a>
<a id='line_891'>times that are far off.</a>
<a id='line_892'></a>
<a id='line_893'>12:28 Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall</a>
<a id='line_894'>none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have</a>
<a id='line_895'>spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_896'></a>
<a id='line_897'>13:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 13:2 Son of man,</a>
<a id='line_898'>prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou</a>
<a id='line_899'>unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of</a>
<a id='line_900'>the LORD; 13:3 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets,</a>
<a id='line_901'>that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!  13:4 O Israel,</a>
<a id='line_902'>thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.</a>
<a id='line_903'></a>
<a id='line_904'>13:5 Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for</a>
<a id='line_905'>the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_906'></a>
<a id='line_907'>13:6 They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD</a>
<a id='line_908'>saith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made others to</a>
<a id='line_909'>hope that they would confirm the word.</a>
<a id='line_910'></a>
<a id='line_911'>13:7 Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying</a>
<a id='line_912'>divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have not</a>
<a id='line_913'>spoken?  13:8 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have</a>
<a id='line_914'>spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you,</a>
<a id='line_915'>saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_916'></a>
<a id='line_917'>13:9 And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and</a>
<a id='line_918'>that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people,</a>
<a id='line_919'>neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_920'>neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know</a>
<a id='line_921'>that I am the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_922'></a>
<a id='line_923'>13:10 Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying,</a>
<a id='line_924'>Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo,</a>
<a id='line_925'>others daubed it with untempered morter: 13:11 Say unto them which</a>
<a id='line_926'>daub it with untempered morter, that it shall fall: there shall be an</a>
<a id='line_927'>overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a</a>
<a id='line_928'>stormy wind shall rend it.</a>
<a id='line_929'></a>
<a id='line_930'>13:12 Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you,</a>
<a id='line_931'>Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?  13:13 Therefore</a>
<a id='line_932'>thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my</a>
<a id='line_933'>fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and</a>
<a id='line_934'>great hailstones in my fury to consume it.</a>
<a id='line_935'></a>
<a id='line_936'>13:14 So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with</a>
<a id='line_937'>untempered morter, and bring it down to the ground, so that the</a>
<a id='line_938'>foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye</a>
<a id='line_939'>shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am</a>
<a id='line_940'>the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_941'></a>
<a id='line_942'>13:15 Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them</a>
<a id='line_943'>that have daubed it with untempered morter, and will say unto you, The</a>
<a id='line_944'>wall is no more, neither they that daubed it; 13:16 To wit, the</a>
<a id='line_945'>prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see</a>
<a id='line_946'>visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_947'></a>
<a id='line_948'>13:17 Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of</a>
<a id='line_949'>thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou</a>
<a id='line_950'>against them, 13:18 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the women</a>
<a id='line_951'>that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of</a>
<a id='line_952'>every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and</a>
<a id='line_953'>will ye save the souls alive that come unto you?  13:19 And will ye</a>
<a id='line_954'>pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of</a>
<a id='line_955'>bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls</a>
<a id='line_956'>alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your</a>
<a id='line_957'>lies?  13:20 Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against</a>
<a id='line_958'>your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and</a>
<a id='line_959'>I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the</a>
<a id='line_960'>souls that ye hunt to make them fly.</a>
<a id='line_961'></a>
<a id='line_962'>13:21 Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of</a>
<a id='line_963'>your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye</a>
<a id='line_964'>shall know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_965'></a>
<a id='line_966'>13:22 Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad,</a>
<a id='line_967'>whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked,</a>
<a id='line_968'>that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:</a>
<a id='line_969'>13:23 Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations:</a>
<a id='line_970'>for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that</a>
<a id='line_971'>I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_972'></a>
<a id='line_973'>14:1 Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before</a>
<a id='line_974'>me.</a>
<a id='line_975'></a>
<a id='line_976'>14:2 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 14:3 Son of man,</a>
<a id='line_977'>these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the</a>
<a id='line_978'>stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be</a>
<a id='line_979'>enquired of at all by them?  14:4 Therefore speak unto them, and say</a>
<a id='line_980'>unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel</a>
<a id='line_981'>that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock</a>
<a id='line_982'>of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD</a>
<a id='line_983'>will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;</a>
<a id='line_984'>14:5 That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because</a>
<a id='line_985'>they are all estranged from me through their idols.</a>
<a id='line_986'></a>
<a id='line_987'>14:6 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD;</a>
<a id='line_988'>Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces</a>
<a id='line_989'>from all your abominations.</a>
<a id='line_990'></a>
<a id='line_991'>14:7 For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that</a>
<a id='line_992'>sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up</a>
<a id='line_993'>his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity</a>
<a id='line_994'>before his face, and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning</a>
<a id='line_995'>me; I the LORD will answer him by myself: 14:8 And I will set my face</a>
<a id='line_996'>against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will</a>
<a id='line_997'>cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am</a>
<a id='line_998'>the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_999'></a>
<a id='line_1000'>14:9 And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the</a>
<a id='line_1001'>LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon</a>
<a id='line_1002'>him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1003'></a>
<a id='line_1004'>14:10 And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the</a>
<a id='line_1005'>punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that</a>
<a id='line_1006'>seeketh unto him; 14:11 That the house of Israel may go no more astray</a>
<a id='line_1007'>from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions;</a>
<a id='line_1008'>but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord</a>
<a id='line_1009'>GOD.</a>
<a id='line_1010'></a>
<a id='line_1011'>14:12 The word of the LORD came again to me, saying, 14:13 Son of man,</a>
<a id='line_1012'>when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will</a>
<a id='line_1013'>I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread</a>
<a id='line_1014'>thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast</a>
<a id='line_1015'>from it: 14:14 Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in</a>
<a id='line_1016'>it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness,</a>
<a id='line_1017'>saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_1018'></a>
<a id='line_1019'>14:15 If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they</a>
<a id='line_1020'>spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because</a>
<a id='line_1021'>of the beasts: 14:16 Though these three men were in it, as I live,</a>
<a id='line_1022'>saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters;</a>
<a id='line_1023'>they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.</a>
<a id='line_1024'></a>
<a id='line_1025'>14:17 Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through</a>
<a id='line_1026'>the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it: 14:18 Though these</a>
<a id='line_1027'>three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall</a>
<a id='line_1028'>deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered</a>

<a id='line_1031'>14:19 Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury</a>

<a id='line_1037'>14:21 For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four</a>

<a id='line_1040'>14:22 Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be</a>

<a id='line_1043'>comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even</a>

<a id='line_1045'></a>
<a id='line_1046'>14:23 And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their</a>

<a id='line_1049'></a>
<a id='line_1050'>15:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 15:2 Son of man,</a>
<a id='line_1051'>what is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is</a>
<a id='line_1052'>among the trees of the forest?  15:3 Shall wood be taken thereof to do</a>
<a id='line_1053'>any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?</a>
<a id='line_1054'>15:4 Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth</a>
<a id='line_1055'>both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any</a>
<a id='line_1056'>work?  15:5 Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how</a>
<a id='line_1057'>much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath</a>
<a id='line_1058'>devoured it, and it is burned?  15:6 Therefore thus saith the Lord</a>
<a id='line_1059'>GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have</a>
<a id='line_1060'>given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of</a>
<a id='line_1061'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1062'></a>
<a id='line_1063'>15:7 And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one</a>
<a id='line_1064'>fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am</a>
<a id='line_1065'>the LORD, when I set my face against them.</a>
<a id='line_1066'></a>
<a id='line_1067'>15:8 And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a</a>
<a id='line_1068'>trespass, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_1069'></a>
<a id='line_1070'>16:1 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 16:2 Son of man,</a>
<a id='line_1071'>cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, 16:3 And say, Thus saith the</a>
<a id='line_1072'>Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of</a>
<a id='line_1073'>Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite.</a>
<a id='line_1074'></a>
<a id='line_1075'>16:4 And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was</a>
<a id='line_1076'>not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast</a>
<a id='line_1077'>not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.</a>
<a id='line_1078'></a>
<a id='line_1079'>16:5 None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have</a>
<a id='line_1080'>compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the</a>
<a id='line_1081'>lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.</a>
<a id='line_1082'></a>
<a id='line_1083'>16:6 And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own</a>
<a id='line_1084'>blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said</a>
<a id='line_1085'>unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live.</a>
<a id='line_1086'></a>
<a id='line_1087'>16:7 I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou</a>
<a id='line_1088'>hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent</a>
<a id='line_1089'>ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas</a>
<a id='line_1090'>thou wast naked and bare.</a>
<a id='line_1091'></a>
<a id='line_1092'>16:8 Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time</a>
<a id='line_1093'>was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy</a>
<a id='line_1094'>nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with</a>
<a id='line_1095'>thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine.</a>
<a id='line_1096'></a>
<a id='line_1097'>16:9 Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy</a>
<a id='line_1098'>blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.</a>
<a id='line_1099'></a>
<a id='line_1100'>16:10 I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with</a>
<a id='line_1101'>badgers’ skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered</a>
<a id='line_1102'>thee with silk.</a>
<a id='line_1103'></a>
<a id='line_1104'>16:11 I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy</a>
<a id='line_1105'>hands, and a chain on thy neck.</a>
<a id='line_1106'></a>
<a id='line_1107'>16:12 And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears,</a>
<a id='line_1108'>and a beautiful crown upon thine head.</a>
<a id='line_1109'></a>
<a id='line_1110'>16:13 Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was</a>
<a id='line_1111'>of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine</a>
<a id='line_1112'>flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou</a>
<a id='line_1113'>didst prosper into a kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_1114'></a>
<a id='line_1115'>16:14 And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for</a>
<a id='line_1116'>it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith</a>
<a id='line_1117'>the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_1118'></a>
<a id='line_1119'>16:15 But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the</a>
<a id='line_1120'>harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on</a>
<a id='line_1121'>every one that passed by; his it was.</a>
<a id='line_1122'></a>
<a id='line_1123'>16:16 And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high</a>
<a id='line_1124'>places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the</a>
<a id='line_1125'>like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.</a>
<a id='line_1126'></a>
<a id='line_1127'>16:17 Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my</a>
<a id='line_1128'>silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men,</a>
<a id='line_1129'>and didst commit whoredom with them, 16:18 And tookest thy broidered</a>
<a id='line_1130'>garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine</a>
<a id='line_1131'>incense before them.</a>
<a id='line_1132'></a>
<a id='line_1133'>16:19 My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey,</a>
<a id='line_1134'>wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet</a>
<a id='line_1135'>savour: and thus it was, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_1136'></a>
<a id='line_1137'>16:20 Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou</a>
<a id='line_1138'>hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be</a>
<a id='line_1139'>devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter, 16:21 That thou</a>
<a id='line_1140'>hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass</a>
<a id='line_1141'>through the fire for them?  16:22 And in all thine abominations and</a>
<a id='line_1142'>thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when</a>
<a id='line_1143'>thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.</a>
<a id='line_1144'></a>
<a id='line_1145'>16:23 And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto</a>
<a id='line_1146'>thee!  saith the LORD GOD;) 16:24 That thou hast also built unto thee</a>
<a id='line_1147'>an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street.</a>
<a id='line_1148'></a>
<a id='line_1149'>16:25 Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and</a>
<a id='line_1150'>hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every</a>
<a id='line_1151'>one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.</a>
<a id='line_1152'></a>
<a id='line_1153'>16:26 Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy</a>
<a id='line_1154'>neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to</a>
<a id='line_1155'>provoke me to anger.</a>
<a id='line_1156'></a>
<a id='line_1157'>16:27 Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and</a>
<a id='line_1158'>have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will</a>
<a id='line_1159'>of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are</a>
<a id='line_1160'>ashamed of thy lewd way.</a>
<a id='line_1161'></a>
<a id='line_1162'>16:28 Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou</a>
<a id='line_1163'>wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet</a>
<a id='line_1164'>couldest not be satisfied.</a>
<a id='line_1165'></a>
<a id='line_1166'>16:29 Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of</a>
<a id='line_1167'>Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied therewith.</a>
<a id='line_1168'></a>
<a id='line_1169'>16:30 How weak is thine heart, saith the LORD GOD, seeing thou doest</a>
<a id='line_1170'>all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman; 16:31 In</a>
<a id='line_1171'>that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and</a>
<a id='line_1172'>makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an</a>
<a id='line_1173'>harlot, in that thou scornest hire; 16:32 But as a wife that</a>
<a id='line_1174'>committeth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband!</a>
<a id='line_1175'>16:33 They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all</a>
<a id='line_1176'>thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every</a>
<a id='line_1177'>side for thy whoredom.</a>
<a id='line_1178'></a>
<a id='line_1179'>16:34 And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms,</a>
<a id='line_1180'>whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou</a>
<a id='line_1181'>givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art</a>
<a id='line_1182'>contrary.</a>
<a id='line_1183'></a>
<a id='line_1184'>16:35 Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD: 16:36 Thus saith</a>
<a id='line_1185'>the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness</a>
<a id='line_1186'>discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the</a>
<a id='line_1187'>idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which</a>
<a id='line_1188'>thou didst give unto them; 16:37 Behold, therefore I will gather all</a>
<a id='line_1189'>thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou</a>
<a id='line_1190'>hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather</a>
<a id='line_1191'>them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto</a>
<a id='line_1192'>them, that they may see all thy nakedness.</a>
<a id='line_1193'></a>
<a id='line_1194'>16:38 And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed</a>
<a id='line_1195'>blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.</a>
<a id='line_1196'></a>
<a id='line_1197'>16:39 And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw</a>
<a id='line_1198'>down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they</a>
<a id='line_1199'>shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels,</a>
<a id='line_1200'>and leave thee naked and bare.</a>
<a id='line_1201'></a>
<a id='line_1202'>16:40 They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall</a>
<a id='line_1203'>stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.</a>
<a id='line_1204'></a>
<a id='line_1205'>16:41 And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute</a>
<a id='line_1206'>judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee</a>
<a id='line_1207'>to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any</a>
<a id='line_1208'>more.</a>
<a id='line_1209'></a>
<a id='line_1210'>16:42 So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy</a>
<a id='line_1211'>shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more</a>
<a id='line_1212'>angry.</a>
<a id='line_1213'></a>
<a id='line_1214'>16:43 Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast</a>
<a id='line_1215'>fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will</a>
<a id='line_1216'>recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_1217'>not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.</a>
<a id='line_1218'></a>
<a id='line_1219'>16:44 Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb</a>
<a id='line_1220'>against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.</a>
<a id='line_1221'></a>
<a id='line_1222'>16:45 Thou art thy mother’s daughter, that lotheth her husband and her</a>

<a id='line_1226'></a>
<a id='line_1227'>16:46 And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that</a>

<a id='line_1231'>16:47 Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their</a>

<a id='line_1235'>16:48 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done,</a>

<a id='line_1291'>17:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 17:2 Son of man,</a>
<a id='line_1292'>put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel; 17:3</a>
<a id='line_1293'>And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings,</a>
<a id='line_1294'>longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto</a>
<a id='line_1295'>Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar: 17:4 He cropped off</a>
<a id='line_1296'>the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he</a>
<a id='line_1297'>set it in a city of merchants.</a>
<a id='line_1298'></a>
<a id='line_1299'>17:5 He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a</a>
<a id='line_1300'>fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow</a>
<a id='line_1301'>tree.</a>
<a id='line_1302'></a>
<a id='line_1303'>17:6 And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose</a>
<a id='line_1304'>branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so</a>
<a id='line_1305'>it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.</a>
<a id='line_1306'></a>
<a id='line_1307'>17:7 There was also another great eagle with great wings and many</a>
<a id='line_1308'>feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and</a>
<a id='line_1309'>shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the</a>
<a id='line_1310'>furrows of her plantation.</a>
<a id='line_1311'></a>
<a id='line_1312'>17:8 It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might</a>

<a id='line_1316'>17:9 Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not</a>

<a id='line_1319'>great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.</a>
<a id='line_1320'></a>
<a id='line_1321'>17:10 Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not</a>

<a id='line_1325'>17:11 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 17:12 Say</a>

<a id='line_1328'>the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to</a>
<a id='line_1329'>Babylon; 17:13 And hath taken of the king’s seed, and made a covenant</a>
<a id='line_1330'>with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty</a>
<a id='line_1331'>of the land: 17:14 That the kingdom might be base, that it might not</a>
<a id='line_1332'>lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.</a>
<a id='line_1333'></a>
<a id='line_1334'>17:15 But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into</a>
<a id='line_1335'>Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he</a>
<a id='line_1336'>prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall he break the</a>
<a id='line_1337'>covenant, and be delivered?  17:16 As I live, saith the Lord GOD,</a>
<a id='line_1338'>surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose</a>
<a id='line_1339'>oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the</a>

<a id='line_1341'></a>
<a id='line_1342'>17:17 Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company</a>
<a id='line_1343'>make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to</a>
<a id='line_1344'>cut off many persons: 17:18 Seeing he despised the oath by breaking</a>
<a id='line_1345'>the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these</a>
<a id='line_1346'>things, he shall not escape.</a>
<a id='line_1347'></a>
<a id='line_1348'>17:19 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath</a>

<a id='line_1352'>17:20 And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my</a>

<a id='line_1359'></a>
<a id='line_1360'>17:22 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch</a>
<a id='line_1361'>of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of</a>
<a id='line_1362'>his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain</a>
<a id='line_1363'>and eminent: 17:23 In the mountain of the height of Israel will I</a>
<a id='line_1364'>plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a</a>
<a id='line_1365'>goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the</a>

<a id='line_1367'></a>
<a id='line_1368'>17:24 And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have</a>

<a id='line_1372'></a>
<a id='line_1373'>18:1 The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying, 18:2 What mean</a>
<a id='line_1374'>ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1375'>The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set</a>
<a id='line_1376'>on edge?  18:3 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have</a>

<a id='line_1378'></a>
<a id='line_1379'>18:4 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also</a>
<a id='line_1380'>the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.</a>
<a id='line_1381'></a>
<a id='line_1382'>18:5 But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right, 18:6</a>
<a id='line_1383'>And hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes</a>
<a id='line_1384'>to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his</a>
<a id='line_1385'>neighbours wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman, 18:7</a>
<a id='line_1386'>And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his</a>

<a id='line_1388'>hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; 18:8 He that hath</a>
<a id='line_1389'>not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath</a>
<a id='line_1390'>withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between</a>
<a id='line_1391'>man and man, 18:9 Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my</a>
<a id='line_1392'>judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the</a>
<a id='line_1393'>Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_1394'></a>
<a id='line_1395'>18:10 If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that</a>
<a id='line_1396'>doeth the like to any one of these things, 18:11 And that doeth not</a>
<a id='line_1397'>any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and</a>
<a id='line_1398'>defiled his neighbours wife, 18:12 Hath oppressed the poor and needy,</a>
<a id='line_1399'>hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath</a>
<a id='line_1400'>lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination, 18:13</a>
<a id='line_1401'>Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then</a>
<a id='line_1402'>live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall</a>
<a id='line_1403'>surely die; his blood shall be upon him.</a>
<a id='line_1404'></a>
<a id='line_1405'>18:14 Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father’s sins</a>
<a id='line_1406'>which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like, 18:15</a>
<a id='line_1407'>That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his</a>
<a id='line_1408'>eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his</a>
<a id='line_1409'>neighbours wife, 18:16 Neither hath oppressed any, hath not</a>
<a id='line_1410'>withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath</a>
<a id='line_1411'>given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a</a>
<a id='line_1412'>garment, 18:17 That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath</a>
<a id='line_1413'>not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath</a>
<a id='line_1414'>walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his</a>
<a id='line_1415'>father, he shall surely live.</a>
<a id='line_1416'></a>
<a id='line_1417'>18:18 As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his</a>

<a id='line_1419'>lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_1420'></a>
<a id='line_1421'>18:19 Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the</a>
<a id='line_1422'>father?  When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and</a>

<a id='line_1424'></a>
<a id='line_1425'>18:20 The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the</a>

<a id='line_1429'></a>
<a id='line_1430'>18:21 But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath</a>

<a id='line_1433'></a>
<a id='line_1434'>18:22 All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be</a>
<a id='line_1435'>mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall</a>
<a id='line_1436'>live.</a>
<a id='line_1437'></a>
<a id='line_1438'>18:23 Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the</a>
<a id='line_1439'>Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?</a>
<a id='line_1440'>18:24 But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and</a>
<a id='line_1441'>committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that</a>
<a id='line_1442'>the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he</a>
<a id='line_1443'>hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath</a>
<a id='line_1444'>trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.</a>
<a id='line_1445'></a>
<a id='line_1446'>18:25 Yet ye say, The way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O house</a>

<a id='line_1448'>a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth</a>
<a id='line_1449'>iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall</a>

<a id='line_1455'></a>
<a id='line_1456'>18:28 Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his</a>
<a id='line_1457'>transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall</a>
<a id='line_1458'>not die.</a>
<a id='line_1459'></a>
<a id='line_1460'>18:29 Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the LORD is not equal.</a>
<a id='line_1461'>O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?</a>
<a id='line_1462'>18:30 Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one</a>
<a id='line_1463'>according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves</a>

<a id='line_1465'></a>
<a id='line_1466'>18:31 Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have</a>
<a id='line_1467'>transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will</a>

<a id='line_1469'>of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and</a>

<a id='line_1472'>19:1 Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_1473'>19:2 And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions,</a>

<a id='line_1475'></a>
<a id='line_1476'>19:3 And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and</a>

<a id='line_1478'></a>
<a id='line_1479'>19:4 The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and</a>

<a id='line_1482'>19:5 Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then</a>

<a id='line_1485'>19:6 And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion,</a>
<a id='line_1486'>and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.</a>
<a id='line_1487'></a>
<a id='line_1488'>19:7 And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their</a>

<a id='line_1491'></a>
<a id='line_1492'>19:8 Then the nations set against him on every side from the</a>

<a id='line_1494'></a>
<a id='line_1495'>19:9 And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king</a>
<a id='line_1496'>of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more</a>

<a id='line_1499'>19:10 Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters:</a>

<a id='line_1502'>19:11 And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule,</a>

<a id='line_1506'>19:12 But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground,</a>

<a id='line_1529'>lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made</a>
<a id='line_1530'>myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine</a>
<a id='line_1531'>hand unto them, saying, I am the LORD your God; 20:6 In the day that I</a>
<a id='line_1532'>lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of</a>
<a id='line_1533'>Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and</a>
<a id='line_1534'>honey, which is the glory of all lands: 20:7 Then said I unto them,</a>
<a id='line_1535'>Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not</a>
<a id='line_1536'>yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</a>
<a id='line_1537'></a>
<a id='line_1538'>20:8 But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they</a>
<a id='line_1539'>did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither</a>
<a id='line_1540'>did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my</a>
<a id='line_1541'>fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of</a>
<a id='line_1542'>the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1543'></a>
<a id='line_1544'>20:9 But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted</a>
<a id='line_1545'>before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself</a>
<a id='line_1546'>known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1547'></a>
<a id='line_1548'>20:10 Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt,</a>
<a id='line_1549'>and brought them into the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_1550'></a>
<a id='line_1551'>20:11 And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which</a>
<a id='line_1552'>if a man do, he shall even live in them.</a>
<a id='line_1553'></a>
<a id='line_1554'>20:12 Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me</a>
<a id='line_1555'>and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.</a>
<a id='line_1556'></a>
<a id='line_1557'>20:13 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness:</a>
<a id='line_1558'>they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which</a>
<a id='line_1559'>if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly</a>
<a id='line_1560'>polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the</a>
<a id='line_1561'>wilderness, to consume them.</a>
<a id='line_1562'></a>
<a id='line_1563'>20:14 But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted</a>
<a id='line_1564'>before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.</a>
<a id='line_1565'></a>
<a id='line_1566'>20:15 Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I</a>
<a id='line_1567'>would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing</a>
<a id='line_1568'>with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands; 20:16 Because</a>
<a id='line_1569'>they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but</a>
<a id='line_1570'>polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.</a>
<a id='line_1571'></a>
<a id='line_1572'>20:17 Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither</a>
<a id='line_1573'>did I make an end of them in the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_1574'></a>
<a id='line_1575'>20:18 But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in</a>
<a id='line_1576'>the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor</a>
<a id='line_1577'>defile yourselves with their idols: 20:19 I am the LORD your God; walk</a>
<a id='line_1578'>in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; 20:20 And hallow</a>
<a id='line_1579'>my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may</a>
<a id='line_1580'>know that I am the LORD your God.</a>
<a id='line_1581'></a>
<a id='line_1582'>20:21 Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked</a>
<a id='line_1583'>not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a</a>
<a id='line_1584'>man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I</a>
<a id='line_1585'>said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger</a>
<a id='line_1586'>against them in the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_1587'></a>
<a id='line_1588'>20:22 Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name’s</a>
<a id='line_1589'>sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in</a>
<a id='line_1590'>whose sight I brought them forth.</a>
<a id='line_1591'></a>
<a id='line_1592'>20:23 I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I</a>
<a id='line_1593'>would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the</a>
<a id='line_1594'>countries; 20:24 Because they had not executed my judgments, but had</a>
<a id='line_1595'>despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes</a>
<a id='line_1596'>were after their fathers’ idols.</a>
<a id='line_1597'></a>
<a id='line_1598'>20:25 Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and</a>
<a id='line_1599'>judgments whereby they should not live; 20:26 And I polluted them in</a>
<a id='line_1600'>their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that</a>
<a id='line_1601'>openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that</a>
<a id='line_1602'>they might know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1603'></a>
<a id='line_1604'>20:27 Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say</a>
<a id='line_1605'>unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have</a>
<a id='line_1606'>blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.</a>
<a id='line_1607'></a>
<a id='line_1608'>20:28 For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I</a>
<a id='line_1609'>lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill,</a>
<a id='line_1610'>and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and</a>
<a id='line_1611'>there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also</a>
<a id='line_1612'>they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink</a>
<a id='line_1613'>offerings.</a>
<a id='line_1614'></a>
<a id='line_1615'>20:29 Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go?</a>
<a id='line_1616'>And the name whereof is called Bamah unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_1617'></a>
<a id='line_1618'>20:30 Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD;</a>
<a id='line_1619'>Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye</a>
<a id='line_1620'>whoredom after their abominations?  20:31 For when ye offer your</a>
<a id='line_1621'>gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute</a>
<a id='line_1622'>yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be</a>
<a id='line_1623'>enquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord GOD,</a>
<a id='line_1624'>I will not be enquired of by you.</a>
<a id='line_1625'></a>
<a id='line_1626'>20:32 And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that</a>
<a id='line_1627'>ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries,</a>
<a id='line_1628'>to serve wood and stone.</a>
<a id='line_1629'></a>
<a id='line_1630'>20:33 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and</a>
<a id='line_1631'>with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over</a>
<a id='line_1632'>you: 20:34 And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather</a>
<a id='line_1633'>you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand,</a>
<a id='line_1634'>and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.</a>
<a id='line_1635'></a>
<a id='line_1636'>20:35 And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and</a>
<a id='line_1637'>there will I plead with you face to face.</a>
<a id='line_1638'></a>
<a id='line_1639'>20:36 Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the</a>
<a id='line_1640'>land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_1641'></a>
<a id='line_1642'>20:37 And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you</a>
<a id='line_1643'>into the bond of the covenant: 20:38 And I will purge out from among</a>
<a id='line_1644'>you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them</a>
<a id='line_1645'>forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter</a>
<a id='line_1646'>into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1647'></a>
<a id='line_1648'>20:39 As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye,</a>
<a id='line_1649'>serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not</a>
<a id='line_1650'>hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts,</a>
<a id='line_1651'>and with your idols.</a>
<a id='line_1652'></a>
<a id='line_1653'>20:40 For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of</a>
<a id='line_1654'>Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all</a>
<a id='line_1655'>of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there</a>
<a id='line_1656'>will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations,</a>
<a id='line_1657'>with all your holy things.</a>
<a id='line_1658'></a>
<a id='line_1659'>20:41 I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out</a>
<a id='line_1660'>from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have</a>
<a id='line_1661'>been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.</a>
<a id='line_1662'></a>
<a id='line_1663'>20:42 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you</a>
<a id='line_1664'>into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up</a>
<a id='line_1665'>mine hand to give it to your fathers.</a>
<a id='line_1666'></a>
<a id='line_1667'>20:43 And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings,</a>
<a id='line_1668'>wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your</a>
<a id='line_1669'>own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.</a>
<a id='line_1670'></a>
<a id='line_1671'>20:44 And ye shall know that I am the LORD when I have wrought with</a>
<a id='line_1672'>you for my name’s sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor</a>
<a id='line_1673'>according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord</a>
<a id='line_1674'>GOD.</a>
<a id='line_1675'></a>
<a id='line_1676'>20:45 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 20:46 Son of</a>
<a id='line_1677'>man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward the</a>
<a id='line_1678'>south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field; 20:47 And</a>
<a id='line_1679'>say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith</a>
<a id='line_1680'>the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall</a>
<a id='line_1681'>devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame</a>
<a id='line_1682'>shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall</a>
<a id='line_1683'>be burned therein.</a>
<a id='line_1684'></a>
<a id='line_1685'>20:48 And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it</a>
<a id='line_1686'>shall not be quenched.</a>
<a id='line_1687'></a>
<a id='line_1688'>20:49 Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak</a>
<a id='line_1689'>parables?  21:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 21:2</a>
<a id='line_1690'>Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward</a>
<a id='line_1691'>the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel, 21:3 And say</a>
<a id='line_1692'>to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I am against thee,</a>
<a id='line_1693'>and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from</a>
<a id='line_1694'>thee the righteous and the wicked.</a>
<a id='line_1695'></a>
<a id='line_1696'>21:4 Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the</a>
<a id='line_1697'>wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against</a>
<a id='line_1698'>all flesh from the south to the north: 21:5 That all flesh may know</a>
<a id='line_1699'>that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall</a>
<a id='line_1700'>not return any more.</a>
<a id='line_1701'></a>
<a id='line_1702'>21:6 Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins;</a>
<a id='line_1703'>and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.</a>
<a id='line_1704'></a>
<a id='line_1705'>21:7 And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou?</a>
<a id='line_1706'>that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every</a>
<a id='line_1707'>heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit</a>
<a id='line_1708'>shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh,</a>
<a id='line_1709'>and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_1710'></a>
<a id='line_1711'>21:8 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 21:9 Son of man,</a>
<a id='line_1712'>prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is</a>
<a id='line_1713'>sharpened, and also furbished: 21:10 It is sharpened to make a sore</a>
<a id='line_1714'>slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make</a>
<a id='line_1715'>mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree.</a>
<a id='line_1716'></a>
<a id='line_1717'>21:11 And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled:</a>
<a id='line_1718'>this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand</a>
<a id='line_1719'>of the slayer.</a>
<a id='line_1720'></a>
<a id='line_1721'>21:12 Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it</a>
<a id='line_1722'>shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the</a>
<a id='line_1723'>sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh.</a>
<a id='line_1724'></a>
<a id='line_1725'>21:13 Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the</a>
<a id='line_1726'>rod?  it shall be no more, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_1727'></a>
<a id='line_1728'>21:14 Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands</a>
<a id='line_1729'>together. and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of</a>
<a id='line_1730'>the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which</a>
<a id='line_1731'>entereth into their privy chambers.</a>
<a id='line_1732'></a>
<a id='line_1733'>21:15 I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that</a>
<a id='line_1734'>their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made</a>
<a id='line_1735'>bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.</a>
<a id='line_1736'></a>
<a id='line_1737'>21:16 Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the</a>
<a id='line_1738'>left, whithersoever thy face is set.</a>
<a id='line_1739'></a>
<a id='line_1740'>21:17 I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury</a>
<a id='line_1741'>to rest: I the LORD have said it.</a>
<a id='line_1742'></a>
<a id='line_1743'>21:18 The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying, 21:19 Also,</a>
<a id='line_1744'>thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of</a>
<a id='line_1745'>Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and</a>
<a id='line_1746'>choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.</a>
<a id='line_1747'></a>
<a id='line_1748'>21:20 Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the</a>
<a id='line_1749'>Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.</a>
<a id='line_1750'></a>
<a id='line_1751'>21:21 For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the</a>
<a id='line_1752'>head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he</a>
<a id='line_1753'>consulted with images, he looked in the liver.</a>
<a id='line_1754'></a>
<a id='line_1755'>21:22 At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint</a>
<a id='line_1756'>captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice</a>
<a id='line_1757'>with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a</a>
<a id='line_1758'>mount, and to build a fort.</a>
<a id='line_1759'></a>
<a id='line_1760'>21:23 And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight,</a>
<a id='line_1761'>to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the</a>
<a id='line_1762'>iniquity, that they may be taken.</a>
<a id='line_1763'></a>
<a id='line_1764'>21:24 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your</a>
<a id='line_1765'>iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered,</a>
<a id='line_1766'>so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that</a>
<a id='line_1767'>ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.</a>
<a id='line_1768'></a>
<a id='line_1769'>21:25 And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come,</a>
<a id='line_1770'>when iniquity shall have an end, 21:26 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove</a>
<a id='line_1771'>the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt</a>
<a id='line_1772'>him that is low, and abase him that is high.</a>
<a id='line_1773'></a>
<a id='line_1774'>21:27 I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no</a>
<a id='line_1775'>more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.</a>
<a id='line_1776'></a>
<a id='line_1777'>21:28 And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD</a>
<a id='line_1778'>concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say</a>
<a id='line_1779'>thou, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is</a>
<a id='line_1780'>furbished, to consume because of the glittering: 21:29 Whiles they see</a>
<a id='line_1781'>vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee</a>
<a id='line_1782'>upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is</a>
<a id='line_1783'>come, when their iniquity shall have an end.</a>
<a id='line_1784'></a>
<a id='line_1785'>21:30 Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in</a>
<a id='line_1786'>the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.</a>
<a id='line_1787'></a>
<a id='line_1788'>21:31 And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow</a>
<a id='line_1789'>against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand</a>
<a id='line_1790'>of brutish men, and skilful to destroy.</a>
<a id='line_1791'></a>
<a id='line_1792'>21:32 Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the</a>
<a id='line_1793'>midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1794'>have spoken it.</a>
<a id='line_1795'></a>
<a id='line_1796'>22:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 22:2 Now,</a>
<a id='line_1797'>thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city?</a>
<a id='line_1798'>yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.</a>
<a id='line_1799'></a>
<a id='line_1800'>22:3 Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood</a>
<a id='line_1801'>in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against</a>
<a id='line_1802'>herself to defile herself.</a>
<a id='line_1803'></a>
<a id='line_1804'>22:4 Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast</a>
<a id='line_1805'>defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast</a>
<a id='line_1806'>caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years:</a>
<a id='line_1807'>therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking</a>
<a id='line_1808'>to all countries.</a>
<a id='line_1809'></a>
<a id='line_1810'>22:5 Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock</a>
<a id='line_1811'>thee, which art infamous and much vexed.</a>
<a id='line_1812'></a>
<a id='line_1813'>22:6 Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their</a>
<a id='line_1814'>power to shed blood.</a>
<a id='line_1815'></a>
<a id='line_1816'>22:7 In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of</a>
<a id='line_1817'>thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have</a>
<a id='line_1818'>they vexed the fatherless and the widow.</a>
<a id='line_1819'></a>
<a id='line_1820'>22:8 Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my</a>
<a id='line_1821'>sabbaths.</a>
<a id='line_1822'></a>
<a id='line_1823'>22:9 In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they</a>
<a id='line_1824'>eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.</a>
<a id='line_1825'></a>
<a id='line_1826'>22:10 In thee have they discovered their fathers’ nakedness: in thee</a>
<a id='line_1827'>have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.</a>
<a id='line_1828'></a>
<a id='line_1829'>22:11 And one hath committed abomination with his neighbours wife;</a>
<a id='line_1830'>and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in</a>

<a id='line_1832'></a>
<a id='line_1833'>22:12 In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken</a>
<a id='line_1834'>usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by</a>

<a id='line_1836'></a>
<a id='line_1837'>22:13 Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain</a>

<a id='line_1840'></a>
<a id='line_1841'>22:14 Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the</a>

<a id='line_1844'></a>
<a id='line_1845'>22:15 And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in</a>

<a id='line_1848'>22:16 And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of</a>

<a id='line_1850'></a>
<a id='line_1851'>22:17 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 22:18 Son of man,</a>
<a id='line_1852'>the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and</a>
<a id='line_1853'>tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even</a>
<a id='line_1854'>the dross of silver.</a>
<a id='line_1855'></a>
<a id='line_1856'>22:19 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become</a>
<a id='line_1857'>dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of</a>
<a id='line_1858'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1859'></a>
<a id='line_1860'>22:20 As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin,</a>
<a id='line_1861'>into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it;</a>
<a id='line_1862'>so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave</a>
<a id='line_1863'>you there, and melt you.</a>
<a id='line_1864'></a>
<a id='line_1865'>22:21 Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my</a>
<a id='line_1866'>wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst therof.</a>
<a id='line_1867'></a>
<a id='line_1868'>22:22 As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be</a>
<a id='line_1869'>melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have</a>
<a id='line_1870'>poured out my fury upon you.</a>
<a id='line_1871'></a>
<a id='line_1872'>22:23 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 22:24 Son of man,</a>
<a id='line_1873'>say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon</a>
<a id='line_1874'>in the day of indignation.</a>
<a id='line_1875'></a>
<a id='line_1876'>22:25 There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like</a>
<a id='line_1877'>a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have</a>
<a id='line_1878'>taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows</a>
<a id='line_1879'>in the midst thereof.</a>
<a id='line_1880'></a>
<a id='line_1881'>22:26 Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy</a>
<a id='line_1882'>things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane,</a>
<a id='line_1883'>neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean,</a>
<a id='line_1884'>and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among</a>
<a id='line_1885'>them.</a>
<a id='line_1886'></a>
<a id='line_1887'>22:27 Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the</a>
<a id='line_1888'>prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.</a>
<a id='line_1889'></a>
<a id='line_1890'>22:28 And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing</a>
<a id='line_1891'>vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD,</a>
<a id='line_1892'>when the LORD hath not spoken.</a>
<a id='line_1893'></a>
<a id='line_1894'>22:29 The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised</a>
<a id='line_1895'>robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed</a>
<a id='line_1896'>the stranger wrongfully.</a>
<a id='line_1897'></a>
<a id='line_1898'>22:30 And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the</a>
<a id='line_1899'>hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not</a>
<a id='line_1900'>destroy it: but I found none.</a>
<a id='line_1901'></a>
<a id='line_1902'>22:31 Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have</a>
<a id='line_1903'>consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I</a>
<a id='line_1904'>recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_1905'></a>
<a id='line_1906'>23:1 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 23:2 Son of man,</a>
<a id='line_1907'>there were two women, the daughters of one mother: 23:3 And they</a>
<a id='line_1908'>committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth:</a>
<a id='line_1909'>there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of</a>
<a id='line_1910'>their virginity.</a>
<a id='line_1911'></a>
<a id='line_1912'>23:4 And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her</a>
<a id='line_1913'>sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus</a>
<a id='line_1914'>were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.</a>
<a id='line_1915'></a>
<a id='line_1916'>23:5 And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on</a>
<a id='line_1917'>her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours, 23:6 Which were clothed</a>
<a id='line_1918'>with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men,</a>
<a id='line_1919'>horsemen riding upon horses.</a>
<a id='line_1920'></a>
<a id='line_1921'>23:7 Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that</a>
<a id='line_1922'>were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with</a>
<a id='line_1923'>all their idols she defiled herself.</a>
<a id='line_1924'></a>
<a id='line_1925'>23:8 Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her</a>
<a id='line_1926'>youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her</a>
<a id='line_1927'>virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.</a>
<a id='line_1928'></a>
<a id='line_1929'>23:9 Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into</a>
<a id='line_1930'>the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.</a>
<a id='line_1931'></a>
<a id='line_1932'>23:10 These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her</a>
<a id='line_1933'>daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among</a>
<a id='line_1934'>women; for they had executed judgment upon her.</a>
<a id='line_1935'></a>
<a id='line_1936'>23:11 And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in</a>
<a id='line_1937'>her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her</a>
<a id='line_1938'>sister in her whoredoms.</a>
<a id='line_1939'></a>
<a id='line_1940'>23:12 She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers</a>
<a id='line_1941'>clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them</a>
<a id='line_1942'>desirable young men.</a>
<a id='line_1943'></a>
<a id='line_1944'>23:13 Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,</a>
<a id='line_1945'>23:14 And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men</a>
<a id='line_1946'>pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with</a>
<a id='line_1947'>vermilion, 23:15 Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in</a>
<a id='line_1948'>dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after</a>
<a id='line_1949'>the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:</a>
<a id='line_1950'>23:16 And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them,</a>
<a id='line_1951'>and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.</a>
<a id='line_1952'></a>
<a id='line_1953'>23:17 And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they</a>
<a id='line_1954'>defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and</a>
<a id='line_1955'>her mind was alienated from them.</a>
<a id='line_1956'></a>
<a id='line_1957'>23:18 So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness:</a>
<a id='line_1958'>then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated</a>
<a id='line_1959'>from her sister.</a>
<a id='line_1960'></a>
<a id='line_1961'>23:19 Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the</a>
<a id='line_1962'>days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of</a>
<a id='line_1963'>Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1964'></a>
<a id='line_1965'>23:20 For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh</a>
<a id='line_1966'>of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.</a>
<a id='line_1967'></a>
<a id='line_1968'>23:21 Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in</a>
<a id='line_1969'>bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.</a>
<a id='line_1970'></a>
<a id='line_1971'>23:22 Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will</a>
<a id='line_1972'>raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and</a>
<a id='line_1973'>I will bring them against thee on every side; 23:23 The Babylonians,</a>
<a id='line_1974'>and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians</a>
<a id='line_1975'>with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great</a>
<a id='line_1976'>lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.</a>
<a id='line_1977'></a>
<a id='line_1978'>23:24 And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and</a>
<a id='line_1979'>wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee</a>
<a id='line_1980'>buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment</a>
<a id='line_1981'>before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.</a>
<a id='line_1982'></a>
<a id='line_1983'>23:25 And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal</a>
<a id='line_1984'>furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and</a>
<a id='line_1985'>thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy</a>
<a id='line_1986'>daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.</a>
<a id='line_1987'></a>
<a id='line_1988'>23:26 They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy</a>
<a id='line_1989'>fair jewels.</a>
<a id='line_1990'></a>
<a id='line_1991'>23:27 Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy</a>
<a id='line_1992'>whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift</a>
<a id='line_1993'>up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.</a>
<a id='line_1994'></a>
<a id='line_1995'>23:28 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into</a>
<a id='line_1996'>the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy</a>
<a id='line_1997'>mind is alienated: 23:29 And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and</a>
<a id='line_1998'>shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare:</a>
<a id='line_1999'>and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy</a>
<a id='line_2000'>lewdness and thy whoredoms.</a>
<a id='line_2001'></a>
<a id='line_2002'>23:30 I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a</a>
<a id='line_2003'>whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their</a>
<a id='line_2004'>idols.</a>
<a id='line_2005'></a>
<a id='line_2006'>23:31 Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give</a>
<a id='line_2007'>her cup into thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_2008'></a>
<a id='line_2009'>23:32 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup</a>
<a id='line_2010'>deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it</a>
<a id='line_2011'>containeth much.</a>
<a id='line_2012'></a>
<a id='line_2013'>23:33 Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup</a>
<a id='line_2014'>of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.</a>
<a id='line_2015'></a>
<a id='line_2016'>23:34 Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break</a>
<a id='line_2017'>the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken</a>
<a id='line_2018'>it, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_2019'></a>
<a id='line_2020'>23:35 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten</a>
<a id='line_2021'>me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness</a>
<a id='line_2022'>and thy whoredoms.</a>
<a id='line_2023'></a>
<a id='line_2024'>23:36 The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge</a>
<a id='line_2025'>Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations; 23:37</a>
<a id='line_2026'>That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and</a>
<a id='line_2027'>with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused</a>
<a id='line_2028'>their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire,</a>
<a id='line_2029'>to devour them.</a>
<a id='line_2030'></a>
<a id='line_2031'>23:38 Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my</a>
<a id='line_2032'>sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.</a>
<a id='line_2033'></a>
<a id='line_2034'>23:39 For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they</a>
<a id='line_2035'>came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have</a>
<a id='line_2036'>they done in the midst of mine house.</a>
<a id='line_2037'></a>
<a id='line_2038'>23:40 And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far,</a>
<a id='line_2039'>unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou</a>
<a id='line_2040'>didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with</a>
<a id='line_2041'>ornaments, 23:41 And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared</a>
<a id='line_2042'>before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.</a>
<a id='line_2043'></a>
<a id='line_2044'>23:42 And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with</a>
<a id='line_2045'>the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness,</a>
<a id='line_2046'>which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their</a>
<a id='line_2047'>heads.</a>
<a id='line_2048'></a>
<a id='line_2049'>23:43 Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now</a>
<a id='line_2050'>commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?  23:44 Yet they went in</a>
<a id='line_2051'>unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went</a>
<a id='line_2052'>they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.</a>
<a id='line_2053'></a>
<a id='line_2054'>23:45 And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of</a>
<a id='line_2055'>adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because</a>
<a id='line_2056'>they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.</a>
<a id='line_2057'></a>
<a id='line_2058'>23:46 For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon</a>
<a id='line_2059'>them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.</a>
<a id='line_2060'></a>
<a id='line_2061'>23:47 And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them</a>
<a id='line_2062'>with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and</a>
<a id='line_2063'>burn up their houses with fire.</a>
<a id='line_2064'></a>
<a id='line_2065'>23:48 Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all</a>
<a id='line_2066'>women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.</a>
<a id='line_2067'></a>
<a id='line_2068'>23:49 And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall</a>
<a id='line_2069'>bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_2070'></a>
<a id='line_2071'>24:1 Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of</a>
<a id='line_2072'>the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 24:2 Son of man,</a>
<a id='line_2073'>write thee the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of</a>
<a id='line_2074'>Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.</a>
<a id='line_2075'></a>
<a id='line_2076'>24:3 And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them,</a>
<a id='line_2077'>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water</a>
<a id='line_2078'>into it: 24:4 Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good</a>
<a id='line_2079'>piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.</a>
<a id='line_2080'></a>
<a id='line_2081'>24:5 Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it,</a>
<a id='line_2082'>and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.</a>
<a id='line_2083'></a>
<a id='line_2084'>24:6 Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the</a>
<a id='line_2085'>pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring</a>
<a id='line_2086'>it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.</a>
<a id='line_2087'></a>
<a id='line_2088'>24:7 For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of</a>
<a id='line_2089'>a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust; 24:8</a>
<a id='line_2090'>That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her</a>
<a id='line_2091'>blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.</a>
<a id='line_2092'></a>
<a id='line_2093'>24:9 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will</a>
<a id='line_2094'>even make the pile for fire great.</a>
<a id='line_2095'></a>
<a id='line_2096'>24:10 Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it</a>
<a id='line_2097'>well, and let the bones be burned.</a>
<a id='line_2098'></a>
<a id='line_2099'>24:11 Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it</a>
<a id='line_2100'>may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten</a>
<a id='line_2101'>in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.</a>
<a id='line_2102'></a>
<a id='line_2103'>24:12 She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not</a>
<a id='line_2104'>forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.</a>
<a id='line_2105'></a>
<a id='line_2106'>24:13 In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and</a>
<a id='line_2107'>thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any</a>
<a id='line_2108'>more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.</a>
<a id='line_2109'></a>
<a id='line_2110'>24:14 I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do</a>
<a id='line_2111'>it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent;</a>
<a id='line_2112'>according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge</a>
<a id='line_2113'>thee, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_2114'></a>
<a id='line_2115'>24:15 Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 24:16 Son of</a>
<a id='line_2116'>man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a</a>
<a id='line_2117'>stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears</a>
<a id='line_2118'>run down.</a>
<a id='line_2119'></a>
<a id='line_2120'>24:17 Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of</a>
<a id='line_2121'>thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover</a>
<a id='line_2122'>not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.</a>
<a id='line_2123'></a>
<a id='line_2124'>24:18 So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife</a>
<a id='line_2125'>died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.</a>
<a id='line_2126'></a>
<a id='line_2127'>24:19 And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these</a>
<a id='line_2128'>things are to us, that thou doest so?  24:20 Then I answered them, The</a>
<a id='line_2129'>word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 24:21 Speak unto the house of</a>
<a id='line_2130'>Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary,</a>
<a id='line_2131'>the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that</a>
<a id='line_2132'>which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have</a>
<a id='line_2133'>left shall fall by the sword.</a>
<a id='line_2134'></a>
<a id='line_2135'>24:22 And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips,</a>
<a id='line_2136'>nor eat the bread of men.</a>
<a id='line_2137'></a>
<a id='line_2138'>24:23 And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon</a>
<a id='line_2139'>your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for</a>
<a id='line_2140'>your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.</a>
<a id='line_2141'></a>
<a id='line_2142'>24:24 Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath</a>
<a id='line_2143'>done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I am the</a>
<a id='line_2144'>Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_2145'></a>
<a id='line_2146'>24:25 Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take</a>
<a id='line_2147'>from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their</a>
<a id='line_2148'>eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their</a>
<a id='line_2149'>daughters, 24:26 That he that escapeth in that day shall come unto</a>
<a id='line_2150'>thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?  24:27 In that day</a>
<a id='line_2151'>shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_2152'>speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and</a>
<a id='line_2153'>they shall know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2154'></a>
<a id='line_2155'>25:1 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 25:2 Son of man,</a>
<a id='line_2156'>set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them; 25:3</a>
<a id='line_2157'>And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith</a>
<a id='line_2158'>the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it</a>
<a id='line_2159'>was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate;</a>
<a id='line_2160'>and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity; 25:4</a>
<a id='line_2161'>Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a</a>
<a id='line_2162'>possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their</a>
<a id='line_2163'>dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy</a>
<a id='line_2164'>milk.</a>
<a id='line_2165'></a>
<a id='line_2166'>25:5 And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a</a>
<a id='line_2167'>couching place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2168'></a>
<a id='line_2169'>25:6 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine</a>
<a id='line_2170'>hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy</a>
<a id='line_2171'>despite against the land of Israel; 25:7 Behold, therefore I will</a>
<a id='line_2172'>stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to</a>
<a id='line_2173'>the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause</a>
<a id='line_2174'>thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou</a>
<a id='line_2175'>shalt know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2176'></a>
<a id='line_2177'>25:8 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say,</a>
<a id='line_2178'>Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen; 25:9</a>
<a id='line_2179'>Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from</a>
<a id='line_2180'>his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country,</a>
<a id='line_2181'>Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim, 25:10 Unto the men of the</a>
<a id='line_2182'>east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the</a>
<a id='line_2183'>Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.</a>
<a id='line_2184'></a>
<a id='line_2185'>25:11 And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that</a>
<a id='line_2186'>I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2187'></a>
<a id='line_2188'>25:12 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against</a>
<a id='line_2189'>the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and</a>
<a id='line_2190'>revenged himself upon them; 25:13 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I</a>
<a id='line_2191'>will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and</a>
<a id='line_2192'>beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of</a>
<a id='line_2193'>Dedan shall fall by the sword.</a>
<a id='line_2194'></a>
<a id='line_2195'>25:14 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people</a>
<a id='line_2196'>Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and</a>
<a id='line_2197'>according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord</a>
<a id='line_2198'>GOD.</a>
<a id='line_2199'></a>
<a id='line_2200'>25:15 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by</a>
<a id='line_2201'>revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy</a>
<a id='line_2202'>it for the old hatred; 25:16 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD;</a>
<a id='line_2203'>Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will</a>
<a id='line_2204'>cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.</a>
<a id='line_2205'></a>
<a id='line_2206'>25:17 And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious</a>
<a id='line_2207'>rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my</a>
<a id='line_2208'>vengeance upon them.</a>
<a id='line_2209'></a>
<a id='line_2210'>26:1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the</a>
<a id='line_2211'>month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 26:2 Son of</a>
<a id='line_2212'>man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is</a>
<a id='line_2213'>broken that was the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: I</a>
<a id='line_2214'>shall be replenished, now she is laid waste: 26:3 Therefore thus saith</a>
<a id='line_2215'>the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many</a>
<a id='line_2216'>nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come</a>
<a id='line_2217'>up.</a>
<a id='line_2218'></a>
<a id='line_2219'>26:4 And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her</a>
<a id='line_2220'>towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the</a>
<a id='line_2221'>top of a rock.</a>
<a id='line_2222'></a>
<a id='line_2223'>26:5 It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_2224'>sea: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD: and it shall become a</a>
<a id='line_2225'>spoil to the nations.</a>
<a id='line_2226'></a>
<a id='line_2227'>26:6 And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the</a>
<a id='line_2228'>sword; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2229'></a>
<a id='line_2230'>26:7 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus</a>
<a id='line_2231'>Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with</a>
<a id='line_2232'>horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much</a>
<a id='line_2233'>people.</a>
<a id='line_2234'></a>
<a id='line_2235'>26:8 He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he</a>
<a id='line_2236'>shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and</a>
<a id='line_2237'>lift up the buckler against thee.</a>
<a id='line_2238'></a>
<a id='line_2239'>26:9 And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his</a>
<a id='line_2240'>axes he shall break down thy towers.</a>
<a id='line_2241'></a>
<a id='line_2242'>26:10 By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover</a>
<a id='line_2243'>thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the</a>
<a id='line_2244'>wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as</a>
<a id='line_2245'>men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.</a>
<a id='line_2246'></a>
<a id='line_2247'>26:11 With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy</a>
<a id='line_2248'>streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong</a>
<a id='line_2249'>garrisons shall go down to the ground.</a>
<a id='line_2250'></a>
<a id='line_2251'>26:12 And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of</a>
<a id='line_2252'>thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy</a>
<a id='line_2253'>pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy</a>
<a id='line_2254'>dust in the midst of the water.</a>
<a id='line_2255'></a>
<a id='line_2256'>26:13 And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound</a>
<a id='line_2257'>of thy harps shall be no more heard.</a>
<a id='line_2258'></a>
<a id='line_2259'>26:14 And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a</a>
<a id='line_2260'>place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2261'>have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_2262'></a>
<a id='line_2263'>26:15 Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at</a>
<a id='line_2264'>the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is</a>
<a id='line_2265'>made in the midst of thee?  26:16 Then all the princes of the sea</a>
<a id='line_2266'>shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put</a>
<a id='line_2267'>off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with</a>
<a id='line_2268'>trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every</a>
<a id='line_2269'>moment, and be astonished at thee.</a>
<a id='line_2270'></a>
<a id='line_2271'>26:17 And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee,</a>
<a id='line_2272'>How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the</a>
<a id='line_2273'>renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants,</a>
<a id='line_2274'>which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it!  26:18 Now shall</a>
<a id='line_2275'>the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in</a>
<a id='line_2276'>the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.</a>
<a id='line_2277'></a>
<a id='line_2278'>26:19 For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate</a>
<a id='line_2279'>city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up</a>
<a id='line_2280'>the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee; 26:20 When I</a>
<a id='line_2281'>shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the</a>
<a id='line_2282'>people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth,</a>
<a id='line_2283'>in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that</a>
<a id='line_2284'>thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the</a>
<a id='line_2285'>living; 26:21 I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more:</a>
<a id='line_2286'>though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith</a>
<a id='line_2287'>the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_2288'></a>
<a id='line_2289'>27:1 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 27:2 Now, thou</a>
<a id='line_2290'>son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus; 27:3 And say unto Tyrus,</a>
<a id='line_2291'>O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, which art a merchant</a>
<a id='line_2292'>of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou</a>
<a id='line_2293'>hast said, I am of perfect beauty.</a>
<a id='line_2294'></a>
<a id='line_2295'>27:4 Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have</a>
<a id='line_2296'>perfected thy beauty.</a>
<a id='line_2297'></a>
<a id='line_2298'>27:5 They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they</a>

<a id='line_2300'></a>
<a id='line_2301'>27:6 Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of</a>
<a id='line_2302'>the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought out of the isles</a>
<a id='line_2303'>of Chittim.</a>
<a id='line_2304'></a>
<a id='line_2305'>27:7 Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou</a>
<a id='line_2306'>spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of</a>
<a id='line_2307'>Elishah was that which covered thee.</a>
<a id='line_2308'></a>
<a id='line_2309'>27:8 The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise</a>
<a id='line_2310'>men, O Tyrus, that were in thee, were thy pilots.</a>

<a id='line_2315'></a>
<a id='line_2316'>27:10 They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy</a>

<a id='line_2319'></a>
<a id='line_2320'>27:11 The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round</a>

<a id='line_2323'></a>
<a id='line_2324'>27:12 Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind</a>

<a id='line_2336'></a>
<a id='line_2337'>27:16 Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares</a>

<a id='line_2420'>upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their</a>
<a id='line_2421'>swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy</a>
<a id='line_2422'>brightness.</a>
<a id='line_2423'></a>
<a id='line_2424'>28:8 They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the</a>

<a id='line_2426'></a>
<a id='line_2427'>28:9 Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but</a>
<a id='line_2428'>thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee.</a>
<a id='line_2429'></a>
<a id='line_2430'>28:10 Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of</a>
<a id='line_2431'>strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_2432'></a>
<a id='line_2433'>28:11 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 28:12 Son of</a>
<a id='line_2434'>man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him,</a>
<a id='line_2435'>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and</a>
<a id='line_2436'>perfect in beauty.</a>
<a id='line_2437'></a>
<a id='line_2438'>28:13 Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone</a>
<a id='line_2439'>was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the</a>
<a id='line_2440'>onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle,</a>
<a id='line_2441'>and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared</a>
<a id='line_2442'>in thee in the day that thou wast created.</a>
<a id='line_2443'></a>
<a id='line_2444'>28:14 Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee</a>
<a id='line_2445'>so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and</a>
<a id='line_2446'>down in the midst of the stones of fire.</a>
<a id='line_2447'></a>
<a id='line_2448'>28:15 Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast</a>
<a id='line_2449'>created, till iniquity was found in thee.</a>
<a id='line_2450'></a>
<a id='line_2451'>28:16 By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst</a>
<a id='line_2452'>of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast</a>
<a id='line_2453'>thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O</a>
<a id='line_2454'>covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.</a>
<a id='line_2455'></a>
<a id='line_2456'>28:17 Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast</a>
<a id='line_2457'>corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to</a>
<a id='line_2458'>the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.</a>
<a id='line_2459'></a>
<a id='line_2460'>28:18 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine</a>
<a id='line_2461'>iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring</a>
<a id='line_2462'>forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will</a>
<a id='line_2463'>bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that</a>
<a id='line_2464'>behold thee.</a>
<a id='line_2465'></a>
<a id='line_2466'>28:19 All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at</a>
<a id='line_2467'>thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.</a>
<a id='line_2468'></a>
<a id='line_2469'>28:20 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 28:21 Son of</a>
<a id='line_2470'>man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it, 28:22 And</a>
<a id='line_2471'>say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon; and</a>
<a id='line_2472'>I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I</a>

<a id='line_2474'>sanctified in her.</a>
<a id='line_2475'></a>
<a id='line_2476'>28:23 For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets;</a>

<a id='line_2479'></a>
<a id='line_2480'>28:24 And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of</a>

<a id='line_2483'></a>
<a id='line_2484'>28:25 Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of</a>
<a id='line_2485'>Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be</a>
<a id='line_2486'>sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell</a>
<a id='line_2487'>in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.</a>
<a id='line_2488'></a>
<a id='line_2489'>28:26 And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and</a>
<a id='line_2490'>plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have</a>
<a id='line_2491'>executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them;</a>
<a id='line_2492'>and they shall know that I am the LORD their God.</a>
<a id='line_2493'></a>
<a id='line_2494'>29:1 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the</a>
<a id='line_2495'>month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 29:2 Son of man, set</a>
<a id='line_2496'>thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and</a>
<a id='line_2497'>against all Egypt: 29:3 Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD;</a>
<a id='line_2498'>Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon</a>
<a id='line_2499'>that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river is</a>
<a id='line_2500'>mine own, and I have made it for myself.</a>
<a id='line_2501'></a>
<a id='line_2502'>29:4 But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of</a>
<a id='line_2503'>thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of</a>
<a id='line_2504'>the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick</a>
<a id='line_2505'>unto thy scales.</a>
<a id='line_2506'></a>
<a id='line_2507'>29:5 And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all</a>
<a id='line_2508'>the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou</a>
<a id='line_2509'>shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for</a>
<a id='line_2510'>meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.</a>
<a id='line_2511'></a>
<a id='line_2512'>29:6 And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_2513'>because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2514'></a>
<a id='line_2515'>29:7 When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and</a>
<a id='line_2516'>rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest,</a>
<a id='line_2517'>and madest all their loins to be at a stand.</a>
<a id='line_2518'></a>
<a id='line_2519'>29:8 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword</a>
<a id='line_2520'>upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.</a>

<a id='line_2522'>29:9 And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall</a>

<a id='line_2525'></a>
<a id='line_2526'>29:10 Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and</a>

<a id='line_2533'>29:12 And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the</a>

<a id='line_2535'>laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the</a>
<a id='line_2536'>Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the</a>
<a id='line_2537'>countries.</a>
<a id='line_2538'></a>
<a id='line_2539'>29:13 Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I</a>
<a id='line_2540'>gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:</a>
<a id='line_2541'>29:14 And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause</a>
<a id='line_2542'>them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their</a>
<a id='line_2543'>habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_2544'></a>
<a id='line_2545'>29:15 It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt</a>
<a id='line_2546'>itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they</a>
<a id='line_2547'>shall no more rule over the nations.</a>
<a id='line_2548'></a>
<a id='line_2549'>29:16 And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_2550'>which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look</a>
<a id='line_2551'>after them: but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_2552'></a>
<a id='line_2553'>29:17 And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the</a>
<a id='line_2554'>first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came</a>
<a id='line_2555'>unto me, saying, 29:18 Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon</a>
<a id='line_2556'>caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was</a>
<a id='line_2557'>made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his</a>
<a id='line_2558'>army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it: 29:19</a>
<a id='line_2559'>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of</a>
<a id='line_2560'>Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her</a>
<a id='line_2561'>multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the</a>
<a id='line_2562'>wages for his army.</a>
<a id='line_2563'></a>
<a id='line_2564'>29:20 I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he</a>
<a id='line_2565'>served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_2566'></a>
<a id='line_2567'>29:21 In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud</a>
<a id='line_2568'>forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of</a>
<a id='line_2569'>them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2570'></a>
<a id='line_2571'>30:1 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 30:2 Son of man,</a>
<a id='line_2572'>prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Howl ye, Woe worth the day!</a>
<a id='line_2573'>30:3 For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a cloudy</a>
<a id='line_2574'>day; it shall be the time of the heathen.</a>
<a id='line_2575'></a>
<a id='line_2576'>30:4 And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in</a>
<a id='line_2577'>Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away</a>
<a id='line_2578'>her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.</a>
<a id='line_2579'></a>
<a id='line_2580'>30:5 Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and</a>
<a id='line_2581'>Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them</a>
<a id='line_2582'>by the sword.</a>
<a id='line_2583'></a>
<a id='line_2584'>30:6 Thus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and</a>
<a id='line_2585'>the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Syene shall</a>
<a id='line_2586'>they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_2587'></a>
<a id='line_2588'>30:7 And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are</a>
<a id='line_2589'>desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are</a>
<a id='line_2590'>wasted.</a>
<a id='line_2591'></a>
<a id='line_2592'>30:8 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in</a>
<a id='line_2593'>Egypt, and when all her helpers shall be destroyed.</a>
<a id='line_2594'></a>
<a id='line_2595'>30:9 In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make</a>
<a id='line_2596'>the careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon them,</a>
<a id='line_2597'>as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it cometh.</a>
<a id='line_2598'></a>
<a id='line_2599'>30:10 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of Egypt</a>
<a id='line_2600'>to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_2601'></a>
<a id='line_2602'>30:11 He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall</a>
<a id='line_2603'>be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords</a>
<a id='line_2604'>against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.</a>
<a id='line_2605'></a>
<a id='line_2606'>30:12 And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand</a>
<a id='line_2607'>of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is</a>
<a id='line_2608'>therein, by the hand of strangers: I the LORD have spoken it.</a>
<a id='line_2609'></a>
<a id='line_2610'>30:13 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I</a>
<a id='line_2611'>will cause their images to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no</a>
<a id='line_2612'>more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land</a>
<a id='line_2613'>of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_2614'></a>
<a id='line_2615'>30:14 And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and</a>
<a id='line_2616'>will execute judgments in No.</a>
<a id='line_2617'></a>
<a id='line_2618'>30:15 And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I</a>
<a id='line_2619'>will cut off the multitude of No.</a>
<a id='line_2620'></a>
<a id='line_2621'>30:16 And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No</a>
<a id='line_2622'>shall be rent asunder, and Noph shall have distresses daily.</a>
<a id='line_2623'></a>
<a id='line_2624'>30:17 The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword:</a>
<a id='line_2625'>and these cities shall go into captivity.</a>
<a id='line_2626'></a>
<a id='line_2627'>30:18 At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall</a>
<a id='line_2628'>break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall</a>
<a id='line_2629'>cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters</a>
<a id='line_2630'>shall go into captivity.</a>
<a id='line_2631'></a>
<a id='line_2632'>30:19 Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that</a>

<a id='line_2634'></a>
<a id='line_2635'>30:20 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in</a>
<a id='line_2636'>the seventh day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me,</a>
<a id='line_2637'>saying, 30:21 Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of</a>
<a id='line_2638'>Egypt; and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller</a>
<a id='line_2639'>to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword.</a>
<a id='line_2640'></a>
<a id='line_2641'>30:22 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against Pharaoh</a>
<a id='line_2642'>king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was</a>
<a id='line_2643'>broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.</a>
<a id='line_2644'></a>
<a id='line_2645'>30:23 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will</a>
<a id='line_2646'>disperse them through the countries.</a>
<a id='line_2647'></a>
<a id='line_2648'>30:24 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put</a>
<a id='line_2649'>my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh’s arms, and he shall</a>
<a id='line_2650'>groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.</a>
<a id='line_2651'></a>
<a id='line_2652'>30:25 But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the</a>
<a id='line_2653'>arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the</a>
<a id='line_2654'>LORD, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon,</a>
<a id='line_2655'>and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_2656'></a>
<a id='line_2657'>30:26 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse</a>
<a id='line_2658'>them among the countries; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2659'></a>
<a id='line_2660'>31:1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in</a>
<a id='line_2661'>the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me,</a>
<a id='line_2662'>saying, 31:2 Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his</a>
<a id='line_2663'>multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?  31:3 Behold, the</a>
<a id='line_2664'>Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a</a>
<a id='line_2665'>shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the</a>
<a id='line_2666'>thick boughs.</a>
<a id='line_2667'></a>
<a id='line_2668'>31:4 The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her</a>
<a id='line_2669'>rivers running round about his plants, and sent her little rivers unto</a>
<a id='line_2670'>all the trees of the field.</a>
<a id='line_2671'></a>
<a id='line_2672'>31:5 Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the</a>
<a id='line_2673'>field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long</a>
<a id='line_2674'>because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.</a>
<a id='line_2675'></a>
<a id='line_2676'>31:6 All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under</a>
<a id='line_2677'>his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young,</a>
<a id='line_2678'>and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.</a>
<a id='line_2679'></a>
<a id='line_2680'>31:7 Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches:</a>
<a id='line_2681'>for his root was by great waters.</a>
<a id='line_2682'></a>
<a id='line_2683'>31:8 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees</a>
<a id='line_2684'>were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his</a>
<a id='line_2685'>branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his</a>
<a id='line_2686'>beauty.</a>
<a id='line_2687'></a>
<a id='line_2688'>31:9 I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that</a>
<a id='line_2689'>all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.</a>
<a id='line_2690'></a>
<a id='line_2691'>31:10 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up</a>
<a id='line_2692'>thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs,</a>
<a id='line_2693'>and his heart is lifted up in his height; 31:11 I have therefore</a>
<a id='line_2694'>delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall</a>
<a id='line_2695'>surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.</a>
<a id='line_2696'></a>
<a id='line_2697'>31:12 And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off,</a>
<a id='line_2698'>and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his</a>
<a id='line_2699'>branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of</a>
<a id='line_2700'>the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his</a>
<a id='line_2701'>shadow, and have left him.</a>
<a id='line_2702'></a>
<a id='line_2703'>31:13 Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all</a>
<a id='line_2704'>the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches: 31:14 To the end</a>
<a id='line_2705'>that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their</a>
<a id='line_2706'>height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither</a>
<a id='line_2707'>their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they</a>
<a id='line_2708'>are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the</a>
<a id='line_2709'>midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.</a>
<a id='line_2710'></a>
<a id='line_2711'>31:15 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the</a>
<a id='line_2712'>grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I</a>
<a id='line_2713'>restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I</a>
<a id='line_2714'>caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field</a>
<a id='line_2715'>fainted for him.</a>
<a id='line_2716'></a>
<a id='line_2717'>31:16 I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I</a>
<a id='line_2718'>cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the</a>
<a id='line_2719'>trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water,</a>
<a id='line_2720'>shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_2721'></a>
<a id='line_2722'>31:17 They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain</a>
<a id='line_2723'>with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his</a>
<a id='line_2724'>shadow in the midst of the heathen.</a>
<a id='line_2725'></a>
<a id='line_2726'>31:18 To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the</a>
<a id='line_2727'>trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden</a>
<a id='line_2728'>unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_2729'>uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh</a>
<a id='line_2730'>and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_2731'></a>
<a id='line_2732'>32:1 And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in</a>
<a id='line_2733'>the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me,</a>
<a id='line_2734'>saying, 32:2 Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of</a>
<a id='line_2735'>Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations,</a>
<a id='line_2736'>and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy</a>
<a id='line_2737'>rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their</a>
<a id='line_2738'>rivers.</a>
<a id='line_2739'></a>
<a id='line_2740'>32:3 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over</a>
<a id='line_2741'>thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my</a>
<a id='line_2742'>net.</a>
<a id='line_2743'></a>
<a id='line_2744'>32:4 Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon</a>
<a id='line_2745'>the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain</a>
<a id='line_2746'>upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.</a>
<a id='line_2747'></a>
<a id='line_2748'>32:5 And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys</a>
<a id='line_2749'>with thy height.</a>
<a id='line_2750'></a>
<a id='line_2751'>32:6 I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest,</a>
<a id='line_2752'>even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.</a>
<a id='line_2753'></a>
<a id='line_2754'>32:7 And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make</a>
<a id='line_2755'>the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the</a>
<a id='line_2756'>moon shall not give her light.</a>
<a id='line_2757'></a>
<a id='line_2758'>32:8 All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and</a>
<a id='line_2759'>set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_2760'></a>
<a id='line_2761'>32:9 I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy</a>
<a id='line_2762'>destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not</a>
<a id='line_2763'>known.</a>
<a id='line_2764'></a>
<a id='line_2765'>32:10 Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings</a>
<a id='line_2766'>shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword</a>
<a id='line_2767'>before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his</a>
<a id='line_2768'>own life, in the day of thy fall.</a>
<a id='line_2769'></a>
<a id='line_2770'>32:11 For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon</a>
<a id='line_2771'>shall come upon thee.</a>
<a id='line_2772'></a>
<a id='line_2773'>32:12 By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall,</a>
<a id='line_2774'>the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the</a>
<a id='line_2775'>pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.</a>
<a id='line_2776'></a>
<a id='line_2777'>32:13 I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great</a>

<a id='line_2779'>hoofs of beasts trouble them.</a>
<a id='line_2780'></a>
<a id='line_2781'>32:14 Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to</a>
<a id='line_2782'>run like oil, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_2783'></a>
<a id='line_2784'>32:15 When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country</a>
<a id='line_2785'>shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all</a>

<a id='line_2787'></a>
<a id='line_2788'>32:16 This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the</a>
<a id='line_2789'>daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her,</a>

<a id='line_2791'></a>
<a id='line_2792'>32:17 It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day</a>
<a id='line_2793'>of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 32:18</a>
<a id='line_2794'>Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even</a>

<a id='line_2857'></a>
<a id='line_2858'>33:1 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 33:2 Son of man,</a>
<a id='line_2859'>speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring</a>
<a id='line_2860'>the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their</a>
<a id='line_2861'>coasts, and set him for their watchman: 33:3 If when he seeth the</a>
<a id='line_2862'>sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;</a>
<a id='line_2863'>33:4 Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not</a>
<a id='line_2864'>warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon</a>
<a id='line_2865'>his own head.</a>
<a id='line_2866'></a>
<a id='line_2867'>33:5 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his</a>
<a id='line_2868'>blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his</a>
<a id='line_2869'>soul.</a>
<a id='line_2870'></a>
<a id='line_2871'>33:6 But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet,</a>
<a id='line_2872'>and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person</a>
<a id='line_2873'>from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will</a>
<a id='line_2874'>I require at the watchman’s hand.</a>
<a id='line_2875'></a>
<a id='line_2876'>33:7 So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house</a>
<a id='line_2877'>of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn</a>
<a id='line_2878'>them from me.</a>
<a id='line_2879'></a>
<a id='line_2880'>33:8 When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die;</a>
<a id='line_2881'>if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked</a>
<a id='line_2882'>man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine</a>
<a id='line_2883'>hand.</a>
<a id='line_2884'></a>
<a id='line_2885'>33:9 Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it;</a>
<a id='line_2886'>if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou</a>
<a id='line_2887'>hast delivered thy soul.</a>
<a id='line_2888'></a>
<a id='line_2889'>33:10 Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel;</a>
<a id='line_2890'>Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us,</a>
<a id='line_2891'>and we pine away in them, how should we then live?  33:11 Say unto</a>
<a id='line_2892'>them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death</a>
<a id='line_2893'>of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn</a>
<a id='line_2894'>ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of</a>
<a id='line_2895'>Israel?  33:12 Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of</a>
<a id='line_2896'>thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him</a>
<a id='line_2897'>in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked,</a>
<a id='line_2898'>he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his</a>
<a id='line_2899'>wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his</a>
<a id='line_2900'>righteousness in the day that he sinneth.</a>
<a id='line_2901'></a>
<a id='line_2902'>33:13 When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if</a>
<a id='line_2903'>he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his</a>
<a id='line_2904'>righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he</a>
<a id='line_2905'>hath committed, he shall die for it.</a>
<a id='line_2906'></a>
<a id='line_2907'>33:14 Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he</a>
<a id='line_2908'>turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; 33:15 If the</a>
<a id='line_2909'>wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the</a>
<a id='line_2910'>statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live,</a>
<a id='line_2911'>he shall not die.</a>
<a id='line_2912'></a>
<a id='line_2913'>33:16 None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto</a>
<a id='line_2914'>him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely</a>
<a id='line_2915'>live.</a>
<a id='line_2916'></a>
<a id='line_2917'>33:17 Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not</a>
<a id='line_2918'>equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.</a>
<a id='line_2919'></a>
<a id='line_2920'>33:18 When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and</a>
<a id='line_2921'>committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.</a>
<a id='line_2922'></a>
<a id='line_2923'>33:19 But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is</a>
<a id='line_2924'>lawful and right, he shall live thereby.</a>
<a id='line_2925'></a>
<a id='line_2926'>33:20 Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of</a>
<a id='line_2927'>Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.</a>
<a id='line_2928'></a>
<a id='line_2929'>33:21 And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the</a>
<a id='line_2930'>tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped</a>
<a id='line_2931'>out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.</a>
<a id='line_2932'></a>
<a id='line_2933'>33:22 Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he</a>
<a id='line_2934'>that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in</a>
<a id='line_2935'>the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.</a>
<a id='line_2936'></a>
<a id='line_2937'>33:23 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 33:24 Son of</a>
<a id='line_2938'>man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak,</a>
<a id='line_2939'>saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many;</a>
<a id='line_2940'>the land is given us for inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_2941'></a>
<a id='line_2942'>33:25 Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with</a>
<a id='line_2943'>the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood:</a>
<a id='line_2944'>and shall ye possess the land?  33:26 Ye stand upon your sword, ye</a>
<a id='line_2945'>work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbours wife: and</a>
<a id='line_2946'>shall ye possess the land?  33:27 Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith</a>
<a id='line_2947'>the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall</a>
<a id='line_2948'>by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the</a>
<a id='line_2949'>beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves</a>
<a id='line_2950'>shall die of the pestilence.</a>
<a id='line_2951'></a>
<a id='line_2952'>33:28 For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her</a>
<a id='line_2953'>strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate,</a>
<a id='line_2954'>that none shall pass through.</a>
<a id='line_2955'></a>
<a id='line_2956'>33:29 Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the</a>
<a id='line_2957'>land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have</a>
<a id='line_2958'>committed.</a>
<a id='line_2959'></a>
<a id='line_2960'>33:30 Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are</a>
<a id='line_2961'>talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and</a>
<a id='line_2962'>speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray</a>
<a id='line_2963'>you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2964'></a>
<a id='line_2965'>33:31 And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit</a>
<a id='line_2966'>before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not</a>
<a id='line_2967'>do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart</a>
<a id='line_2968'>goeth after their covetousness.</a>
<a id='line_2969'></a>
<a id='line_2970'>33:32 And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that</a>
<a id='line_2971'>hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they</a>
<a id='line_2972'>hear thy words, but they do them not.</a>
<a id='line_2973'></a>
<a id='line_2974'>33:33 And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall</a>
<a id='line_2975'>they know that a prophet hath been among them.</a>
<a id='line_2976'></a>
<a id='line_2977'>34:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 34:2 Son of man,</a>
<a id='line_2978'>prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them,</a>
<a id='line_2979'>Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of</a>
<a id='line_2980'>Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the</a>
<a id='line_2981'>flocks?  34:3 Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill</a>
<a id='line_2982'>them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock.</a>
<a id='line_2983'></a>
<a id='line_2984'>34:4 The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed</a>
<a id='line_2985'>that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken,</a>
<a id='line_2986'>neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have</a>
<a id='line_2987'>ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye</a>
<a id='line_2988'>ruled them.</a>
<a id='line_2989'></a>
<a id='line_2990'>34:5 And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they</a>
<a id='line_2991'>became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.</a>
<a id='line_2992'></a>
<a id='line_2993'>34:6 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high</a>
<a id='line_2994'>hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and</a>
<a id='line_2995'>none did search or seek after them.</a>
<a id='line_2996'></a>
<a id='line_2997'>34:7 Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; 34:8 As I</a>
<a id='line_2998'>live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and</a>
<a id='line_2999'>my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no</a>
<a id='line_3000'>shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the</a>
<a id='line_3001'>shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock; 34:9 Therefore, O ye</a>
<a id='line_3002'>shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; 34:10 Thus saith the Lord GOD;</a>
<a id='line_3003'>Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at</a>
<a id='line_3004'>their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither</a>
<a id='line_3005'>shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my</a>
<a id='line_3006'>flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.</a>
<a id='line_3007'></a>
<a id='line_3008'>34:11 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search</a>
<a id='line_3009'>my sheep, and seek them out.</a>
<a id='line_3010'></a>
<a id='line_3011'>34:12 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among</a>
<a id='line_3012'>his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will</a>
<a id='line_3013'>deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the</a>
<a id='line_3014'>cloudy and dark day.</a>
<a id='line_3015'></a>
<a id='line_3016'>34:13 And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from</a>
<a id='line_3017'>the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them</a>
<a id='line_3018'>upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited</a>
<a id='line_3019'>places of the country.</a>
<a id='line_3020'></a>
<a id='line_3021'>34:14 I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains</a>
<a id='line_3022'>of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold,</a>
<a id='line_3023'>and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3024'></a>
<a id='line_3025'>34:15 I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith</a>
<a id='line_3026'>the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_3027'></a>
<a id='line_3028'>34:16 I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was</a>
<a id='line_3029'>driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will</a>
<a id='line_3030'>strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the</a>
<a id='line_3031'>strong; I will feed them with judgment.</a>
<a id='line_3032'></a>
<a id='line_3033'>34:17 And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I</a>
<a id='line_3034'>judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.</a>
<a id='line_3035'></a>
<a id='line_3036'>34:18 Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good</a>
<a id='line_3037'>pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your</a>
<a id='line_3038'>pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the</a>
<a id='line_3039'>residue with your feet?  34:19 And as for my flock, they eat that</a>
<a id='line_3040'>which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye</a>
<a id='line_3041'>have fouled with your feet.</a>
<a id='line_3042'></a>
<a id='line_3043'>34:20 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even I,</a>
<a id='line_3044'>will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.</a>
<a id='line_3045'></a>
<a id='line_3046'>34:21 Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed</a>
<a id='line_3047'>all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;</a>
<a id='line_3048'>34:22 Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a</a>
<a id='line_3049'>prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.</a>
<a id='line_3050'></a>
<a id='line_3051'>34:23 And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed</a>
<a id='line_3052'>them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their</a>
<a id='line_3053'>shepherd.</a>
<a id='line_3054'></a>
<a id='line_3055'>34:24 And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince</a>
<a id='line_3056'>among them; I the LORD have spoken it.</a>
<a id='line_3057'></a>
<a id='line_3058'>34:25 And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause</a>
<a id='line_3059'>the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely</a>
<a id='line_3060'>in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.</a>
<a id='line_3061'></a>
<a id='line_3062'>34:26 And I will make them and the places round about my hill a</a>
<a id='line_3063'>blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season;</a>
<a id='line_3064'>there shall be showers of blessing.</a>
<a id='line_3065'></a>
<a id='line_3066'>34:27 And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth</a>
<a id='line_3067'>shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and</a>
<a id='line_3068'>shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their</a>
<a id='line_3069'>yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served</a>
<a id='line_3070'>themselves of them.</a>
<a id='line_3071'></a>
<a id='line_3072'>34:28 And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall</a>
<a id='line_3073'>the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and</a>
<a id='line_3074'>none shall make them afraid.</a>
<a id='line_3075'></a>
<a id='line_3076'>34:29 And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall</a>
<a id='line_3077'>be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of</a>
<a id='line_3078'>the heathen any more.</a>
<a id='line_3079'></a>
<a id='line_3080'>34:30 Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and</a>
<a id='line_3081'>that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord</a>
<a id='line_3082'>GOD.</a>
<a id='line_3083'></a>
<a id='line_3084'>34:31 And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your</a>
<a id='line_3085'>God, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_3086'></a>
<a id='line_3087'>35:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 35:2 Son of</a>
<a id='line_3088'>man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it, 35:3</a>
<a id='line_3089'>And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I am</a>
<a id='line_3090'>against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I</a>
<a id='line_3091'>will make thee most desolate.</a>
<a id='line_3092'></a>
<a id='line_3093'>35:4 I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou</a>
<a id='line_3094'>shalt know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3095'></a>
<a id='line_3096'>35:5 Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood</a>
<a id='line_3097'>of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of</a>
<a id='line_3098'>their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end: 35:6</a>
<a id='line_3099'>Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto</a>
<a id='line_3100'>blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood,</a>
<a id='line_3101'>even blood shall pursue thee.</a>
<a id='line_3102'></a>
<a id='line_3103'>35:7 Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it</a>
<a id='line_3104'>him that passeth out and him that returneth.</a>
<a id='line_3105'></a>
<a id='line_3106'>35:8 And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills,</a>
<a id='line_3107'>and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are</a>
<a id='line_3108'>slain with the sword.</a>
<a id='line_3109'></a>
<a id='line_3110'>35:9 I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not</a>
<a id='line_3111'>return: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3112'></a>
<a id='line_3113'>35:10 Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two</a>
<a id='line_3114'>countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was</a>
<a id='line_3115'>there: 35:11 Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do</a>
<a id='line_3116'>according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast</a>
<a id='line_3117'>used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known</a>
<a id='line_3118'>among them, when I have judged thee.</a>
<a id='line_3119'></a>
<a id='line_3120'>35:12 And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard</a>
<a id='line_3121'>all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of</a>
<a id='line_3122'>Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.</a>
<a id='line_3123'></a>
<a id='line_3124'>35:13 Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have</a>
<a id='line_3125'>multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.</a>
<a id='line_3126'></a>
<a id='line_3127'>35:14 Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will</a>
<a id='line_3128'>make thee desolate.</a>
<a id='line_3129'></a>
<a id='line_3130'>35:15 As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_3131'>because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be</a>
<a id='line_3132'>desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall</a>
<a id='line_3133'>know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3134'></a>
<a id='line_3135'>36:1 Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and</a>
<a id='line_3136'>say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD: 36:2 Thus</a>
<a id='line_3137'>saith the Lord GOD; Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha, even</a>
<a id='line_3138'>the ancient high places are ours in possession: 36:3 Therefore</a>
<a id='line_3139'>prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they have made you</a>
<a id='line_3140'>desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a</a>
<a id='line_3141'>possession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in the</a>
<a id='line_3142'>lips of talkers, and are an infamy of the people: 36:4 Therefore, ye</a>
<a id='line_3143'>mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the</a>
<a id='line_3144'>Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the</a>
<a id='line_3145'>valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken,</a>
<a id='line_3146'>which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that</a>
<a id='line_3147'>are round about; 36:5 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the</a>
<a id='line_3148'>fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen,</a>
<a id='line_3149'>and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their</a>
<a id='line_3150'>possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to</a>
<a id='line_3151'>cast it out for a prey.</a>
<a id='line_3152'></a>
<a id='line_3153'>36:6 Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto</a>
<a id='line_3154'>the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys,</a>
<a id='line_3155'>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in</a>
<a id='line_3156'>my fury, because ye have borne the shame of the heathen: 36:7</a>
<a id='line_3157'>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely</a>
<a id='line_3158'>the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their shame.</a>
<a id='line_3159'></a>
<a id='line_3160'>36:8 But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your</a>
<a id='line_3161'>branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at</a>
<a id='line_3162'>hand to come.</a>
<a id='line_3163'></a>
<a id='line_3164'>36:9 For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall</a>
<a id='line_3165'>be tilled and sown: 36:10 And I will multiply men upon you, all the</a>
<a id='line_3166'>house of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited,</a>
<a id='line_3167'>and the wastes shall be builded: 36:11 And I will multiply upon you</a>
<a id='line_3168'>man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will</a>
<a id='line_3169'>settle you after your old estates, and will do better unto you than at</a>
<a id='line_3170'>your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3171'></a>
<a id='line_3172'>36:12 Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel;</a>
<a id='line_3173'>and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and</a>
<a id='line_3174'>thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men.</a>
<a id='line_3175'></a>
<a id='line_3176'>36:13 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou land</a>
<a id='line_3177'>devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations: 36:14 Therefore thou</a>
<a id='line_3178'>shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith</a>
<a id='line_3179'>the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_3180'></a>
<a id='line_3181'>36:15 Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the</a>
<a id='line_3182'>heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people</a>
<a id='line_3183'>any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith</a>
<a id='line_3184'>the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_3185'></a>
<a id='line_3186'>36:16 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 36:17 Son of</a>
<a id='line_3187'>man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it</a>
<a id='line_3188'>by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the</a>
<a id='line_3189'>uncleanness of a removed woman.</a>
<a id='line_3190'></a>
<a id='line_3191'>36:18 Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had</a>
<a id='line_3192'>shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted</a>
<a id='line_3193'>it: 36:19 And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were</a>
<a id='line_3194'>dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according</a>
<a id='line_3195'>to their doings I judged them.</a>
<a id='line_3196'></a>
<a id='line_3197'>36:20 And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they</a>
<a id='line_3198'>profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of</a>
<a id='line_3199'>the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.</a>
<a id='line_3200'></a>
<a id='line_3201'>36:21 But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had</a>
<a id='line_3202'>profaned among the heathen, whither they went.</a>
<a id='line_3203'></a>
<a id='line_3204'>36:22 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD;</a>
<a id='line_3205'>I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy</a>
<a id='line_3206'>name’s sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye</a>
<a id='line_3207'>went.</a>
<a id='line_3208'></a>
<a id='line_3209'>36:23 And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the</a>
<a id='line_3210'>heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen</a>
<a id='line_3211'>shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be</a>
<a id='line_3212'>sanctified in you before their eyes.</a>
<a id='line_3213'></a>
<a id='line_3214'>36:24 For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out</a>
<a id='line_3215'>of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.</a>
<a id='line_3216'></a>
<a id='line_3217'>36:25 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be</a>
<a id='line_3218'>clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I</a>
<a id='line_3219'>cleanse you.</a>
<a id='line_3220'></a>
<a id='line_3221'>36:26 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put</a>
<a id='line_3222'>within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh,</a>
<a id='line_3223'>and I will give you an heart of flesh.</a>
<a id='line_3224'></a>
<a id='line_3225'>36:27 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my</a>
<a id='line_3226'>statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.</a>
<a id='line_3227'></a>
<a id='line_3228'>36:28 And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and</a>
<a id='line_3229'>ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</a>
<a id='line_3230'></a>
<a id='line_3231'>36:29 I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will</a>
<a id='line_3232'>call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.</a>
<a id='line_3233'></a>
<a id='line_3234'>36:30 And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of</a>
<a id='line_3235'>the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the</a>
<a id='line_3236'>heathen.</a>
<a id='line_3237'></a>
<a id='line_3238'>36:31 Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that</a>
<a id='line_3239'>were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your</a>
<a id='line_3240'>iniquities and for your abominations.</a>
<a id='line_3241'></a>
<a id='line_3242'>36:32 Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known</a>
<a id='line_3243'>unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of</a>
<a id='line_3244'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3245'></a>
<a id='line_3246'>36:33 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed</a>
<a id='line_3247'>you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the</a>
<a id='line_3248'>cities, and the wastes shall be builded.</a>
<a id='line_3249'></a>
<a id='line_3250'>36:34 And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate</a>
<a id='line_3251'>in the sight of all that passed by.</a>
<a id='line_3252'></a>
<a id='line_3253'>36:35 And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like</a>
<a id='line_3254'>the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are</a>
<a id='line_3255'>become fenced, and are inhabited.</a>
<a id='line_3256'></a>
<a id='line_3257'>36:36 Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I</a>
<a id='line_3258'>the LORD build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I</a>
<a id='line_3259'>the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.</a>
<a id='line_3260'></a>
<a id='line_3261'>36:37 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by</a>
<a id='line_3262'>the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men</a>
<a id='line_3263'>like a flock.</a>
<a id='line_3264'></a>
<a id='line_3265'>36:38 As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn</a>
<a id='line_3266'>feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and</a>
<a id='line_3267'>they shall know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3268'></a>
<a id='line_3269'>37:1 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the</a>
<a id='line_3270'>spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which</a>
<a id='line_3271'>was full of bones, 37:2 And caused me to pass by them round about:</a>
<a id='line_3272'>and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they</a>
<a id='line_3273'>were very dry.</a>
<a id='line_3274'></a>
<a id='line_3275'>37:3 And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I</a>
<a id='line_3276'>answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.</a>
<a id='line_3277'></a>
<a id='line_3278'>37:4 Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto</a>
<a id='line_3279'>them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3280'></a>
<a id='line_3281'>37:5 Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause</a>
<a id='line_3282'>breath to enter into you, and ye shall live: 37:6 And I will lay</a>
<a id='line_3283'>sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with</a>
<a id='line_3284'>skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that</a>
<a id='line_3285'>I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3286'></a>
<a id='line_3287'>37:7 So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there</a>
<a id='line_3288'>was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone</a>
<a id='line_3289'>to his bone.</a>
<a id='line_3290'></a>
<a id='line_3291'>37:8 And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon</a>
<a id='line_3292'>them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in</a>
<a id='line_3293'>them.</a>
<a id='line_3294'></a>
<a id='line_3295'>37:9 Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of</a>
<a id='line_3296'>man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four</a>
<a id='line_3297'>winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.</a>
<a id='line_3298'></a>
<a id='line_3299'>37:10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into</a>
<a id='line_3300'>them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great</a>
<a id='line_3301'>army.</a>
<a id='line_3302'></a>
<a id='line_3303'>37:11 Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole</a>
<a id='line_3304'>house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope</a>
<a id='line_3305'>is lost: we are cut off for our parts.</a>
<a id='line_3306'></a>
<a id='line_3307'>37:12 Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;</a>
<a id='line_3308'>Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up</a>
<a id='line_3309'>out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3310'></a>
<a id='line_3311'>37:13 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your</a>
<a id='line_3312'>graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, 37:14 And</a>
<a id='line_3313'>shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you</a>
<a id='line_3314'>in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it,</a>
<a id='line_3315'>and performed it, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3316'></a>
<a id='line_3317'>37:15 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 37:16 Moreover,</a>
<a id='line_3318'>thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah,</a>
<a id='line_3319'>and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another</a>
<a id='line_3320'>stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and for all</a>
<a id='line_3321'>the house of Israel his companions: 37:17 And join them one to another</a>
<a id='line_3322'>into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_3323'></a>
<a id='line_3324'>37:18 And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee,</a>
<a id='line_3325'>saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?  37:19 Say</a>
<a id='line_3326'>unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of</a>
<a id='line_3327'>Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his</a>
<a id='line_3328'>fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and</a>
<a id='line_3329'>make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.</a>
<a id='line_3330'></a>
<a id='line_3331'>37:20 And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand</a>
<a id='line_3332'>before their eyes.</a>
<a id='line_3333'></a>
<a id='line_3334'>37:21 And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take</a>
<a id='line_3335'>the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone,</a>
<a id='line_3336'>and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own</a>
<a id='line_3337'>land: 37:22 And I will make them one nation in the land upon the</a>
<a id='line_3338'>mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they</a>
<a id='line_3339'>shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two</a>
<a id='line_3340'>kingdoms any more at all.</a>
<a id='line_3341'></a>
<a id='line_3342'>37:23 Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols,</a>
<a id='line_3343'>nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their</a>
<a id='line_3344'>transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces,</a>
<a id='line_3345'>wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my</a>
<a id='line_3346'>people, and I will be their God.</a>
<a id='line_3347'></a>
<a id='line_3348'>37:24 And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall</a>
<a id='line_3349'>have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe</a>
<a id='line_3350'>my statutes, and do them.</a>
<a id='line_3351'></a>
<a id='line_3352'>37:25 And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my</a>
<a id='line_3353'>servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell</a>
<a id='line_3354'>therein, even they, and their children, and their children’s children</a>
<a id='line_3355'>for ever: and my servant David shall be their prince for ever.</a>
<a id='line_3356'></a>
<a id='line_3357'>37:26 Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be</a>
<a id='line_3358'>an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply</a>

<a id='line_3360'></a>
<a id='line_3361'>37:27 My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God,</a>

<a id='line_3366'></a>
<a id='line_3367'>38:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 38:2 Son of man,</a>
<a id='line_3368'>set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of</a>
<a id='line_3369'>Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him, 38:3 And say, Thus saith</a>
<a id='line_3370'>the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of</a>
<a id='line_3371'>Meshech and Tubal: 38:4 And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into</a>
<a id='line_3372'>thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and</a>
<a id='line_3373'>horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a great</a>
<a id='line_3374'>company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords: 38:5</a>
<a id='line_3375'>Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and</a>
<a id='line_3376'>helmet: 38:6 Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the</a>
<a id='line_3377'>north quarters, and all his bands: and many people with thee.</a>
<a id='line_3378'></a>
<a id='line_3379'>38:7 Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy</a>
<a id='line_3380'>company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.</a>
<a id='line_3381'></a>
<a id='line_3382'>38:8 After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou</a>
<a id='line_3383'>shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is</a>
<a id='line_3384'>gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which</a>
<a id='line_3385'>have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations,</a>
<a id='line_3386'>and they shall dwell safely all of them.</a>
<a id='line_3387'></a>
<a id='line_3388'>38:9 Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a</a>
<a id='line_3389'>cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with</a>
<a id='line_3390'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_3391'></a>
<a id='line_3392'>38:10 Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at the</a>
<a id='line_3393'>same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an</a>
<a id='line_3394'>evil thought: 38:11 And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of</a>
<a id='line_3395'>unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell</a>
<a id='line_3396'>safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars</a>
<a id='line_3397'>nor gates, 38:12 To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine</a>
<a id='line_3398'>hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the</a>
<a id='line_3399'>people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle</a>
<a id='line_3400'>and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.</a>
<a id='line_3401'></a>
<a id='line_3402'>38:13 Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the</a>

<a id='line_3405'>silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?</a>
<a id='line_3406'>38:14 Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the</a>
<a id='line_3407'>Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt</a>
<a id='line_3408'>thou not know it?  38:15 And thou shalt come from thy place out of the</a>
<a id='line_3409'>north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon</a>
<a id='line_3410'>horses, a great company, and a mighty army: 38:16 And thou shalt come</a>
<a id='line_3411'>up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall</a>
<a id='line_3412'>be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the</a>
<a id='line_3413'>heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before</a>
<a id='line_3414'>their eyes.</a>
<a id='line_3415'></a>
<a id='line_3416'>38:17 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in</a>
<a id='line_3417'>old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in</a>
<a id='line_3418'>those days many years that I would bring thee against them?  38:18 And</a>
<a id='line_3419'>it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the</a>
<a id='line_3420'>land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, that my fury shall come up in my</a>
<a id='line_3421'>face.</a>
<a id='line_3422'></a>
<a id='line_3423'>38:19 For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken,</a>
<a id='line_3424'>Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of</a>
<a id='line_3425'>Israel; 38:20 So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the</a>
<a id='line_3426'>heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that</a>
<a id='line_3427'>creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the</a>
<a id='line_3428'>earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown</a>
<a id='line_3429'>down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to</a>
<a id='line_3430'>the ground.</a>
<a id='line_3431'></a>
<a id='line_3432'>38:21 And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my</a>
<a id='line_3433'>mountains, saith the Lord GOD: every man’s sword shall be against his</a>
<a id='line_3434'>brother.</a>
<a id='line_3435'></a>
<a id='line_3436'>38:22 And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and</a>
<a id='line_3437'>I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people</a>
<a id='line_3438'>that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire,</a>
<a id='line_3439'>and brimstone.</a>
<a id='line_3440'></a>
<a id='line_3441'>38:23 Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be</a>
<a id='line_3442'>known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the</a>
<a id='line_3443'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3444'></a>
<a id='line_3445'>39:1 Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus</a>
<a id='line_3446'>saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince</a>
<a id='line_3447'>of Meshech and Tubal: 39:2 And I will turn thee back, and leave but</a>
<a id='line_3448'>the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north</a>
<a id='line_3449'>parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel: 39:3 And I</a>
<a id='line_3450'>will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows</a>
<a id='line_3451'>to fall out of thy right hand.</a>
<a id='line_3452'></a>
<a id='line_3453'>39:4 Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy</a>
<a id='line_3454'>bands, and the people that is with thee: I will give thee unto the</a>
<a id='line_3455'>ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be</a>
<a id='line_3456'>devoured.</a>
<a id='line_3457'></a>
<a id='line_3458'>39:5 Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith</a>
<a id='line_3459'>the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_3460'></a>
<a id='line_3461'>39:6 And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell</a>
<a id='line_3462'>carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3463'></a>
<a id='line_3464'>39:7 So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people</a>
<a id='line_3465'>Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more: and the</a>
<a id='line_3466'>heathen shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3467'></a>
<a id='line_3468'>39:8 Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this is</a>
<a id='line_3469'>the day whereof I have spoken.</a>
<a id='line_3470'></a>
<a id='line_3471'>39:9 And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and</a>
<a id='line_3472'>shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the</a>
<a id='line_3473'>bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears,</a>
<a id='line_3474'>and they shall burn them with fire seven years: 39:10 So that they</a>
<a id='line_3475'>shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the</a>
<a id='line_3476'>forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall</a>
<a id='line_3477'>spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, saith</a>
<a id='line_3478'>the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_3479'></a>
<a id='line_3480'>39:11 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog</a>
<a id='line_3481'>a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the</a>
<a id='line_3482'>east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers: and</a>
<a id='line_3483'>there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call</a>
<a id='line_3484'>it The valley of Hamongog.</a>
<a id='line_3485'></a>
<a id='line_3486'>39:12 And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them,</a>
<a id='line_3487'>that they may cleanse the land.</a>
<a id='line_3488'></a>
<a id='line_3489'>39:13 Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be</a>
<a id='line_3490'>to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord</a>
<a id='line_3491'>GOD.</a>
<a id='line_3492'></a>
<a id='line_3493'>39:14 And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing</a>
<a id='line_3494'>through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon</a>
<a id='line_3495'>the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months</a>
<a id='line_3496'>shall they search.</a>
<a id='line_3497'></a>
<a id='line_3498'>39:15 And the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth a</a>
<a id='line_3499'>man’s bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have</a>
<a id='line_3500'>buried it in the valley of Hamongog.</a>
<a id='line_3501'></a>
<a id='line_3502'>39:16 And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they</a>
<a id='line_3503'>cleanse the land.</a>
<a id='line_3504'></a>
<a id='line_3505'>39:17 And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto every</a>
<a id='line_3506'>feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves,</a>
<a id='line_3507'>and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do</a>
<a id='line_3508'>sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of</a>
<a id='line_3509'>Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood.</a>
<a id='line_3510'></a>
<a id='line_3511'>39:18 Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the</a>
<a id='line_3512'>princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks,</a>
<a id='line_3513'>all of them fatlings of Bashan.</a>
<a id='line_3514'></a>
<a id='line_3515'>39:19 And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be</a>
<a id='line_3516'>drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.</a>
<a id='line_3517'></a>
<a id='line_3518'>39:20 Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots,</a>
<a id='line_3519'>with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_3520'></a>
<a id='line_3521'>39:21 And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen</a>
<a id='line_3522'>shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have</a>
<a id='line_3523'>laid upon them.</a>
<a id='line_3524'></a>
<a id='line_3525'>39:22 So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God</a>
<a id='line_3526'>from that day and forward.</a>
<a id='line_3527'></a>
<a id='line_3528'>39:23 And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into</a>
<a id='line_3529'>captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me,</a>
<a id='line_3530'>therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of</a>
<a id='line_3531'>their enemies: so fell they all by the sword.</a>
<a id='line_3532'></a>
<a id='line_3533'>39:24 According to their uncleanness and according to their</a>
<a id='line_3534'>transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.</a>
<a id='line_3535'></a>
<a id='line_3536'>39:25 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the</a>
<a id='line_3537'>captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and</a>
<a id='line_3538'>will be jealous for my holy name; 39:26 After that they have borne</a>
<a id='line_3539'>their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed</a>
<a id='line_3540'>against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made them</a>
<a id='line_3541'>afraid.</a>
<a id='line_3542'></a>
<a id='line_3543'>39:27 When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered</a>
<a id='line_3544'>them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the</a>
<a id='line_3545'>sight of many nations; 39:28 Then shall they know that I am the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3546'>their God, which caused them to be led into captivity among the</a>
<a id='line_3547'>heathen: but I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left</a>
<a id='line_3548'>none of them any more there.</a>
<a id='line_3549'></a>
<a id='line_3550'>39:29 Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have</a>
<a id='line_3551'>poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_3552'></a>
<a id='line_3553'>40:1 In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning</a>
<a id='line_3554'>of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year</a>
<a id='line_3555'>after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_3556'>LORD was upon me, and brought me thither.</a>
<a id='line_3557'></a>
<a id='line_3558'>40:2 In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and</a>
<a id='line_3559'>set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city</a>
<a id='line_3560'>on the south.</a>
<a id='line_3561'></a>
<a id='line_3562'>40:3 And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose</a>
<a id='line_3563'>appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in</a>
<a id='line_3564'>his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.</a>
<a id='line_3565'></a>
<a id='line_3566'>40:4 And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and</a>
<a id='line_3567'>hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew</a>
<a id='line_3568'>thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou</a>
<a id='line_3569'>brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3570'></a>
<a id='line_3571'>40:5 And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in</a>
<a id='line_3572'>the man’s hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an</a>
<a id='line_3573'>hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed;</a>
<a id='line_3574'>and the height, one reed.</a>
<a id='line_3575'></a>
<a id='line_3576'>40:6 Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and</a>
<a id='line_3577'>went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate,</a>
<a id='line_3578'>which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which</a>
<a id='line_3579'>was one reed broad.</a>
<a id='line_3580'></a>
<a id='line_3581'>40:7 And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad;</a>
<a id='line_3582'>and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of</a>
<a id='line_3583'>the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.</a>
<a id='line_3584'></a>
<a id='line_3585'>40:8 He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.</a>
<a id='line_3586'></a>
<a id='line_3587'>40:9 Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the</a>
<a id='line_3588'>posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.</a>
<a id='line_3589'></a>
<a id='line_3590'>40:10 And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this</a>
<a id='line_3591'>side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the</a>
<a id='line_3592'>posts had one measure on this side and on that side.</a>
<a id='line_3593'></a>
<a id='line_3594'>40:11 And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten</a>
<a id='line_3595'>cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.</a>
<a id='line_3596'></a>
<a id='line_3597'>40:12 The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this</a>
<a id='line_3598'>side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little</a>
<a id='line_3599'>chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.</a>
<a id='line_3600'></a>
<a id='line_3601'>40:13 He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to</a>
<a id='line_3602'>the roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door</a>
<a id='line_3603'>against door.</a>
<a id='line_3604'></a>
<a id='line_3605'>40:14 He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of</a>
<a id='line_3606'>the court round about the gate.</a>
<a id='line_3607'></a>
<a id='line_3608'>40:15 And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of</a>
<a id='line_3609'>the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.</a>
<a id='line_3610'></a>
<a id='line_3611'>40:16 And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to</a>
<a id='line_3612'>their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches:</a>
<a id='line_3613'>and windows were round about inward: and upon each post were palm</a>
<a id='line_3614'>trees.</a>
<a id='line_3615'></a>
<a id='line_3616'>40:17 Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were</a>
<a id='line_3617'>chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty</a>
<a id='line_3618'>chambers were upon the pavement.</a>
<a id='line_3619'></a>
<a id='line_3620'>40:18 And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the</a>
<a id='line_3621'>length of the gates was the lower pavement.</a>
<a id='line_3622'></a>
<a id='line_3623'>40:19 Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower</a>
<a id='line_3624'>gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits</a>
<a id='line_3625'>eastward and northward.</a>
<a id='line_3626'></a>
<a id='line_3627'>40:20 And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north,</a>
<a id='line_3628'>he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.</a>
<a id='line_3629'></a>
<a id='line_3630'>40:21 And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and</a>
<a id='line_3631'>three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were</a>
<a id='line_3632'>after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty</a>
<a id='line_3633'>cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.</a>
<a id='line_3634'></a>
<a id='line_3635'>40:22 And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were</a>
<a id='line_3636'>after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they</a>
<a id='line_3637'>went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before</a>
<a id='line_3638'>them.</a>
<a id='line_3639'></a>
<a id='line_3640'>40:23 And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward</a>
<a id='line_3641'>the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an</a>
<a id='line_3642'>hundred cubits.</a>
<a id='line_3643'></a>
<a id='line_3644'>40:24 After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate</a>
<a id='line_3645'>toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches</a>
<a id='line_3646'>thereof according to these measures.</a>
<a id='line_3647'></a>
<a id='line_3648'>40:25 And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round</a>
<a id='line_3649'>about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the</a>
<a id='line_3650'>breadth five and twenty cubits.</a>
<a id='line_3651'></a>
<a id='line_3652'>40:26 And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches</a>
<a id='line_3653'>thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and</a>
<a id='line_3654'>another on that side, upon the posts thereof.</a>
<a id='line_3655'></a>
<a id='line_3656'>40:27 And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he</a>
<a id='line_3657'>measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.</a>
<a id='line_3658'></a>
<a id='line_3659'>40:28 And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he</a>
<a id='line_3660'>measured the south gate according to these measures; 40:29 And the</a>
<a id='line_3661'>little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches</a>
<a id='line_3662'>thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and</a>
<a id='line_3663'>in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five</a>
<a id='line_3664'>and twenty cubits broad.</a>
<a id='line_3665'></a>
<a id='line_3666'>40:30 And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and</a>
<a id='line_3667'>five cubits broad.</a>
<a id='line_3668'></a>
<a id='line_3669'>40:31 And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm</a>
<a id='line_3670'>trees were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight</a>
<a id='line_3671'>steps.</a>
<a id='line_3672'></a>
<a id='line_3673'>40:32 And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he</a>
<a id='line_3674'>measured the gate according to these measures.</a>
<a id='line_3675'></a>
<a id='line_3676'>40:33 And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the</a>
<a id='line_3677'>arches thereof, were according to these measures: and there were</a>
<a id='line_3678'>windows therein and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty</a>
<a id='line_3679'>cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.</a>
<a id='line_3680'></a>
<a id='line_3681'>40:34 And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm</a>
<a id='line_3682'>trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and</a>
<a id='line_3683'>the going up to it had eight steps.</a>
<a id='line_3684'></a>
<a id='line_3685'>40:35 And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according</a>
<a id='line_3686'>to these measures; 40:36 The little chambers thereof, the posts</a>
<a id='line_3687'>thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about:</a>
<a id='line_3688'>the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.</a>
<a id='line_3689'></a>
<a id='line_3690'>40:37 And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm</a>
<a id='line_3691'>trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and</a>
<a id='line_3692'>the going up to it had eight steps.</a>
<a id='line_3693'></a>
<a id='line_3694'>40:38 And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of</a>
<a id='line_3695'>the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.</a>
<a id='line_3696'></a>
<a id='line_3697'>40:39 And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and</a>
<a id='line_3698'>two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the</a>
<a id='line_3699'>sin offering and the trespass offering.</a>
<a id='line_3700'></a>
<a id='line_3701'>40:40 And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the</a>
<a id='line_3702'>north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the</a>
<a id='line_3703'>porch of the gate, were two tables.</a>
<a id='line_3704'></a>
<a id='line_3705'>40:41 Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by</a>
<a id='line_3706'>the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their</a>
<a id='line_3707'>sacrifices.</a>
<a id='line_3708'></a>
<a id='line_3709'>40:42 And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering,</a>
<a id='line_3710'>of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one</a>
<a id='line_3711'>cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they</a>
<a id='line_3712'>slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.</a>
<a id='line_3713'></a>
<a id='line_3714'>40:43 And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and</a>
<a id='line_3715'>upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.</a>
<a id='line_3716'></a>
<a id='line_3717'>40:44 And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in</a>
<a id='line_3718'>the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their</a>
<a id='line_3719'>prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having</a>
<a id='line_3720'>the prospect toward the north.</a>
<a id='line_3721'></a>
<a id='line_3722'>40:45 And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the</a>
<a id='line_3723'>south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.</a>
<a id='line_3724'></a>
<a id='line_3725'>40:46 And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the</a>
<a id='line_3726'>priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of</a>
<a id='line_3727'>Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister</a>
<a id='line_3728'>unto him.</a>
<a id='line_3729'></a>
<a id='line_3730'>40:47 So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred</a>
<a id='line_3731'>cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.</a>
<a id='line_3732'></a>
<a id='line_3733'>40:48 And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each</a>
<a id='line_3734'>post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that</a>
<a id='line_3735'>side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and</a>
<a id='line_3736'>three cubits on that side.</a>
<a id='line_3737'></a>
<a id='line_3738'>40:49 The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth</a>
<a id='line_3739'>eleven cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to</a>
<a id='line_3740'>it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another</a>
<a id='line_3741'>on that side.</a>
<a id='line_3742'></a>
<a id='line_3743'>41:1 Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts,</a>
<a id='line_3744'>six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other</a>
<a id='line_3745'>side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.</a>
<a id='line_3746'></a>
<a id='line_3747'>41:2 And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the</a>
<a id='line_3748'>door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other</a>
<a id='line_3749'>side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the</a>
<a id='line_3750'>breadth, twenty cubits.</a>
<a id='line_3751'></a>
<a id='line_3752'>41:3 Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two</a>
<a id='line_3753'>cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven</a>
<a id='line_3754'>cubits.</a>
<a id='line_3755'></a>
<a id='line_3756'>41:4 So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the</a>
<a id='line_3757'>breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This</a>
<a id='line_3758'>is the most holy place.</a>
<a id='line_3759'></a>
<a id='line_3760'>41:5 After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the</a>
<a id='line_3761'>breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on</a>
<a id='line_3762'>every side.</a>
<a id='line_3763'></a>
<a id='line_3764'>41:6 And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in</a>
<a id='line_3765'>order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the</a>
<a id='line_3766'>side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not</a>
<a id='line_3767'>hold in the wall of the house.</a>
<a id='line_3768'></a>
<a id='line_3769'>41:7 And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to</a>
<a id='line_3770'>the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still</a>
<a id='line_3771'>upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was</a>
<a id='line_3772'>still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest</a>
<a id='line_3773'>by the midst.</a>
<a id='line_3774'></a>
<a id='line_3775'>41:8 I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations</a>
<a id='line_3776'>of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.</a>
<a id='line_3777'></a>
<a id='line_3778'>41:9 The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber</a>
<a id='line_3779'>without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the</a>
<a id='line_3780'>side chambers that were within.</a>
<a id='line_3781'></a>
<a id='line_3782'>41:10 And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round</a>
<a id='line_3783'>about the house on every side.</a>
<a id='line_3784'></a>
<a id='line_3785'>41:11 And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that</a>
<a id='line_3786'>was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the</a>
<a id='line_3787'>south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits</a>
<a id='line_3788'>round about.</a>
<a id='line_3789'></a>
<a id='line_3790'>41:12 Now the building that was before the separate place at the end</a>
<a id='line_3791'>toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building</a>
<a id='line_3792'>was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety</a>
<a id='line_3793'>cubits.</a>
<a id='line_3794'></a>
<a id='line_3795'>41:13 So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the</a>
<a id='line_3796'>separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred</a>
<a id='line_3797'>cubits long; 41:14 Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of</a>
<a id='line_3798'>the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.</a>
<a id='line_3799'></a>
<a id='line_3800'>41:15 And he measured the length of the building over against the</a>
<a id='line_3801'>separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the</a>
<a id='line_3802'>one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner</a>
<a id='line_3803'>temple, and the porches of the court; 41:16 The door posts, and the</a>
<a id='line_3804'>narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories,</a>
<a id='line_3805'>over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the</a>
<a id='line_3806'>ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered; 41:17 To that</a>
<a id='line_3807'>above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the</a>
<a id='line_3808'>wall round about within and without, by measure.</a>
<a id='line_3809'></a>
<a id='line_3810'>41:18 And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm</a>
<a id='line_3811'>tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two</a>
<a id='line_3812'>faces; 41:19 So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the</a>
<a id='line_3813'>one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the</a>
<a id='line_3814'>other side: it was made through all the house round about.</a>
<a id='line_3815'></a>
<a id='line_3816'>41:20 From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm</a>
<a id='line_3817'>trees made, and on the wall of the temple.</a>
<a id='line_3818'></a>
<a id='line_3819'>41:21 The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the</a>
<a id='line_3820'>sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.</a>
<a id='line_3821'></a>
<a id='line_3822'>41:22 The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof</a>
<a id='line_3823'>two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the</a>
<a id='line_3824'>walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table</a>
<a id='line_3825'>that is before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3826'></a>
<a id='line_3827'>41:23 And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.</a>
<a id='line_3828'></a>
<a id='line_3829'>41:24 And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two</a>
<a id='line_3830'>leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.</a>
<a id='line_3831'></a>
<a id='line_3832'>41:25 And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple,</a>
<a id='line_3833'>cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there</a>
<a id='line_3834'>were thick planks upon the face of the porch without.</a>
<a id='line_3835'></a>
<a id='line_3836'>41:26 And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and</a>
<a id='line_3837'>on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side</a>
<a id='line_3838'>chambers of the house, and thick planks.</a>
<a id='line_3839'></a>
<a id='line_3840'>42:1 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the</a>
<a id='line_3841'>north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the</a>
<a id='line_3842'>separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.</a>
<a id='line_3843'></a>
<a id='line_3844'>42:2 Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and</a>
<a id='line_3845'>the breadth was fifty cubits.</a>
<a id='line_3846'></a>
<a id='line_3847'>42:3 Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court,</a>
<a id='line_3848'>and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was</a>
<a id='line_3849'>gallery against gallery in three stories.</a>
<a id='line_3850'></a>
<a id='line_3851'>42:4 And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward,</a>
<a id='line_3852'>a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.</a>
<a id='line_3853'></a>
<a id='line_3854'>42:5 Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were</a>
<a id='line_3855'>higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the</a>
<a id='line_3856'>building.</a>
<a id='line_3857'></a>
<a id='line_3858'>42:6 For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the</a>
<a id='line_3859'>pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than</a>
<a id='line_3860'>the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.</a>
<a id='line_3861'></a>
<a id='line_3862'>42:7 And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward</a>
<a id='line_3863'>the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof</a>
<a id='line_3864'>was fifty cubits.</a>
<a id='line_3865'></a>
<a id='line_3866'>42:8 For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was</a>
<a id='line_3867'>fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits.</a>
<a id='line_3868'></a>
<a id='line_3869'>42:9 And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as</a>
<a id='line_3870'>one goeth into them from the utter court.</a>
<a id='line_3871'></a>
<a id='line_3872'>42:10 The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court</a>
<a id='line_3873'>toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the</a>
<a id='line_3874'>building.</a>
<a id='line_3875'></a>
<a id='line_3876'>42:11 And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers</a>
<a id='line_3877'>which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they:</a>
<a id='line_3878'>and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and</a>
<a id='line_3879'>according to their doors.</a>
<a id='line_3880'></a>
<a id='line_3881'>42:12 And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the</a>
<a id='line_3882'>south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before</a>
<a id='line_3883'>the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.</a>
<a id='line_3884'></a>
<a id='line_3885'>42:13 Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers,</a>
<a id='line_3886'>which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the</a>
<a id='line_3887'>priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things:</a>
<a id='line_3888'>there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and</a>
<a id='line_3889'>the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.</a>
<a id='line_3890'></a>
<a id='line_3891'>42:14 When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of</a>
<a id='line_3892'>the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their</a>
<a id='line_3893'>garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on</a>
<a id='line_3894'>other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the</a>
<a id='line_3895'>people.</a>
<a id='line_3896'></a>
<a id='line_3897'>42:15 Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he</a>
<a id='line_3898'>brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east,</a>
<a id='line_3899'>and measured it round about.</a>
<a id='line_3900'></a>
<a id='line_3901'>42:16 He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred</a>
<a id='line_3902'>reeds, with the measuring reed round about.</a>
<a id='line_3903'></a>
<a id='line_3904'>42:17 He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the</a>
<a id='line_3905'>measuring reed round about.</a>
<a id='line_3906'></a>
<a id='line_3907'>42:18 He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the</a>
<a id='line_3908'>measuring reed.</a>
<a id='line_3909'></a>
<a id='line_3910'>42:19 He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred</a>
<a id='line_3911'>reeds with the measuring reed.</a>
<a id='line_3912'></a>
<a id='line_3913'>42:20 He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about,</a>
<a id='line_3914'>five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation</a>
<a id='line_3915'>between the sanctuary and the profane place.</a>
<a id='line_3916'></a>
<a id='line_3917'>43:1 Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh</a>
<a id='line_3918'>toward the east: 43:2 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came</a>
<a id='line_3919'>from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many</a>
<a id='line_3920'>waters: and the earth shined with his glory.</a>
<a id='line_3921'></a>
<a id='line_3922'>43:3 And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw,</a>
<a id='line_3923'>even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the</a>
<a id='line_3924'>city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river</a>
<a id='line_3925'>Chebar; and I fell upon my face.</a>
<a id='line_3926'></a>
<a id='line_3927'>43:4 And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the</a>
<a id='line_3928'>gate whose prospect is toward the east.</a>
<a id='line_3929'></a>
<a id='line_3930'>43:5 So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court;</a>
<a id='line_3931'>and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.</a>
<a id='line_3932'></a>
<a id='line_3933'>43:6 And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man</a>
<a id='line_3934'>stood by me.</a>
<a id='line_3935'></a>
<a id='line_3936'>43:7 And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the</a>
<a id='line_3937'>place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_3938'>children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of</a>
<a id='line_3939'>Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their</a>
<a id='line_3940'>whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.</a>
<a id='line_3941'></a>
<a id='line_3942'>43:8 In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their</a>
<a id='line_3943'>post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even</a>
<a id='line_3944'>defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed:</a>
<a id='line_3945'>wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.</a>
<a id='line_3946'></a>
<a id='line_3947'>43:9 Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their</a>
<a id='line_3948'>kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.</a>
<a id='line_3949'></a>
<a id='line_3950'>43:10 Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that</a>
<a id='line_3951'>they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the</a>
<a id='line_3952'>pattern.</a>
<a id='line_3953'></a>
<a id='line_3954'>43:11 And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the</a>
<a id='line_3955'>form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out</a>
<a id='line_3956'>thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and</a>
<a id='line_3957'>all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the</a>
<a id='line_3958'>laws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep the</a>
<a id='line_3959'>whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.</a>
<a id='line_3960'></a>
<a id='line_3961'>43:12 This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the</a>
<a id='line_3962'>whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is</a>
<a id='line_3963'>the law of the house.</a>
<a id='line_3964'></a>
<a id='line_3965'>43:13 And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The</a>
<a id='line_3966'>cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a</a>
<a id='line_3967'>cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge</a>
<a id='line_3968'>thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher</a>
<a id='line_3969'>place of the altar.</a>
<a id='line_3970'></a>
<a id='line_3971'>43:14 And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle</a>
<a id='line_3972'>shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser</a>
<a id='line_3973'>settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the</a>
<a id='line_3974'>breadth one cubit.</a>
<a id='line_3975'></a>
<a id='line_3976'>43:15 So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward</a>
<a id='line_3977'>shall be four horns.</a>
<a id='line_3978'></a>
<a id='line_3979'>43:16 And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square</a>
<a id='line_3980'>in the four squares thereof.</a>
<a id='line_3981'></a>
<a id='line_3982'>43:17 And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad</a>
<a id='line_3983'>in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a</a>
<a id='line_3984'>cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs</a>
<a id='line_3985'>shall look toward the east.</a>
<a id='line_3986'></a>
<a id='line_3987'>43:18 And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These</a>
<a id='line_3988'>are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to</a>
<a id='line_3989'>offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.</a>
<a id='line_3990'></a>
<a id='line_3991'>43:19 And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the</a>
<a id='line_3992'>seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the</a>
<a id='line_3993'>Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.</a>
<a id='line_3994'></a>
<a id='line_3995'>43:20 And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four</a>
<a id='line_3996'>horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the</a>
<a id='line_3997'>border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.</a>
<a id='line_3998'></a>
<a id='line_3999'>43:21 Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he</a>
<a id='line_4000'>shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the</a>
<a id='line_4001'>sanctuary.</a>
<a id='line_4002'></a>
<a id='line_4003'>43:22 And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats</a>
<a id='line_4004'>without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar,</a>
<a id='line_4005'>as they did cleanse it with the bullock.</a>
<a id='line_4006'></a>
<a id='line_4007'>43:23 When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a</a>
<a id='line_4008'>young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without</a>
<a id='line_4009'>blemish.</a>
<a id='line_4010'></a>
<a id='line_4011'>43:24 And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall</a>
<a id='line_4012'>cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering</a>
<a id='line_4013'>unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4014'></a>
<a id='line_4015'>43:25 Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin</a>
<a id='line_4016'>offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of</a>
<a id='line_4017'>the flock, without blemish.</a>
<a id='line_4018'></a>
<a id='line_4019'>43:26 Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they</a>
<a id='line_4020'>shall consecrate themselves.</a>
<a id='line_4021'></a>
<a id='line_4022'>43:27 And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the</a>
<a id='line_4023'>eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt</a>
<a id='line_4024'>offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept</a>
<a id='line_4025'>you, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_4026'></a>
<a id='line_4027'>44:1 Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward</a>
<a id='line_4028'>sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.</a>
<a id='line_4029'></a>
<a id='line_4030'>44:2 Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not</a>
<a id='line_4031'>be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God</a>
<a id='line_4032'>of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.</a>
<a id='line_4033'></a>
<a id='line_4034'>44:3 It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread</a>
<a id='line_4035'>before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate,</a>
<a id='line_4036'>and shall go out by the way of the same.</a>
<a id='line_4037'></a>
<a id='line_4038'>44:4 Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house:</a>
<a id='line_4039'>and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of</a>
<a id='line_4040'>the LORD: and I fell upon my face.</a>
<a id='line_4041'></a>
<a id='line_4042'>44:5 And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with</a>
<a id='line_4043'>thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee</a>
<a id='line_4044'>concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the</a>
<a id='line_4045'>laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every</a>
<a id='line_4046'>going forth of the sanctuary.</a>
<a id='line_4047'></a>
<a id='line_4048'>44:6 And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of</a>
<a id='line_4049'>Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice</a>
<a id='line_4050'>you of all your abominations, 44:7 In that ye have brought into my</a>
<a id='line_4051'>sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in</a>
<a id='line_4052'>flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye</a>
<a id='line_4053'>offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my</a>
<a id='line_4054'>covenant because of all your abominations.</a>
<a id='line_4055'></a>
<a id='line_4056'>44:8 And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have</a>
<a id='line_4057'>set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.</a>
<a id='line_4058'></a>
<a id='line_4059'>44:9 Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor</a>
<a id='line_4060'>uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger</a>
<a id='line_4061'>that is among the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4062'></a>
<a id='line_4063'>44:10 And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went</a>
<a id='line_4064'>astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall</a>
<a id='line_4065'>even bear their iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_4066'></a>
<a id='line_4067'>44:11 Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at</a>
<a id='line_4068'>the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay</a>
<a id='line_4069'>the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall</a>
<a id='line_4070'>stand before them to minister unto them.</a>
<a id='line_4071'></a>
<a id='line_4072'>44:12 Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused</a>
<a id='line_4073'>the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up</a>
<a id='line_4074'>mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their</a>
<a id='line_4075'>iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_4076'></a>
<a id='line_4077'>44:13 And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a</a>
<a id='line_4078'>priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most</a>
<a id='line_4079'>holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations</a>
<a id='line_4080'>which they have committed.</a>
<a id='line_4081'></a>
<a id='line_4082'>44:14 But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all</a>
<a id='line_4083'>the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.</a>
<a id='line_4084'></a>
<a id='line_4085'>44:15 But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the</a>
<a id='line_4086'>charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from</a>
<a id='line_4087'>me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall</a>
<a id='line_4088'>stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord</a>
<a id='line_4089'>GOD: 44:16 They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come</a>
<a id='line_4090'>near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.</a>
<a id='line_4091'></a>
<a id='line_4092'>44:17 And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates</a>
<a id='line_4093'>of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no</a>
<a id='line_4094'>wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the</a>
<a id='line_4095'>inner court, and within.</a>
<a id='line_4096'></a>
<a id='line_4097'>44:18 They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have</a>
<a id='line_4098'>linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with</a>
<a id='line_4099'>any thing that causeth sweat.</a>
<a id='line_4100'></a>
<a id='line_4101'>44:19 And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter</a>
<a id='line_4102'>court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they</a>
<a id='line_4103'>ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on</a>
<a id='line_4104'>other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their</a>
<a id='line_4105'>garments.</a>
<a id='line_4106'></a>
<a id='line_4107'>44:20 Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to</a>
<a id='line_4108'>grow long; they shall only poll their heads.</a>
<a id='line_4109'></a>
<a id='line_4110'>44:21 Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the</a>
<a id='line_4111'>inner court.</a>
<a id='line_4112'></a>
<a id='line_4113'>44:22 Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is</a>
<a id='line_4114'>put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of</a>
<a id='line_4115'>Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.</a>
<a id='line_4116'></a>
<a id='line_4117'>44:23 And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy</a>
<a id='line_4118'>and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the</a>
<a id='line_4119'>clean.</a>
<a id='line_4120'></a>
<a id='line_4121'>44:24 And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall</a>
<a id='line_4122'>judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my</a>
<a id='line_4123'>statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.</a>
<a id='line_4124'></a>
<a id='line_4125'>44:25 And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but</a>
<a id='line_4126'>for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother,</a>
<a id='line_4127'>or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.</a>
<a id='line_4128'></a>
<a id='line_4129'>44:26 And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.</a>
<a id='line_4130'></a>
<a id='line_4131'>44:27 And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner</a>
<a id='line_4132'>court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering,</a>
<a id='line_4133'>saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_4134'></a>
<a id='line_4135'>44:28 And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their</a>
<a id='line_4136'>inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I am</a>
<a id='line_4137'>their possession.</a>
<a id='line_4138'></a>
<a id='line_4139'>44:29 They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the</a>
<a id='line_4140'>trespass offering: and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be</a>

<a id='line_4142'></a>
<a id='line_4143'>44:30 And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every</a>

<a id='line_4148'>44:31 The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself,</a>

<a id='line_4150'></a>
<a id='line_4151'>45:1 Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance,</a>
<a id='line_4152'>ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy portion of the land:</a>
<a id='line_4153'>the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and</a>
<a id='line_4154'>the breadth shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy in all the</a>

<a id='line_4156'></a>
<a id='line_4157'>45:2 Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length,</a>

<a id='line_4160'></a>
<a id='line_4161'>45:3 And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and</a>

<a id='line_4164'></a>
<a id='line_4165'>45:4 The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the</a>

<a id='line_4168'>the sanctuary.</a>
<a id='line_4169'></a>
<a id='line_4170'>45:5 And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand</a>

<a id='line_4172'>for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers.</a>
<a id='line_4173'></a>
<a id='line_4174'>45:6 And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand</a>

<a id='line_4176'>the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4177'></a>
<a id='line_4178'>45:7 And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the</a>

<a id='line_4181'>possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east</a>
<a id='line_4182'>side eastward: and the length shall be over against one of the</a>

<a id='line_4184'></a>
<a id='line_4185'>45:8 In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes</a>

<a id='line_4205'>the bath of oil, ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the</a>

<a id='line_4207'>And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat</a>

<a id='line_4225'>the sin offering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the</a>
<a id='line_4226'>four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the</a>
<a id='line_4227'>gate of the inner court.</a>
<a id='line_4228'></a>
<a id='line_4229'>45:20 And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one</a>
<a id='line_4230'>that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye reconcile the</a>
<a id='line_4231'>house.</a>
<a id='line_4232'></a>
<a id='line_4233'>45:21 In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_4234'>have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be</a>
<a id='line_4235'>eaten.</a>
<a id='line_4236'></a>
<a id='line_4237'>45:22 And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for</a>
<a id='line_4238'>all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.</a>
<a id='line_4239'></a>
<a id='line_4240'>45:23 And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to</a>
<a id='line_4241'>the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the</a>
<a id='line_4242'>seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering.</a>
<a id='line_4243'></a>
<a id='line_4244'>45:24 And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock,</a>
<a id='line_4245'>and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah.</a>
<a id='line_4246'></a>
<a id='line_4247'>45:25 In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall</a>
<a id='line_4248'>he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin</a>
<a id='line_4249'>offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat</a>
<a id='line_4250'>offering, and according to the oil.</a>
<a id='line_4251'></a>
<a id='line_4252'>46:1 Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looketh</a>
<a id='line_4253'>toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath</a>
<a id='line_4254'>it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.</a>
<a id='line_4255'></a>
<a id='line_4256'>46:2 And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate</a>
<a id='line_4257'>without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests</a>
<a id='line_4258'>shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall</a>
<a id='line_4259'>worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the</a>
<a id='line_4260'>gate shall not be shut until the evening.</a>
<a id='line_4261'></a>
<a id='line_4262'>46:3 Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this</a>
<a id='line_4263'>gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons.</a>
<a id='line_4264'></a>
<a id='line_4265'>46:4 And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD</a>
<a id='line_4266'>in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram</a>
<a id='line_4267'>without blemish.</a>
<a id='line_4268'></a>
<a id='line_4269'>46:5 And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat</a>
<a id='line_4270'>offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil</a>
<a id='line_4271'>to an ephah.</a>
<a id='line_4272'></a>
<a id='line_4273'>46:6 And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock</a>
<a id='line_4274'>without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without</a>
<a id='line_4275'>blemish.</a>
<a id='line_4276'></a>
<a id='line_4277'>46:7 And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and</a>
<a id='line_4278'>an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall</a>
<a id='line_4279'>attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.</a>
<a id='line_4280'></a>
<a id='line_4281'>46:8 And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the</a>
<a id='line_4282'>porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.</a>
<a id='line_4283'></a>
<a id='line_4284'>46:9 But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the</a>
<a id='line_4285'>solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to</a>
<a id='line_4286'>worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that</a>
<a id='line_4287'>entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the</a>
<a id='line_4288'>north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came</a>
<a id='line_4289'>in, but shall go forth over against it.</a>
<a id='line_4290'></a>
<a id='line_4291'>46:10 And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go</a>
<a id='line_4292'>in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.</a>
<a id='line_4293'></a>
<a id='line_4294'>46:11 And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall</a>
<a id='line_4295'>be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as</a>
<a id='line_4296'>he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.</a>
<a id='line_4297'></a>
<a id='line_4298'>46:12 Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or</a>
<a id='line_4299'>peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open him the</a>
<a id='line_4300'>gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt</a>
<a id='line_4301'>offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then</a>
<a id='line_4302'>he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.</a>
<a id='line_4303'></a>
<a id='line_4304'>46:13 Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a</a>
<a id='line_4305'>lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every</a>
<a id='line_4306'>morning.</a>
<a id='line_4307'></a>
<a id='line_4308'>46:14 And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the</a>
<a id='line_4309'>sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper</a>
<a id='line_4310'>with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual</a>
<a id='line_4311'>ordinance unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4312'></a>
<a id='line_4313'>46:15 Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the</a>
<a id='line_4314'>oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.</a>
<a id='line_4315'></a>
<a id='line_4316'>46:16 Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of</a>
<a id='line_4317'>his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons’; it shall be</a>
<a id='line_4318'>their possession by inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_4319'></a>
<a id='line_4320'>46:17 But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants,</a>
<a id='line_4321'>then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to</a>
<a id='line_4322'>the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons’ for them.</a>
<a id='line_4323'></a>
<a id='line_4324'>46:18 Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance</a>
<a id='line_4325'>by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall</a>
<a id='line_4326'>give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be</a>
<a id='line_4327'>not scattered every man from his possession.</a>
<a id='line_4328'></a>
<a id='line_4329'>46:19 After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of</a>
<a id='line_4330'>the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward</a>
<a id='line_4331'>the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward.</a>
<a id='line_4332'></a>
<a id='line_4333'>46:20 Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall</a>
<a id='line_4334'>boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake</a>
<a id='line_4335'>the meat offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court,</a>
<a id='line_4336'>to sanctify the people.</a>
<a id='line_4337'></a>
<a id='line_4338'>46:21 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to</a>
<a id='line_4339'>pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of</a>
<a id='line_4340'>the court there was a court.</a>
<a id='line_4341'></a>
<a id='line_4342'>46:22 In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of</a>
<a id='line_4343'>forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one</a>
<a id='line_4344'>measure.</a>
<a id='line_4345'></a>
<a id='line_4346'>46:23 And there was a row of building round about in them, round about</a>
<a id='line_4347'>them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round</a>
<a id='line_4348'>about.</a>
<a id='line_4349'></a>
<a id='line_4350'>46:24 Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil,</a>
<a id='line_4351'>where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the</a>
<a id='line_4352'>people.</a>
<a id='line_4353'></a>
<a id='line_4354'>47:1 Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and,</a>
<a id='line_4355'>behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house</a>
<a id='line_4356'>eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and</a>
<a id='line_4357'>the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at</a>
<a id='line_4358'>the south side of the altar.</a>
<a id='line_4359'></a>
<a id='line_4360'>47:2 Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led</a>
<a id='line_4361'>me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh</a>
<a id='line_4362'>eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.</a>
<a id='line_4363'></a>
<a id='line_4364'>47:3 And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth</a>
<a id='line_4365'>eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the</a>
<a id='line_4366'>waters; the waters were to the ankles.</a>
<a id='line_4367'></a>
<a id='line_4368'>47:4 Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters;</a>
<a id='line_4369'>the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and</a>
<a id='line_4370'>brought me through; the waters were to the loins.</a>
<a id='line_4371'></a>
<a id='line_4372'>47:5 Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could</a>
<a id='line_4373'>not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river</a>
<a id='line_4374'>that could not be passed over.</a>
<a id='line_4375'></a>
<a id='line_4376'>47:6 And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he</a>
<a id='line_4377'>brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.</a>
<a id='line_4378'></a>
<a id='line_4379'>47:7 Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were</a>
<a id='line_4380'>very many trees on the one side and on the other.</a>
<a id='line_4381'></a>
<a id='line_4382'>47:8 Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east</a>
<a id='line_4383'>country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being</a>
<a id='line_4384'>brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed.</a>
<a id='line_4385'></a>
<a id='line_4386'>47:9 And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which</a>
<a id='line_4387'>moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there</a>
<a id='line_4388'>shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall</a>
<a id='line_4389'>come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live</a>
<a id='line_4390'>whither the river cometh.</a>
<a id='line_4391'></a>
<a id='line_4392'>47:10 And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it</a>
<a id='line_4393'>from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth</a>
<a id='line_4394'>nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the</a>
<a id='line_4395'>great sea, exceeding many.</a>
<a id='line_4396'></a>
<a id='line_4397'>47:11 But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not</a>
<a id='line_4398'>be healed; they shall be given to salt.</a>
<a id='line_4399'></a>
<a id='line_4400'>47:12 And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that</a>
<a id='line_4401'>side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade,</a>
<a id='line_4402'>neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new</a>
<a id='line_4403'>fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of</a>
<a id='line_4404'>the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf</a>
<a id='line_4405'>thereof for medicine.</a>
<a id='line_4406'></a>
<a id='line_4407'>47:13 Thus saith the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby ye</a>
<a id='line_4408'>shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel:</a>
<a id='line_4409'>Joseph shall have two portions.</a>
<a id='line_4410'></a>
<a id='line_4411'>47:14 And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the</a>
<a id='line_4412'>which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this</a>
<a id='line_4413'>land shall fall unto you for inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_4414'></a>
<a id='line_4415'>47:15 And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side,</a>
<a id='line_4416'>from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad; 47:16</a>
<a id='line_4417'>Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and</a>
<a id='line_4418'>the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.</a>
<a id='line_4419'></a>
<a id='line_4420'>47:17 And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of</a>
<a id='line_4421'>Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And this</a>
<a id='line_4422'>is the north side.</a>
<a id='line_4423'></a>
<a id='line_4424'>47:18 And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from</a>
<a id='line_4425'>Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from</a>
<a id='line_4426'>the border unto the east sea. And this is the east side.</a>
<a id='line_4427'></a>
<a id='line_4428'>47:19 And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of</a>
<a id='line_4429'>strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the south</a>
<a id='line_4430'>side southward.</a>
<a id='line_4431'></a>
<a id='line_4432'>47:20 The west side also shall be the great sea from the border, till</a>
<a id='line_4433'>a man come over against Hamath. This is the west side.</a>
<a id='line_4434'></a>
<a id='line_4435'>47:21 So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of</a>
<a id='line_4436'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4437'></a>
<a id='line_4438'>47:22 And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an</a>
<a id='line_4439'>inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you,</a>
<a id='line_4440'>which shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you as</a>
<a id='line_4441'>born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have</a>
<a id='line_4442'>inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4443'></a>
<a id='line_4444'>47:23 And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger</a>
<a id='line_4445'>sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord</a>
<a id='line_4446'>GOD.</a>
<a id='line_4447'></a>
<a id='line_4448'>48:1 Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north end to the</a>
<a id='line_4449'>coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath, Hazarenan, the</a>
<a id='line_4450'>border of Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath; for these are</a>
<a id='line_4451'>his sides east and west; a portion for Dan.</a>
<a id='line_4452'></a>
<a id='line_4453'>48:2 And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side,</a>
<a id='line_4454'>a portion for Asher.</a>
<a id='line_4455'></a>
<a id='line_4456'>48:3 And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west</a>
<a id='line_4457'>side, a portion for Naphtali.</a>

<a id='line_4467'></a>

<a id='line_4469'>side, a portion for Judah.</a>
<a id='line_4470'></a>
<a id='line_4471'>48:8 And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west</a>
<a id='line_4472'>side, shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and twenty</a>
<a id='line_4473'>thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts,</a>
<a id='line_4474'>from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in</a>

<a id='line_4476'></a>
<a id='line_4477'>48:9 The oblation that ye shall offer unto the LORD shall be of five</a>

<a id='line_4480'>48:10 And for them, even for the priests, shall be this holy oblation;</a>

<a id='line_4484'>the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the midst thereof.</a>
<a id='line_4485'></a>
<a id='line_4486'>48:11 It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of</a>
<a id='line_4487'>Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when the</a>

<a id='line_4489'></a>
<a id='line_4490'>48:12 And this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them</a>
<a id='line_4491'>a thing most holy by the border of the Levites.</a>

<a id='line_4498'>48:14 And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate</a>

<a id='line_4501'>48:15 And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against</a>
