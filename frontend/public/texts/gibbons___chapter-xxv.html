<a id='line_10'></a>
<a id='line_11'>      The death of Julian had left the public affairs of the empire in</a>
<a id='line_12'>      a very doubtful and dangerous situation. The Roman army was saved</a>
<a id='line_13'>      by an inglorious, perhaps a necessary treaty; 1 and the first</a>
<a id='line_14'>      moments of peace were consecrated by the pious Jovian to restore</a>
<a id='line_15'>      the domestic tranquility of the church and state. The</a>
<a id='line_16'>      indiscretion of his predecessor, instead of reconciling, had</a>
<a id='line_17'>      artfully fomented the religious war: and the balance which he</a>
<a id='line_18'>      affected to preserve between the hostile factions, served only to</a>
<a id='line_19'>      perpetuate the contest, by the vicissitudes of hope and fear, by</a>
<a id='line_20'>      the rival claims of ancient possession and actual favor. The</a>
<a id='line_21'>      Christians had forgotten the spirit of the gospel; and the Pagans</a>
<a id='line_22'>      had imbibed the spirit of the church. In private families, the</a>
<a id='line_23'>      sentiments of nature were extinguished by the blind fury of zeal</a>
<a id='line_24'>      and revenge: the majesty of the laws was violated or abused; the</a>
<a id='line_25'>      cities of the East were stained with blood; and the most</a>
<a id='line_26'>      implacable enemies of the Romans were in the bosom of their</a>
<a id='line_27'>      country. Jovian was educated in the profession of Christianity;</a>
<a id='line_28'>      and as he marched from Nisibis to Antioch, the banner of the</a>
<a id='line_29'>      Cross, the Labarum of Constantine, which was again displayed at</a>
<a id='line_30'>      the head of the legions, announced to the people the faith of</a>
<a id='line_31'>      their new emperor. As soon as he ascended the throne, he</a>
<a id='line_32'>      transmitted a circular epistle to all the governors of provinces;</a>
<a id='line_33'>      in which he confessed the divine truth, and secured the legal</a>
<a id='line_34'>      establishment, of the Christian religion. The insidious edicts of</a>
<a id='line_35'>      Julian were abolished; the ecclesiastical immunities were</a>
<a id='line_36'>      restored and enlarged; and Jovian condescended to lament, that</a>
<a id='line_37'>      the distress of the times obliged him to diminish the measure of</a>
<a id='line_38'>      charitable distributions. 2 The Christians were unanimous in the</a>
<a id='line_39'>      loud and sincere applause which they bestowed on the pious</a>
<a id='line_40'>      successor of Julian. But they were still ignorant what creed, or</a>
<a id='line_41'>      what synod, he would choose for the standard of orthodoxy; and</a>
<a id='line_42'>      the peace of the church immediately revived those eager disputes</a>
<a id='line_43'>      which had been suspended during the season of persecution. The</a>
<a id='line_44'>      episcopal leaders of the contending sects, convinced, from</a>
<a id='line_45'>      experience, how much their fate would depend on the earliest</a>
<a id='line_46'>      impressions that were made on the mind of an untutored soldier,</a>
<a id='line_47'>      hastened to the court of Edessa, or Antioch. The highways of the</a>
<a id='line_48'>      East were crowded with Homoousian, and Arian, and Semi-Arian, and</a>
<a id='line_49'>      Eunomian bishops, who struggled to outstrip each other in the</a>
<a id='line_50'>      holy race: the apartments of the palace resounded with their</a>
<a id='line_51'>      clamors; and the ears of the prince were assaulted, and perhaps</a>
<a id='line_52'>      astonished, by the singular mixture of metaphysical argument and</a>
<a id='line_53'>      passionate invective. 3 The moderation of Jovian, who recommended</a>
<a id='line_54'>      concord and charity, and referred the disputants to the sentence</a>
<a id='line_55'>      of a future council, was interpreted as a symptom of</a>
<a id='line_56'>      indifference: but his attachment to the Nicene creed was at</a>
<a id='line_57'>      length discovered and declared, by the reverence which he</a>
<a id='line_58'>      expressed for the _celestial_ 4 virtues of the great Athanasius.</a>
<a id='line_59'>      The intrepid veteran of the faith, at the age of seventy, had</a>
<a id='line_60'>      issued from his retreat on the first intelligence of the tyrantÕs</a>
<a id='line_61'>      death. The acclamations of the people seated him once more on the</a>
<a id='line_62'>      archiepiscopal throne; and he wisely accepted, or anticipated,</a>
<a id='line_63'>      the invitation of Jovian. The venerable figure of Athanasius, his</a>
<a id='line_64'>      calm courage, and insinuating eloquence, sustained the reputation</a>
<a id='line_65'>      which he had already acquired in the courts of four successive</a>
<a id='line_66'>      princes. 5 As soon as he had gained the confidence, and secured</a>
<a id='line_67'>      the faith, of the Christian emperor, he returned in triumph to</a>
<a id='line_68'>      his diocese, and continued, with mature counsels and undiminished</a>
<a id='line_69'>      vigor, to direct, ten years longer, 6 the ecclesiastical</a>
<a id='line_70'>      government of Alexandria, Egypt, and the Catholic church. Before</a>
<a id='line_71'>      his departure from Antioch, he assured Jovian that his orthodox</a>
<a id='line_72'>      devotion would be rewarded with a long and peaceful reign.</a>
<a id='line_73'>      Athanasius, had reason to hope, that he should be allowed either</a>
<a id='line_74'>      the merit of a successful prediction, or the excuse of a grateful</a>
<a id='line_75'>      though ineffectual prayer. 7</a>

<a id='line_120'>      The slightest force, when it is applied to assist and guide the</a>
<a id='line_121'>      natural descent of its object, operates with irresistible weight;</a>
<a id='line_122'>      and Jovian had the good fortune to embrace the religious opinions</a>
<a id='line_123'>      which were supported by the spirit of the times, and the zeal and</a>
<a id='line_124'>      numbers of the most powerful sect. 8 Under his reign,</a>
<a id='line_125'>      Christianity obtained an easy and lasting victory; and as soon as</a>
<a id='line_126'>      the smile of royal patronage was withdrawn, the genius of</a>
<a id='line_127'>      Paganism, which had been fondly raised and cherished by the arts</a>
<a id='line_128'>      of Julian, sunk irrecoverably in the. In many cities, the temples</a>
<a id='line_129'>      were shut or deserted: the philosophers who had abused their</a>
<a id='line_130'>      transient favor, thought it prudent to shave their beards, and</a>
<a id='line_131'>      disguise their profession; and the Christians rejoiced, that they</a>
<a id='line_132'>      were now in a condition to forgive, or to revenge, the injuries</a>
<a id='line_133'>      which they had suffered under the preceding reign. 9 The</a>
<a id='line_134'>      consternation of the Pagan world was dispelled by a wise and</a>
<a id='line_135'>      gracious edict of toleration; in which Jovian explicitly</a>
<a id='line_136'>      declared, that although he should severely punish the</a>
<a id='line_137'>      sacrilegious rites of magic, his subjects might exercise, with</a>
<a id='line_138'>      freedom and safety, the ceremonies of the ancient worship. The</a>
<a id='line_139'>      memory of this law has been preserved by the orator Themistius,</a>
<a id='line_140'>      who was deputed by the senate of Constantinople to express their</a>
<a id='line_141'>      royal devotion for the new emperor. Themistius expatiates on the</a>
<a id='line_142'>      clemency of the Divine Nature, the facility of human error, the</a>
<a id='line_143'>      rights of conscience, and the independence of the mind; and, with</a>
<a id='line_144'>      some eloquence, inculcates the principles of philosophical</a>
<a id='line_145'>      toleration; whose aid Superstition herself, in the hour of her</a>
<a id='line_146'>      distress, is not ashamed to implore. He justly observes, that in</a>
<a id='line_147'>      the recent changes, both religions had been alternately disgraced</a>
<a id='line_148'>      by the seeming acquisition of worthless proselytes, of those</a>
<a id='line_149'>      votaries of the reigning purple, who could pass, without a</a>
<a id='line_150'>      reason, and without a blush, from the church to the temple, and</a>
<a id='line_151'>      from the altars of Jupiter to the sacred table of the Christians.</a>

<a id='line_163'>      Paris, 1684. The AbbŽ de la Bleterie judiciously remarks, (Hist.</a>
<a id='line_164'>      de Jovien, tom. i. p. 199,) that Sozomen has forgot the general</a>
<a id='line_165'>      toleration; and Themistius the establishment of the Catholic</a>
<a id='line_166'>      religion. Each of them turned away from the object which he</a>
<a id='line_167'>      disliked, and wished to suppress the part of the edict the least</a>
<a id='line_168'>      honorable, in his opinion, to the emperor.]</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>      In the space of seven months, the Roman troops, who were now</a>
<a id='line_171'>      returned to Antioch, had performed a march of fifteen hundred</a>
<a id='line_172'>      miles; in which they had endured all the hardships of war, of</a>
<a id='line_173'>      famine, and of climate. Notwithstanding their services, their</a>
<a id='line_174'>      fatigues, and the approach of winter, the timid and impatient</a>
<a id='line_175'>      Jovian allowed only, to the men and horses, a respite of six</a>
<a id='line_176'>      weeks. The emperor could not sustain the indiscreet and malicious</a>
<a id='line_177'>      raillery of the people of Antioch. 11 He was impatient to possess</a>
<a id='line_178'>      the palace of Constantinople; and to prevent the ambition of some</a>
<a id='line_179'>      competitor, who might occupy the vacant allegiance of Europe. But</a>
<a id='line_180'>      he soon received the grateful intelligence, that his authority</a>
<a id='line_181'>      was acknowledged from the Thracian Bosphorus to the Atlantic</a>
<a id='line_182'>      Ocean. By the first letters which he despatched from the camp of</a>
<a id='line_183'>      Mesopotamia, he had delegated the military command of Gaul and</a>
<a id='line_184'>      Illyricum to Malarich, a brave and faithful officer of the nation</a>
<a id='line_185'>      of the Franks; and to his father-in-law, Count Lucillian, who had</a>
<a id='line_186'>      formerly distinguished his courage and conduct in the defence of</a>
<a id='line_187'>      Nisibis. Malarich had declined an office to which he thought</a>
<a id='line_188'>      himself unequal; and Lucillian was massacred at Rheims, in an</a>
<a id='line_189'>      accidental mutiny of the Batavian cohorts. 12 But the moderation</a>
<a id='line_190'>      of Jovinus, master-general of the cavalry, who forgave the</a>
<a id='line_191'>      intention of his disgrace, soon appeased the tumult, and</a>
<a id='line_192'>      confirmed the uncertain minds of the soldiers. The oath of</a>
<a id='line_193'>      fidelity was administered and taken, with loyal acclamations; and</a>
<a id='line_194'>      the deputies of the Western armies 13 saluted their new sovereign</a>
<a id='line_195'>      as he descended from Mount Taurus to the city of Tyana in</a>
<a id='line_196'>      Cappadocia. From Tyana he continued his hasty march to Ancyra,</a>
<a id='line_197'>      capital of the province of Galatia; where Jovian assumed, with</a>
<a id='line_198'>      his infant son, the name and ensigns of the consulship. 14</a>
<a id='line_199'>      Dadastana, 15 an obscure town, almost at an equal distance</a>
<a id='line_200'>      between Ancyra and Nice, was marked for the fatal term of his</a>
<a id='line_201'>      journey and life. After indulging himself with a plentiful,</a>
<a id='line_202'>      perhaps an intemperate, supper, he retired to rest; and the next</a>
<a id='line_203'>      morning the emperor Jovian was found dead in his bed. The cause</a>
<a id='line_204'>      of this sudden death was variously understood. By some it was</a>
<a id='line_205'>      ascribed to the consequences of an indigestion, occasioned either</a>
<a id='line_206'>      by the quantity of the wine, or the quality of the mushrooms,</a>
<a id='line_207'>      which he had swallowed in the evening. According to others, he</a>
<a id='line_208'>      was suffocated in his sleep by the vapor of charcoal, which</a>
<a id='line_209'>      extracted from the walls of the apartment the unwholesome</a>
<a id='line_210'>      moisture of the fresh plaster. 16 But the want of a regular</a>
<a id='line_211'>      inquiry into the death of a prince, whose reign and person were</a>
<a id='line_212'>      soon forgotten, appears to have been the only circumstance which</a>
<a id='line_213'>      countenanced the malicious whispers of poison and domestic guilt.</a>
<a id='line_214'>      17 The body of Jovian was sent to Constantinople, to be interred</a>
<a id='line_215'>      with his predecessors, and the sad procession was met on the road</a>
<a id='line_216'>      by his wife Charito, the daughter of Count Lucillian; who still</a>
<a id='line_217'>      wept the recent death of her father, and was hastening to dry her</a>
<a id='line_218'>      tears in the embraces of an Imperial husband. Her disappointment</a>
<a id='line_219'>      and grief were imbittered by the anxiety of maternal tenderness.</a>
<a id='line_220'>      Six weeks before the death of Jovian, his infant son had been</a>
<a id='line_221'>      placed in the curule chair, adorned with the title of</a>
<a id='line_222'>      _Nobilissimus_, and the vain ensigns of the consulship.</a>
<a id='line_223'>      Unconscious of his fortune, the royal youth, who, from his</a>
<a id='line_224'>      grandfather, assumed the name of Varronian, was reminded only by</a>
<a id='line_225'>      the jealousy of the government, that he was the son of an</a>
<a id='line_226'>      emperor. Sixteen years afterwards he was still alive, but he had</a>
<a id='line_227'>      already been deprived of an eye; and his afflicted mother</a>
<a id='line_228'>      expected every hour, that the innocent victim would be torn from</a>
<a id='line_229'>      her arms, to appease, with his blood, the suspicions of the</a>
<a id='line_230'>      reigning prince. 18</a>

<a id='line_280'>      and military powers of the empire, the diadem was again</a>
<a id='line_281'>      unanimously offered to the pr¾fect Sallust. He enjoyed the glory</a>
<a id='line_282'>      of a second refusal: and when the virtues of the father were</a>
<a id='line_283'>      alleged in favor of his son, the pr¾fect, with the firmness of a</a>
<a id='line_284'>      disinterested patriot, declared to the electors, that the feeble</a>
<a id='line_285'>      age of the one, and the unexperienced youth of the other, were</a>
<a id='line_286'>      equally incapable of the laborious duties of government. Several</a>
<a id='line_287'>      candidates were proposed; and, after weighing the objections of</a>
<a id='line_288'>      character or situation, they were successively rejected; but, as</a>
<a id='line_289'>      soon as the name of Valentinian was pronounced, the merit of that</a>
<a id='line_290'>      officer united the suffrages of the whole assembly, and obtained</a>
<a id='line_291'>      the sincere approbation of Sallust himself. Valentinian 21 was</a>
<a id='line_292'>      the son of Count Gratian, a native of Cibalis, in Pannonia, who</a>
<a id='line_293'>      from an obscure condition had raised himself, by matchless</a>
<a id='line_294'>      strength and dexterity, to the military commands of Africa and</a>
<a id='line_295'>      Britain; from which he retired with an ample fortune and</a>
<a id='line_296'>      suspicious integrity. The rank and services of Gratian</a>
<a id='line_297'>      contributed, however, to smooth the first steps of the promotion</a>
<a id='line_298'>      of his son; and afforded him an early opportunity of displaying</a>
<a id='line_299'>      those solid and useful qualifications, which raised his character</a>
<a id='line_300'>      above the ordinary level of his fellow-soldiers. The person of</a>
<a id='line_301'>      Valentinian was tall, graceful, and majestic. His manly</a>
<a id='line_302'>      countenance, deeply marked with the impression of sense and</a>
<a id='line_303'>      spirit, inspired his friends with awe, and his enemies with fear;</a>
<a id='line_304'>      and to second the efforts of his undaunted courage, the son of</a>
<a id='line_305'>      Gratian had inherited the advantages of a strong and healthy</a>
<a id='line_306'>      constitution. By the habits of chastity and temperance, which</a>
<a id='line_307'>      restrain the appetites and invigorate the faculties, Valentinian</a>
<a id='line_308'>      preserved his own and the public esteem. The avocations of a</a>
<a id='line_309'>      military life had diverted his youth from the elegant pursuits of</a>
<a id='line_310'>      literature; 2111 he was ignorant of the Greek language, and the</a>
<a id='line_311'>      arts of rhetoric; but as the mind of the orator was never</a>
<a id='line_312'>      disconcerted by timid perplexity, he was able, as often as the</a>
<a id='line_313'>      occasion prompted him, to deliver his decided sentiments with</a>
<a id='line_314'>      bold and ready elocution. The laws of martial discipline were the</a>
<a id='line_315'>      only laws that he had studied; and he was soon distinguished by</a>
<a id='line_316'>      the laborious diligence, and inflexible severity, with which he</a>
<a id='line_317'>      discharged and enforced the duties of the camp. In the time of</a>
<a id='line_318'>      Julian he provoked the danger of disgrace, by the contempt which</a>
<a id='line_319'>      he publicly expressed for the reigning religion; 22 and it should</a>
<a id='line_320'>      seem, from his subsequent conduct, that the indiscreet and</a>
<a id='line_321'>      unseasonable freedom of Valentinian was the effect of military</a>
<a id='line_322'>      spirit, rather than of Christian zeal. He was pardoned, however,</a>
<a id='line_323'>      and still employed by a prince who esteemed his merit; 23 and in</a>
<a id='line_324'>      the various events of the Persian war, he improved the reputation</a>

<a id='line_401'>      deserved to reign, you have placed me on the throne. It is now</a>
<a id='line_402'>      _my_ duty to consult the safety and interest of the republic. The</a>

<a id='line_417'>      various banners of the cavalry and infantry, was conducted, in</a>
<a id='line_418'>      warlike pomp, to the palace of Nice. As he was sensible, however,</a>
<a id='line_419'>      of the importance of preventing some rash declaration of the</a>
<a id='line_420'>      soldiers, he consulted the assembly of the chiefs; and their real</a>
<a id='line_421'>      sentiments were concisely expressed by the generous freedom of</a>

<a id='line_425'>      The emperor, who suppressed his displeasure, without altering his</a>
<a id='line_426'>      intention, slowly proceeded from Nice to Nicomedia and</a>

<a id='line_485'>      Before Valentinian divided the provinces, he reformed the</a>
<a id='line_486'>      administration of the empire. All ranks of subjects, who had been</a>

<a id='line_505'>      the beginning of the spring. In the castle, or palace, of</a>
<a id='line_506'>      Mediana, only three miles from Naissus, they executed the solemn</a>
<a id='line_507'>      and final division of the Roman empire. 32 Valentinian bestowed</a>
<a id='line_508'>      on his brother the rich pr¾fecture of the _East_, from the Lower</a>
<a id='line_509'>      Danube to the confines of Persia; whilst he reserved for his</a>

<a id='line_514'>      former basis; but a double supply of generals and magistrates was</a>
<a id='line_515'>      required for two councils, and two courts: the division was made</a>
<a id='line_516'>      with a just regard to their peculiar merit and situation, and</a>
<a id='line_517'>      seven master-generals were soon created, either of the cavalry or</a>

<a id='line_556'>      command of the army of Mesopotamia; the public opinion already</a>

<a id='line_559'>      his enemies, that Julian, before the altar of the Moon at Carrh¾,</a>
<a id='line_560'>      had privately invested Procopius with the Imperial purple. 35 He</a>
<a id='line_561'>      endeavored, by his dutiful and submissive behavior, to disarm the</a>
<a id='line_562'>      jealousy of Jovian; resigned, without a contest, his military</a>
<a id='line_563'>      command; and retired, with his wife and family, to cultivate the</a>
<a id='line_564'>      ample patrimony which he possessed in the province of Cappadocia.</a>
<a id='line_565'>      These useful and innocent occupations were interrupted by the</a>
<a id='line_566'>      appearance of an officer with a band of soldiers, who, in the</a>

<a id='line_568'>      despatched to conduct the unfortunate Procopius either to a</a>
<a id='line_569'>      perpetual prison or an ignominious death. His presence of mind</a>
<a id='line_570'>      procured him a longer respite, and a more splendid fate. Without</a>
<a id='line_571'>      presuming to dispute the royal mandate, he requested the</a>
<a id='line_572'>      indulgence of a few moments to embrace his weeping family; and</a>
<a id='line_573'>      while the vigilance of his guards was relaxed by a plentiful</a>
<a id='line_574'>      entertainment, he dexterously escaped to the sea-coast of the</a>
<a id='line_575'>      Euxine, from whence he passed over to the country of Bosphorus.</a>
<a id='line_576'>      In that sequestered region he remained many months, exposed to</a>
<a id='line_577'>      the hardships of exile, of solitude, and of want; his melancholy</a>
<a id='line_578'>      temper brooding over his misfortunes, and his mind agitated by</a>
<a id='line_579'>      the just apprehension, that, if any accident should discover his</a>
<a id='line_580'>      name, the faithless Barbarians would violate, without much</a>
<a id='line_581'>      scruple, the laws of hospitality. In a moment of impatience and</a>
<a id='line_582'>      despair, Procopius embarked in a merchant vessel, which made sail</a>
<a id='line_583'>      for Constantinople; and boldly aspired to the rank of a</a>
<a id='line_584'>      sovereign, because he was not allowed to enjoy the security of a</a>
<a id='line_585'>      subject. At first he lurked in the villages of Bithynia,</a>
<a id='line_586'>      continually changing his habitation and his disguise. 36 By</a>
<a id='line_587'>      degrees he ventured into the capital, trusted his life and</a>
<a id='line_588'>      fortune to the fidelity of two friends, a senator and a eunuch,</a>
<a id='line_589'>      and conceived some hopes of success, from the intelligence which</a>
<a id='line_590'>      he obtained of the actual state of public affairs. The body of</a>
<a id='line_591'>      the people was infected with a spirit of discontent: they</a>
<a id='line_592'>      regretted the justice and the abilities of Sallust, who had been</a>
<a id='line_593'>      imprudently dismissed from the pr¾fecture of the East. They</a>
<a id='line_594'>      despised the character of Valens, which was rude without vigor,</a>
<a id='line_595'>      and feeble without mildness. They dreaded the influence of his</a>
<a id='line_596'>      father-in-law, the patrician Petronius, a cruel and rapacious</a>
<a id='line_597'>      minister, who rigorously exacted all the arrears of tribute that</a>
<a id='line_598'>      might remain unpaid since the reign of the emperor Aurelian. The</a>
<a id='line_599'>      circumstances were propitious to the designs of a usurper. The</a>
<a id='line_600'>      hostile measures of the Persians required the presence of Valens</a>
<a id='line_601'>      in Syria: from the Danube to the Euphrates the troops were in</a>
<a id='line_602'>      motion; and the capital was occasionally filled with the soldiers</a>
<a id='line_603'>      who passed or repassed the Thracian Bosphorus. Two cohorts of</a>
<a id='line_604'>      Gaul were persuaded to listen to the secret proposals of the</a>
<a id='line_605'>      conspirators; which were recommended by the promise of a liberal</a>
<a id='line_606'>      donative; and, as they still revered the memory of Julian, they</a>
<a id='line_607'>      easily consented to support the hereditary claim of his</a>
<a id='line_608'>      proscribed kinsman. At the dawn of day they were drawn up near</a>
<a id='line_609'>      the baths of Anastasia; and Procopius, clothed in a purple</a>
<a id='line_610'>      garment, more suitable to a player than to a monarch, appeared,</a>
<a id='line_611'>      as if he rose from the dead, in the midst of Constantinople. The</a>
<a id='line_612'>      soldiers, who were prepared for his reception, saluted their</a>
<a id='line_613'>      trembling prince with shouts of joy and vows of fidelity. Their</a>
<a id='line_614'>      numbers were soon increased by a band of sturdy peasants,</a>
<a id='line_615'>      collected from the adjacent country; and Procopius, shielded by</a>
<a id='line_616'>      the arms of his adherents, was successively conducted to the</a>
<a id='line_617'>      tribunal, the senate, and the palace. During the first moments of</a>
<a id='line_618'>      his tumultuous reign, he was astonished and terrified by the</a>
<a id='line_619'>      gloomy silence of the people; who were either ignorant of the</a>
<a id='line_620'>      cause, or apprehensive of the event. But his military strength</a>
<a id='line_621'>      was superior to any actual resistance: the malcontents flocked to</a>
<a id='line_622'>      the standard of rebellion; the poor were excited by the hopes,</a>
<a id='line_623'>      and the rich were intimidated by the fear, of a general pillage;</a>
<a id='line_624'>      and the obstinate credulity of the multitude was once more</a>
<a id='line_625'>      deceived by the promised advantages of a revolution. The</a>
<a id='line_626'>      magistrates were seized; the prisons and arsenals broke open; the</a>
<a id='line_627'>      gates, and the entrance of the harbor, were diligently occupied;</a>
<a id='line_628'>      and, in a few hours, Procopius became the absolute, though</a>
<a id='line_629'>      precarious, master of the Imperial city. 3611 The usurper</a>
<a id='line_630'>      improved this unexpected success with some degree of courage and</a>
<a id='line_631'>      dexterity. He artfully propagated the rumors and opinions the</a>
<a id='line_632'>      most favorable to his interest; while he deluded the populace by</a>
<a id='line_633'>      giving audience to the frequent, but imaginary, ambassadors of</a>
<a id='line_634'>      distant nations. The large bodies of troops stationed in the</a>
<a id='line_635'>      cities of Thrace and the fortresses of the Lower Danube, were</a>
<a id='line_636'>      gradually involved in the guilt of rebellion: and the Gothic</a>
<a id='line_637'>      princes consented to supply the sovereign of Constantinople with</a>
<a id='line_638'>      the formidable strength of several thousand auxiliaries. His</a>
<a id='line_639'>      generals passed the Bosphorus, and subdued, without an effort,</a>
<a id='line_640'>      the unarmed, but wealthy provinces of Bithynia and Asia. After an</a>
<a id='line_641'>      honorable defence, the city and island of Cyzicus yielded to his</a>
<a id='line_642'>      power; the renowned legions of the Jovians and Herculeans</a>
<a id='line_643'>      embraced the cause of the usurper, whom they were ordered to</a>
<a id='line_644'>      crush; and, as the veterans were continually augmented with new</a>
<a id='line_645'>      levies, he soon appeared at the head of an army, whose valor, as</a>
<a id='line_646'>      well as numbers, were not unequal to the greatness of the</a>
<a id='line_647'>      contest. The son of Hormisdas, 37 a youth of spirit and ability,</a>
<a id='line_648'>      condescended to draw his sword against the lawful emperor of the</a>
<a id='line_649'>      East; and the Persian prince was immediately invested with the</a>
<a id='line_650'>      ancient and extraordinary powers of a Roman Proconsul. The</a>

<a id='line_656'>      in the arms of her adopted father; and, as often as she passed</a>
<a id='line_657'>      through the ranks, the tenderness of the soldiers was inflamed</a>
<a id='line_658'>      into martial fury: 38 they recollected the glories of the house</a>
<a id='line_659'>      of Constantine, and they declared, with loyal acclamation, that</a>

<a id='line_719'>      ruin by the firmness of his ministers, and their abilities soon</a>

<a id='line_725'>      step which indicated the repentance of Valens, and satisfied the</a>
<a id='line_726'>      minds of the people. The reign of Procopius was apparently</a>
<a id='line_727'>      supported by powerful armies and obedient provinces. But many of</a>
<a id='line_728'>      the principal officers, military as well as civil, had been</a>
<a id='line_729'>      urged, either by motives of duty or interest, to withdraw</a>
<a id='line_730'>      themselves from the guilty scene; or to watch the moment of</a>
<a id='line_731'>      betraying, and deserting, the cause of the usurper. Lupicinus</a>
<a id='line_732'>      advanced by hasty marches, to bring the legions of Syria to the</a>
<a id='line_733'>      aid of Valens. Arintheus, who, in strength, beauty, and valor,</a>
<a id='line_734'>      excelled all the heroes of the age, attacked with a small troop a</a>
<a id='line_735'>      superior body of the rebels. When he beheld the faces of the</a>

<a id='line_737'>      a loud voice, to seize and deliver up their pretended leader; and</a>
<a id='line_738'>      such was the ascendant of his genius, that this extraordinary</a>
<a id='line_739'>      order was instantly obeyed. 40 Arbetio, a respectable veteran of</a>
<a id='line_740'>      the great Constantine, who had been distinguished by the honors</a>
<a id='line_741'>      of the consulship, was persuaded to leave his retirement, and</a>
<a id='line_742'>      once more to conduct an army into the field. In the heat of</a>
<a id='line_743'>      action, calmly taking off his helmet, he showed his gray hairs</a>
<a id='line_744'>      and venerable countenance: saluted the soldiers of Procopius by</a>
<a id='line_745'>      the endearing names of children and companions, and exhorted them</a>
<a id='line_746'>      no longer to support the desperate cause of a contemptible</a>
<a id='line_747'>      tyrant; but to follow their old commander, who had so often led</a>
<a id='line_748'>      them to honor and victory. In the two engagements of Thyatira 41</a>
<a id='line_749'>      and Nacolia, the unfortunate Procopius was deserted by his</a>
<a id='line_750'>      troops, who were seduced by the instructions and example of their</a>

<a id='line_966'>      In the condition of a subject, he had kissed, with trembling awe,</a>

<a id='line_968'>      reasonably expected, that the same fears, which had subdued his</a>
<a id='line_969'>      own mind, would secure the patient submission of his people. The</a>
<a id='line_970'>      favorites of Valens obtained, by the privilege of rapine and</a>
<a id='line_971'>      confiscation, the wealth which his economy would have refused. 56</a>
<a id='line_972'>      They urged, with persuasive eloquence, _that_, in all cases of</a>
<a id='line_973'>      treason, suspicion is equivalent to proof; _that_ the power</a>
<a id='line_974'>      supposes the intention, of mischief; _that_ the intention is not</a>
<a id='line_975'>      less criminal than the act; and _that_ a subject no longer</a>
<a id='line_976'>      deserves to live, if his life may threaten the safety, or disturb</a>
<a id='line_977'>      the repose, of his sovereign. The judgment of Valentinian was</a>
<a id='line_978'>      sometimes deceived, and his confidence abused; but he would have</a>
<a id='line_979'>      silenced the informers with a contemptuous smile, had they</a>
<a id='line_980'>      presumed to alarm his fortitude by the sound of danger. They</a>

<a id='line_984'>      his equals, in the bold competition of an active and ambitious</a>

<a id='line_1100'>      was his intention, that the arts of rhetoric and grammar should</a>

<a id='line_1103'>      usually proportioned to the importance of the city, the academies</a>
<a id='line_1104'>      of Rome and Constantinople claimed a just and singular</a>

<a id='line_1206'>      abused the name of religion for the dark purposes of vice and</a>

<a id='line_1208'>      more strictly proscribed: but the emperor admitted a formal</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      distinction to protect the ancient methods of divination, which</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      were approved by the senate, and exercised by the Tuscan</a>

<a id='line_1249'>      and their invectives were sometimes followed by blows. Athanasius</a>
<a id='line_1250'>      still reigned at Alexandria; the thrones of Constantinople and</a>
<a id='line_1251'>      Antioch were occupied by Arian prelates, and every episcopal</a>
<a id='line_1252'>      vacancy was the occasion of a popular tumult. The Homoousians</a>
<a id='line_1253'>      were fortified by the reconciliation of fifty-nine Macelonian, or</a>
<a id='line_1254'>      Semi-Arian, bishops; but their secret reluctance to embrace the</a>
<a id='line_1255'>      divinity of the Holy Ghost, clouded the splendor of the triumph;</a>
<a id='line_1256'>      and the declaration of Valens, who, in the first years of his</a>
<a id='line_1257'>      reign, had imitated the impartial conduct of his brother, was an</a>
<a id='line_1258'>      important victory on the side of Arianism. The two brothers had</a>
<a id='line_1259'>      passed their private life in the condition of catechumens; but</a>
<a id='line_1260'>      the piety of Valens prompted him to solicit the sacrament of</a>
<a id='line_1261'>      baptism, before he exposed his person to the dangers of a Gothic</a>
<a id='line_1262'>      war. He naturally addressed himself to Eudoxus, 66 6611 bishop of</a>
<a id='line_1263'>      the Imperial city; and if the ignorant monarch was instructed by</a>
<a id='line_1264'>      that Arian pastor in the principles of heterodox theology, his</a>
<a id='line_1265'>      misfortune, rather than his guilt, was the inevitable consequence</a>
<a id='line_1266'>      of his erroneous choice. Whatever had been the determination of</a>
<a id='line_1267'>      the emperor, he must have offended a numerous party of his</a>
<a id='line_1268'>      Christian subjects; as the leaders both of the Homoousians and of</a>
<a id='line_1269'>      the Arians believed, that, if they were not suffered to reign,</a>
<a id='line_1270'>      they were most cruelly injured and oppressed. After he had taken</a>
<a id='line_1271'>      this decisive step, it was extremely difficult for him to</a>
<a id='line_1272'>      preserve either the virtue, or the reputation of impartiality. He</a>
<a id='line_1273'>      never aspired, like Constantius, to the fame of a profound</a>
<a id='line_1274'>      theologian; but as he had received with simplicity and respect</a>
<a id='line_1275'>      the tenets of Euxodus, Valens resigned his conscience to the</a>
<a id='line_1276'>      direction of his ecclesiastical guides, and promoted, by the</a>
<a id='line_1277'>      influence of his authority, the reunion of the _Athanasian</a>
<a id='line_1278'>      heretics_ to the body of the Catholic church. At first, he pitied</a>
<a id='line_1279'>      their blindness; by degrees he was provoked at their obstinacy;</a>
<a id='line_1280'>      and he insensibly hated those sectaries to whom he was an object</a>
<a id='line_1281'>      of hatred. 67 The feeble mind of Valens was always swayed by the</a>
<a id='line_1282'>      persons with whom he familiarly conversed; and the exile or</a>
<a id='line_1283'>      imprisonment of a private citizen are the favors the most readily</a>
<a id='line_1284'>      granted in a despotic court. Such punishments were frequently</a>
<a id='line_1285'>      inflicted on the leaders of the Homoousian party; and the</a>
<a id='line_1286'>      misfortune of fourscore ecclesiastics of Constantinople, who,</a>
<a id='line_1287'>      perhaps accidentally, were burned on shipboard, was imputed to</a>
<a id='line_1288'>      the cruel and premeditated malice of the emperor, and his Arian</a>
<a id='line_1289'>      ministers. In every contest, the Catholics (if we may anticipate</a>
<a id='line_1290'>      that name) were obliged to pay the penalty of their own faults,</a>
<a id='line_1291'>      and of those of their adversaries. In every election, the claims</a>
<a id='line_1292'>      of the Arian candidate obtained the preference; and if they were</a>
<a id='line_1293'>      opposed by the majority of the people, he was usually supported</a>
<a id='line_1294'>      by the authority of the civil magistrate, or even by the terrors</a>
<a id='line_1295'>      of a military force. The enemies of Athanasius attempted to</a>
<a id='line_1296'>      disturb the last years of his venerable age; and his temporary</a>
<a id='line_1297'>      retreat to his fatherÕs sepulchre has been celebrated as a fifth</a>

<a id='line_1299'>      arms, intimidated the pr¾fect: and the archbishop was permitted</a>
<a id='line_1300'>      to end his life in peace and in glory, after a reign of</a>
<a id='line_1301'>      forty-seven years. The death of Athanasius was the signal of the</a>
<a id='line_1302'>      persecution of Egypt; and the Pagan minister of Valens, who</a>
<a id='line_1303'>      forcibly seated the worthless Lucius on the archiepiscopal</a>
<a id='line_1304'>      throne, purchased the favor of the reigning party, by the blood</a>

<a id='line_1306'>      of the heathen and Jewish worship was bitterly lamented, as a</a>
<a id='line_1307'>      circumstance which aggravated the misery of the Catholics, and</a>

<a id='line_1355'>      apprehensive, if he employed violence, of a general revolt in the</a>

<a id='line_1357'>      inflexible pride, 72 the truth of his opinions, and the dignity</a>
<a id='line_1358'>      of his rank, was left in the free possession of his conscience</a>
<a id='line_1359'>      and his throne. The emperor devoutly assisted at the solemn</a>
<a id='line_1360'>      service of the cathedral; and, instead of a sentence of</a>
<a id='line_1361'>      banishment, subscribed the donation of a valuable estate for the</a>

<a id='line_1364'>      any law (such as Theodosius afterwards enacted against the</a>

<a id='line_1366'>      and the edict which excited the most violent clamors, may not</a>
<a id='line_1367'>      appear so extremely reprehensible. The emperor had observed, that</a>
<a id='line_1368'>      several of his subjects, gratifying their lazy disposition under</a>
<a id='line_1369'>      the pretence of religion, had associated themselves with the</a>
<a id='line_1370'>      monks of Egypt; and he directed the count of the East to drag</a>

<a id='line_1373'>      temporal possessions, or of discharging the public duties of men</a>

<a id='line_1433'>      Valentinian. His edict, 77 addressed to Damasus, bishop of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_1434'>      was publicly read in the churches of the city. He admonished the</a>
<a id='line_1435'>      ecclesiastics and monks not to frequent the houses of widows and</a>
<a id='line_1436'>      virgins; and menaced their disobedience with the animadversion of</a>
<a id='line_1437'>      the civil judge. The director was no longer permitted to receive</a>
<a id='line_1438'>      any gift, or legacy, or inheritance, from the liberality of his</a>
<a id='line_1439'>      spiritual-daughter: every testament contrary to this edict was</a>
<a id='line_1440'>      declared null and void; and the illegal donation was confiscated</a>
<a id='line_1441'>      for the use of the treasury. By a subsequent regulation, it</a>
<a id='line_1442'>      should seem, that the same provisions were extended to nuns and</a>
<a id='line_1443'>      bishops; and that all persons of the ecclesiastical order were</a>
<a id='line_1444'>      rendered incapable of receiving any testamentary gifts, and</a>
<a id='line_1445'>      strictly confined to the natural and legal rights of inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_1446'>      As the guardian of domestic happiness and virtue, Valentinian</a>
<a id='line_1447'>      applied this severe remedy to the growing evil. In the capital of</a>
<a id='line_1448'>      the empire, the females of noble and opulent houses possessed a</a>
<a id='line_1449'>      very ample share of independent property: and many of those</a>
<a id='line_1450'>      devout females had embraced the doctrines of Christianity, not</a>
<a id='line_1451'>      only with the cold assent of the understanding, but with the</a>
<a id='line_1452'>      warmth of affection, and perhaps with the eagerness of fashion.</a>
<a id='line_1453'>      They sacrificed the pleasures of dress and luxury; and renounced,</a>
<a id='line_1454'>      for the praise of chastity, the soft endearments of conjugal</a>
<a id='line_1455'>      society. Some ecclesiastic, of real or apparent sanctity, was</a>
<a id='line_1456'>      chosen to direct their timorous conscience, and to amuse the</a>
<a id='line_1457'>      vacant tenderness of their heart: and the unbounded confidence,</a>
<a id='line_1458'>      which they hastily bestowed, was often abused by knaves and</a>
<a id='line_1459'>      enthusiasts; who hastened from the extremities of the East, to</a>
<a id='line_1460'>      enjoy, on a splendid theatre, the privileges of the monastic</a>
<a id='line_1461'>      profession. By their contempt of the world, they insensibly</a>
<a id='line_1462'>      acquired its most desirable advantages; the lively attachment,</a>
<a id='line_1463'>      perhaps of a young and beautiful woman, the delicate plenty of an</a>
<a id='line_1464'>      opulent household, and the respectful homage of the slaves, the</a>
<a id='line_1465'>      freedmen, and the clients of a senatorial family. The immense</a>
<a id='line_1466'>      fortunes of the Roman ladies were gradually consumed in lavish</a>
<a id='line_1467'>      alms and expensive pilgrimages; and the artful monk, who had</a>
<a id='line_1468'>      assigned himself the first, or possibly the sole place, in the</a>
<a id='line_1469'>      testament of his spiritual daughter, still presumed to declare,</a>
<a id='line_1470'>      with the smooth face of hypocrisy, that _he_ was only the</a>
<a id='line_1471'>      instrument of charity, and the steward of the poor. The</a>
<a id='line_1472'>      lucrative, but disgraceful, trade, 78 which was exercised by the</a>
<a id='line_1473'>      clergy to defraud the expectations of the natural heirs, had</a>

<a id='line_1526'>      the quarrel was maintained by the wounds and death of their</a>
<a id='line_1527'>      followers; and the pr¾fect, unable to resist or appease the</a>
<a id='line_1528'>      tumult, was constrained, by superior violence, to retire into the</a>
<a id='line_1529'>      suburbs. Damasus prevailed: the well-disputed victory remained on</a>

<a id='line_1620'>      When the suffrage of the generals and of the army committed the</a>
<a id='line_1621'>      sceptre of the Roman empire to the hands of Valentinian, his</a>
<a id='line_1622'>      reputation in arms, his military skill and experience, and his</a>
<a id='line_1623'>      rigid attachment to the forms, as well as spirit, of ancient</a>
<a id='line_1624'>      discipline, were the principal motives of their judicious choice.</a>
<a id='line_1625'></a>
<a id='line_1626'>      The eagerness of the troops, who pressed him to nominate his</a>
<a id='line_1627'>      colleague, was justified by the dangerous situation of public</a>
<a id='line_1628'>      affairs; and Valentinian himself was conscious, that the</a>
<a id='line_1629'>      abilities of the most active mind were unequal to the defence of</a>
<a id='line_1630'>      the distant frontiers of an invaded monarchy. As soon as the</a>
<a id='line_1631'>      death of Julian had relieved the Barbarians from the terror of</a>
<a id='line_1632'>      his name, the most sanguine hopes of rapine and conquest excited</a>
<a id='line_1633'>      the nations of the East, of the North, and of the South. Their</a>
<a id='line_1634'>      inroads were often vexatious, and sometimes formidable; but,</a>
<a id='line_1635'>      during the twelve years of the reign of Valentinian, his firmness</a>
<a id='line_1636'>      and vigilance protected his own dominions; and his powerful</a>

<a id='line_1639'>      the urgent and divided cares of the two emperors; but the</a>

<a id='line_1648'>      and haughty behavior of Ursacius, master of the offices; 88 who</a>
<a id='line_1649'>      by an act of unseasonable parsimony, had diminished the value, as</a>
<a id='line_1650'>      well as the quantity, of the presents to which they were</a>
<a id='line_1651'>      entitled, either from custom or treaty, on the accession of a new</a>
<a id='line_1652'>      emperor. They expressed, and they communicated to their</a>
<a id='line_1653'>      countrymen, their strong sense of the national affront. The</a>
<a id='line_1654'>      irascible minds of the chiefs were exasperated by the suspicion</a>
<a id='line_1655'>      of contempt; and the martial youth crowded to their standard.</a>
<a id='line_1656'>      Before Valentinian could pass the Alps, the villages of Gaul were</a>
<a id='line_1657'>      in flames; before his general Degalaiphus could encounter the</a>
<a id='line_1658'>      Alemanni, they had secured the captives and the spoil in the</a>
<a id='line_1659'>      forests of Germany. In the beginning of the ensuing year, the</a>
<a id='line_1660'>      military force of the whole nation, in deep and solid columns,</a>
<a id='line_1661'>      broke through the barrier of the Rhine, during the severity of a</a>
<a id='line_1662'>      northern winter. Two Roman counts were defeated and mortally</a>
<a id='line_1663'>      wounded; and the standard of the Heruli and Batavians fell into</a>
<a id='line_1664'>      the hands of the conquerors, who displayed, with insulting shouts</a>
<a id='line_1665'>      and menaces, the trophy of their victory. The standard was</a>
<a id='line_1666'>      recovered; but the Batavians had not redeemed the shame of their</a>
<a id='line_1667'>      disgrace and flight in the eyes of their severe judge. It was the</a>
<a id='line_1668'>      opinion of Valentinian, that his soldiers must learn to fear</a>
<a id='line_1669'>      their commander, before they could cease to fear the enemy. The</a>
<a id='line_1670'>      troops were solemnly assembled; and the trembling Batavians were</a>
<a id='line_1671'>      enclosed within the circle of the Imperial army. Valentinian then</a>
<a id='line_1672'>      ascended his tribunal; and, as if he disdained to punish</a>
<a id='line_1673'>      cowardice with death, he inflicted a stain of indelible ignominy</a>
<a id='line_1674'>      on the officers, whose misconduct and pusillanimity were found to</a>
<a id='line_1675'>      be the first occasion of the defeat. The Batavians were degraded</a>
<a id='line_1676'>      from their rank, stripped of their arms, and condemned to be sold</a>
<a id='line_1677'>      for slaves to the highest bidder. At this tremendous sentence,</a>
<a id='line_1678'>      the troops fell prostrate on the ground, deprecated the</a>
<a id='line_1679'>      indignation of their sovereign, and protested, that, if he would</a>
<a id='line_1680'>      indulge them in another trial, they would approve themselves not</a>
<a id='line_1681'>      unworthy of the name of Romans, and of his soldiers. Valentinian,</a>
<a id='line_1682'>      with affected reluctance, yielded to their entreaties; the</a>
<a id='line_1683'>      Batavians resumed their arms, and with their arms, the invincible</a>
<a id='line_1684'>      resolution of wiping away their disgrace in the blood of the</a>
<a id='line_1685'>      Alemanni. 89 The principal command was declined by Dagalaiphus;</a>
<a id='line_1686'>      and that experienced general, who had represented, perhaps with</a>
<a id='line_1687'>      too much prudence, the extreme difficulties of the undertaking,</a>
<a id='line_1688'>      had the mortification, before the end of the campaign, of seeing</a>
<a id='line_1689'>      his rival Jovinus convert those difficulties into a decisive</a>
<a id='line_1690'>      advantage over the scattered forces of the Barbarians. At the</a>
<a id='line_1691'>      head of a well-disciplined army of cavalry, infantry, and light</a>
<a id='line_1692'>      troops, Jovinus advanced, with cautious and rapid steps, to</a>
<a id='line_1693'>      Scarponna, 90 9011 in the territory of Metz, where he surprised a</a>
<a id='line_1694'>      large division of the Alemanni, before they had time to run to</a>
<a id='line_1695'>      their arms; and flushed his soldiers with the confidence of an</a>
<a id='line_1696'>      easy and bloodless victory. Another division, or rather army, of</a>
<a id='line_1697'>      the enemy, after the cruel and wanton devastation of the adjacent</a>
<a id='line_1698'>      country, reposed themselves on the shady banks of the Moselle.</a>
<a id='line_1699'>      Jovinus, who had viewed the ground with the eye of a general,</a>
<a id='line_1700'>      made a silent approach through a deep and woody vale, till he</a>
<a id='line_1701'>      could distinctly perceive the indolent security of the Germans.</a>
<a id='line_1702'>      Some were bathing their huge limbs in the river; others were</a>
<a id='line_1703'>      combing their long and flaxen hair; others again were swallowing</a>
<a id='line_1704'>      large draughts of rich and delicious wine. On a sudden they heard</a>
<a id='line_1705'>      the sound of the Roman trumpet; they saw the enemy in their camp.</a>
<a id='line_1706'>      Astonishment produced disorder; disorder was followed by flight</a>
<a id='line_1707'>      and dismay; and the confused multitude of the bravest warriors</a>
<a id='line_1708'>      was pierced by the swords and javelins of the legionaries and</a>
<a id='line_1709'>      auxiliaries. The fugitives escaped to the third, and most</a>
<a id='line_1710'>      considerable, camp, in the Catalonian plains, near Ch‰lons in</a>
<a id='line_1711'>      Champagne: the straggling detachments were hastily recalled to</a>
<a id='line_1712'>      their standard; and the Barbarian chiefs, alarmed and admonished</a>
<a id='line_1713'>      by the fate of their companions, prepared to encounter, in a</a>
<a id='line_1714'>      decisive battle, the victorious forces of the lieutenant of</a>
<a id='line_1715'>      Valentinian. The bloody and obstinate conflict lasted a whole</a>
<a id='line_1716'>      summerÕs day, with equal valor, and with alternate success. The</a>
<a id='line_1717'>      Romans at length prevailed, with the loss of about twelve hundred</a>
<a id='line_1718'>      men. Six thousand of the Alemanni were slain, four thousand were</a>
<a id='line_1719'>      wounded; and the brave Jovinus, after chasing the flying remnant</a>
<a id='line_1720'>      of their host as far as the banks of the Rhine, returned to</a>
<a id='line_1721'>      Paris, to receive the applause of his sovereign, and the ensigns</a>
<a id='line_1722'>      of the consulship for the ensuing year. 91 The triumph of the</a>
<a id='line_1723'>      Romans was indeed sullied by their treatment of the captive king,</a>
<a id='line_1724'>      whom they hung on a gibbet, without the knowledge of their</a>
<a id='line_1725'>      indignant general. This disgraceful act of cruelty, which might</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      be imputed to the fury of the troops, was followed by the</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      deliberate murder of Withicab, the son of Vadomair; a German</a>
<a id='line_1728'>      prince, of a weak and sickly constitution, but of a daring and</a>
<a id='line_1729'>      formidable spirit. The domestic assassin was instigated and</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      protected by the Romans; 92 and the violation of the laws of</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      humanity and justice betrayed their secret apprehension of the</a>

<a id='line_1761'>      of the Upper Germany. In the unsuspicious moment of a Christian</a>

<a id='line_1764'>      defenceless town, and retired with a multitude of captives of</a>
<a id='line_1765'>      either sex. Valentinian resolved to execute severe vengeance on</a>
<a id='line_1766'>      the whole body of the nation. Count Sebastian, with the bands of</a>
<a id='line_1767'>      Italy and Illyricum, was ordered to invade their country, most</a>
<a id='line_1768'>      probably on the side of Rh¾tia. The emperor in person,</a>
<a id='line_1769'>      accompanied by his son Gratian, passed the Rhine at the head of a</a>
<a id='line_1770'>      formidable army, which was supported on both flanks by Jovinus</a>
<a id='line_1771'>      and Severus, the two masters-general of the cavalry and infantry</a>
<a id='line_1772'>      of the West. The Alemanni, unable to prevent the devastation of</a>

<a id='line_1774'>      inaccessible, mountain, in the modern duchy of Wirtemberg, and</a>
<a id='line_1775'>      resolutely expected the approach of the Romans. The life of</a>

<a id='line_1777'>      curiosity with which he persisted to explore some secret and</a>
<a id='line_1778'>      unguarded path. A troop of Barbarians suddenly rose from their</a>
<a id='line_1779'>      ambuscade: and the emperor, who vigorously spurred his horse down</a>
<a id='line_1780'>      a steep and slippery descent, was obliged to leave behind him his</a>
<a id='line_1781'>      armor-bearer, and his helmet, magnificently enriched with gold</a>
<a id='line_1782'>      and precious stones. At the signal of the general assault, the</a>
<a id='line_1783'>      Roman troops encompassed and ascended the mountain of Solicinium</a>
<a id='line_1784'>      on three different sides. 9212 Every step which they gained,</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      increased their ardor, and abated the resistance of the enemy:</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      and after their united forces had occupied the summit of the</a>
<a id='line_1787'>      hill, they impetuously urged the Barbarians down the northern</a>
<a id='line_1788'>      descent, where Count Sebastian was posted to intercept their</a>
<a id='line_1789'>      retreat. After this signal victory, Valentinian returned to his</a>
<a id='line_1790'>      winter quarters at Treves; where he indulged the public joy by</a>
<a id='line_1791'>      the exhibition of splendid and triumphal games. 93 But the wise</a>

<a id='line_1875'>      fourth century, the countries, perhaps of Lusace and Thuringia,</a>
<a id='line_1876'>      on either side of the Elbe, were occupied by the vague dominion</a>

<a id='line_1878'>      Vandal race, 96 whose obscure name insensibly swelled into a</a>
<a id='line_1879'>      powerful kingdom, and has finally settled on a flourishing</a>
<a id='line_1880'>      province. The most remarkable circumstance in the ancient manners</a>
<a id='line_1881'>      of the Burgundians appears to have been the difference of their</a>
<a id='line_1882'>      civil and ecclesiastical constitution. The appellation of</a>
<a id='line_1883'>      _Hendinos_ was given to the king or general, and the title of</a>
<a id='line_1884'>      _Sinistus_ to the high priest, of the nation. The person of the</a>
<a id='line_1885'>      priest was sacred, and his dignity perpetual; but the temporal</a>
<a id='line_1886'>      government was held by a very precarious tenure. If the events of</a>
<a id='line_1887'>      war accuses the courage or conduct of the king, he was</a>
<a id='line_1888'>      immediately deposed; and the injustice of his subjects made him</a>
<a id='line_1889'>      responsible for the fertility of the earth, and the regularity of</a>
<a id='line_1890'>      the seasons, which seemed to fall more properly within the</a>
<a id='line_1891'>      sacerdotal department. 97 The disputed possession of some</a>
<a id='line_1892'>      salt-pits 98 engaged the Alemanni and the Burgundians in frequent</a>
<a id='line_1893'>      contests: the latter were easily tempted, by the secret</a>
<a id='line_1894'>      solicitations and liberal offers of the emperor; and their</a>
<a id='line_1895'>      fabulous descent from the Roman soldiers, who had formerly been</a>
<a id='line_1896'>      left to garrison the fortresses of Drusus, was admitted with</a>
<a id='line_1897'>      mutual credulity, as it was conducive to mutual interest. 99 An</a>
<a id='line_1898'>      army of fourscore thousand Burgundians soon appeared on the banks</a>
<a id='line_1899'>      of the Rhine; and impatiently required the support and subsidies</a>
<a id='line_1900'>      which Valentinian had promised: but they were amused with excuses</a>
<a id='line_1901'>      and delays, till at length, after a fruitless expectation, they</a>
<a id='line_1902'>      were compelled to retire. The arms and fortifications of the</a>
<a id='line_1903'>      Gallic frontier checked the fury of their just resentment; and</a>
<a id='line_1904'>      their massacre of the captives served to imbitter the hereditary</a>
<a id='line_1905'>      feud of the Burgundians and the Alemanni. The inconstancy of a</a>
<a id='line_1906'>      wise prince may, perhaps, be explained by some alteration of</a>
<a id='line_1907'>      circumstances; and perhaps it was the original design of</a>
<a id='line_1908'>      Valentinian to intimidate, rather than to destroy; as the balance</a>
<a id='line_1909'>      of power would have been equally overturned by the extirpation of</a>
<a id='line_1910'>      either of the German nations. Among the princes of the Alemanni,</a>
<a id='line_1911'>      Macrianus, who, with a Roman name, had assumed the arts of a</a>
<a id='line_1912'>      soldier and a statesman, deserved his hatred and esteem. The</a>

<a id='line_1979'>      solitude of their woods and mountains. Every tide might float</a>
<a id='line_1980'>      down the Elbe whole fleets of canoes, filled with hardy and</a>
<a id='line_1981'>      intrepid associates, who aspired to behold the unbounded prospect</a>
<a id='line_1982'>      of the ocean, and to taste the wealth and luxury of unknown</a>
<a id='line_1983'>      worlds. It should seem probable, however, that the most numerous</a>
<a id='line_1984'>      auxiliaries of the Saxons were furnished by the nations who dwelt</a>
<a id='line_1985'>      along the shores of the Baltic. They possessed arms and ships,</a>
<a id='line_1986'>      the art of navigation, and the habits of naval war; but the</a>
<a id='line_1987'>      difficulty of issuing through the northern columns of Hercules</a>
<a id='line_1988'>      103 (which, during several months of the year, are obstructed</a>
<a id='line_1989'>      with ice) confined their skill and courage within the limits of a</a>
<a id='line_1990'>      spacious lake. The rumor of the successful armaments which sailed</a>
<a id='line_1991'>      from the mouth of the Elbe, would soon provoke them to cross the</a>
<a id='line_1992'>      narrow isthmus of Sleswig, and to launch their vessels on the</a>
<a id='line_1993'>      great sea. The various troops of pirates and adventurers, who</a>
<a id='line_1994'>      fought under the same standard, were insensibly united in a</a>
<a id='line_1995'>      permanent society, at first of rapine, and afterwards of</a>
<a id='line_1996'>      government. A military confederation was gradually moulded into a</a>
<a id='line_1997'>      national body, by the gentle operation of marriage and</a>
<a id='line_1998'>      consanguinity; and the adjacent tribes, who solicited the</a>
<a id='line_1999'>      alliance, accepted the name and laws, of the Saxons. If the fact</a>
<a id='line_2000'>      were not established by the most unquestionable evidence, we</a>
<a id='line_2001'>      should appear to abuse the credulity of our readers, by the</a>
<a id='line_2002'>      description of the vessels in which the Saxon pirates ventured to</a>
<a id='line_2003'>      sport in the waves of the German Ocean, the British Channel, and</a>
<a id='line_2004'>      the Bay of Biscay. The keel of their large flat-bottomed boats</a>
<a id='line_2005'>      were framed of light timber, but the sides and upper works</a>
<a id='line_2006'>      consisted only of wicker, with a covering of strong hides. 104 In</a>
<a id='line_2007'>      the course of their slow and distant navigations, they must</a>
<a id='line_2008'>      always have been exposed to the danger, and very frequently to</a>
<a id='line_2009'>      the misfortune, of shipwreck; and the naval annals of the Saxons</a>
<a id='line_2010'>      were undoubtedly filled with the accounts of the losses which</a>
<a id='line_2011'>      they sustained on the coasts of Britain and Gaul. But the daring</a>
<a id='line_2012'>      spirit of the pirates braved the perils both of the sea and of</a>
<a id='line_2013'>      the shore: their skill was confirmed by the habits of enterprise;</a>
<a id='line_2014'>      the meanest of their mariners was alike capable of handling an</a>
<a id='line_2015'>      oar, of rearing a sail, or of conducting a vessel, and the Saxons</a>
<a id='line_2016'>      rejoiced in the appearance of a tempest, which concealed their</a>
<a id='line_2017'>      design, and dispersed the fleets of the enemy. 105 After they had</a>
<a id='line_2018'>      acquired an accurate knowledge of the maritime provinces of the</a>
<a id='line_2019'>      West, they extended the scene of their depredations, and the most</a>
<a id='line_2020'>      sequestered places had no reason to presume on their security.</a>
<a id='line_2021'>      The Saxon boats drew so little water that they could easily</a>
<a id='line_2022'>      proceed fourscore or a hundred miles up the great rivers; their</a>
<a id='line_2023'>      weight was so inconsiderable, that they were transported on</a>
<a id='line_2024'>      wagons from one river to another; and the pirates who had entered</a>
<a id='line_2025'>      the mouth of the Seine, or of the Rhine, might descend, with the</a>
<a id='line_2026'>      rapid stream of the Rhone, into the Mediterranean. Under the</a>
<a id='line_2027'>      reign of Valentinian, the maritime provinces of Gaul were</a>
<a id='line_2028'>      afflicted by the Saxons: a military count was stationed for the</a>
<a id='line_2029'>      defence of the sea-coast, or Armorican limit; and that officer,</a>
<a id='line_2030'>      who found his strength, or his abilities, unequal to the task,</a>
<a id='line_2031'>      implored the assistance of Severus, master-general of the</a>
<a id='line_2032'>      infantry. The Saxons, surrounded and outnumbered, were forced to</a>
<a id='line_2033'>      relinquish their spoil, and to yield a select band of their tall</a>
<a id='line_2034'>      and robust youth to serve in the Imperial armies. They stipulated</a>
<a id='line_2035'>      only a safe and honorable retreat; and the condition was readily</a>
<a id='line_2036'>      granted by the Roman general, who meditated an act of perfidy,</a>
<a id='line_2037'>      106 imprudent as it was inhuman, while a Saxon remained alive,</a>
<a id='line_2038'>      and in arms, to revenge the fate of their countrymen. The</a>
<a id='line_2039'>      premature eagerness of the infantry, who were secretly posted in</a>
<a id='line_2040'>      a deep valley, betrayed the ambuscade; and they would perhaps</a>
<a id='line_2041'>      have fallen the victims of their own treachery, if a large body</a>
<a id='line_2042'>      of cuirassiers, alarmed by the noise of the combat, had not</a>
<a id='line_2043'>      hastily advanced to extricate their companions, and to overwhelm</a>
<a id='line_2044'>      the undaunted valor of the Saxons. Some of the prisoners were</a>
<a id='line_2045'>      saved from the edge of the sword, to shed their blood in the</a>
<a id='line_2046'>      amphitheatre; and the orator Symmachus complains, that</a>
<a id='line_2047'>      twenty-nine of those desperate savages, by strangling themselves</a>
<a id='line_2048'>      with their own hands, had disappointed the amusement of the</a>

<a id='line_2050'>      impressed with the deepest horror, when they were informed, that</a>

<a id='line_2106'>      the adjacent continent of Gaul. From the coast of Kent, to the</a>

<a id='line_2108'>      was distinctly preserved, in the perpetual resemblance of</a>
<a id='line_2109'>      language, of religion, and of manners; and the peculiar</a>
<a id='line_2110'>      characters of the British tribes might be naturally ascribed to</a>
<a id='line_2111'>      the influence of accidental and local circumstances. 109 The</a>
<a id='line_2112'>      Roman Province was reduced to the state of civilized and peaceful</a>
<a id='line_2113'>      servitude; the rights of savage freedom were contracted to the</a>
<a id='line_2114'>      narrow limits of Caledonia. The inhabitants of that northern</a>
<a id='line_2115'>      region were divided, as early as the reign of Constantine,</a>
<a id='line_2116'>      between the two great tribes of the Scots and of the Picts, 110</a>
<a id='line_2117'>      who have since experienced a very different fortune. The power,</a>
<a id='line_2118'>      and almost the memory, of the Picts have been extinguished by</a>
<a id='line_2119'>      their successful rivals; and the Scots, after maintaining for</a>
<a id='line_2120'>      ages the dignity of an independent kingdom, have multiplied, by</a>
<a id='line_2121'>      an equal and voluntary union, the honors of the English name. The</a>
<a id='line_2122'>      hand of nature had contributed to mark the ancient distinctions</a>
<a id='line_2123'>      of the Scots and Picts. The former were the men of the hills, and</a>
<a id='line_2124'>      the latter those of the plain. The eastern coast of Caledonia may</a>
<a id='line_2125'>      be considered as a level and fertile country, which, even in a</a>
<a id='line_2126'>      rude state of tillage, was capable of producing a considerable</a>
<a id='line_2127'>      quantity of corn; and the epithet of _cruitnich_, or</a>
<a id='line_2128'>      wheat-eaters, expressed the contempt or envy of the carnivorous</a>
<a id='line_2129'>      highlander. The cultivation of the earth might introduce a more</a>
<a id='line_2130'>      accurate separation of property, and the habits of a sedentary</a>
<a id='line_2131'>      life; but the love of arms and rapine was still the ruling</a>
<a id='line_2132'>      passion of the Picts; and their warriors, who stripped themselves</a>
<a id='line_2133'>      for a day of battle, were distinguished, in the eyes of the</a>
<a id='line_2134'>      Romans, by the strange fashion of painting their naked bodies</a>
<a id='line_2135'>      with gaudy colors and fantastic figures. The western part of</a>
<a id='line_2136'>      Caledonia irregularly rises into wild and barren hills, which</a>
<a id='line_2137'>      scarcely repay the toil of the husbandman, and are most</a>
<a id='line_2138'>      profitably used for the pasture of cattle. The highlanders were</a>
<a id='line_2139'>      condemned to the occupations of shepherds and hunters; and, as</a>
<a id='line_2140'>      they seldom were fixed to any permanent habitation, they acquired</a>
<a id='line_2141'>      the expressive name of Scots, which, in the Celtic tongue, is</a>
<a id='line_2142'>      said to be equivalent to that of _wanderers_, or _vagrants_. The</a>
<a id='line_2143'>      inhabitants of a barren land were urged to seek a fresh supply of</a>
<a id='line_2144'>      food in the waters. The deep lakes and bays which intersect their</a>
<a id='line_2145'>      country, are plentifully supplied with fish; and they gradually</a>
<a id='line_2146'>      ventured to cast their nets in the waves of the ocean. The</a>
<a id='line_2147'>      vicinity of the Hebrides, so profusely scattered along the</a>
<a id='line_2148'>      western coast of Scotland, tempted their curiosity, and improved</a>
<a id='line_2149'>      their skill; and they acquired, by slow degrees, the art, or</a>
<a id='line_2150'>      rather the habit, of managing their boats in a tempestuous sea,</a>
<a id='line_2151'>      and of steering their nocturnal course by the light of the</a>
<a id='line_2152'>      well-known stars. The two bold headlands of Caledonia almost</a>
<a id='line_2153'>      touch the shores of a spacious island, which obtained, from its</a>
<a id='line_2154'>      luxuriant vegetation, the epithet of _Green;_ and has preserved,</a>
<a id='line_2155'>      with a slight alteration, the name of Erin, or Ierne, or Ireland.</a>
<a id='line_2156'>      It is _probable_, that in some remote period of antiquity, the</a>
<a id='line_2157'>      fertile plains of Ulster received a colony of hungry Scots; and</a>
<a id='line_2158'>      that the strangers of the North, who had dared to encounter the</a>
<a id='line_2159'>      arms of the legions, spread their conquests over the savage and</a>
<a id='line_2160'>      unwarlike natives of a solitary island. It is _certain_, that, in</a>
<a id='line_2161'>      the declining age of the Roman empire, Caledonia, Ireland, and</a>
<a id='line_2162'>      the Isle of Man, were inhabited by the Scots, and that the</a>
<a id='line_2163'>      kindred tribes, who were often associated in military enterprise,</a>
<a id='line_2164'>      were deeply affected by the various accidents of their mutual</a>
<a id='line_2165'>      fortunes. They long cherished the lively tradition of their</a>
<a id='line_2166'>      common name and origin; and the missionaries of the Isle of</a>
<a id='line_2167'>      Saints, who diffused the light of Christianity over North</a>
<a id='line_2168'>      Britain, established the vain opinion, that their Irish</a>

<a id='line_2224'>      Irish tribes, which are mentioned by Ptolemy, (A.D. 150,) were of</a>

<a id='line_2230'>      the cousin of Ossian, who was transplanted (A.D. 320) from</a>
<a id='line_2231'>      Ireland to Caledonia, is built on a conjectural supplement to the</a>
<a id='line_2232'>      Erse poetry, and the feeble evidence of Richard of Cirencester, a</a>
<a id='line_2233'>      monk of the fourteenth century. The lively spirit of the learned</a>

<a id='line_2258'>      the harbor of Sandwich. 112 The calamities which the afflicted</a>
<a id='line_2259'>      provincials continued to experience, from foreign war and</a>
<a id='line_2260'>      domestic tyranny, were aggravated by the feeble and corrupt</a>
<a id='line_2261'>      administration of the eunuchs of Constantius; and the transient</a>
<a id='line_2262'>      relief which they might obtain from the virtues of Julian, was</a>
<a id='line_2263'>      soon lost by the absence and death of their benefactor. The sums</a>
<a id='line_2264'>      of gold and silver, which had been painfully collected, or</a>
<a id='line_2265'>      liberally transmitted, for the payment of the troops, were</a>
<a id='line_2266'>      intercepted by the avarice of the commanders; discharges, or, at</a>
<a id='line_2267'>      least, exemptions, from the military service, were publicly sold;</a>
<a id='line_2268'>      the distress of the soldiers, who were injuriously deprived of</a>
<a id='line_2269'>      their legal and scanty subsistence, provoked them to frequent</a>
<a id='line_2270'>      desertion; the nerves of discipline were relaxed, and the</a>
<a id='line_2271'>      highways were infested with robbers. 113 The oppression of the</a>
<a id='line_2272'>      good, and the impunity of the wicked, equally contributed to</a>
<a id='line_2273'>      diffuse through the island a spirit of discontent and revolt; and</a>
<a id='line_2274'>      every ambitious subject, every desperate exile, might entertain a</a>
<a id='line_2275'>      reasonable hope of subverting the weak and distracted government</a>
<a id='line_2276'>      of Britain. The hostile tribes of the North, who detested the</a>
<a id='line_2277'>      pride and power of the King of the World, suspended their</a>
<a id='line_2278'>      domestic feuds; and the Barbarians of the land and sea, the</a>
<a id='line_2279'>      Scots, the Picts, and the Saxons, spread themselves with rapid</a>
<a id='line_2280'>      and irresistible fury, from the wall of Antoninus to the shores</a>
<a id='line_2281'>      of Kent. Every production of art and nature, every object of</a>
<a id='line_2282'>      convenience and luxury, which they were incapable of creating by</a>
<a id='line_2283'>      labor or procuring by trade, was accumulated in the rich and</a>
<a id='line_2284'>      fruitful province of Britain. 114 A philosopher may deplore the</a>
<a id='line_2285'>      eternal discords of the human race, but he will confess, that the</a>
<a id='line_2286'>      desire of spoil is a more rational provocation than the vanity of</a>
<a id='line_2287'>      conquest. From the age of Constantine to the Plantagenets, this</a>

<a id='line_2290'>      to inspire the songs of Ossian, was disgraced by a savage</a>
<a id='line_2291'>      ignorance of the virtues of peace, and of the laws of war. Their</a>
<a id='line_2292'>      southern neighbors have felt, and perhaps exaggerated, the cruel</a>

<a id='line_2296'>      delighting in the taste of human flesh. When they hunted the</a>
<a id='line_2297'>      woods for prey, it is said, that they attacked the shepherd</a>

<a id='line_2369'>      consultation, the defence, or rather the recovery, of Britain was</a>
<a id='line_2370'>      intrusted to the abilities of the brave Theodosius. The exploits</a>
<a id='line_2371'>      of that general, the father of a line of emperors, have been</a>
<a id='line_2372'>      celebrated, with peculiar complacency, by the writers of the age:</a>

<a id='line_2374'>      was received, by the army and province, as a sure presage of</a>
<a id='line_2375'>      approaching victory. He seized the favorable moment of</a>
<a id='line_2376'>      navigation, and securely landed the numerous and veteran bands of</a>
<a id='line_2377'>      the Heruli and Batavians, the Jovians and the Victors. In his</a>
<a id='line_2378'>      march from Sandwich to London, Theodosius defeated several</a>

<a id='line_2380'>      after distributing to his soldiers a small portion of the spoil,</a>

<a id='line_2383'>      London, who had almost despaired of their safety, threw open</a>
<a id='line_2384'>      their gates; and as soon as Theodosius had obtained from the</a>
<a id='line_2385'>      court of Treves the important aid of a military lieutenant, and a</a>
<a id='line_2386'>      civil governor, he executed, with wisdom and vigor, the laborious</a>
<a id='line_2387'>      task of the deliverance of Britain. The vagrant soldiers were</a>
<a id='line_2388'>      recalled to their standard; an edict of amnesty dispelled the</a>
<a id='line_2389'>      public apprehensions; and his cheerful example alleviated the</a>
<a id='line_2390'>      rigor of martial discipline. The scattered and desultory warfare</a>
<a id='line_2391'>      of the Barbarians, who infested the land and sea, deprived him of</a>
<a id='line_2392'>      the glory of a signal victory; but the prudent spirit, and</a>
<a id='line_2393'>      consummate art, of the Roman general, were displayed in the</a>
<a id='line_2394'>      operations of two campaigns, which successively rescued every</a>
<a id='line_2395'>      part of the province from the hands of a cruel and rapacious</a>
<a id='line_2396'>      enemy. The splendor of the cities, and the security of the</a>
<a id='line_2397'>      fortifications, were diligently restored, by the paternal care of</a>
<a id='line_2398'>      Theodosius; who with a strong hand confined the trembling</a>

<a id='line_2518'>      doubt whether he should assume the diadem of a Moorish king, or</a>
<a id='line_2519'>      the purple of a Roman emperor. But the imprudent and unhappy</a>
<a id='line_2520'>      Africans soon discovered, that, in this rash insurrection, they</a>
<a id='line_2521'>      had not sufficiently consulted their own strength, or the</a>
<a id='line_2522'>      abilities of their leader. Before he could procure any certain</a>
<a id='line_2523'>      intelligence, that the emperor of the West had fixed the choice</a>
<a id='line_2524'>      of a general, or that a fleet of transports was collected at the</a>
<a id='line_2525'>      mouth of the Rhone, he was suddenly informed that the great</a>
<a id='line_2526'>      Theodosius, with a small band of veterans, had landed near</a>
<a id='line_2527'>      Igilgilis, or Gigeri, on the African coast; and the timid usurper</a>
<a id='line_2528'>      sunk under the ascendant of virtue and military genius. Though</a>
<a id='line_2529'>      Firmus possessed arms and treasures, his despair of victory</a>
<a id='line_2530'>      immediately reduced him to the use of those arts, which, in the</a>
<a id='line_2531'>      same country, and in a similar situation, had formerly been</a>
<a id='line_2532'>      practised by the crafty Jugurtha. He attempted to deceive, by an</a>
<a id='line_2533'>      apparent submission, the vigilance of the Roman general; to</a>
<a id='line_2534'>      seduce the fidelity of his troops; and to protract the duration</a>
<a id='line_2535'>      of the war, by successively engaging the independent tribes of</a>
<a id='line_2536'>      Africa to espouse his quarrel, or to protect his flight.</a>
<a id='line_2537'>      Theodosius imitated the example, and obtained the success, of his</a>
<a id='line_2538'>      predecessor Metellus. When Firmus, in the character of a</a>
<a id='line_2539'>      suppliant, accused his own rashness, and humbly solicited the</a>
<a id='line_2540'>      clemency of the emperor, the lieutenant of Valentinian received</a>
<a id='line_2541'>      and dismissed him with a friendly embrace: but he diligently</a>
<a id='line_2542'>      required the useful and substantial pledges of a sincere</a>
<a id='line_2543'>      repentance; nor could he be persuaded, by the assurances of</a>
<a id='line_2544'>      peace, to suspend, for an instant, the operations of an active</a>
<a id='line_2545'>      war. A dark conspiracy was detected by the penetration of</a>
<a id='line_2546'>      Theodosius; and he satisfied, without much reluctance, the public</a>
<a id='line_2547'>      indignation, which he had secretly excited. Several of the guilty</a>
<a id='line_2548'>      accomplices of Firmus were abandoned, according to ancient</a>
<a id='line_2549'>      custom, to the tumult of a military execution; many more, by the</a>
<a id='line_2550'>      amputation of both their hands, continued to exhibit an</a>
<a id='line_2551'>      instructive spectacle of horror; the hatred of the rebels was</a>
<a id='line_2552'>      accompanied with fear; and the fear of the Roman soldiers was</a>
<a id='line_2553'>      mingled with respectful admiration. Amidst the boundless plains</a>
<a id='line_2554'>      of Getulia, and the innumerable valleys of Mount Atlas, it was</a>
<a id='line_2555'>      impossible to prevent the escape of Firmus; and if the usurper</a>
<a id='line_2556'>      could have tired the patience of his antagonist, he would have</a>
<a id='line_2557'>      secured his person in the depth of some remote solitude, and</a>
<a id='line_2558'>      expected the hopes of a future revolution. He was subdued by the</a>
<a id='line_2559'>      perseverance of Theodosius; who had formed an inflexible</a>
<a id='line_2560'>      determination, that the war should end only by the death of the</a>
<a id='line_2561'>      tyrant; and that every nation of Africa, which presumed to</a>
<a id='line_2562'>      support his cause, should be involved in his ruin. At the head of</a>
<a id='line_2563'>      a small body of troops, which seldom exceeded three thousand five</a>
<a id='line_2564'>      hundred men, the Roman general advanced, with a steady prudence,</a>
<a id='line_2565'>      devoid of rashness or of fear, into the heart of a country, where</a>
<a id='line_2566'>      he was sometimes attacked by armies of twenty thousand Moors. The</a>
<a id='line_2567'>      boldness of his charge dismayed the irregular Barbarians; they</a>
<a id='line_2568'>      were disconcerted by his seasonable and orderly retreats; they</a>
<a id='line_2569'>      were continually baffled by the unknown resources of the military</a>
<a id='line_2570'>      art; and they felt and confessed the just superiority which was</a>
<a id='line_2571'>      assumed by the leader of a civilized nation. When Theodosius</a>
<a id='line_2572'>      entered the extensive dominions of Igmazen, king of the</a>
<a id='line_2573'>      Isaflenses, the haughty savage required, in words of defiance,</a>

<a id='line_2745'>      had solemnly renounced the sovereignty and alliance of Armenia</a>

<a id='line_2748'>      the Armenian territories at the head of a formidable host of</a>
<a id='line_2749'>      cuirassiers, of archers, and of mercenary foot; but it was the</a>
<a id='line_2750'>      invariable practice of Sapor to mix war and negotiation, and to</a>
<a id='line_2751'>      consider falsehood and perjury as the most powerful instruments</a>
<a id='line_2752'>      of regal policy. He affected to praise the prudent and moderate</a>
<a id='line_2753'>      conduct of the king of Armenia; and the unsuspicious Tiranus was</a>
<a id='line_2754'>      persuaded, by the repeated assurances of insidious friendship, to</a>
<a id='line_2755'>      deliver his person into the hands of a faithless and cruel enemy.</a>

<a id='line_2761'>      was reduced to the state of a Persian province; the</a>
<a id='line_2762'>      administration was shared between a distinguished satrap and a</a>
<a id='line_2763'>      favorite eunuch; and Sapor marched, without delay, to subdue the</a>

<a id='line_2770'>      The treasure deposited in that strong fortress tempted the</a>

<a id='line_2773'>      the desperate valor of her subjects and soldiers. 13412 The</a>
<a id='line_2774'>      Persians were surprised and repulsed under the walls of</a>

<a id='line_2776'>      But the forces of Sapor were continually renewed and increased;</a>
<a id='line_2777'>      the hopeless courage of the garrison was exhausted; the strength</a>
<a id='line_2778'>      of the walls yielded to the assault; and the proud conqueror,</a>

<a id='line_2780'>      captive an unfortunate queen; who, in a more auspicious hour, had</a>
<a id='line_2781'>      been the destined bride of the son of Constantine. 135 Yet if</a>
<a id='line_2782'>      Sapor already triumphed in the easy conquest of two dependent</a>
<a id='line_2783'>      kingdoms, he soon felt, that a country is unsubdued as long as</a>
<a id='line_2784'>      the minds of the people are actuated by a hostile and</a>
<a id='line_2785'>      contumacious spirit. The satraps, whom he was obliged to trust,</a>
<a id='line_2786'>      embraced the first opportunity of regaining the affection of</a>
<a id='line_2787'>      their countrymen, and of signalizing their immortal hatred to the</a>
<a id='line_2788'>      Persian name. Since the conversion of the Armenians and Iberians,</a>
<a id='line_2789'>      these nations considered the Christians as the favorites, and the</a>
<a id='line_2790'>      Magians as the adversaries, of the Supreme Being: the influence</a>
<a id='line_2791'>      of the clergy, over a superstitious people was uniformly exerted</a>
<a id='line_2792'>      in the cause of Rome; and as long as the successors of</a>
<a id='line_2793'>      Constantine disputed with those of Artaxerxes the sovereignty of</a>
<a id='line_2794'>      the intermediate provinces, the religious connection always threw</a>
<a id='line_2795'>      a decisive advantage into the scale of the empire. A numerous and</a>
<a id='line_2796'>      active party acknowledged Para, the son of Tiranus, as the lawful</a>
<a id='line_2797'>      sovereign of Armenia, and his title to the throne was deeply</a>
<a id='line_2798'>      rooted in the hereditary succession of five hundred years. By the</a>
<a id='line_2799'>      unanimous consent of the Iberians, the country was equally</a>
<a id='line_2800'>      divided between the rival princes; and Aspacuras, who owed his</a>
<a id='line_2801'>      diadem to the choice of Sapor, was obliged to declare, that his</a>
<a id='line_2802'>      regard for his children, who were detained as hostages by the</a>
<a id='line_2803'>      tyrant, was the only consideration which prevented him from</a>
<a id='line_2804'>      openly renouncing the alliance of Persia. The emperor Valens, who</a>
<a id='line_2805'>      respected the obligations of the treaty, and who was apprehensive</a>
<a id='line_2806'>      of involving the East in a dangerous war, ventured, with slow and</a>
<a id='line_2807'>      cautious measures, to support the Roman party in the kingdoms of</a>
<a id='line_2808'>      Iberia and Armenia. 13511 Twelve legions established the</a>
<a id='line_2809'>      authority of Sauromaces on the banks of the Cyrus. The Euphrates</a>
<a id='line_2810'>      was protected by the valor of Arintheus. A powerful army, under</a>
<a id='line_2811'>      the command of Count Trajan, and of Vadomair, king of the</a>
<a id='line_2812'>      Alemanni, fixed their camp on the confines of Armenia. But they</a>
<a id='line_2813'>      were strictly enjoined not to commit the first hostilities, which</a>
<a id='line_2814'>      might be understood as a breach of the treaty: and such was the</a>
<a id='line_2815'>      implicit obedience of the Roman general, that they retreated,</a>
<a id='line_2816'>      with exemplary patience, under a shower of Persian arrows till</a>
<a id='line_2817'>      they had clearly acquired a just title to an honorable and</a>
<a id='line_2818'>      legitimate victory. Yet these appearances of war insensibly</a>
<a id='line_2819'>      subsided in a vain and tedious negotiation. The contending</a>
<a id='line_2820'>      parties supported their claims by mutual reproaches of perfidy</a>
<a id='line_2821'>      and ambition; and it should seem, that the original treaty was</a>
<a id='line_2822'>      expressed in very obscure terms, since they were reduced to the</a>
<a id='line_2823'>      necessity of making their inconclusive appeal to the partial</a>
<a id='line_2824'>      testimony of the generals of the two nations, who had assisted at</a>
<a id='line_2825'>      the negotiations. 136 The invasion of the Goths and Huns which</a>
<a id='line_2826'>      soon afterwards shook the foundations of the Roman empire,</a>
<a id='line_2827'>      exposed the provinces of Asia to the arms of Sapor. But the</a>
<a id='line_2828'>      declining age, and perhaps the infirmities, of the monarch</a>
<a id='line_2829'>      suggested new maxims of tranquillity and moderation. His death,</a>
<a id='line_2830'>      which happened in the full maturity of a reign of seventy years,</a>
<a id='line_2831'>      changed in a moment the court and councils of Persia; and their</a>
<a id='line_2832'>      attention was most probably engaged by domestic troubles, and the</a>
<a id='line_2833'>      distant efforts of a Carmanian war. 137 The remembrance of</a>
<a id='line_2834'>      ancient injuries was lost in the enjoyment of peace. The kingdoms</a>
<a id='line_2835'>      of Armenia and Iberia were permitted, by the mutual,though tacit</a>

<a id='line_2838'>      arrived at Constantinople, to excuse the unjustifiable measures</a>
<a id='line_2839'>      of the former reign; and to offer, as the tribute of friendship,</a>

<a id='line_2946'>      vigilance, and he gradually discovered, that he was a prisoner in</a>
<a id='line_2947'>      the hands of the Romans. Para suppressed his indignation,</a>
<a id='line_2948'>      dissembled his fears, and after secretly preparing his escape,</a>
<a id='line_2949'>      mounted on horseback with three hundred of his faithful</a>
<a id='line_2950'>      followers. The officer stationed at the door of his apartment</a>
<a id='line_2951'>      immediately communicated his flight to the consular of Cilicia,</a>
<a id='line_2952'>      who overtook him in the suburbs, and endeavored without success,</a>
<a id='line_2953'>      to dissuade him from prosecuting his rash and dangerous design. A</a>
<a id='line_2954'>      legion was ordered to pursue the royal fugitive; but the pursuit</a>
<a id='line_2955'>      of infantry could not be very alarming to a body of light</a>
<a id='line_2956'>      cavalry; and upon the first cloud of arrows that was discharged</a>
<a id='line_2957'>      into the air, they retreated with precipitation to the gates of</a>
<a id='line_2958'>      Tarsus. After an incessant march of two days and two nights, Para</a>
<a id='line_2959'>      and his Armenians reached the banks of the Euphrates; but the</a>
<a id='line_2960'>      passage of the river which they were obliged to swim, 13812 was</a>
<a id='line_2961'>      attended with some delay and some loss. The country was alarmed;</a>
<a id='line_2962'>      and the two roads, which were only separated by an interval of</a>
<a id='line_2963'>      three miles had been occupied by a thousand archers on horseback,</a>
<a id='line_2964'>      under the command of a count and a tribune. Para must have</a>
<a id='line_2965'>      yielded to superior force, if the accidental arrival of a</a>
<a id='line_2966'>      friendly traveller had not revealed the danger and the means of</a>
<a id='line_2967'>      escape. A dark and almost impervious path securely conveyed the</a>
<a id='line_2968'>      Armenian troop through the thicket; and Para had left behind him</a>
<a id='line_2969'>      the count and the tribune, while they patiently expected his</a>
<a id='line_2970'>      approach along the public highways. They returned to the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_2971'>      court to excuse their want of diligence or success; and seriously</a>
<a id='line_2972'>      alleged, that the king of Armenia, who was a skilful magician,</a>
<a id='line_2973'>      had transformed himself and his followers, and passed before</a>
<a id='line_2974'>      their eyes under a borrowed shape. 13813 After his return to his</a>
<a id='line_2975'>      native kingdom, Para still continued to profess himself the</a>
<a id='line_2976'>      friend and ally of the Romans: but the Romans had injured him too</a>
<a id='line_2977'>      deeply ever to forgive, and the secret sentence of his death was</a>
<a id='line_2978'>      signed in the council of Valens. The execution of the bloody deed</a>
<a id='line_2979'>      was committed to the subtle prudence of Count Trajan; and he had</a>
<a id='line_2980'>      the merit of insinuating himself into the confidence of the</a>
<a id='line_2981'>      credulous prince, that he might find an opportunity of stabbing</a>
<a id='line_2982'>      him to the heart Para was invited to a Roman banquet, which had</a>
<a id='line_2983'>      been prepared with all the pomp and sensuality of the East; the</a>
<a id='line_2984'>      hall resounded with cheerful music, and the company was already</a>
<a id='line_2985'>      heated with wine; when the count retired for an instant, drew his</a>
<a id='line_2986'>      sword, and gave the signal of the murder. A robust and desperate</a>
<a id='line_2987'>      Barbarian instantly rushed on the king of Armenia; and though he</a>
<a id='line_2988'>      bravely defended his life with the first weapon that chance</a>
<a id='line_2989'>      offered to his hand, the table of the Imperial general was</a>
<a id='line_2990'>      stained with the royal blood of a guest, and an ally. Such were</a>
<a id='line_2991'>      the weak and wicked maxims of the Roman administration, that, to</a>

<a id='line_3026'>      sovereign of the Gothic nation: the chiefs of the Visigoths, or</a>

<a id='line_3029'>      Fritigern, and Alavivus, were the most illustrious, by their</a>
<a id='line_3030'>      personal merit, as well as by their vicinity to the Roman</a>
<a id='line_3031'>      provinces. These domestic conquests, which increased the military</a>
<a id='line_3032'>      power of Hermanric, enlarged his ambitious designs. He invaded</a>
<a id='line_3033'>      the adjacent countries of the North; and twelve considerable</a>
<a id='line_3034'>      nations, whose names and limits cannot be accurately defined,</a>
<a id='line_3035'>      successively yielded to the superiority of the Gothic arms. 141</a>
<a id='line_3036'>      The Heruli, who inhabited the marshy lands near the lake M¾otis,</a>
<a id='line_3037'>      were renowned for their strength and agility; and the assistance</a>
<a id='line_3038'>      of their light infantry was eagerly solicited, and highly</a>
<a id='line_3039'>      esteemed, in all the wars of the Barbarians. But the active</a>
<a id='line_3040'>      spirit of the Heruli was subdued by the slow and steady</a>
<a id='line_3041'>      perseverance of the Goths; and, after a bloody action, in which</a>
<a id='line_3042'>      the king was slain, the remains of that warlike tribe became a</a>
<a id='line_3043'>      useful accession to the camp of Hermanric.</a>
<a id='line_3044'></a>
<a id='line_3045'>      He then marched against the Venedi; unskilled in the use of arms,</a>
<a id='line_3046'>      and formidable only by their numbers, which filled the wide</a>
<a id='line_3047'>      extent of the plains of modern Poland. The victorious Goths, who</a>
<a id='line_3048'>      were not inferior in numbers, prevailed in the contest, by the</a>
<a id='line_3049'>      decisive advantages of exercise and discipline. After the</a>
<a id='line_3050'>      submission of the Venedi, the conqueror advanced, without</a>

<a id='line_3052'>      people, whose name is still preserved in the province of</a>

<a id='line_3058'>      wealthy country is ascribed to the prudence, rather than to the</a>

<a id='line_3060'>      to the Baltic, included the native seats, and the recent</a>
<a id='line_3061'>      acquisitions, of the Goths; and he reigned over the greatest part</a>

<a id='line_3190'>      the war was more favorable to the Romans, and more pernicious to</a>
<a id='line_3191'>      the Goths. The interruption of trade deprived the Barbarians of</a>
<a id='line_3192'>      the objects of luxury, which they already confounded with the</a>
<a id='line_3193'>      necessaries of life; and the desolation of a very extensive tract</a>
<a id='line_3194'>      of country threatened them with the horrors of famine. Athanaric</a>
<a id='line_3195'>      was provoked, or compelled, to risk a battle, which he lost, in</a>
<a id='line_3196'>      the plains; and the pursuit was rendered more bloody by the cruel</a>
<a id='line_3197'>      precaution of the victorious generals, who had promised a large</a>
<a id='line_3198'>      reward for the head of every Goth that was brought into the</a>
<a id='line_3199'>      Imperial camp. The submission of the Barbarians appeased the</a>
<a id='line_3200'>      resentment of Valens and his council: the emperor listened with</a>
<a id='line_3201'>      satisfaction to the flattering and eloquent remonstrance of the</a>
<a id='line_3202'>      senate of Constantinople, which assumed, for the first time, a</a>
<a id='line_3203'>      share in the public deliberations; and the same generals, Victor</a>
<a id='line_3204'>      and Arintheus, who had successfully directed the conduct of the</a>
<a id='line_3205'>      war, were empowered to regulate the conditions of peace. The</a>
<a id='line_3206'>      freedom of trade, which the Goths had hitherto enjoyed, was</a>
<a id='line_3207'>      restricted to two cities on the Danube; the rashness of their</a>
<a id='line_3208'>      leaders was severely punished by the suppression of their</a>
<a id='line_3209'>      pensions and subsidies; and the exception, which was stipulated</a>
<a id='line_3210'>      in favor of Athanaric alone, was more advantageous than honorable</a>
<a id='line_3211'>      to the Judge of the Visigoths. Athanaric, who, on this occasion,</a>
<a id='line_3212'>      appears to have consulted his private interest, without expecting</a>
<a id='line_3213'>      the orders of his sovereign, supported his own dignity, and that</a>
<a id='line_3214'>      of his tribe, in the personal interview which was proposed by the</a>
<a id='line_3215'>      ministers of Valens. He persisted in his declaration, that it was</a>
<a id='line_3216'>      impossible for him, without incurring the guilt of perjury, ever</a>
<a id='line_3217'>      to set his foot on the territory of the empire; and it is more</a>
<a id='line_3218'>      than probable, that his regard for the sanctity of an oath was</a>
<a id='line_3219'>      confirmed by the recent and fatal examples of Roman treachery.</a>
<a id='line_3220'>      The Danube, which separated the dominions of the two independent</a>
<a id='line_3221'>      nations, was chosen for the scene of the conference. The emperor</a>

<a id='line_3223'>      equal number of armed followers, advanced in their respective</a>

<a id='line_3225'>      treaty, and the delivery of hostages, Valens returned in triumph</a>
<a id='line_3226'>      to Constantinople; and the Goths remained in a state of</a>
<a id='line_3227'>      tranquillity about six years; till they were violently impelled</a>

<a id='line_3250'>      new fortifications to the security of the frontier: but the abuse</a>
<a id='line_3251'>      of this policy provoked the just resentment of the Barbarians.</a>
<a id='line_3252'>      The Quadi complained, that the ground for an intended fortress</a>
<a id='line_3253'>      had been marked out on their territories; and their complaints</a>
<a id='line_3254'>      were urged with so much reason and moderation, that Equitius,</a>

<a id='line_3261'>      credulously listened to the assurances of his favorite, that if</a>
<a id='line_3262'>      the government of Valeria, and the direction of the work, were</a>
<a id='line_3263'>      intrusted to the zeal of his son Marcellinus, the emperor should</a>
<a id='line_3264'>      no longer be importuned with the audacious remonstrances of the</a>
<a id='line_3265'>      Barbarians. The subjects of Rome, and the natives of Germany,</a>
<a id='line_3266'>      were insulted by the arrogance of a young and worthless minister,</a>
<a id='line_3267'>      who considered his rapid elevation as the proof and reward of his</a>
<a id='line_3268'>      superior merit. He affected, however, to receive the modest</a>
<a id='line_3269'>      application of Gabinius, king of the Quadi, with some attention</a>
<a id='line_3270'>      and regard: but this artful civility concealed a dark and bloody</a>
<a id='line_3271'>      design, and the credulous prince was persuaded to accept the</a>
<a id='line_3272'>      pressing invitation of Marcellinus. I am at a loss how to vary</a>
<a id='line_3273'>      the narrative of similar crimes; or how to relate, that, in the</a>
<a id='line_3274'>      course of the same year, but in remote parts of the empire, the</a>
<a id='line_3275'>      inhospitable table of two Imperial generals was stained with the</a>
<a id='line_3276'>      royal blood of two guests and allies, inhumanly murdered by their</a>
<a id='line_3277'>      order, and in their presence. The fate of Gabinius, and of Para,</a>
<a id='line_3278'>      was the same: but the cruel death of their sovereign was resented</a>
<a id='line_3279'>      in a very different manner by the servile temper of the</a>
<a id='line_3280'>      Armenians, and the free and daring spirit of the Germans. The</a>
<a id='line_3281'>      Quadi were much declined from that formidable power, which, in</a>
<a id='line_3282'>      the time of Marcus Antoninus, had spread terror to the gates of</a>
<a id='line_3283'>      Rome. But they still possessed arms and courage; their courage</a>
<a id='line_3284'>      was animated by despair, and they obtained the usual</a>
<a id='line_3285'>      reenforcement of the cavalry of their Sarmatian allies. So</a>
<a id='line_3286'>      improvident was the assassin Marcellinus, that he chose the</a>
<a id='line_3287'>      moment when the bravest veterans had been drawn away, to suppress</a>
<a id='line_3288'>      the revolt of Firmus; and the whole province was exposed, with a</a>
<a id='line_3289'>      very feeble defence, to the rage of the exasperated Barbarians.</a>
<a id='line_3290'>      They invaded Pannonia in the season of harvest; unmercifully</a>
<a id='line_3291'>      destroyed every object of plunder which they could not easily</a>
<a id='line_3292'>      transport; and either disregarded, or demolished, the empty</a>
<a id='line_3293'>      fortifications. The princess Constantia, the daughter of the</a>
<a id='line_3294'>      emperor Constantius, and the granddaughter of the great</a>
<a id='line_3295'>      Constantine, very narrowly escaped. That royal maid, who had</a>
<a id='line_3296'>      innocently supported the revolt of Procopius, was now the</a>
<a id='line_3297'>      destined wife of the heir of the Western empire. She traversed</a>
<a id='line_3298'>      the peaceful province with a splendid and unarmed train. Her</a>
<a id='line_3299'>      person was saved from danger, and the republic from disgrace, by</a>
<a id='line_3300'>      the active zeal of Messala, governor of the provinces. As soon as</a>
<a id='line_3301'>      he was informed that the village, where she stopped only to dine,</a>
<a id='line_3302'>      was almost encompassed by the Barbarians, he hastily placed her</a>
<a id='line_3303'>      in his own chariot, and drove full speed till he reached the</a>
<a id='line_3304'>      gates of Sirmium, which were at the distance of six-and-twenty</a>
<a id='line_3305'>      miles. Even Sirmium might not have been secure, if the Quadi and</a>
<a id='line_3306'>      Sarmatians had diligently advanced during the general</a>
<a id='line_3307'>      consternation of the magistrates and people. Their delay allowed</a>
<a id='line_3308'>      Probus, the Pr¾torian pr¾fect, sufficient time to recover his own</a>
<a id='line_3309'>      spirits, and to revive the courage of the citizens. He skilfully</a>
<a id='line_3310'>      directed their strenuous efforts to repair and strengthen the</a>
<a id='line_3311'>      decayed fortifications; and procured the seasonable and effectual</a>
<a id='line_3312'>      assistance of a company of archers, to protect the capital of the</a>
<a id='line_3313'>      Illyrian provinces. Disappointed in their attempts against the</a>
<a id='line_3314'>      walls of Sirmium, the indignant Barbarians turned their arms</a>
<a id='line_3315'>      against the master general of the frontier, to whom they unjustly</a>
<a id='line_3316'>      attributed the murder of their king. Equitius could bring into</a>
<a id='line_3317'>      the field no more than two legions; but they contained the</a>
<a id='line_3318'>      veteran strength of the M¾sian and Pannonian bands. The obstinacy</a>
<a id='line_3319'>      with which they disputed the vain honors of rank and precedency,</a>
<a id='line_3320'>      was the cause of their destruction; and while they acted with</a>
<a id='line_3321'>      separate forces and divided councils, they were surprised and</a>
<a id='line_3322'>      slaughtered by the active vigor of the Sarmatian horse. The</a>
<a id='line_3323'>      success of this invasion provoked the emulation of the bordering</a>

<a id='line_3346'>      suppliant ambassadors of the Sarmatians, who met him on the way,</a>
<a id='line_3347'>      he returned a doubtful answer, that, as soon as he reached the</a>

<a id='line_3349'>      arrived at Sirmium, he gave audience to the deputies of the</a>
<a id='line_3350'>      Illyrian provinces; who loudly congratulated their own felicity</a>

<a id='line_3355'>      was freely sent by the wishes of the province. ÒWith tears and</a>

<a id='line_3357'>      emperor paused: but the impunity of his ministers established the</a>
<a id='line_3358'>      pernicious maxim, that they might oppress his subjects, without</a>
<a id='line_3359'>      injuring his service. A strict inquiry into their conduct would</a>
<a id='line_3360'>      have relieved the public discontent. The severe condemnation of</a>
<a id='line_3361'>      the murder of Gabinius, was the only measure which could restore</a>
<a id='line_3362'>      the confidence of the Germans, and vindicate the honor of the</a>
<a id='line_3363'>      Roman name. But the haughty monarch was incapable of the</a>
<a id='line_3364'>      magnanimity which dares to acknowledge a fault. He forgot the</a>
<a id='line_3365'>      provocation, remembered only the injury, and advanced into the</a>
<a id='line_3366'>      country of the Quadi with an insatiate thirst of blood and</a>
<a id='line_3367'>      revenge. The extreme devastation, and promiscuous massacre, of a</a>
<a id='line_3368'>      savage war, were justified, in the eyes of the emperor, and</a>
<a id='line_3369'>      perhaps in those of the world, by the cruel equity of</a>
<a id='line_3370'>      retaliation: 153 and such was the discipline of the Romans, and</a>
<a id='line_3371'>      the consternation of the enemy, that Valentinian repassed the</a>
<a id='line_3372'>      Danube without the loss of a single man. As he had resolved to</a>
<a id='line_3373'>      complete the destruction of the Quadi by a second campaign, he</a>
<a id='line_3374'>      fixed his winter quarters at Bregetio, on the Danube, near the</a>
<a id='line_3375'>      Hungarian city of Presburg. While the operations of war were</a>
<a id='line_3376'>      suspended by the severity of the weather, the Quadi made an</a>
<a id='line_3377'>      humble attempt to deprecate the wrath of their conqueror; and, at</a>
<a id='line_3378'>      the earnest persuasion of Equitius, their ambassadors were</a>
<a id='line_3379'>      introduced into the Imperial council. They approached the throne</a>
<a id='line_3380'>      with bended bodies and dejected countenances; and without daring</a>
<a id='line_3381'>      to complain of the murder of their king, they affirmed, with</a>
<a id='line_3382'>      solemn oaths, that the late invasion was the crime of some</a>
<a id='line_3383'>      irregular robbers, which the public council of the nation</a>
<a id='line_3384'>      condemned and abhorred. The answer of the emperor left them but</a>
<a id='line_3385'>      little to hope from his clemency or compassion. He reviled, in</a>
<a id='line_3386'>      the most intemperate language, their baseness, their ingratitude,</a>

<a id='line_3434'>      charms, which she had often seen in the bath, was expressed with</a>
<a id='line_3435'>      such lavish and imprudent praise, that the emperor was tempted to</a>
<a id='line_3436'>      introduce a second wife into his bed; and his public edict</a>
<a id='line_3437'>      extended to all the subjects of the empire the same domestic</a>
<a id='line_3438'>      privilege which he had assumed for himself.Ó But we may be</a>
<a id='line_3439'>      assured, from the evidence of reason as well as history, that the</a>
<a id='line_3440'>      two marriages of Valentinian, with Severa, and with Justina, were</a>
<a id='line_3441'>      _successively_ contracted; and that he used the ancient</a>
<a id='line_3442'>      permission of divorce, which was still allowed by the laws,</a>
<a id='line_3443'>      though it was condemned by the church. Severa was the mother of</a>
<a id='line_3444'>      Gratian, who seemed to unite every claim which could entitle him</a>
<a id='line_3445'>      to the undoubted succession of the Western empire. He was the</a>
<a id='line_3446'>      eldest son of a monarch whose glorious reign had confirmed the</a>
<a id='line_3447'>      free and honorable choice of his fellow-soldiers. Before he had</a>
<a id='line_3448'>      attained the ninth year of his age, the royal youth received from</a>
<a id='line_3449'>      the hands of his indulgent father the purple robe and diadem,</a>
<a id='line_3450'>      with the title of Augustus; the election was solemnly ratified by</a>
<a id='line_3451'>      the consent and applause of the armies of Gaul; 156 and the name</a>
<a id='line_3452'>      of Gratian was added to the names of Valentinian and Valens, in</a>
<a id='line_3453'>      all the legal transactions of the Roman government. By his</a>
<a id='line_3454'>      marriage with the granddaughter of Constantine, the son of</a>
<a id='line_3455'>      Valentinian acquired all the hereditary rights of the Flavian</a>
<a id='line_3456'>      family; which, in a series of three Imperial generations, were</a>
<a id='line_3457'>      sanctified by time, religion, and the reverence of the people. At</a>
<a id='line_3458'>      the death of his father, the royal youth was in the seventeenth</a>
<a id='line_3459'>      year of his age; and his virtues already justified the favorable</a>
<a id='line_3460'>      opinion of the army and the people. But Gratian resided, without</a>
<a id='line_3461'>      apprehension, in the palace of Treves; whilst, at the distance of</a>
<a id='line_3462'>      many hundred miles, Valentinian suddenly expired in the camp of</a>
<a id='line_3463'>      Bregetio. The passions, which had been so long suppressed by the</a>
<a id='line_3464'>      presence of a master, immediately revived in the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_3465'>      council; and the ambitious design of reigning in the name of an</a>
<a id='line_3466'>      infant, was artfully executed by Mellobaudes and Equitius, who</a>
<a id='line_3467'>      commanded the attachment of the Illyrian and Italian bands. They</a>
<a id='line_3468'>      contrived the most honorable pretences to remove the popular</a>
<a id='line_3469'>      leaders, and the troops of Gaul, who might have asserted the</a>
<a id='line_3470'>      claims of the lawful successor; they suggested the necessity of</a>
<a id='line_3471'>      extinguishing the hopes of foreign and domestic enemies, by a</a>
<a id='line_3472'>      bold and decisive measure. The empress Justina, who had been left</a>
<a id='line_3473'>      in a palace about one hundred miles from Bregetio, was</a>
<a id='line_3474'>      respectively invited to appear in the camp, with the son of the</a>
<a id='line_3475'>      deceased emperor. On the sixth day after the death of</a>
<a id='line_3476'>      Valentinian, the infant prince of the same name, who was only</a>
<a id='line_3477'>      four years old, was shown, in the arms of his mother, to the</a>
<a id='line_3478'>      legions; and solemnly invested, by military acclamation, with the</a>
<a id='line_3479'>      titles and ensigns of supreme power. The impending dangers of a</a>
<a id='line_3480'>      civil war were seasonably prevented by the wise and moderate</a>
<a id='line_3481'>      conduct of the emperor Gratian. He cheerfully accepted the choice</a>
<a id='line_3482'>      of the army; declared that he should always consider the son of</a>
<a id='line_3483'>      Justina as a brother, not as a rival; and advised the empress,</a>
<a id='line_3484'>      with her son Valentinian to fix their residence at Milan, in the</a>
<a id='line_3485'>      fair and peaceful province of Italy; while he assumed the more</a>
<a id='line_3486'>      arduous command of the countries beyond the Alps. Gratian</a>
<a id='line_3487'>      dissembled his resentment till he could safely punish, or</a>
<a id='line_3488'>      disgrace, the authors of the conspiracy; and though he uniformly</a>
<a id='line_3489'>      behaved with tenderness and regard to his infant colleague, he</a>
<a id='line_3490'>      gradually confounded, in the administration of the Western</a>
<a id='line_3491'>      empire, the office of a guardian with the authority of a</a>
<a id='line_3492'>      sovereign. The government of the Roman world was exercised in the</a>
<a id='line_3493'>      united names of Valens and his two nephews; but the feeble</a>
<a id='line_3494'>      emperor of the East, who succeeded to the rank of his elder</a>
<a id='line_3495'>      brother, never obtained any weight or influence in the councils</a>
<a id='line_3496'>      of the West. 157</a>
