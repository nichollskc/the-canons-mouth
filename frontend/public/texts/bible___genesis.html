                    <a id='line_0'>The First Book of Moses:  Called Genesis</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</a>
<a id='line_4'></a>
<a id='line_5'>1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon</a>
<a id='line_6'>the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the</a>
<a id='line_7'>waters.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</a>
<a id='line_10'></a>
<a id='line_11'>1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light</a>
<a id='line_12'>from the darkness.</a>
<a id='line_13'></a>
<a id='line_14'>1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.</a>
<a id='line_15'>And the evening and the morning were the first day.</a>
<a id='line_16'></a>
<a id='line_17'>1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,</a>
<a id='line_18'>and let it divide the waters from the waters.</a>
<a id='line_19'></a>
<a id='line_20'>1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were</a>
<a id='line_21'>under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament:</a>
<a id='line_22'>and it was so.</a>
<a id='line_23'></a>
<a id='line_24'>1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the</a>
<a id='line_25'>morning were the second day.</a>
<a id='line_26'></a>
<a id='line_27'>1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together</a>
<a id='line_28'>unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>1:10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of</a>
<a id='line_31'>the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.</a>
<a id='line_32'></a>
<a id='line_33'>1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding</a>
<a id='line_34'>seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is</a>
<a id='line_35'>in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.</a>
<a id='line_36'></a>
<a id='line_37'>1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after</a>
<a id='line_38'>his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after</a>
<a id='line_39'>his kind: and God saw that it was good.</a>
<a id='line_40'></a>
<a id='line_41'>1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven</a>
<a id='line_44'>to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for</a>
<a id='line_45'>seasons, and for days, and years: 1:15 And let them be for lights in</a>
<a id='line_46'>the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was</a>
<a id='line_47'>so.</a>
<a id='line_48'></a>
<a id='line_49'>1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,</a>
<a id='line_50'>and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.</a>
<a id='line_51'></a>
<a id='line_52'>1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light</a>
<a id='line_53'>upon the earth, 1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and</a>
<a id='line_54'>to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.</a>
<a id='line_55'></a>
<a id='line_56'>1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</a>
<a id='line_57'></a>
<a id='line_58'>1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving</a>
<a id='line_59'>creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the</a>
<a id='line_60'>open firmament of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that</a>
<a id='line_63'>moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind,</a>
<a id='line_64'>and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</a>
<a id='line_65'></a>
<a id='line_66'>1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill</a>
<a id='line_67'>the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</a>
<a id='line_70'></a>
<a id='line_71'>1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after</a>
<a id='line_72'>his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his</a>
<a id='line_73'>kind: and it was so.</a>
<a id='line_74'></a>
<a id='line_75'>1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle</a>
<a id='line_76'>after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after</a>
<a id='line_77'>his kind: and God saw that it was good.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:</a>
<a id='line_80'>and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl</a>
<a id='line_81'>of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over</a>
<a id='line_82'>every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created</a>
<a id='line_85'>he him; male and female created he them.</a>
<a id='line_86'></a>
<a id='line_87'>1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and</a>
<a id='line_88'>multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion</a>
<a id='line_89'>over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every</a>
<a id='line_90'>living thing that moveth upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,</a>
<a id='line_93'>which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which</a>
<a id='line_94'>is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</a>
<a id='line_95'></a>
<a id='line_96'>1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,</a>
<a id='line_97'>and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is</a>
<a id='line_98'>life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.</a>
<a id='line_99'></a>
<a id='line_100'>1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was</a>
<a id='line_101'>very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</a>
<a id='line_102'></a>
<a id='line_103'>2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of</a>
<a id='line_104'>them.</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and</a>
<a id='line_107'>he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</a>
<a id='line_108'></a>
<a id='line_109'>2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that</a>
<a id='line_110'>in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'>2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when</a>
<a id='line_113'>they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the</a>
<a id='line_114'>heavens, 2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth,</a>
<a id='line_115'>and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not</a>
<a id='line_116'>caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the</a>
<a id='line_117'>ground.</a>
<a id='line_118'></a>
<a id='line_119'>2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole</a>
<a id='line_120'>face of the ground.</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and</a>
<a id='line_123'>breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living</a>
<a id='line_124'>soul.</a>
<a id='line_125'></a>
<a id='line_126'>2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he</a>
<a id='line_127'>put the man whom he had formed.</a>
<a id='line_128'></a>
<a id='line_129'>2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is</a>
<a id='line_130'>pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the</a>
<a id='line_131'>midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</a>
<a id='line_132'></a>
<a id='line_133'>2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence</a>
<a id='line_134'>it was parted, and became into four heads.</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the</a>
<a id='line_137'>whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 2:12 And the gold of that</a>
<a id='line_138'>land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.</a>
<a id='line_139'></a>
<a id='line_140'>2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that</a>
<a id='line_141'>compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.</a>
<a id='line_142'></a>
<a id='line_143'>2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which</a>
<a id='line_144'>goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.</a>
<a id='line_145'></a>
<a id='line_146'>2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of</a>
<a id='line_147'>Eden to dress it and to keep it.</a>
<a id='line_148'></a>
<a id='line_149'>2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the</a>
<a id='line_150'>garden thou mayest freely eat: 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge</a>
<a id='line_151'>of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou</a>
<a id='line_152'>eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be</a>
<a id='line_155'>alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the</a>
<a id='line_158'>field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see</a>
<a id='line_159'>what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living</a>
<a id='line_160'>creature, that was the name thereof.</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,</a>
<a id='line_163'>and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an</a>
<a id='line_164'>help meet for him.</a>
<a id='line_165'></a>
<a id='line_166'>2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he</a>
<a id='line_167'>slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead</a>
<a id='line_168'>thereof; 2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made</a>
<a id='line_169'>he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</a>
<a id='line_170'></a>
<a id='line_171'>2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my</a>
<a id='line_172'>flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</a>
<a id='line_173'></a>
<a id='line_174'>2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall</a>
<a id='line_175'>cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not</a>
<a id='line_178'>ashamed.</a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which</a>
<a id='line_181'>the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said,</a>
<a id='line_182'>Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  3:2 And the woman said</a>
<a id='line_183'>unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:</a>
<a id='line_184'>3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,</a>
<a id='line_185'>God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest</a>
<a id='line_186'>ye die.</a>
<a id='line_187'></a>
<a id='line_188'>3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 3:5</a>
<a id='line_189'>For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall</a>
<a id='line_190'>be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</a>
<a id='line_191'></a>
<a id='line_192'>3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that</a>
<a id='line_193'>it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one</a>
<a id='line_194'>wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto</a>
<a id='line_195'>her husband with her; and he did eat.</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they</a>
<a id='line_198'>were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves</a>
<a id='line_199'>aprons.</a>
<a id='line_200'></a>
<a id='line_201'>3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in</a>
<a id='line_202'>the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the</a>
<a id='line_203'>presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.</a>
<a id='line_204'></a>
<a id='line_205'>3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art</a>
<a id='line_206'>thou?  3:10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was</a>
<a id='line_207'>afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.</a>
<a id='line_208'></a>
<a id='line_209'>3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten</a>
<a id='line_210'>of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?</a>
<a id='line_211'>3:12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she</a>
<a id='line_212'>gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</a>
<a id='line_213'></a>
<a id='line_214'>3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast</a>
<a id='line_215'>done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>3:14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done</a>
<a id='line_218'>this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the</a>
<a id='line_219'>field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the</a>
<a id='line_220'>days of thy life: 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the</a>
<a id='line_221'>woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head,</a>
<a id='line_222'>and thou shalt bruise his heel.</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and</a>
<a id='line_225'>thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy</a>
<a id='line_226'>desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice</a>
<a id='line_229'>of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,</a>
<a id='line_230'>saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake;</a>
<a id='line_231'>in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 3:18 Thorns</a>
<a id='line_232'>also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the</a>
<a id='line_233'>herb of the field; 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,</a>
<a id='line_234'>till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for</a>
<a id='line_235'>dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>3:20 And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother</a>
<a id='line_238'>of all living.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of</a>
<a id='line_241'>skins, and clothed them.</a>
<a id='line_242'></a>
<a id='line_243'>3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to</a>
<a id='line_244'>know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also</a>
<a id='line_245'>of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 3:23 Therefore the</a>
<a id='line_246'>LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground</a>
<a id='line_247'>from whence he was taken.</a>
<a id='line_248'></a>
<a id='line_249'>3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden</a>
<a id='line_250'>of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep</a>
<a id='line_251'>the way of the tree of life.</a>
<a id='line_252'></a>
<a id='line_253'>4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and</a>
<a id='line_254'>said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'>4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of</a>
<a id='line_257'>sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the</a>
<a id='line_260'>fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_261'></a>
<a id='line_262'>4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of</a>
<a id='line_263'>the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his</a>
<a id='line_264'>offering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.</a>
<a id='line_265'>And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</a>
<a id='line_266'></a>
<a id='line_267'>4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy</a>
<a id='line_268'>countenance fallen?  4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be</a>
<a id='line_269'>accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto</a>
<a id='line_270'>thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</a>
<a id='line_271'></a>
<a id='line_272'>4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when</a>
<a id='line_273'>they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,</a>
<a id='line_274'>and slew him.</a>
<a id='line_275'></a>
<a id='line_276'>4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he</a>
<a id='line_277'>said, I know not: Am I my brother’s keeper?  4:10 And he said, What</a>
<a id='line_278'>hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from</a>
<a id='line_279'>the ground.</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her</a>
<a id='line_282'>mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand; 4:12 When thou</a>
<a id='line_283'>tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her</a>
<a id='line_284'>strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.</a>
<a id='line_285'></a>
<a id='line_286'>4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can</a>
<a id='line_287'>bear.</a>
<a id='line_288'></a>
<a id='line_289'>4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the</a>
<a id='line_290'>earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and</a>
<a id='line_291'>a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one</a>
<a id='line_292'>that findeth me shall slay me.</a>
<a id='line_293'></a>
<a id='line_294'>4:15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,</a>
<a id='line_295'>vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark</a>
<a id='line_296'>upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</a>
<a id='line_297'></a>
<a id='line_298'>4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the</a>
<a id='line_299'>land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</a>
<a id='line_300'></a>
<a id='line_301'>4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he</a>
<a id='line_302'>builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his</a>
<a id='line_303'>son, Enoch.</a>
<a id='line_304'></a>
<a id='line_305'>4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and</a>
<a id='line_306'>Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.</a>
<a id='line_307'></a>
<a id='line_308'>4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah,</a>
<a id='line_309'>and the name of the other Zillah.</a>
<a id='line_310'></a>
<a id='line_311'>4:20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents,</a>
<a id='line_312'>and of such as have cattle.</a>
<a id='line_313'></a>
<a id='line_314'>4:21 And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such</a>

<a id='line_492'>7:8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls,</a>
<a id='line_493'>and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 7:9 There went in two</a>

<a id='line_495'>commanded Noah.</a>
<a id='line_496'></a>
<a id='line_497'>7:10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the</a>
<a id='line_498'>flood were upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_499'></a>
<a id='line_500'>7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month,</a>
<a id='line_501'>the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains</a>

<a id='line_503'></a>
<a id='line_504'>7:12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.</a>
<a id='line_505'></a>
<a id='line_506'>7:13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,</a>
<a id='line_507'>the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons</a>

<a id='line_509'>and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that</a>
<a id='line_510'>creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind,</a>
<a id='line_511'>every bird of every sort.</a>
<a id='line_512'></a>
<a id='line_513'>7:15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all</a>
<a id='line_514'>flesh, wherein is the breath of life.</a>
<a id='line_515'></a>
<a id='line_516'>7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as</a>
<a id='line_517'>God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.</a>
<a id='line_518'></a>
<a id='line_519'>7:17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters</a>
<a id='line_520'>increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.</a>
<a id='line_521'></a>
<a id='line_522'>7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the</a>
<a id='line_523'>earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.</a>
<a id='line_524'></a>
<a id='line_525'>7:19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the</a>
<a id='line_526'>high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.</a>
<a id='line_527'></a>
<a id='line_528'>7:20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains</a>
<a id='line_529'>were covered.</a>
<a id='line_530'></a>
<a id='line_531'>7:21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and</a>
<a id='line_532'>of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth</a>
<a id='line_533'>upon the earth, and every man: 7:22 All in whose nostrils was the</a>
<a id='line_534'>breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.</a>
<a id='line_535'></a>
<a id='line_536'>7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face</a>
<a id='line_537'>of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the</a>
<a id='line_538'>fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah</a>
<a id='line_539'>only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.</a>
<a id='line_540'></a>
<a id='line_541'>7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty</a>
<a id='line_542'>days.</a>
<a id='line_543'></a>
<a id='line_544'>8:1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the</a>
<a id='line_545'>cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over</a>
<a id='line_546'>the earth, and the waters asswaged; 8:2 The fountains also of the deep</a>
<a id='line_547'>and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was</a>
<a id='line_548'>restrained; 8:3 And the waters returned from off the earth</a>
<a id='line_549'>continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the</a>
<a id='line_550'>waters were abated.</a>
<a id='line_551'></a>
<a id='line_552'>8:4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of</a>
<a id='line_553'>the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.</a>
<a id='line_554'></a>
<a id='line_555'>8:5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the</a>
<a id='line_556'>tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the</a>
<a id='line_557'>mountains seen.</a>
<a id='line_558'></a>
<a id='line_559'>8:6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the</a>
<a id='line_560'>window of the ark which he had made: 8:7 And he sent forth a raven,</a>
<a id='line_561'>which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off</a>
<a id='line_562'>the earth.</a>
<a id='line_563'></a>
<a id='line_564'>8:8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were</a>
<a id='line_565'>abated from off the face of the ground; 8:9 But the dove found no rest</a>
<a id='line_566'>for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for</a>
<a id='line_567'>the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his</a>
<a id='line_568'>hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.</a>
<a id='line_569'></a>
<a id='line_570'>8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the</a>
<a id='line_571'>dove out of the ark; 8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening;</a>
<a id='line_572'>and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that</a>
<a id='line_573'>the waters were abated from off the earth.</a>
<a id='line_574'></a>
<a id='line_575'>8:12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;</a>
<a id='line_576'>which returned not again unto him any more.</a>
<a id='line_577'></a>
<a id='line_578'>8:13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the</a>
<a id='line_579'>first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from</a>
<a id='line_580'>off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked,</a>
<a id='line_581'>and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.</a>
<a id='line_582'></a>
<a id='line_583'>8:14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the</a>
<a id='line_584'>month, was the earth dried.</a>
<a id='line_585'></a>
<a id='line_586'>8:15 And God spake unto Noah, saying, 8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou,</a>
<a id='line_587'>and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee.</a>
<a id='line_588'></a>
<a id='line_589'>8:17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of</a>
<a id='line_590'>all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing</a>
<a id='line_591'>that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the</a>
<a id='line_592'>earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_593'></a>
<a id='line_594'>8:18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’</a>
<a id='line_595'>wives with him: 8:19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every</a>
<a id='line_596'>fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went</a>
<a id='line_597'>forth out of the ark.</a>
<a id='line_598'></a>
<a id='line_599'>8:20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean</a>
<a id='line_600'>beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the</a>
<a id='line_601'>altar.</a>
<a id='line_602'></a>
<a id='line_603'>8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his</a>
<a id='line_604'>heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; for</a>

<a id='line_606'>again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.</a>
<a id='line_607'></a>
<a id='line_608'>8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and</a>

<a id='line_611'>9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be</a>

<a id='line_635'>9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9:9 And</a>
<a id='line_636'>I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after</a>
<a id='line_637'>you; 9:10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the</a>
<a id='line_638'>fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from</a>
<a id='line_639'>all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_640'></a>
<a id='line_641'>9:11 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all</a>
<a id='line_642'>flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall</a>
<a id='line_643'>there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.</a>
<a id='line_644'></a>
<a id='line_645'>9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make</a>
<a id='line_646'>between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for</a>
<a id='line_647'>perpetual generations: 9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall</a>
<a id='line_648'>be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.</a>
<a id='line_649'></a>
<a id='line_650'>9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,</a>
<a id='line_651'>that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 9:15 And I will remember my</a>
<a id='line_652'>covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all</a>
<a id='line_653'>flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all</a>
<a id='line_654'>flesh.</a>
<a id='line_655'></a>
<a id='line_656'>9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that</a>
<a id='line_657'>I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living</a>
<a id='line_658'>creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_659'></a>
<a id='line_660'>9:17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which</a>
<a id='line_661'>I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_662'></a>
<a id='line_663'>9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and</a>
<a id='line_664'>Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.</a>
<a id='line_665'></a>
<a id='line_666'>9:19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth</a>
<a id='line_667'>overspread.</a>
<a id='line_668'></a>
<a id='line_669'>9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:</a>
<a id='line_670'>9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered</a>
<a id='line_671'>within his tent.</a>
<a id='line_672'></a>
<a id='line_673'>9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,</a>
<a id='line_674'>and told his two brethren without.</a>
<a id='line_675'></a>
<a id='line_676'>9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their</a>
<a id='line_677'>shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their</a>
<a id='line_678'>father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father’s</a>
<a id='line_679'>nakedness.</a>
<a id='line_680'></a>
<a id='line_681'>9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had</a>
<a id='line_682'>done unto him.</a>
<a id='line_683'></a>
<a id='line_684'>9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be</a>
<a id='line_685'>unto his brethren.</a>
<a id='line_686'></a>
<a id='line_687'>9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be</a>
<a id='line_688'>his servant.</a>
<a id='line_689'></a>
<a id='line_690'>9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of</a>
<a id='line_691'>Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.</a>
<a id='line_692'></a>
<a id='line_693'>9:28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.</a>
<a id='line_694'></a>
<a id='line_695'>9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and</a>
<a id='line_696'>he died.</a>
<a id='line_697'></a>
<a id='line_698'>10:1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and</a>
<a id='line_699'>Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.</a>
<a id='line_700'></a>
<a id='line_701'>10:2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and</a>
<a id='line_702'>Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.</a>

<a id='line_704'>10:3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.</a>
<a id='line_705'></a>
<a id='line_706'>10:4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and</a>
<a id='line_707'>Dodanim.</a>
<a id='line_708'></a>
<a id='line_709'>10:5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands;</a>
<a id='line_710'>every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.</a>
<a id='line_711'></a>
<a id='line_712'>10:6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.</a>

<a id='line_714'>10:7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah,</a>
<a id='line_715'>and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.</a>
<a id='line_716'></a>
<a id='line_717'>10:8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.</a>
<a id='line_718'></a>
<a id='line_719'>10:9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,</a>
<a id='line_720'>Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_721'></a>
<a id='line_722'>10:10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and</a>
<a id='line_723'>Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.</a>
<a id='line_724'></a>
<a id='line_725'>10:11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the</a>
<a id='line_726'>city Rehoboth, and Calah, 10:12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah:</a>
<a id='line_727'>the same is a great city.</a>
<a id='line_728'></a>
<a id='line_729'>10:13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,</a>
<a id='line_730'>10:14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and</a>
<a id='line_731'>Caphtorim.</a>
<a id='line_732'></a>
<a id='line_733'>10:15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, 10:16 And the</a>
<a id='line_734'>Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 10:17 And the Hivite,</a>
<a id='line_735'>and the Arkite, and the Sinite, 10:18 And the Arvadite, and the</a>
<a id='line_736'>Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the</a>
<a id='line_737'>Canaanites spread abroad.</a>
<a id='line_738'></a>
<a id='line_739'>10:19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest</a>

<a id='line_741'>Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.</a>
<a id='line_742'></a>
<a id='line_743'>10:20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their</a>
<a id='line_744'>tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.</a>
<a id='line_745'></a>
<a id='line_746'>10:21 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the</a>
<a id='line_747'>brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.</a>
<a id='line_748'></a>
<a id='line_749'>10:22 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,</a>

<a id='line_754'>10:24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.</a>
<a id='line_755'></a>
<a id='line_756'>10:25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for</a>
<a id='line_757'>in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan.</a>
<a id='line_758'></a>
<a id='line_759'>10:26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and</a>
<a id='line_760'>Jerah, 10:27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 10:28 And Obal, and</a>
<a id='line_761'>Abimael, and Sheba, 10:29 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these</a>
<a id='line_762'>were the sons of Joktan.</a>
<a id='line_763'></a>
<a id='line_764'>10:30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a</a>
<a id='line_765'>mount of the east.</a>
<a id='line_766'></a>
<a id='line_767'>10:31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their</a>
<a id='line_768'>tongues, in their lands, after their nations.</a>
<a id='line_769'></a>
<a id='line_770'>10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their</a>
<a id='line_771'>generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided</a>
<a id='line_772'>in the earth after the flood.</a>
<a id='line_773'></a>
<a id='line_774'>11:1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.</a>
<a id='line_775'></a>
<a id='line_776'>11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they</a>
<a id='line_777'>found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.</a>
<a id='line_778'></a>
<a id='line_779'>11:3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn</a>
<a id='line_780'>them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for</a>
<a id='line_781'>morter.</a>
<a id='line_782'></a>
<a id='line_783'>11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose</a>
<a id='line_784'>top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be</a>
<a id='line_785'>scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.</a>
<a id='line_786'></a>
<a id='line_787'>11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the</a>
<a id='line_788'>children of men builded.</a>
<a id='line_789'></a>
<a id='line_790'>11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all</a>
<a id='line_791'>one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be</a>
<a id='line_792'>restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</a>
<a id='line_793'></a>
<a id='line_794'>11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that</a>
<a id='line_795'>they may not understand one another’s speech.</a>
<a id='line_796'></a>
<a id='line_797'>11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of</a>
<a id='line_798'>all the earth: and they left off to build the city.</a>
<a id='line_799'></a>
<a id='line_800'>11:9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did</a>
<a id='line_801'>there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the</a>
<a id='line_802'>LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</a>
<a id='line_803'></a>
<a id='line_804'>11:10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years</a>
<a id='line_805'>old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: 11:11 And Shem</a>
<a id='line_806'>lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and</a>
<a id='line_807'>daughters.</a>
<a id='line_808'></a>
<a id='line_809'>11:12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: 11:13</a>
<a id='line_810'>And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years,</a>
<a id='line_811'>and begat sons and daughters.</a>
<a id='line_812'></a>
<a id='line_813'>11:14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 11:15 And Salah</a>
<a id='line_814'>lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons</a>
<a id='line_815'>and daughters.</a>
<a id='line_816'></a>
<a id='line_817'>11:16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 11:17 And</a>
<a id='line_818'>Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and</a>
<a id='line_819'>begat sons and daughters.</a>
<a id='line_820'></a>
<a id='line_821'>11:18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 11:19 And Peleg</a>
<a id='line_822'>lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons</a>
<a id='line_823'>and daughters.</a>
<a id='line_824'></a>
<a id='line_825'>11:20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 11:21 And</a>
<a id='line_826'>Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat</a>
<a id='line_827'>sons and daughters.</a>
<a id='line_828'></a>
<a id='line_829'>11:22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 11:23 And Serug</a>
<a id='line_830'>lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and</a>
<a id='line_831'>daughters.</a>
<a id='line_832'></a>
<a id='line_833'>11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 11:25</a>
<a id='line_834'>And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years,</a>
<a id='line_835'>and begat sons and daughters.</a>
<a id='line_836'></a>
<a id='line_837'>11:26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and</a>
<a id='line_838'>Haran.</a>
<a id='line_839'></a>
<a id='line_840'>11:27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,</a>
<a id='line_841'>Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.</a>
<a id='line_842'></a>
<a id='line_843'>11:28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his</a>
<a id='line_844'>nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.</a>
<a id='line_845'></a>
<a id='line_846'>11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife</a>
<a id='line_847'>was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of</a>
<a id='line_848'>Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.</a>
<a id='line_849'></a>
<a id='line_850'>11:30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.</a>
<a id='line_851'></a>
<a id='line_852'>11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son’s</a>
<a id='line_853'>son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram’s wife; and they</a>
<a id='line_854'>went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of</a>
<a id='line_855'>Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.</a>
<a id='line_856'></a>
<a id='line_857'>11:32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah</a>
<a id='line_858'>died in Haran.</a>
<a id='line_859'></a>
<a id='line_860'>12:1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,</a>
<a id='line_861'>and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I</a>
<a id='line_862'>will shew thee: 12:2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I</a>
<a id='line_863'>will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a</a>
<a id='line_864'>blessing: 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him</a>
<a id='line_865'>that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be</a>
<a id='line_866'>blessed.</a>
<a id='line_867'></a>
<a id='line_868'>12:4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went</a>
<a id='line_869'>with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed</a>
<a id='line_870'>out of Haran.</a>
<a id='line_871'></a>
<a id='line_872'>12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all</a>
<a id='line_873'>their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had</a>
<a id='line_874'>gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan;</a>
<a id='line_875'>and into the land of Canaan they came.</a>
<a id='line_876'></a>
<a id='line_877'>12:6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto</a>
<a id='line_878'>the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.</a>
<a id='line_879'></a>
<a id='line_880'>12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I</a>
<a id='line_881'>give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who</a>
<a id='line_882'>appeared unto him.</a>
<a id='line_883'></a>
<a id='line_884'>12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel,</a>
<a id='line_885'>and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east:</a>
<a id='line_886'>and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name</a>
<a id='line_887'>of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_888'></a>
<a id='line_889'>12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.</a>
<a id='line_890'></a>
<a id='line_891'>12:10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into</a>
<a id='line_892'>Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.</a>
<a id='line_893'></a>
<a id='line_894'>12:11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt,</a>
<a id='line_895'>that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a</a>
<a id='line_896'>fair woman to look upon: 12:12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when</a>
<a id='line_897'>the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife:</a>
<a id='line_898'>and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.</a>
<a id='line_899'></a>
<a id='line_900'>12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with</a>
<a id='line_901'>me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.</a>
<a id='line_902'></a>
<a id='line_903'>12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the</a>
<a id='line_904'>Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.</a>
<a id='line_905'></a>
<a id='line_906'>12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before</a>
<a id='line_907'>Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.</a>
<a id='line_908'></a>
<a id='line_909'>12:16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and</a>
<a id='line_910'>oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses,</a>
<a id='line_911'>and camels.</a>
<a id='line_912'></a>
<a id='line_913'>12:17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues</a>
<a id='line_914'>because of Sarai Abram’s wife.</a>
<a id='line_915'></a>
<a id='line_916'>12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast</a>
<a id='line_917'>done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?  12:19</a>
<a id='line_918'>Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to</a>
<a id='line_919'>wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.</a>
<a id='line_920'></a>
<a id='line_921'>12:20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him</a>
<a id='line_922'>away, and his wife, and all that he had.</a>
<a id='line_923'></a>
<a id='line_924'>13:1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he</a>
<a id='line_925'>had, and Lot with him, into the south.</a>
<a id='line_926'></a>
<a id='line_927'>13:2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.</a>
<a id='line_928'></a>
<a id='line_929'>13:3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto</a>
<a id='line_930'>the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and</a>
<a id='line_931'>Hai; 13:4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the</a>
<a id='line_932'>first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_933'></a>
<a id='line_934'>13:5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and</a>
<a id='line_935'>tents.</a>
<a id='line_936'></a>
<a id='line_937'>13:6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell</a>
<a id='line_938'>together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell</a>
<a id='line_939'>together.</a>
<a id='line_940'></a>
<a id='line_941'>13:7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and</a>
<a id='line_942'>the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite</a>
<a id='line_943'>dwelled then in the land.</a>
<a id='line_944'></a>
<a id='line_945'>13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,</a>
<a id='line_946'>between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be</a>
<a id='line_947'>brethren.</a>
<a id='line_948'></a>
<a id='line_949'>13:9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,</a>
<a id='line_950'>from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right;</a>
<a id='line_951'>or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.</a>
<a id='line_952'></a>
<a id='line_953'>13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,</a>
<a id='line_954'>that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom</a>
<a id='line_955'>and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt,</a>
<a id='line_956'>as thou comest unto Zoar.</a>
<a id='line_957'></a>
<a id='line_958'>13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed</a>
<a id='line_959'>east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.</a>
<a id='line_960'></a>
<a id='line_961'>13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the</a>
<a id='line_962'>cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.</a>
<a id='line_963'></a>
<a id='line_964'>13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD</a>
<a id='line_965'>exceedingly.</a>
<a id='line_966'></a>
<a id='line_967'>13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from</a>
<a id='line_968'>him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art</a>
<a id='line_969'>northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 13:15 For all</a>
<a id='line_970'>the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for</a>
<a id='line_971'>ever.</a>
<a id='line_972'></a>
<a id='line_973'>13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a</a>
<a id='line_974'>man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be</a>
<a id='line_975'>numbered.</a>
<a id='line_976'></a>
<a id='line_977'>13:17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the</a>
<a id='line_978'>breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_979'></a>
<a id='line_980'>13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of</a>
<a id='line_981'>Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_982'></a>
<a id='line_983'>14:1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,</a>
<a id='line_984'>Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of</a>
<a id='line_985'>nations; 14:2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with</a>
<a id='line_986'>Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of</a>
<a id='line_987'>Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.</a>
<a id='line_988'></a>
<a id='line_989'>14:3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is</a>
<a id='line_990'>the salt sea.</a>
<a id='line_991'></a>
<a id='line_992'>14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year</a>
<a id='line_993'>they rebelled.</a>
<a id='line_994'></a>
<a id='line_995'>14:5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that</a>
<a id='line_996'>were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the</a>
<a id='line_997'>Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 14:6 And the</a>
<a id='line_998'>Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_999'></a>
<a id='line_1000'>14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and</a>
<a id='line_1001'>smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that</a>
<a id='line_1002'>dwelt in Hazezontamar.</a>
<a id='line_1003'></a>
<a id='line_1004'>14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah,</a>
<a id='line_1005'>and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela</a>
<a id='line_1006'>(the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of</a>
<a id='line_1007'>Siddim; 14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king</a>
<a id='line_1008'>of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;</a>
<a id='line_1009'>four kings with five.</a>
<a id='line_1010'></a>
<a id='line_1011'>14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of</a>
<a id='line_1012'>Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled</a>
<a id='line_1013'>to the mountain.</a>
<a id='line_1014'></a>
<a id='line_1015'>14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their</a>
<a id='line_1016'>victuals, and went their way.</a>
<a id='line_1017'></a>
<a id='line_1018'>14:12 And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom,</a>
<a id='line_1019'>and his goods, and departed.</a>
<a id='line_1020'></a>
<a id='line_1021'>14:13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew;</a>
<a id='line_1022'>for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and</a>
<a id='line_1023'>brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.</a>
<a id='line_1024'></a>
<a id='line_1025'>14:14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he</a>
<a id='line_1026'>armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and</a>
<a id='line_1027'>eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.</a>
<a id='line_1028'></a>
<a id='line_1029'>14:15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by</a>
<a id='line_1030'>night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the</a>
<a id='line_1031'>left hand of Damascus.</a>
<a id='line_1032'></a>
<a id='line_1033'>14:16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his</a>
<a id='line_1034'>brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.</a>
<a id='line_1035'></a>
<a id='line_1036'>14:17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from</a>
<a id='line_1037'>the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at</a>
<a id='line_1038'>the valley of Shaveh, which is the king’s dale.</a>
<a id='line_1039'></a>
<a id='line_1040'>14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and</a>
<a id='line_1041'>he was the priest of the most high God.</a>
<a id='line_1042'></a>
<a id='line_1043'>14:19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high</a>
<a id='line_1044'>God, possessor of heaven and earth: 14:20 And blessed be the most high</a>
<a id='line_1045'>God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him</a>
<a id='line_1046'>tithes of all.</a>
<a id='line_1047'></a>
<a id='line_1048'>14:21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and</a>
<a id='line_1049'>take the goods to thyself.</a>
<a id='line_1050'></a>
<a id='line_1051'>14:22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand</a>
<a id='line_1052'>unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,</a>
<a id='line_1053'>14:23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and</a>
<a id='line_1054'>that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say,</a>
<a id='line_1055'>I have made Abram rich: 14:24 Save only that which the young men have</a>
<a id='line_1056'>eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol,</a>
<a id='line_1057'>and Mamre; let them take their portion.</a>
<a id='line_1058'></a>
<a id='line_1059'>15:1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a</a>
<a id='line_1060'>vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding</a>
<a id='line_1061'>great reward.</a>
<a id='line_1062'></a>
<a id='line_1063'>15:2 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go</a>
<a id='line_1064'>childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?</a>
<a id='line_1065'>15:3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo,</a>
<a id='line_1066'>one born in my house is mine heir.</a>
<a id='line_1067'></a>
<a id='line_1068'>15:4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This</a>
<a id='line_1069'>shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own</a>
<a id='line_1070'>bowels shall be thine heir.</a>
<a id='line_1071'></a>
<a id='line_1072'>15:5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward</a>
<a id='line_1073'>heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he</a>
<a id='line_1074'>said unto him, So shall thy seed be.</a>
<a id='line_1075'></a>
<a id='line_1076'>15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for</a>
<a id='line_1077'>righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_1078'></a>
<a id='line_1079'>15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur</a>
<a id='line_1080'>of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.</a>
<a id='line_1081'></a>
<a id='line_1082'>15:8 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit</a>
<a id='line_1083'>it?  15:9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,</a>
<a id='line_1084'>and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a</a>
<a id='line_1085'>turtledove, and a young pigeon.</a>
<a id='line_1086'></a>
<a id='line_1087'>15:10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,</a>
<a id='line_1088'>and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.</a>
<a id='line_1089'></a>
<a id='line_1090'>15:11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them</a>
<a id='line_1091'>away.</a>
<a id='line_1092'></a>
<a id='line_1093'>15:12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;</a>
<a id='line_1094'>and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.</a>
<a id='line_1095'></a>
<a id='line_1096'>15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be</a>
<a id='line_1097'>a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and</a>
<a id='line_1098'>they shall afflict them four hundred years; 15:14 And also that</a>
<a id='line_1099'>nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they</a>
<a id='line_1100'>come out with great substance.</a>
<a id='line_1101'></a>
<a id='line_1102'>15:15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried</a>
<a id='line_1103'>in a good old age.</a>
<a id='line_1104'></a>
<a id='line_1105'>15:16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for</a>
<a id='line_1106'>the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.</a>
<a id='line_1107'></a>
<a id='line_1108'>15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was</a>
<a id='line_1109'>dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between</a>
<a id='line_1110'>those pieces.</a>
<a id='line_1111'></a>
<a id='line_1112'>15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1113'>Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the</a>
<a id='line_1114'>great river, the river Euphrates: 15:19 The Kenites, and the</a>
<a id='line_1115'>Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 15:20 And the Hittites, and the</a>
<a id='line_1116'>Perizzites, and the Rephaims, 15:21 And the Amorites, and the</a>
<a id='line_1117'>Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.</a>
<a id='line_1118'></a>
<a id='line_1119'>16:1 Now Sarai Abram’s wife bare him no children: and she had an</a>
<a id='line_1120'>handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.</a>
<a id='line_1121'></a>
<a id='line_1122'>16:2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained</a>
<a id='line_1123'>me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may</a>
<a id='line_1124'>obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.</a>
<a id='line_1125'></a>
<a id='line_1126'>16:3 And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after</a>
<a id='line_1127'>Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her</a>
<a id='line_1128'>husband Abram to be his wife.</a>
<a id='line_1129'></a>
<a id='line_1130'>16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw</a>
<a id='line_1131'>that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.</a>
<a id='line_1132'></a>
<a id='line_1133'>16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my</a>
<a id='line_1134'>maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was</a>
<a id='line_1135'>despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.</a>
<a id='line_1136'></a>
<a id='line_1137'>16:6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do</a>
<a id='line_1138'>to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she</a>
<a id='line_1139'>fled from her face.</a>
<a id='line_1140'></a>
<a id='line_1141'>16:7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the</a>
<a id='line_1142'>wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.</a>
<a id='line_1143'></a>
<a id='line_1144'>16:8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence camest thou? and whither</a>
<a id='line_1145'>wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.</a>
<a id='line_1146'></a>
<a id='line_1147'>16:9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress,</a>
<a id='line_1148'>and submit thyself under her hands.</a>
<a id='line_1149'></a>
<a id='line_1150'>16:10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy</a>
<a id='line_1151'>seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.</a>
<a id='line_1152'></a>
<a id='line_1153'>16:11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with</a>
<a id='line_1154'>child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because</a>
<a id='line_1155'>the LORD hath heard thy affliction.</a>
<a id='line_1156'></a>
<a id='line_1157'>16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,</a>
<a id='line_1158'>and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence</a>
<a id='line_1159'>of all his brethren.</a>
<a id='line_1160'></a>
<a id='line_1161'>16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou</a>
<a id='line_1162'>God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that</a>
<a id='line_1163'>seeth me?  16:14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold,</a>
<a id='line_1164'>it is between Kadesh and Bered.</a>
<a id='line_1165'></a>
<a id='line_1166'>16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son’s name,</a>
<a id='line_1167'>which Hagar bare, Ishmael.</a>
<a id='line_1168'></a>
<a id='line_1169'>16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare</a>
<a id='line_1170'>Ishmael to Abram.</a>
<a id='line_1171'></a>
<a id='line_1172'>17:1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared</a>
<a id='line_1173'>to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me,</a>
<a id='line_1174'>and be thou perfect.</a>
<a id='line_1175'></a>
<a id='line_1176'>17:2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will</a>
<a id='line_1177'>multiply thee exceedingly.</a>
<a id='line_1178'></a>
<a id='line_1179'>17:3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 17:4</a>
<a id='line_1180'>As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a</a>
<a id='line_1181'>father of many nations.</a>
<a id='line_1182'></a>
<a id='line_1183'>17:5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name</a>
<a id='line_1184'>shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.</a>
<a id='line_1185'></a>
<a id='line_1186'>17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations</a>
<a id='line_1187'>of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.</a>
<a id='line_1188'></a>
<a id='line_1189'>17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed</a>
<a id='line_1190'>after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a</a>
<a id='line_1191'>God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.</a>
<a id='line_1192'></a>
<a id='line_1193'>17:8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land</a>
<a id='line_1194'>wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an</a>
<a id='line_1195'>everlasting possession; and I will be their God.</a>
<a id='line_1196'></a>
<a id='line_1197'>17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore,</a>
<a id='line_1198'>thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.</a>
<a id='line_1199'></a>
<a id='line_1200'>17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and</a>
<a id='line_1201'>thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.</a>
<a id='line_1202'></a>
<a id='line_1203'>17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall</a>
<a id='line_1204'>be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.</a>
<a id='line_1205'></a>
<a id='line_1206'>17:12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,</a>
<a id='line_1207'>every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or</a>
<a id='line_1208'>bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.</a>
<a id='line_1209'></a>
<a id='line_1210'>17:13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy</a>
<a id='line_1211'>money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your</a>
<a id='line_1212'>flesh for an everlasting covenant.</a>
<a id='line_1213'></a>
<a id='line_1214'>17:14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is</a>
<a id='line_1215'>not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath</a>
<a id='line_1216'>broken my covenant.</a>
<a id='line_1217'></a>
<a id='line_1218'>17:15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not</a>
<a id='line_1219'>call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.</a>
<a id='line_1220'></a>
<a id='line_1221'>17:16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I</a>
<a id='line_1222'>will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people</a>
<a id='line_1223'>shall be of her.</a>
<a id='line_1224'></a>
<a id='line_1225'>17:17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his</a>
<a id='line_1226'>heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old?</a>
<a id='line_1227'>and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?  17:18 And Abraham</a>
<a id='line_1228'>said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!  17:19 And God</a>
<a id='line_1229'>said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call</a>
<a id='line_1230'>his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an</a>
<a id='line_1231'>everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.</a>
<a id='line_1232'></a>
<a id='line_1233'>17:20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed</a>
<a id='line_1234'>him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly;</a>
<a id='line_1235'>twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.</a>
<a id='line_1236'></a>
<a id='line_1237'>17:21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall</a>
<a id='line_1238'>bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.</a>
<a id='line_1239'></a>
<a id='line_1240'>17:22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.</a>
<a id='line_1241'></a>
<a id='line_1242'>17:23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his</a>
<a id='line_1243'>house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the</a>
<a id='line_1244'>men of Abraham’s house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in</a>
<a id='line_1245'>the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.</a>
<a id='line_1246'></a>
<a id='line_1247'>17:24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was</a>
<a id='line_1248'>circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.</a>
<a id='line_1249'></a>
<a id='line_1250'>17:25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was</a>
<a id='line_1251'>circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.</a>

<a id='line_1253'>17:26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his</a>
<a id='line_1254'>son.</a>
<a id='line_1255'></a>
<a id='line_1256'>17:27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with</a>
<a id='line_1257'>money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.</a>
<a id='line_1258'></a>
<a id='line_1259'>18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat</a>
<a id='line_1260'>in the tent door in the heat of the day; 18:2 And he lift up his eyes</a>
<a id='line_1261'>and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he</a>
<a id='line_1262'>ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the</a>
<a id='line_1263'>ground, 18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy</a>
<a id='line_1264'>sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 18:4 Let a little</a>
<a id='line_1265'>water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves</a>
<a id='line_1266'>under the tree: 18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort</a>
<a id='line_1267'>ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come</a>
<a id='line_1268'>to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</a>
<a id='line_1269'></a>
<a id='line_1270'>18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make</a>
<a id='line_1271'>ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes</a>
<a id='line_1272'>upon the hearth.</a>
<a id='line_1273'></a>
<a id='line_1274'>18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good,</a>
<a id='line_1275'>and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</a>
<a id='line_1276'></a>
<a id='line_1277'>18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,</a>
<a id='line_1278'>and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they</a>
<a id='line_1279'>did eat.</a>
<a id='line_1280'></a>
<a id='line_1281'>18:9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,</a>
<a id='line_1282'>Behold, in the tent.</a>
<a id='line_1283'></a>
<a id='line_1284'>18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the</a>
<a id='line_1285'>time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah</a>
<a id='line_1286'>heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.</a>
<a id='line_1287'></a>
<a id='line_1288'>18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it</a>
<a id='line_1289'>ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</a>
<a id='line_1290'></a>
<a id='line_1291'>18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed</a>
<a id='line_1292'>old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?  18:13 And the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1293'>said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a</a>
<a id='line_1294'>surety bear a child, which am old?  18:14 Is any thing too hard for</a>
<a id='line_1295'>the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to</a>
<a id='line_1296'>the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</a>
<a id='line_1297'></a>
<a id='line_1298'>18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.</a>
<a id='line_1299'>And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</a>
<a id='line_1300'></a>
<a id='line_1301'>18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and</a>
<a id='line_1302'>Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</a>
<a id='line_1303'></a>
<a id='line_1304'>18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I</a>
<a id='line_1305'>do; 18:18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty</a>
<a id='line_1306'>nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</a>
<a id='line_1307'>18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his</a>
<a id='line_1308'>household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do</a>
<a id='line_1309'>justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which</a>
<a id='line_1310'>he hath spoken of him.</a>
<a id='line_1311'></a>
<a id='line_1312'>18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is</a>
<a id='line_1313'>great, and because their sin is very grievous; 18:21 I will go down</a>
<a id='line_1314'>now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of</a>
<a id='line_1315'>it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</a>
<a id='line_1316'></a>
<a id='line_1317'>18:22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward</a>
<a id='line_1318'>Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1319'></a>
<a id='line_1320'>18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the</a>
<a id='line_1321'>righteous with the wicked?  18:24 Peradventure there be fifty</a>
<a id='line_1322'>righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the</a>
<a id='line_1323'>place for the fifty righteous that are therein?  18:25 That be far</a>
<a id='line_1324'>from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the</a>
<a id='line_1325'>wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far</a>
<a id='line_1326'>from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  18:26 And</a>
<a id='line_1327'>the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,</a>
<a id='line_1328'>then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</a>
<a id='line_1329'></a>
<a id='line_1330'>18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me</a>
<a id='line_1331'>to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes: 18:28</a>
<a id='line_1332'>Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou</a>
<a id='line_1333'>destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there</a>
<a id='line_1334'>forty and five, I will not destroy it.</a>
<a id='line_1335'></a>
<a id='line_1336'>18:29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there</a>
<a id='line_1337'>shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty’s</a>
<a id='line_1338'>sake.</a>
<a id='line_1339'></a>
<a id='line_1340'>18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will</a>
<a id='line_1341'>speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I</a>
<a id='line_1342'>will not do it, if I find thirty there.</a>
<a id='line_1343'></a>
<a id='line_1344'>18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the</a>
<a id='line_1345'>LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I</a>
<a id='line_1346'>will not destroy it for twenty’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_1347'></a>
<a id='line_1348'>18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet</a>
<a id='line_1349'>but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I</a>
<a id='line_1350'>will not destroy it for ten’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_1351'></a>
<a id='line_1352'>18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with</a>
<a id='line_1353'>Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</a>
<a id='line_1354'></a>
<a id='line_1355'>19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the</a>
<a id='line_1356'>gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed</a>
<a id='line_1357'>himself with his face toward the ground; 19:2 And he said, Behold now,</a>
<a id='line_1358'>my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry</a>
<a id='line_1359'>all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on</a>
<a id='line_1360'>your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all</a>
<a id='line_1361'>night.</a>
<a id='line_1362'></a>
<a id='line_1363'>19:3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,</a>
<a id='line_1364'>and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake</a>
<a id='line_1365'>unleavened bread, and they did eat.</a>
<a id='line_1366'></a>
<a id='line_1367'>19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of</a>
<a id='line_1368'>Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people</a>
<a id='line_1369'>from every quarter: 19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him,</a>
<a id='line_1370'>Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out</a>
<a id='line_1371'>unto us, that we may know them.</a>
<a id='line_1372'></a>
<a id='line_1373'>19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after</a>
<a id='line_1374'>him, 19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.</a>
<a id='line_1375'></a>
<a id='line_1376'>19:8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let</a>
<a id='line_1377'>me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good</a>
<a id='line_1378'>in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they</a>
<a id='line_1379'>under the shadow of my roof.</a>
<a id='line_1380'></a>
<a id='line_1381'>19:9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow</a>
<a id='line_1382'>came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal</a>
<a id='line_1383'>worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man,</a>
<a id='line_1384'>even Lot, and came near to break the door.</a>
<a id='line_1385'></a>
<a id='line_1386'>19:10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house</a>
<a id='line_1387'>to them, and shut to the door.</a>
<a id='line_1388'></a>
<a id='line_1389'>19:11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with</a>
<a id='line_1390'>blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to</a>
<a id='line_1391'>find the door.</a>
<a id='line_1392'></a>
<a id='line_1393'>19:12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in</a>
<a id='line_1394'>law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the</a>
<a id='line_1395'>city, bring them out of this place: 19:13 For we will destroy this</a>
<a id='line_1396'>place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the</a>
<a id='line_1397'>LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.</a>
<a id='line_1398'></a>
<a id='line_1399'>19:14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married</a>
<a id='line_1400'>his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1401'>will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons</a>
<a id='line_1402'>in law.</a>
<a id='line_1403'></a>
<a id='line_1404'>19:15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,</a>
<a id='line_1405'>saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here;</a>
<a id='line_1406'>lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.</a>
<a id='line_1407'></a>
<a id='line_1408'>19:16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon</a>
<a id='line_1409'>the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1410'>being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him</a>
<a id='line_1411'>without the city.</a>
<a id='line_1412'></a>
<a id='line_1413'>19:17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,</a>
<a id='line_1414'>that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay</a>
<a id='line_1415'>thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.</a>
<a id='line_1416'></a>
<a id='line_1417'>19:18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 19:19 Behold now,</a>
<a id='line_1418'>thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy</a>
<a id='line_1419'>mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot</a>
<a id='line_1420'>escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 19:20</a>
<a id='line_1421'>Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one:</a>
<a id='line_1422'>Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall</a>
<a id='line_1423'>live.</a>
<a id='line_1424'></a>
<a id='line_1425'>19:21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this</a>
<a id='line_1426'>thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou</a>
<a id='line_1427'>hast spoken.</a>
<a id='line_1428'></a>
<a id='line_1429'>19:22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou</a>
<a id='line_1430'>be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.</a>
<a id='line_1431'></a>
<a id='line_1432'>19:23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.</a>
<a id='line_1433'></a>
<a id='line_1434'>19:24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and</a>
<a id='line_1435'>fire from the LORD out of heaven; 19:25 And he overthrew those cities,</a>
<a id='line_1436'>and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that</a>
<a id='line_1437'>which grew upon the ground.</a>
<a id='line_1438'></a>
<a id='line_1439'>19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a</a>
<a id='line_1440'>pillar of salt.</a>
<a id='line_1441'></a>
<a id='line_1442'>19:27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he</a>
<a id='line_1443'>stood before the LORD: 19:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah,</a>
<a id='line_1444'>and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke</a>
<a id='line_1445'>of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.</a>
<a id='line_1446'></a>
<a id='line_1447'>19:29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,</a>
<a id='line_1448'>that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_1449'>overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.</a>
<a id='line_1450'></a>
<a id='line_1451'>19:30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his</a>
<a id='line_1452'>two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt</a>
<a id='line_1453'>in a cave, he and his two daughters.</a>
<a id='line_1454'></a>
<a id='line_1455'>19:31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and</a>
<a id='line_1456'>there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of</a>
<a id='line_1457'>all the earth: 19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we</a>
<a id='line_1458'>will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.</a>
<a id='line_1459'></a>
<a id='line_1460'>19:33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the</a>
<a id='line_1461'>firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when</a>
<a id='line_1462'>she lay down, nor when she arose.</a>
<a id='line_1463'></a>
<a id='line_1464'>19:34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto</a>
<a id='line_1465'>the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him</a>
<a id='line_1466'>drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we</a>
<a id='line_1467'>may preserve seed of our father.</a>
<a id='line_1468'></a>
<a id='line_1469'>19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the</a>
<a id='line_1470'>younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay</a>
<a id='line_1471'>down, nor when she arose.</a>
<a id='line_1472'></a>
<a id='line_1473'>19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.</a>
<a id='line_1474'></a>
<a id='line_1475'>19:37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the</a>
<a id='line_1476'>same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_1477'></a>
<a id='line_1478'>19:38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name</a>
<a id='line_1479'>Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this</a>
<a id='line_1480'>day.</a>
<a id='line_1481'></a>
<a id='line_1482'>20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and</a>
<a id='line_1483'>dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.</a>
<a id='line_1484'></a>
<a id='line_1485'>20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and</a>
<a id='line_1486'>Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.</a>
<a id='line_1487'></a>
<a id='line_1488'>20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,</a>
<a id='line_1489'>Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken;</a>
<a id='line_1490'>for she is a man’s wife.</a>
<a id='line_1491'></a>
<a id='line_1492'>20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou</a>
<a id='line_1493'>slay also a righteous nation?  20:5 Said he not unto me, She is my</a>
<a id='line_1494'>sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the</a>
<a id='line_1495'>integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.</a>
<a id='line_1496'></a>
<a id='line_1497'>20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst</a>
<a id='line_1498'>this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from</a>
<a id='line_1499'>sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.</a>
<a id='line_1500'></a>
<a id='line_1501'>20:7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and</a>
<a id='line_1502'>he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her</a>
<a id='line_1503'>not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are</a>
<a id='line_1504'>thine.</a>
<a id='line_1505'></a>
<a id='line_1506'>20:8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his</a>
<a id='line_1507'>servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were</a>
<a id='line_1508'>sore afraid.</a>
<a id='line_1509'></a>
<a id='line_1510'>20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou</a>
<a id='line_1511'>done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on</a>
<a id='line_1512'>me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that</a>
<a id='line_1513'>ought not to be done.</a>
<a id='line_1514'></a>
<a id='line_1515'>20:10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou</a>
<a id='line_1516'>hast done this thing?  20:11 And Abraham said, Because I thought,</a>
<a id='line_1517'>Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for</a>
<a id='line_1518'>my wife’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_1519'></a>
<a id='line_1520'>20:12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my</a>
<a id='line_1521'>father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</a>
<a id='line_1522'></a>
<a id='line_1523'>20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my</a>
<a id='line_1524'>father’s house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou</a>
<a id='line_1525'>shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me,</a>
<a id='line_1526'>He is my brother.</a>
<a id='line_1527'></a>
<a id='line_1528'>20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and</a>
<a id='line_1529'>womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his</a>
<a id='line_1530'>wife.</a>
<a id='line_1531'></a>
<a id='line_1532'>20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where</a>
<a id='line_1533'>it pleaseth thee.</a>
<a id='line_1534'></a>
<a id='line_1535'>20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a</a>
<a id='line_1536'>thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the</a>
<a id='line_1537'>eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was</a>
<a id='line_1538'>reproved.</a>
<a id='line_1539'></a>
<a id='line_1540'>20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his</a>
<a id='line_1541'>wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.</a>
<a id='line_1542'></a>
<a id='line_1543'>20:18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of</a>
<a id='line_1544'>Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife.</a>
<a id='line_1545'></a>
<a id='line_1546'>21:1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto</a>
<a id='line_1547'>Sarah as he had spoken.</a>
<a id='line_1548'></a>
<a id='line_1549'>21:2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at</a>
<a id='line_1550'>the set time of which God had spoken to him.</a>
<a id='line_1551'></a>
<a id='line_1552'>21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,</a>
<a id='line_1553'>whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.</a>
<a id='line_1554'></a>
<a id='line_1555'>21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as</a>
<a id='line_1556'>God had commanded him.</a>
<a id='line_1557'></a>
<a id='line_1558'>21:5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born</a>
<a id='line_1559'>unto him.</a>
<a id='line_1560'></a>
<a id='line_1561'>21:6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear</a>
<a id='line_1562'>will laugh with me.</a>
<a id='line_1563'></a>
<a id='line_1564'>21:7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should</a>
<a id='line_1565'>have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.</a>
<a id='line_1566'></a>
<a id='line_1567'>21:8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great</a>
<a id='line_1568'>feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.</a>
<a id='line_1569'></a>
<a id='line_1570'>21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born</a>
<a id='line_1571'>unto Abraham, mocking.</a>
<a id='line_1572'></a>
<a id='line_1573'>21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her</a>
<a id='line_1574'>son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even</a>
<a id='line_1575'>with Isaac.</a>
<a id='line_1576'></a>
<a id='line_1577'>21:11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of</a>
<a id='line_1578'>his son.</a>
<a id='line_1579'></a>
<a id='line_1580'>21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight</a>
<a id='line_1581'>because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah</a>
<a id='line_1582'>hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy</a>
<a id='line_1583'>seed be called.</a>
<a id='line_1584'></a>
<a id='line_1585'>21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,</a>
<a id='line_1586'>because he is thy seed.</a>
<a id='line_1587'></a>
<a id='line_1588'>21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a</a>
<a id='line_1589'>bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder,</a>
<a id='line_1590'>and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in</a>
<a id='line_1591'>the wilderness of Beersheba.</a>
<a id='line_1592'></a>
<a id='line_1593'>21:15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child</a>
<a id='line_1594'>under one of the shrubs.</a>
<a id='line_1595'></a>
<a id='line_1596'>21:16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off,</a>
<a id='line_1597'>as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the</a>
<a id='line_1598'>child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.</a>
<a id='line_1599'></a>
<a id='line_1600'>21:17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called</a>
<a id='line_1601'>to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar?</a>
<a id='line_1602'>fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.</a>
<a id='line_1603'></a>
<a id='line_1604'>21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will</a>
<a id='line_1605'>make him a great nation.</a>
<a id='line_1606'></a>
<a id='line_1607'>21:19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she</a>
<a id='line_1608'>went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.</a>
<a id='line_1609'></a>
<a id='line_1610'>21:20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the</a>
<a id='line_1611'>wilderness, and became an archer.</a>
<a id='line_1612'></a>
<a id='line_1613'>21:21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him</a>
<a id='line_1614'>a wife out of the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1615'></a>
<a id='line_1616'>21:22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the</a>
<a id='line_1617'>chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee</a>
<a id='line_1618'>in all that thou doest: 21:23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God</a>
<a id='line_1619'>that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my</a>
<a id='line_1620'>son’s son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee,</a>
<a id='line_1621'>thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.</a>
<a id='line_1622'></a>
<a id='line_1623'>21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear.</a>
<a id='line_1624'></a>
<a id='line_1625'>21:25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which</a>
<a id='line_1626'>Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.</a>
<a id='line_1627'></a>
<a id='line_1628'>21:26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither</a>
<a id='line_1629'>didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.</a>
<a id='line_1630'></a>
<a id='line_1631'>21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;</a>
<a id='line_1632'>and both of them made a covenant.</a>
<a id='line_1633'></a>
<a id='line_1634'>21:28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.</a>
<a id='line_1635'></a>
<a id='line_1636'>21:29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs</a>
<a id='line_1637'>which thou hast set by themselves?  21:30 And he said, For these seven</a>
<a id='line_1638'>ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto</a>
<a id='line_1639'>me, that I have digged this well.</a>
<a id='line_1640'></a>
<a id='line_1641'>21:31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they</a>
<a id='line_1642'>sware both of them.</a>
<a id='line_1643'></a>
<a id='line_1644'>21:32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up,</a>
<a id='line_1645'>and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the</a>
<a id='line_1646'>land of the Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_1647'></a>
<a id='line_1648'>21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on</a>
<a id='line_1649'>the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.</a>
<a id='line_1650'></a>
<a id='line_1651'>21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days.</a>
<a id='line_1652'></a>
<a id='line_1653'>22:1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt</a>
<a id='line_1654'>Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.</a>
<a id='line_1655'></a>
<a id='line_1656'>22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou</a>
<a id='line_1657'>lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for</a>
<a id='line_1658'>a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.</a>
<a id='line_1659'></a>
<a id='line_1660'>22:3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,</a>
<a id='line_1661'>and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave</a>
<a id='line_1662'>the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place</a>
<a id='line_1663'>of which God had told him.</a>
<a id='line_1664'></a>
<a id='line_1665'>22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the</a>
<a id='line_1666'>place afar off.</a>
<a id='line_1667'></a>
<a id='line_1668'>22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass;</a>
<a id='line_1669'>and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.</a>
<a id='line_1670'></a>
<a id='line_1671'>22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon</a>
<a id='line_1672'>Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they</a>
<a id='line_1673'>went both of them together.</a>
<a id='line_1674'></a>
<a id='line_1675'>22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and</a>
<a id='line_1676'>he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood:</a>
<a id='line_1677'>but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?  22:8 And Abraham said, My</a>
<a id='line_1678'>son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they</a>
<a id='line_1679'>went both of them together.</a>
<a id='line_1680'></a>
<a id='line_1681'>22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham</a>
<a id='line_1682'>built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his</a>
<a id='line_1683'>son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.</a>
<a id='line_1684'></a>
<a id='line_1685'>22:10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay</a>
<a id='line_1686'>his son.</a>
<a id='line_1687'></a>
<a id='line_1688'>22:11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and</a>
<a id='line_1689'>said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.</a>
<a id='line_1690'></a>
<a id='line_1691'>22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou</a>
<a id='line_1692'>any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou</a>
<a id='line_1693'>hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.</a>
<a id='line_1694'></a>
<a id='line_1695'>22:13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind</a>
<a id='line_1696'>him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took</a>
<a id='line_1697'>the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his</a>
<a id='line_1698'>son.</a>
<a id='line_1699'></a>
<a id='line_1700'>22:14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is</a>
<a id='line_1701'>said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.</a>
<a id='line_1702'></a>
<a id='line_1703'>22:15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the</a>
<a id='line_1704'>second time, 22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_1705'>for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,</a>
<a id='line_1706'>thine only son: 22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in</a>
<a id='line_1707'>multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and</a>
<a id='line_1708'>as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess</a>
<a id='line_1709'>the gate of his enemies; 22:18 And in thy seed shall all the nations</a>
<a id='line_1710'>of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.</a>
<a id='line_1711'></a>
<a id='line_1712'>22:19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and</a>
<a id='line_1713'>went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.</a>
<a id='line_1714'></a>
<a id='line_1715'>22:20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told</a>
<a id='line_1716'>Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy</a>
<a id='line_1717'>brother Nahor; 22:21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and</a>
<a id='line_1718'>Kemuel the father of Aram, 22:22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash,</a>
<a id='line_1719'>and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.</a>
<a id='line_1720'></a>
<a id='line_1721'>22:23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor,</a>
<a id='line_1722'>Abraham’s brother.</a>
<a id='line_1723'></a>
<a id='line_1724'>22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,</a>
<a id='line_1725'>and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.</a>
<a id='line_1726'></a>
<a id='line_1727'>23:1 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these</a>
<a id='line_1728'>were the years of the life of Sarah.</a>
<a id='line_1729'></a>
<a id='line_1730'>23:2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of</a>
<a id='line_1731'>Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.</a>
<a id='line_1732'></a>
<a id='line_1733'>23:3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the</a>
<a id='line_1734'>sons of Heth, saying, 23:4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you:</a>
<a id='line_1735'>give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my</a>
<a id='line_1736'>dead out of my sight.</a>
<a id='line_1737'></a>
<a id='line_1738'>23:5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:6</a>
<a id='line_1739'>Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of</a>
<a id='line_1740'>our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his</a>
<a id='line_1741'>sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.</a>
<a id='line_1742'></a>
<a id='line_1743'>23:7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the</a>
<a id='line_1744'>land, even to the children of Heth.</a>
<a id='line_1745'></a>
<a id='line_1746'>23:8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I</a>
<a id='line_1747'>should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to</a>
<a id='line_1748'>Ephron the son of Zohar, 23:9 That he may give me the cave of</a>
<a id='line_1749'>Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as</a>
<a id='line_1750'>much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a</a>
<a id='line_1751'>buryingplace amongst you.</a>
<a id='line_1752'></a>
<a id='line_1753'>23:10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the</a>
<a id='line_1754'>Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even</a>
<a id='line_1755'>of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, 23:11 Nay, my</a>
<a id='line_1756'>lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I</a>
<a id='line_1757'>give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee:</a>
<a id='line_1758'>bury thy dead.</a>
<a id='line_1759'></a>
<a id='line_1760'>23:12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.</a>
<a id='line_1761'></a>
<a id='line_1762'>23:13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the</a>
<a id='line_1763'>land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will</a>
<a id='line_1764'>give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead</a>
<a id='line_1765'>there.</a>
<a id='line_1766'></a>
<a id='line_1767'>23:14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:15 My lord,</a>
<a id='line_1768'>hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver;</a>
<a id='line_1769'>what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.</a>
<a id='line_1770'></a>
<a id='line_1771'>23:16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron</a>
<a id='line_1772'>the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth,</a>
<a id='line_1773'>four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.</a>
<a id='line_1774'></a>
<a id='line_1775'>23:17 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before</a>
<a id='line_1776'>Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees</a>
<a id='line_1777'>that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were</a>
<a id='line_1778'>made sure 23:18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the</a>
<a id='line_1779'>children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.</a>
<a id='line_1780'></a>
<a id='line_1781'>23:19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the</a>
<a id='line_1782'>field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of</a>
<a id='line_1783'>Canaan.</a>
<a id='line_1784'></a>
<a id='line_1785'>23:20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto</a>
<a id='line_1786'>Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.</a>
<a id='line_1787'></a>
<a id='line_1788'>24:1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had</a>
<a id='line_1789'>blessed Abraham in all things.</a>
<a id='line_1790'></a>
<a id='line_1791'>24:2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled</a>
<a id='line_1792'>over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: 24:3</a>
<a id='line_1793'>And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God</a>
<a id='line_1794'>of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the</a>
<a id='line_1795'>daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: 24:4 But thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_1796'>go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son</a>
<a id='line_1797'>Isaac.</a>
<a id='line_1798'></a>
<a id='line_1799'>24:5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be</a>
<a id='line_1800'>willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again</a>
<a id='line_1801'>unto the land from whence thou camest?  24:6 And Abraham said unto</a>
<a id='line_1802'>him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.</a>
<a id='line_1803'></a>
<a id='line_1804'>24:7 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father’s house, and</a>
<a id='line_1805'>from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware</a>
<a id='line_1806'>unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send</a>
<a id='line_1807'>his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from</a>
<a id='line_1808'>thence.</a>
<a id='line_1809'></a>
<a id='line_1810'>24:8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou</a>
<a id='line_1811'>shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.</a>
<a id='line_1812'></a>
<a id='line_1813'>24:9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his</a>
<a id='line_1814'>master, and sware to him concerning that matter.</a>
<a id='line_1815'></a>
<a id='line_1816'>24:10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and</a>
<a id='line_1817'>departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he</a>
<a id='line_1818'>arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.</a>
<a id='line_1819'></a>
<a id='line_1820'>24:11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well</a>
<a id='line_1821'>of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out</a>
<a id='line_1822'>to draw water.</a>
<a id='line_1823'></a>
<a id='line_1824'>24:12 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send</a>
<a id='line_1825'>me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.</a>
<a id='line_1826'></a>
<a id='line_1827'>24:13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of</a>
<a id='line_1828'>the men of the city come out to draw water: 24:14 And let it come to</a>
<a id='line_1829'>pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I</a>
<a id='line_1830'>pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give</a>
<a id='line_1831'>thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed</a>
<a id='line_1832'>for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed</a>
<a id='line_1833'>kindness unto my master.</a>
<a id='line_1834'></a>
<a id='line_1835'>24:15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,</a>
<a id='line_1836'>Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of</a>
<a id='line_1837'>Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.</a>
<a id='line_1838'></a>
<a id='line_1839'>24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had</a>
<a id='line_1840'>any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her</a>
<a id='line_1841'>pitcher, and came up.</a>
<a id='line_1842'></a>
<a id='line_1843'>24:17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,</a>
<a id='line_1844'>drink a little water of thy pitcher.</a>
<a id='line_1845'></a>
<a id='line_1846'>24:18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her</a>
<a id='line_1847'>pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.</a>
<a id='line_1848'></a>
<a id='line_1849'>24:19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw</a>
<a id='line_1850'>water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.</a>
<a id='line_1851'></a>
<a id='line_1852'>24:20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran</a>
<a id='line_1853'>again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.</a>
<a id='line_1854'></a>
<a id='line_1855'>24:21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the</a>
<a id='line_1856'>LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.</a>
<a id='line_1857'></a>
<a id='line_1858'>24:22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the</a>
<a id='line_1859'>man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets</a>
<a id='line_1860'>for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; 24:23 And said, Whose</a>
<a id='line_1861'>daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father’s</a>
<a id='line_1862'>house for us to lodge in?  24:24 And she said unto him, I am the</a>
<a id='line_1863'>daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.</a>
<a id='line_1864'></a>
<a id='line_1865'>24:25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender</a>
<a id='line_1866'>enough, and room to lodge in.</a>
<a id='line_1867'></a>
<a id='line_1868'>24:26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1869'></a>
<a id='line_1870'>24:27 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who</a>
<a id='line_1871'>hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being</a>
<a id='line_1872'>in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master’s brethren.</a>
<a id='line_1873'></a>
<a id='line_1874'>24:28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother’s house these</a>
<a id='line_1875'>things.</a>
<a id='line_1876'></a>
<a id='line_1877'>24:29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran</a>
<a id='line_1878'>out unto the man, unto the well.</a>
<a id='line_1879'></a>
<a id='line_1880'>24:30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon</a>
<a id='line_1881'>his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister,</a>
<a id='line_1882'>saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and,</a>
<a id='line_1883'>behold, he stood by the camels at the well.</a>
<a id='line_1884'></a>
<a id='line_1885'>24:31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore</a>
<a id='line_1886'>standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the</a>
<a id='line_1887'>camels.</a>
<a id='line_1888'></a>
<a id='line_1889'>24:32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and</a>
<a id='line_1890'>gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet,</a>
<a id='line_1891'>and the men’s feet that were with him.</a>
<a id='line_1892'></a>
<a id='line_1893'>24:33 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will</a>
<a id='line_1894'>not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.</a>
<a id='line_1895'></a>
<a id='line_1896'>24:34 And he said, I am Abraham’s servant.</a>
<a id='line_1897'></a>
<a id='line_1898'>24:35 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become</a>
<a id='line_1899'>great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold,</a>
<a id='line_1900'>and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.</a>
<a id='line_1901'></a>
<a id='line_1902'>24:36 And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was</a>
<a id='line_1903'>old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.</a>
<a id='line_1904'></a>
<a id='line_1905'>24:37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife</a>
<a id='line_1906'>to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:</a>
<a id='line_1907'>24:38 But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and</a>
<a id='line_1908'>take a wife unto my son.</a>
<a id='line_1909'></a>
<a id='line_1910'>24:39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not</a>
<a id='line_1911'>follow me.</a>
<a id='line_1912'></a>
<a id='line_1913'>24:40 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his</a>
<a id='line_1914'>angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for</a>
<a id='line_1915'>my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house: 24:41 Then shalt thou</a>
<a id='line_1916'>be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if</a>
<a id='line_1917'>they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.</a>
<a id='line_1918'></a>
<a id='line_1919'>24:42 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my</a>
<a id='line_1920'>master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: 24:43</a>
<a id='line_1921'>Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that</a>
<a id='line_1922'>when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me,</a>
<a id='line_1923'>I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; 24:44 And she say</a>
<a id='line_1924'>to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the</a>
<a id='line_1925'>same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master’s</a>
<a id='line_1926'>son.</a>
<a id='line_1927'></a>
<a id='line_1928'>24:45 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah</a>
<a id='line_1929'>came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto</a>
<a id='line_1930'>the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray</a>
<a id='line_1931'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_1932'></a>
<a id='line_1933'>24:46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,</a>
<a id='line_1934'>and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank,</a>
<a id='line_1935'>and she made the camels drink also.</a>
<a id='line_1936'></a>
<a id='line_1937'>24:47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she</a>
<a id='line_1938'>said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare unto him:</a>
<a id='line_1939'>and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.</a>
<a id='line_1940'></a>
<a id='line_1941'>24:48 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed</a>
<a id='line_1942'>the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way</a>
<a id='line_1943'>to take my master’s brother’s daughter unto his son.</a>
<a id='line_1944'></a>
<a id='line_1945'>24:49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell</a>
<a id='line_1946'>me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the</a>
<a id='line_1947'>left.</a>
<a id='line_1948'></a>
<a id='line_1949'>24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth</a>
<a id='line_1950'>from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.</a>
<a id='line_1951'></a>
<a id='line_1952'>24:51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be</a>
<a id='line_1953'>thy master’s son’s wife, as the LORD hath spoken.</a>
<a id='line_1954'></a>
<a id='line_1955'>24:52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their</a>
<a id='line_1956'>words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_1957'></a>
<a id='line_1958'>24:53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of</a>
<a id='line_1959'>gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her</a>
<a id='line_1960'>brother and to her mother precious things.</a>
<a id='line_1961'></a>
<a id='line_1962'>24:54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,</a>
<a id='line_1963'>and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said,</a>
<a id='line_1964'>Send me away unto my master.</a>
<a id='line_1965'></a>
<a id='line_1966'>24:55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with</a>
<a id='line_1967'>us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.</a>
<a id='line_1968'></a>
<a id='line_1969'>24:56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath</a>
<a id='line_1970'>prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.</a>
<a id='line_1971'></a>
<a id='line_1972'>24:57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her</a>
<a id='line_1973'>mouth.</a>
<a id='line_1974'></a>
<a id='line_1975'>24:58 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with</a>
<a id='line_1976'>this man? And she said, I will go.</a>
<a id='line_1977'></a>
<a id='line_1978'>24:59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and</a>
<a id='line_1979'>Abraham’s servant, and his men.</a>
<a id='line_1980'></a>
<a id='line_1981'>24:60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our</a>
<a id='line_1982'>sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed</a>
<a id='line_1983'>possess the gate of those which hate them.</a>
<a id='line_1984'></a>
<a id='line_1985'>24:61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the</a>
<a id='line_1986'>camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went</a>
<a id='line_1987'>his way.</a>
<a id='line_1988'></a>
<a id='line_1989'>24:62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt</a>
<a id='line_1990'>in the south country.</a>
<a id='line_1991'></a>
<a id='line_1992'>24:63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and</a>
<a id='line_1993'>he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.</a>
<a id='line_1994'></a>
<a id='line_1995'>24:64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she</a>
<a id='line_1996'>lighted off the camel.</a>
<a id='line_1997'></a>
<a id='line_1998'>24:65 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh</a>
<a id='line_1999'>in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master:</a>
<a id='line_2000'>therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.</a>
<a id='line_2001'></a>
<a id='line_2002'>24:66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.</a>
<a id='line_2003'></a>
<a id='line_2004'>24:67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took</a>
<a id='line_2005'>Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was</a>
<a id='line_2006'>comforted after his mother’s death.</a>
<a id='line_2007'></a>
<a id='line_2008'>25:1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.</a>
<a id='line_2009'></a>
<a id='line_2010'>25:2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and</a>
<a id='line_2011'>Ishbak, and Shuah.</a>
<a id='line_2012'></a>
<a id='line_2013'>25:3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were</a>
<a id='line_2014'>Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.</a>
<a id='line_2015'></a>
<a id='line_2016'>25:4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah,</a>
<a id='line_2017'>and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.</a>
<a id='line_2018'></a>
<a id='line_2019'>25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.</a>
<a id='line_2020'></a>
<a id='line_2021'>25:6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham</a>
<a id='line_2022'>gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,</a>
<a id='line_2023'>eastward, unto the east country.</a>
<a id='line_2024'></a>
<a id='line_2025'>25:7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he</a>
<a id='line_2026'>lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.</a>
<a id='line_2027'></a>
<a id='line_2028'>25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an</a>
<a id='line_2029'>old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.</a>
<a id='line_2030'></a>
<a id='line_2031'>25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of</a>
<a id='line_2032'>Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which</a>
<a id='line_2033'>is before Mamre; 25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons</a>
<a id='line_2034'>of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</a>
<a id='line_2035'></a>
<a id='line_2036'>25:11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed</a>
<a id='line_2037'>his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.</a>
<a id='line_2038'></a>
<a id='line_2039'>25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom</a>
<a id='line_2040'>Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 25:13 And</a>
<a id='line_2041'>these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according</a>
<a id='line_2042'>to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar,</a>
<a id='line_2043'>and Adbeel, and Mibsam, 25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 25:15</a>
<a id='line_2044'>Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 25:16 These are the sons</a>
<a id='line_2045'>of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their</a>
<a id='line_2046'>castles; twelve princes according to their nations.</a>
<a id='line_2047'></a>
<a id='line_2048'>25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and</a>
<a id='line_2049'>thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was</a>
<a id='line_2050'>gathered unto his people.</a>
<a id='line_2051'></a>
<a id='line_2052'>25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as</a>
<a id='line_2053'>thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his</a>
<a id='line_2054'>brethren.</a>
<a id='line_2055'></a>
<a id='line_2056'>25:19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham</a>
<a id='line_2057'>begat Isaac: 25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah</a>
<a id='line_2058'>to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister</a>
<a id='line_2059'>to Laban the Syrian.</a>
<a id='line_2060'></a>
<a id='line_2061'>25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was</a>
<a id='line_2062'>barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife</a>
<a id='line_2063'>conceived.</a>
<a id='line_2064'></a>
<a id='line_2065'>25:22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If</a>
<a id='line_2066'>it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2067'></a>
<a id='line_2068'>25:23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two</a>
<a id='line_2069'>manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one</a>
<a id='line_2070'>people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall</a>
<a id='line_2071'>serve the younger.</a>
<a id='line_2072'></a>
<a id='line_2073'>25:24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there</a>
<a id='line_2074'>were twins in her womb.</a>
<a id='line_2075'></a>
<a id='line_2076'>25:25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and</a>
<a id='line_2077'>they called his name Esau.</a>
<a id='line_2078'></a>
<a id='line_2079'>25:26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on</a>
<a id='line_2080'>Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore</a>
<a id='line_2081'>years old when she bare them.</a>
<a id='line_2082'></a>
<a id='line_2083'>25:27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the</a>
<a id='line_2084'>field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.</a>
<a id='line_2085'></a>
<a id='line_2086'>25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but</a>
<a id='line_2087'>Rebekah loved Jacob.</a>
<a id='line_2088'></a>
<a id='line_2089'>25:29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was</a>
<a id='line_2090'>faint: 25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that</a>
<a id='line_2091'>same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.</a>
<a id='line_2092'></a>
<a id='line_2093'>25:31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.</a>
<a id='line_2094'></a>
<a id='line_2095'>25:32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit</a>
<a id='line_2096'>shall this birthright do to me?  25:33 And Jacob said, Swear to me</a>
<a id='line_2097'>this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto</a>
<a id='line_2098'>Jacob.</a>
<a id='line_2099'></a>
<a id='line_2100'>25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did</a>
<a id='line_2101'>eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his</a>
<a id='line_2102'>birthright.</a>
<a id='line_2103'></a>
<a id='line_2104'>26:1 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that</a>
<a id='line_2105'>was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the</a>
<a id='line_2106'>Philistines unto Gerar.</a>
<a id='line_2107'></a>
<a id='line_2108'>26:2 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt;</a>
<a id='line_2109'>dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: 26:3 Sojourn in this</a>
<a id='line_2110'>land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and</a>
<a id='line_2111'>unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the</a>
<a id='line_2112'>oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 26:4 And I will make thy</a>
<a id='line_2113'>seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed</a>
<a id='line_2114'>all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the</a>
<a id='line_2115'>earth be blessed; 26:5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept</a>
<a id='line_2116'>my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</a>
<a id='line_2117'></a>
<a id='line_2118'>26:6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 26:7 And the men of the place asked him</a>
<a id='line_2119'>of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She</a>
<a id='line_2120'>is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for</a>
<a id='line_2121'>Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.</a>
<a id='line_2122'></a>
<a id='line_2123'>26:8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that</a>
<a id='line_2124'>Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw,</a>
<a id='line_2125'>and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.</a>
<a id='line_2126'></a>
<a id='line_2127'>26:9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is</a>
<a id='line_2128'>thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto</a>
<a id='line_2129'>him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.</a>
<a id='line_2130'></a>
<a id='line_2131'>26:10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of</a>
<a id='line_2132'>the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest</a>
<a id='line_2133'>have brought guiltiness upon us.</a>
<a id='line_2134'></a>
<a id='line_2135'>26:11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth</a>
<a id='line_2136'>this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</a>
<a id='line_2137'></a>
<a id='line_2138'>26:12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an</a>
<a id='line_2139'>hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.</a>
<a id='line_2140'></a>
<a id='line_2141'>26:13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he</a>
<a id='line_2142'>became very great: 26:14 For he had possession of flocks, and</a>
<a id='line_2143'>possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines</a>
<a id='line_2144'>envied him.</a>
<a id='line_2145'></a>
<a id='line_2146'>26:15 For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the</a>
<a id='line_2147'>days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and</a>
<a id='line_2148'>filled them with earth.</a>
<a id='line_2149'></a>
<a id='line_2150'>26:16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much</a>
<a id='line_2151'>mightier than we.</a>
<a id='line_2152'></a>
<a id='line_2153'>26:17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of</a>
<a id='line_2154'>Gerar, and dwelt there.</a>
<a id='line_2155'></a>
<a id='line_2156'>26:18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged</a>
<a id='line_2157'>in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped</a>
<a id='line_2158'>them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the</a>
<a id='line_2159'>names by which his father had called them.</a>
<a id='line_2160'></a>
<a id='line_2161'>26:19 And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a</a>
<a id='line_2162'>well of springing water.</a>
<a id='line_2163'></a>
<a id='line_2164'>26:20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen,</a>
<a id='line_2165'>saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek;</a>
<a id='line_2166'>because they strove with him.</a>
<a id='line_2167'></a>
<a id='line_2168'>26:21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he</a>
<a id='line_2169'>called the name of it Sitnah.</a>
<a id='line_2170'></a>
<a id='line_2171'>26:22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for</a>
<a id='line_2172'>that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he</a>
<a id='line_2173'>said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful</a>
<a id='line_2174'>in the land.</a>
<a id='line_2175'></a>
<a id='line_2176'>26:23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.</a>
<a id='line_2177'></a>
<a id='line_2178'>26:24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am</a>
<a id='line_2179'>the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will</a>
<a id='line_2180'>bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_2181'></a>
<a id='line_2182'>26:25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the</a>
<a id='line_2183'>LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged a</a>
<a id='line_2184'>well.</a>
<a id='line_2185'></a>
<a id='line_2186'>26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his</a>
<a id='line_2187'>friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.</a>
<a id='line_2188'></a>
<a id='line_2189'>26:27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye</a>
<a id='line_2190'>hate me, and have sent me away from you?  26:28 And they said, We saw</a>
<a id='line_2191'>certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now</a>
<a id='line_2192'>an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a</a>
<a id='line_2193'>covenant with thee; 26:29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not</a>
<a id='line_2194'>touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have</a>
<a id='line_2195'>sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2196'></a>
<a id='line_2197'>26:30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.</a>
<a id='line_2198'></a>
<a id='line_2199'>26:31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to</a>
<a id='line_2200'>another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in</a>
<a id='line_2201'>peace.</a>
<a id='line_2202'></a>
<a id='line_2203'>26:32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came,</a>
<a id='line_2204'>and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_2205'>him, We have found water.</a>
<a id='line_2206'></a>
<a id='line_2207'>26:33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is</a>
<a id='line_2208'>Beersheba unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_2209'></a>
<a id='line_2210'>26:34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the</a>
<a id='line_2211'>daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the</a>
<a id='line_2212'>Hittite: 26:35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.</a>
<a id='line_2213'></a>
<a id='line_2214'>27:1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were</a>
<a id='line_2215'>dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said</a>
<a id='line_2216'>unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.</a>
<a id='line_2217'></a>
<a id='line_2218'>27:2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my</a>
<a id='line_2219'>death: 27:3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver</a>
<a id='line_2220'>and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 27:4</a>
<a id='line_2221'>And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I</a>
<a id='line_2222'>may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.</a>
<a id='line_2223'></a>
<a id='line_2224'>27:5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went</a>
<a id='line_2225'>to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.</a>
<a id='line_2226'></a>
<a id='line_2227'>27:6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy</a>
<a id='line_2228'>father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 27:7 Bring me venison, and</a>
<a id='line_2229'>make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2230'>before my death.</a>
<a id='line_2231'></a>
<a id='line_2232'>27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I</a>
<a id='line_2233'>command thee.</a>
<a id='line_2234'></a>
<a id='line_2235'>27:9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of</a>
<a id='line_2236'>the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as</a>
<a id='line_2237'>he loveth: 27:10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may</a>
<a id='line_2238'>eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.</a>
<a id='line_2239'></a>
<a id='line_2240'>27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is</a>
<a id='line_2241'>a hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 27:12 My father peradventure will</a>
<a id='line_2242'>feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a</a>
<a id='line_2243'>curse upon me, and not a blessing.</a>
<a id='line_2244'></a>
<a id='line_2245'>27:13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only</a>
<a id='line_2246'>obey my voice, and go fetch me them.</a>
<a id='line_2247'></a>
<a id='line_2248'>27:14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and</a>
<a id='line_2249'>his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.</a>
<a id='line_2250'></a>
<a id='line_2251'>27:15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which</a>
<a id='line_2252'>were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:</a>
<a id='line_2253'>27:16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,</a>
<a id='line_2254'>and upon the smooth of his neck: 27:17 And she gave the savoury meat</a>
<a id='line_2255'>and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</a>
<a id='line_2256'></a>
<a id='line_2257'>27:18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,</a>
<a id='line_2258'>Here am I; who art thou, my son?  27:19 And Jacob said unto his</a>
<a id='line_2259'>father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest</a>
<a id='line_2260'>me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may</a>
<a id='line_2261'>bless me.</a>
<a id='line_2262'></a>
<a id='line_2263'>27:20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it</a>
<a id='line_2264'>so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it</a>
<a id='line_2265'>to me.</a>
<a id='line_2266'></a>
<a id='line_2267'>27:21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may</a>
<a id='line_2268'>feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.</a>
<a id='line_2269'></a>
<a id='line_2270'>27:22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and</a>
<a id='line_2271'>said, The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.</a>
<a id='line_2272'></a>
<a id='line_2273'>27:23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his</a>
<a id='line_2274'>brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him.</a>
<a id='line_2275'></a>
<a id='line_2276'>27:24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.</a>
<a id='line_2277'></a>
<a id='line_2278'>27:25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s</a>
<a id='line_2279'>venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him,</a>
<a id='line_2280'>and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.</a>
<a id='line_2281'></a>
<a id='line_2282'>27:26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me,</a>
<a id='line_2283'>my son.</a>
<a id='line_2284'></a>
<a id='line_2285'>27:27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of</a>
<a id='line_2286'>his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as</a>
<a id='line_2287'>the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed: 27:28 Therefore God</a>
<a id='line_2288'>give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and</a>
<a id='line_2289'>plenty of corn and wine: 27:29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow</a>
<a id='line_2290'>down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow</a>
<a id='line_2291'>down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he</a>
<a id='line_2292'>that blesseth thee.</a>
<a id='line_2293'></a>
<a id='line_2294'>27:30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of</a>
<a id='line_2295'>blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of</a>
<a id='line_2296'>Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.</a>
<a id='line_2297'></a>
<a id='line_2298'>27:31 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his</a>
<a id='line_2299'>father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his</a>
<a id='line_2300'>son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me.</a>
<a id='line_2301'></a>
<a id='line_2302'>27:32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I</a>
<a id='line_2303'>am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.</a>
<a id='line_2304'></a>
<a id='line_2305'>27:33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he</a>
<a id='line_2306'>that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all</a>
<a id='line_2307'>before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be</a>
<a id='line_2308'>blessed.</a>
<a id='line_2309'></a>
<a id='line_2310'>27:34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a</a>
<a id='line_2311'>great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me,</a>
<a id='line_2312'>even me also, O my father.</a>
<a id='line_2313'></a>
<a id='line_2314'>27:35 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away</a>
<a id='line_2315'>thy blessing.</a>
<a id='line_2316'></a>
<a id='line_2317'>27:36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath</a>
<a id='line_2318'>supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and,</a>
<a id='line_2319'>behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not</a>
<a id='line_2320'>reserved a blessing for me?  27:37 And Isaac answered and said unto</a>
<a id='line_2321'>Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I</a>
<a id='line_2322'>given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained</a>
<a id='line_2323'>him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?  27:38 And Esau said</a>
<a id='line_2324'>unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even</a>
<a id='line_2325'>me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.</a>
<a id='line_2326'></a>
<a id='line_2327'>27:39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy</a>
<a id='line_2328'>dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven</a>
<a id='line_2329'>from above; 27:40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve</a>
<a id='line_2330'>thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the</a>
<a id='line_2331'>dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.</a>
<a id='line_2332'></a>
<a id='line_2333'>27:41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his</a>
<a id='line_2334'>father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning</a>
<a id='line_2335'>for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.</a>
<a id='line_2336'></a>
<a id='line_2337'>27:42 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and</a>
<a id='line_2338'>she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold,</a>
<a id='line_2339'>thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to</a>
<a id='line_2340'>kill thee.</a>
<a id='line_2341'></a>
<a id='line_2342'>27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban</a>
<a id='line_2343'>my brother to Haran; 27:44 And tarry with him a few days, until thy</a>
<a id='line_2344'>brother’s fury turn away; 27:45 Until thy brother’s anger turn away</a>
<a id='line_2345'>from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will</a>
<a id='line_2346'>send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you</a>
<a id='line_2347'>both in one day?  27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my</a>
<a id='line_2348'>life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the</a>
<a id='line_2349'>daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the</a>
<a id='line_2350'>land, what good shall my life do me?  28:1 And Isaac called Jacob, and</a>
<a id='line_2351'>blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a</a>
<a id='line_2352'>wife of the daughters of Canaan.</a>
<a id='line_2353'></a>
<a id='line_2354'>28:2 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s</a>
<a id='line_2355'>father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy</a>
<a id='line_2356'>mother’s brother.</a>
<a id='line_2357'></a>
<a id='line_2358'>28:3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply</a>
<a id='line_2359'>thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; 28:4 And give thee</a>
<a id='line_2360'>the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou</a>
<a id='line_2361'>mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave</a>
<a id='line_2362'>unto Abraham.</a>
<a id='line_2363'></a>
<a id='line_2364'>28:5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban,</a>
<a id='line_2365'>son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s</a>
<a id='line_2366'>mother.</a>
<a id='line_2367'></a>
<a id='line_2368'>28:6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to</a>
<a id='line_2369'>Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him</a>
<a id='line_2370'>he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the</a>
<a id='line_2371'>daughers of Canaan; 28:7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his</a>
<a id='line_2372'>mother, and was gone to Padanaram; 28:8 And Esau seeing that the</a>
<a id='line_2373'>daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; 28:9 Then went Esau</a>
<a id='line_2374'>unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the</a>
<a id='line_2375'>daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his</a>
<a id='line_2376'>wife.</a>
<a id='line_2377'></a>
<a id='line_2378'>28:10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.</a>
<a id='line_2379'></a>
<a id='line_2380'>28:11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all</a>
<a id='line_2381'>night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that</a>
<a id='line_2382'>place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to</a>
<a id='line_2383'>sleep.</a>
<a id='line_2384'></a>
<a id='line_2385'>28:12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the</a>
<a id='line_2386'>top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending</a>
<a id='line_2387'>and descending on it.</a>
<a id='line_2388'></a>
<a id='line_2389'>28:13 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2390'>God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou</a>
<a id='line_2391'>liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; 28:14 And thy seed</a>
<a id='line_2392'>shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the</a>
<a id='line_2393'>west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee</a>
<a id='line_2394'>and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</a>
<a id='line_2395'></a>
<a id='line_2396'>28:15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places</a>
<a id='line_2397'>whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I</a>
<a id='line_2398'>will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to</a>
<a id='line_2399'>thee of.</a>
<a id='line_2400'></a>
<a id='line_2401'>28:16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2402'>is in this place; and I knew it not.</a>
<a id='line_2403'></a>
<a id='line_2404'>28:17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is</a>
<a id='line_2405'>none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_2406'></a>
<a id='line_2407'>28:18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that</a>
<a id='line_2408'>he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil</a>
<a id='line_2409'>upon the top of it.</a>
<a id='line_2410'></a>
<a id='line_2411'>28:19 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of</a>
<a id='line_2412'>that city was called Luz at the first.</a>
<a id='line_2413'></a>
<a id='line_2414'>28:20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will</a>
<a id='line_2415'>keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and</a>
<a id='line_2416'>raiment to put on, 28:21 So that I come again to my father’s house in</a>
<a id='line_2417'>peace; then shall the LORD be my God: 28:22 And this stone, which I</a>
<a id='line_2418'>have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that thou</a>
<a id='line_2419'>shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_2420'></a>
<a id='line_2421'>29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the</a>
<a id='line_2422'>people of the east.</a>
<a id='line_2423'></a>
<a id='line_2424'>29:2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there</a>
<a id='line_2425'>were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they</a>
<a id='line_2426'>watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well’s mouth.</a>
<a id='line_2427'></a>
<a id='line_2428'>29:3 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the</a>
<a id='line_2429'>stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone</a>
<a id='line_2430'>again upon the well’s mouth in his place.</a>
<a id='line_2431'></a>
<a id='line_2432'>29:4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they</a>
<a id='line_2433'>said, Of Haran are we.</a>
<a id='line_2434'></a>
<a id='line_2435'>29:5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they</a>
<a id='line_2436'>said, We know him.</a>
<a id='line_2437'></a>
<a id='line_2438'>29:6 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:</a>
<a id='line_2439'>and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.</a>
<a id='line_2440'></a>
<a id='line_2441'>29:7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the</a>
<a id='line_2442'>cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and</a>
<a id='line_2443'>feed them.</a>
<a id='line_2444'></a>
<a id='line_2445'>29:8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered</a>
<a id='line_2446'>together, and till they roll the stone from the well’s mouth; then we</a>
<a id='line_2447'>water the sheep.</a>
<a id='line_2448'></a>
<a id='line_2449'>29:9 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father’s</a>
<a id='line_2450'>sheep; for she kept them.</a>
<a id='line_2451'></a>
<a id='line_2452'>29:10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban</a>
<a id='line_2453'>his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother,</a>
<a id='line_2454'>that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and</a>
<a id='line_2455'>watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.</a>
<a id='line_2456'></a>
<a id='line_2457'>29:11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.</a>
<a id='line_2458'></a>
<a id='line_2459'>29:12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that</a>
<a id='line_2460'>he was Rebekah’s son: and she ran and told her father.</a>
<a id='line_2461'></a>
<a id='line_2462'>29:13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his</a>
<a id='line_2463'>sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed</a>
<a id='line_2464'>him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.</a>
<a id='line_2465'></a>
<a id='line_2466'>29:14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And</a>
<a id='line_2467'>he abode with him the space of a month.</a>
<a id='line_2468'></a>
<a id='line_2469'>29:15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,</a>
<a id='line_2470'>shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy</a>
<a id='line_2471'>wages be?  29:16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder</a>
<a id='line_2472'>was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</a>
<a id='line_2473'></a>
<a id='line_2474'>29:17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well</a>
<a id='line_2475'>favoured.</a>
<a id='line_2476'></a>
<a id='line_2477'>29:18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years</a>
<a id='line_2478'>for Rachel thy younger daughter.</a>
<a id='line_2479'></a>
<a id='line_2480'>29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that</a>
<a id='line_2481'>I should give her to another man: abide with me.</a>
<a id='line_2482'></a>
<a id='line_2483'>29:20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto</a>
<a id='line_2484'>him but a few days, for the love he had to her.</a>
<a id='line_2485'></a>
<a id='line_2486'>29:21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are</a>
<a id='line_2487'>fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.</a>
<a id='line_2488'></a>
<a id='line_2489'>29:22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a</a>
<a id='line_2490'>feast.</a>
<a id='line_2491'></a>
<a id='line_2492'>29:23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his</a>
<a id='line_2493'>daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.</a>
<a id='line_2494'></a>
<a id='line_2495'>29:24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an</a>
<a id='line_2496'>handmaid.</a>
<a id='line_2497'></a>
<a id='line_2498'>29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:</a>
<a id='line_2499'>and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I</a>
<a id='line_2500'>serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?</a>
<a id='line_2501'>29:26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give</a>
<a id='line_2502'>the younger before the firstborn.</a>
<a id='line_2503'></a>
<a id='line_2504'>29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service</a>
<a id='line_2505'>which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.</a>
<a id='line_2506'></a>
<a id='line_2507'>29:28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel</a>
<a id='line_2508'>his daughter to wife also.</a>
<a id='line_2509'></a>
<a id='line_2510'>29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be</a>
<a id='line_2511'>her maid.</a>
<a id='line_2512'></a>
<a id='line_2513'>29:30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more</a>
<a id='line_2514'>than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.</a>
<a id='line_2515'></a>
<a id='line_2516'>29:31 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:</a>
<a id='line_2517'>but Rachel was barren.</a>
<a id='line_2518'></a>
<a id='line_2519'>29:32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name</a>
<a id='line_2520'>Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction;</a>
<a id='line_2521'>now therefore my husband will love me.</a>
<a id='line_2522'></a>
<a id='line_2523'>29:33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the</a>
<a id='line_2524'>LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also:</a>
<a id='line_2525'>and she called his name Simeon.</a>
<a id='line_2526'></a>
<a id='line_2527'>29:34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time</a>
<a id='line_2528'>will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons:</a>
<a id='line_2529'>therefore was his name called Levi.</a>
<a id='line_2530'></a>
<a id='line_2531'>29:35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will</a>
<a id='line_2532'>I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left</a>
<a id='line_2533'>bearing.</a>
<a id='line_2534'></a>
<a id='line_2535'>30:1 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel</a>
<a id='line_2536'>envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I</a>
<a id='line_2537'>die.</a>
<a id='line_2538'></a>
<a id='line_2539'>30:2 And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I</a>
<a id='line_2540'>in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?</a>
<a id='line_2541'>30:3 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she</a>
<a id='line_2542'>shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.</a>
<a id='line_2543'></a>
<a id='line_2544'>30:4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in</a>
<a id='line_2545'>unto her.</a>
<a id='line_2546'></a>
<a id='line_2547'>30:5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.</a>
<a id='line_2548'></a>
<a id='line_2549'>30:6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my</a>
<a id='line_2550'>voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.</a>
<a id='line_2551'></a>
<a id='line_2552'>30:7 And Bilhah Rachel’s maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second</a>
<a id='line_2553'>son.</a>
<a id='line_2554'></a>
<a id='line_2555'>30:8 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my</a>
<a id='line_2556'>sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.</a>
<a id='line_2557'></a>
<a id='line_2558'>30:9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her</a>
<a id='line_2559'>maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.</a>
<a id='line_2560'></a>
<a id='line_2561'>30:10 And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a son.</a>
<a id='line_2562'></a>
<a id='line_2563'>30:11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.</a>
<a id='line_2564'></a>
<a id='line_2565'>30:12 And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a second son.</a>
<a id='line_2566'></a>
<a id='line_2567'>30:13 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me</a>
<a id='line_2568'>blessed: and she called his name Asher.</a>
<a id='line_2569'></a>
<a id='line_2570'>30:14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found</a>
<a id='line_2571'>mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then</a>
<a id='line_2572'>Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes.</a>
<a id='line_2573'></a>
<a id='line_2574'>30:15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken</a>
<a id='line_2575'>my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also? And</a>
<a id='line_2576'>Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son’s</a>
<a id='line_2577'>mandrakes.</a>
<a id='line_2578'></a>
<a id='line_2579'>30:16 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went</a>
<a id='line_2580'>out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I</a>
<a id='line_2581'>have hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that</a>
<a id='line_2582'>night.</a>
<a id='line_2583'></a>
<a id='line_2584'>30:17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob</a>
<a id='line_2585'>the fifth son.</a>
<a id='line_2586'></a>
<a id='line_2587'>30:18 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given</a>
<a id='line_2588'>my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.</a>
<a id='line_2589'></a>
<a id='line_2590'>30:19 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.</a>
<a id='line_2591'></a>
<a id='line_2592'>30:20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my</a>
<a id='line_2593'>husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she</a>
<a id='line_2594'>called his name Zebulun.</a>
<a id='line_2595'></a>
<a id='line_2596'>30:21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.</a>
<a id='line_2597'></a>
<a id='line_2598'>30:22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened</a>
<a id='line_2599'>her womb.</a>
<a id='line_2600'></a>
<a id='line_2601'>30:23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away</a>
<a id='line_2602'>my reproach: 30:24 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD</a>
<a id='line_2603'>shall add to me another son.</a>
<a id='line_2604'></a>
<a id='line_2605'>30:25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob</a>
<a id='line_2606'>said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and</a>
<a id='line_2607'>to my country.</a>
<a id='line_2608'></a>
<a id='line_2609'>30:26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,</a>
<a id='line_2610'>and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.</a>
<a id='line_2611'></a>
<a id='line_2612'>30:27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in</a>
<a id='line_2613'>thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath</a>
<a id='line_2614'>blessed me for thy sake.</a>
<a id='line_2615'></a>
<a id='line_2616'>30:28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.</a>
<a id='line_2617'></a>
<a id='line_2618'>30:29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and</a>
<a id='line_2619'>how thy cattle was with me.</a>
<a id='line_2620'></a>
<a id='line_2621'>30:30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now</a>
<a id='line_2622'>increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my</a>
<a id='line_2623'>coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?  30:31</a>
<a id='line_2624'>And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not</a>
<a id='line_2625'>give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again</a>
<a id='line_2626'>feed and keep thy flock.</a>
<a id='line_2627'></a>
<a id='line_2628'>30:32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence</a>
<a id='line_2629'>all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among</a>
<a id='line_2630'>the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such</a>
<a id='line_2631'>shall be my hire.</a>
<a id='line_2632'></a>
<a id='line_2633'>30:33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it</a>
<a id='line_2634'>shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled</a>
<a id='line_2635'>and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be</a>
<a id='line_2636'>counted stolen with me.</a>
<a id='line_2637'></a>
<a id='line_2638'>30:34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy</a>
<a id='line_2639'>word.</a>
<a id='line_2640'></a>
<a id='line_2641'>30:35 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and</a>
<a id='line_2642'>spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and</a>
<a id='line_2643'>every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the</a>
<a id='line_2644'>sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.</a>
<a id='line_2645'></a>
<a id='line_2646'>30:36 And he set three days’ journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and</a>
<a id='line_2647'>Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.</a>
<a id='line_2648'></a>
<a id='line_2649'>30:37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and</a>
<a id='line_2650'>chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white</a>
<a id='line_2651'>appear which was in the rods.</a>
<a id='line_2652'></a>
<a id='line_2653'>30:38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the</a>
<a id='line_2654'>gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that</a>
<a id='line_2655'>they should conceive when they came to drink.</a>
<a id='line_2656'></a>
<a id='line_2657'>30:39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth</a>
<a id='line_2658'>cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.</a>
<a id='line_2659'></a>
<a id='line_2660'>30:40 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the</a>
<a id='line_2661'>flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of</a>
<a id='line_2662'>Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto</a>
<a id='line_2663'>Laban’s cattle.</a>
<a id='line_2664'></a>
<a id='line_2665'>30:41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did</a>
<a id='line_2666'>conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in</a>
<a id='line_2667'>the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.</a>
<a id='line_2668'></a>
<a id='line_2669'>30:42 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the</a>
<a id='line_2670'>feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.</a>
<a id='line_2671'></a>
<a id='line_2672'>30:43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and</a>
<a id='line_2673'>maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.</a>
<a id='line_2674'></a>
<a id='line_2675'>31:1 And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken</a>
<a id='line_2676'>away all that was our father’s; and of that which was our father’s</a>
<a id='line_2677'>hath he gotten all this glory.</a>
<a id='line_2678'></a>
<a id='line_2679'>31:2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was</a>
<a id='line_2680'>not toward him as before.</a>
<a id='line_2681'></a>
<a id='line_2682'>31:3 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy</a>
<a id='line_2683'>fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.</a>
<a id='line_2684'></a>
<a id='line_2685'>31:4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his</a>
<a id='line_2686'>flock, 31:5 And said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that</a>
<a id='line_2687'>it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with</a>
<a id='line_2688'>me.</a>
<a id='line_2689'></a>
<a id='line_2690'>31:6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.</a>
<a id='line_2691'></a>
<a id='line_2692'>31:7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times;</a>
<a id='line_2693'>but God suffered him not to hurt me.</a>
<a id='line_2694'></a>
<a id='line_2695'>31:8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the</a>
<a id='line_2696'>cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be</a>
<a id='line_2697'>thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.</a>
<a id='line_2698'></a>
<a id='line_2699'>31:9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given</a>
<a id='line_2700'>them to me.</a>
<a id='line_2701'></a>
<a id='line_2702'>31:10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that</a>
<a id='line_2703'>I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which</a>
<a id='line_2704'>leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.</a>
<a id='line_2705'></a>
<a id='line_2706'>31:11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:</a>
<a id='line_2707'>And I said, Here am I.</a>
<a id='line_2708'></a>
<a id='line_2709'>31:12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which</a>
<a id='line_2710'>leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I</a>
<a id='line_2711'>have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_2712'></a>
<a id='line_2713'>31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and</a>
<a id='line_2714'>where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this</a>
<a id='line_2715'>land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.</a>
<a id='line_2716'></a>
<a id='line_2717'>31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any</a>
<a id='line_2718'>portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?  31:15 Are we not</a>
<a id='line_2719'>counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured</a>
<a id='line_2720'>also our money.</a>
<a id='line_2721'></a>
<a id='line_2722'>31:16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is</a>
<a id='line_2723'>ours, and our children’s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto</a>
<a id='line_2724'>thee, do.</a>
<a id='line_2725'></a>
<a id='line_2726'>31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;</a>
<a id='line_2727'>31:18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he</a>
<a id='line_2728'>had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in</a>
<a id='line_2729'>Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.</a>
<a id='line_2730'></a>
<a id='line_2731'>31:19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the</a>
<a id='line_2732'>images that were her father’s.</a>
<a id='line_2733'></a>
<a id='line_2734'>31:20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he</a>
<a id='line_2735'>told him not that he fled.</a>
<a id='line_2736'></a>
<a id='line_2737'>31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over</a>
<a id='line_2738'>the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.</a>
<a id='line_2739'></a>
<a id='line_2740'>31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.</a>
<a id='line_2741'></a>
<a id='line_2742'>31:23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven</a>
<a id='line_2743'>days’ journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.</a>
<a id='line_2744'></a>
<a id='line_2745'>31:24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said</a>
<a id='line_2746'>unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</a>
<a id='line_2747'></a>
<a id='line_2748'>31:25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the</a>
<a id='line_2749'>mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.</a>
<a id='line_2750'></a>
<a id='line_2751'>31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast</a>
<a id='line_2752'>stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives</a>
<a id='line_2753'>taken with the sword?  31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly,</a>
<a id='line_2754'>and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent</a>
<a id='line_2755'>thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?</a>
<a id='line_2756'>31:28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou</a>
<a id='line_2757'>hast now done foolishly in so doing.</a>
<a id='line_2758'></a>
<a id='line_2759'>31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of</a>
<a id='line_2760'>your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that</a>
<a id='line_2761'>thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</a>
<a id='line_2762'></a>
<a id='line_2763'>31:30 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore</a>
<a id='line_2764'>longedst after thy father’s house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my</a>
<a id='line_2765'>gods?  31:31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was</a>
<a id='line_2766'>afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy</a>
<a id='line_2767'>daughters from me.</a>
<a id='line_2768'></a>
<a id='line_2769'>31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before</a>
<a id='line_2770'>our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee.</a>
<a id='line_2771'>For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.</a>
<a id='line_2772'></a>
<a id='line_2773'>31:33 And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into</a>
<a id='line_2774'>the two maidservants’ tents; but he found them not. Then went he out</a>
<a id='line_2775'>of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.</a>
<a id='line_2776'></a>
<a id='line_2777'>31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s</a>
<a id='line_2778'>furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but</a>
<a id='line_2779'>found them not.</a>
<a id='line_2780'></a>
<a id='line_2781'>31:35 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I</a>
<a id='line_2782'>cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he</a>
<a id='line_2783'>searched but found not the images.</a>
<a id='line_2784'></a>
<a id='line_2785'>31:36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered</a>
<a id='line_2786'>and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast</a>
<a id='line_2787'>so hotly pursued after me?  31:37 Whereas thou hast searched all my</a>
<a id='line_2788'>stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here</a>
<a id='line_2789'>before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us</a>
<a id='line_2790'>both.</a>
<a id='line_2791'></a>
<a id='line_2792'>31:38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she</a>
<a id='line_2793'>goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not</a>
<a id='line_2794'>eaten.</a>
<a id='line_2795'></a>
<a id='line_2796'>31:39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare</a>
<a id='line_2797'>the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by</a>
<a id='line_2798'>day, or stolen by night.</a>
<a id='line_2799'></a>
<a id='line_2800'>31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by</a>
<a id='line_2801'>night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.</a>
<a id='line_2802'></a>
<a id='line_2803'>31:41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee</a>
<a id='line_2804'>fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle:</a>
<a id='line_2805'>and thou hast changed my wages ten times.</a>
<a id='line_2806'></a>
<a id='line_2807'>31:42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of</a>
<a id='line_2808'>Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God</a>
<a id='line_2809'>hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee</a>
<a id='line_2810'>yesternight.</a>
<a id='line_2811'></a>
<a id='line_2812'>31:43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my</a>
<a id='line_2813'>daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my</a>
<a id='line_2814'>cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day</a>
<a id='line_2815'>unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?</a>
<a id='line_2816'>31:44 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and</a>
<a id='line_2817'>let it be for a witness between me and thee.</a>
<a id='line_2818'></a>
<a id='line_2819'>31:45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.</a>
<a id='line_2820'></a>
<a id='line_2821'>31:46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took</a>
<a id='line_2822'>stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.</a>
<a id='line_2823'></a>
<a id='line_2824'>31:47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.</a>
<a id='line_2825'></a>
<a id='line_2826'>31:48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this</a>
<a id='line_2827'>day.</a>
<a id='line_2828'></a>
<a id='line_2829'>Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; 31:49 And Mizpah; for he</a>
<a id='line_2830'>said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from</a>
<a id='line_2831'>another.</a>
<a id='line_2832'></a>
<a id='line_2833'>31:50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other</a>
<a id='line_2834'>wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness</a>
<a id='line_2835'>betwixt me and thee.</a>
<a id='line_2836'></a>
<a id='line_2837'>31:51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this</a>
<a id='line_2838'>pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee: 31:52 This heap be</a>
<a id='line_2839'>witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this</a>
<a id='line_2840'>heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this</a>
<a id='line_2841'>pillar unto me, for harm.</a>
<a id='line_2842'></a>
<a id='line_2843'>31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their</a>
<a id='line_2844'>father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father</a>
<a id='line_2845'>Isaac.</a>
<a id='line_2846'></a>
<a id='line_2847'>31:54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his</a>
<a id='line_2848'>brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night</a>
<a id='line_2849'>in the mount.</a>
<a id='line_2850'></a>
<a id='line_2851'>31:55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and</a>
<a id='line_2852'>his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto</a>
<a id='line_2853'>his place.</a>
<a id='line_2854'></a>
<a id='line_2855'>32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</a>
<a id='line_2856'></a>
<a id='line_2857'>32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God’s host: and he</a>
<a id='line_2858'>called the name of that place Mahanaim.</a>
<a id='line_2859'></a>
<a id='line_2860'>32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the</a>
<a id='line_2861'>land of Seir, the country of Edom.</a>
<a id='line_2862'></a>
<a id='line_2863'>32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord</a>
<a id='line_2864'>Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and</a>
<a id='line_2865'>stayed there until now: 32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and</a>
<a id='line_2866'>menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that</a>
<a id='line_2867'>I may find grace in thy sight.</a>
<a id='line_2868'></a>
<a id='line_2869'>32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy</a>
<a id='line_2870'>brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men</a>
<a id='line_2871'>with him.</a>
<a id='line_2872'></a>
<a id='line_2873'>32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the</a>
<a id='line_2874'>people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels,</a>
<a id='line_2875'>into two bands; 32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and</a>
<a id='line_2876'>smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.</a>
<a id='line_2877'></a>
<a id='line_2878'>32:9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father</a>
<a id='line_2879'>Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to</a>
<a id='line_2880'>thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: 32:10 I am not worthy of</a>
<a id='line_2881'>the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast</a>
<a id='line_2882'>shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan;</a>
<a id='line_2883'>and now I am become two bands.</a>
<a id='line_2884'></a>
<a id='line_2885'>32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the</a>
<a id='line_2886'>hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the</a>
<a id='line_2887'>mother with the children.</a>
<a id='line_2888'></a>
<a id='line_2889'>32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed</a>
<a id='line_2890'>as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</a>
<a id='line_2891'></a>
<a id='line_2892'>32:13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came</a>
<a id='line_2893'>to his hand a present for Esau his brother; 32:14 Two hundred she</a>
<a id='line_2894'>goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 32:15</a>
<a id='line_2895'>Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls,</a>
<a id='line_2896'>twenty she asses, and ten foals.</a>
<a id='line_2897'></a>
<a id='line_2898'>32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove</a>
<a id='line_2899'>by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and</a>
<a id='line_2900'>put a space betwixt drove and drove.</a>
<a id='line_2901'></a>
<a id='line_2902'>32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother</a>
<a id='line_2903'>meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither</a>
<a id='line_2904'>goest thou? and whose are these before thee?  32:18 Then thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_2905'>say, They be thy servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my lord</a>
<a id='line_2906'>Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.</a>
<a id='line_2907'></a>
<a id='line_2908'>32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that</a>
<a id='line_2909'>followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau,</a>
<a id='line_2910'>when ye find him.</a>
<a id='line_2911'></a>
<a id='line_2912'>32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For</a>
<a id='line_2913'>he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and</a>
<a id='line_2914'>afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.</a>
<a id='line_2915'></a>
<a id='line_2916'>32:21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that</a>
<a id='line_2917'>night in the company.</a>
<a id='line_2918'></a>
<a id='line_2919'>32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two</a>
<a id='line_2920'>womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.</a>
<a id='line_2921'></a>
<a id='line_2922'>32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over</a>
<a id='line_2923'>that he had.</a>
<a id='line_2924'></a>
<a id='line_2925'>32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him</a>
<a id='line_2926'>until the breaking of the day.</a>
<a id='line_2927'></a>
<a id='line_2928'>32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched</a>
<a id='line_2929'>the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of</a>
<a id='line_2930'>joint, as he wrestled with him.</a>
<a id='line_2931'></a>
<a id='line_2932'>32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I</a>
<a id='line_2933'>will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</a>
<a id='line_2934'></a>
<a id='line_2935'>32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.</a>
<a id='line_2936'></a>
<a id='line_2937'>32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel:</a>
<a id='line_2938'>for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast</a>
<a id='line_2939'>prevailed.</a>
<a id='line_2940'></a>
<a id='line_2941'>32:29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.</a>
<a id='line_2942'>And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he</a>
<a id='line_2943'>blessed him there.</a>
<a id='line_2944'></a>
<a id='line_2945'>32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen</a>
<a id='line_2946'>God face to face, and my life is preserved.</a>
<a id='line_2947'></a>
<a id='line_2948'>32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he</a>
<a id='line_2949'>halted upon his thigh.</a>
<a id='line_2950'></a>
<a id='line_2951'>32:32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which</a>
<a id='line_2952'>shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because</a>
<a id='line_2953'>he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew that shrank.</a>
<a id='line_2954'></a>
<a id='line_2955'>33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came,</a>
<a id='line_2956'>and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah,</a>
<a id='line_2957'>and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.</a>
<a id='line_2958'></a>
<a id='line_2959'>33:2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah</a>
<a id='line_2960'>and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.</a>
<a id='line_2961'></a>
<a id='line_2962'>33:3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground</a>
<a id='line_2963'>seven times, until he came near to his brother.</a>
<a id='line_2964'></a>
<a id='line_2965'>33:4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck,</a>
<a id='line_2966'>and kissed him: and they wept.</a>
<a id='line_2967'></a>
<a id='line_2968'>33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;</a>
<a id='line_2969'>and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God</a>
<a id='line_2970'>hath graciously given thy servant.</a>
<a id='line_2971'></a>
<a id='line_2972'>33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they</a>
<a id='line_2973'>bowed themselves.</a>
<a id='line_2974'></a>
<a id='line_2975'>33:7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves:</a>
<a id='line_2976'>and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.</a>
<a id='line_2977'></a>
<a id='line_2978'>33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And</a>
<a id='line_2979'>he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2980'></a>
<a id='line_2981'>33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast</a>
<a id='line_2982'>unto thyself.</a>
<a id='line_2983'></a>
<a id='line_2984'>33:10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in</a>
<a id='line_2985'>thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have</a>
<a id='line_2986'>seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast</a>
<a id='line_2987'>pleased with me.</a>
<a id='line_2988'></a>
<a id='line_2989'>33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because</a>
<a id='line_2990'>God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he</a>
<a id='line_2991'>urged him, and he took it.</a>
<a id='line_2992'></a>
<a id='line_2993'>33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will</a>
<a id='line_2994'>go before thee.</a>
<a id='line_2995'></a>
<a id='line_2996'>33:13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are</a>
<a id='line_2997'>tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men</a>
<a id='line_2998'>should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.</a>
<a id='line_2999'></a>
<a id='line_3000'>33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I</a>
<a id='line_3001'>will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and</a>
<a id='line_3002'>the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.</a>
<a id='line_3003'></a>
<a id='line_3004'>33:15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that</a>
<a id='line_3005'>are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the</a>
<a id='line_3006'>sight of my lord.</a>
<a id='line_3007'></a>
<a id='line_3008'>33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.</a>
<a id='line_3009'></a>
<a id='line_3010'>33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made</a>
<a id='line_3011'>booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called</a>
<a id='line_3012'>Succoth.</a>
<a id='line_3013'></a>
<a id='line_3014'>33:18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the</a>
<a id='line_3015'>land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent</a>
<a id='line_3016'>before the city.</a>
<a id='line_3017'></a>
<a id='line_3018'>33:19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent,</a>
<a id='line_3019'>at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for an hundred</a>
<a id='line_3020'>pieces of money.</a>
<a id='line_3021'></a>
<a id='line_3022'>33:20 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.</a>
<a id='line_3023'></a>
<a id='line_3024'>34:1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went</a>
<a id='line_3025'>out to see the daughters of the land.</a>
<a id='line_3026'></a>
<a id='line_3027'>34:2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the</a>
<a id='line_3028'>country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.</a>
<a id='line_3029'></a>
<a id='line_3030'>34:3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved</a>
<a id='line_3031'>the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.</a>
<a id='line_3032'></a>
<a id='line_3033'>34:4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this</a>
<a id='line_3034'>damsel to wife.</a>
<a id='line_3035'></a>
<a id='line_3036'>34:5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his</a>
<a id='line_3037'>sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until</a>
<a id='line_3038'>they were come.</a>
<a id='line_3039'></a>
<a id='line_3040'>34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune</a>
<a id='line_3041'>with him.</a>
<a id='line_3042'></a>
<a id='line_3043'>34:7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it:</a>
<a id='line_3044'>and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had</a>
<a id='line_3045'>wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter: which thing</a>
<a id='line_3046'>ought not to be done.</a>
<a id='line_3047'></a>
<a id='line_3048'>34:8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem</a>
<a id='line_3049'>longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.</a>
<a id='line_3050'></a>
<a id='line_3051'>34:9 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us,</a>
<a id='line_3052'>and take our daughters unto you.</a>
<a id='line_3053'></a>
<a id='line_3054'>34:10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;</a>
<a id='line_3055'>dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.</a>
<a id='line_3056'></a>
<a id='line_3057'>34:11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me</a>
<a id='line_3058'>find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.</a>
<a id='line_3059'></a>
<a id='line_3060'>34:12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according</a>
<a id='line_3061'>as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.</a>
<a id='line_3062'></a>
<a id='line_3063'>34:13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father</a>
<a id='line_3064'>deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:</a>
<a id='line_3065'>34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our</a>
<a id='line_3066'>sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:</a>
<a id='line_3067'>34:15 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,</a>
<a id='line_3068'>that every male of you be circumcised; 34:16 Then will we give our</a>
<a id='line_3069'>daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will</a>
<a id='line_3070'>dwell with you, and we will become one people.</a>
<a id='line_3071'></a>
<a id='line_3072'>34:17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will</a>
<a id='line_3073'>we take our daughter, and we will be gone.</a>
<a id='line_3074'></a>
<a id='line_3075'>34:18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s son.</a>
<a id='line_3076'></a>
<a id='line_3077'>34:19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had</a>
<a id='line_3078'>delight in Jacob’s daughter: and he was more honourable than all the</a>
<a id='line_3079'>house of his father.</a>
<a id='line_3080'></a>
<a id='line_3081'>34:20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city,</a>
<a id='line_3082'>and communed with the men of their city, saying, 34:21 These men are</a>
<a id='line_3083'>peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade</a>
<a id='line_3084'>therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us</a>
<a id='line_3085'>take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our</a>
<a id='line_3086'>daughters.</a>
<a id='line_3087'></a>
<a id='line_3088'>34:22 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,</a>
<a id='line_3089'>to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are</a>
<a id='line_3090'>circumcised.</a>
<a id='line_3091'></a>
<a id='line_3092'>34:23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of</a>
<a id='line_3093'>theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell</a>
<a id='line_3094'>with us.</a>
<a id='line_3095'></a>
<a id='line_3096'>34:24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went</a>
<a id='line_3097'>out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that</a>
<a id='line_3098'>went out of the gate of his city.</a>
<a id='line_3099'></a>
<a id='line_3100'>34:25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that</a>
<a id='line_3101'>two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each</a>
<a id='line_3102'>man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.</a>
<a id='line_3103'></a>
<a id='line_3104'>34:26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the</a>
<a id='line_3105'>sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went out.</a>
<a id='line_3106'></a>
<a id='line_3107'>34:27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,</a>
<a id='line_3108'>because they had defiled their sister.</a>
<a id='line_3109'></a>
<a id='line_3110'>34:28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that</a>
<a id='line_3111'>which was in the city, and that which was in the field, 34:29 And all</a>
<a id='line_3112'>their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they</a>
<a id='line_3113'>captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.</a>
<a id='line_3114'></a>
<a id='line_3115'>34:30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make</a>
<a id='line_3116'>me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites</a>
<a id='line_3117'>and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather</a>
<a id='line_3118'>themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed,</a>
<a id='line_3119'>I and my house.</a>
<a id='line_3120'></a>
<a id='line_3121'>34:31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?</a>
<a id='line_3122'>35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there:</a>
<a id='line_3123'>and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou</a>
<a id='line_3124'>fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.</a>
<a id='line_3125'></a>
<a id='line_3126'>35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with</a>
<a id='line_3127'>him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and</a>
<a id='line_3128'>change your garments: 35:3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and</a>
<a id='line_3129'>I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my</a>
<a id='line_3130'>distress, and was with me in the way which I went.</a>
<a id='line_3131'></a>
<a id='line_3132'>35:4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their</a>
<a id='line_3133'>hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid</a>
<a id='line_3134'>them under the oak which was by Shechem.</a>
<a id='line_3135'></a>
<a id='line_3136'>35:5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities</a>
<a id='line_3137'>that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of</a>
<a id='line_3138'>Jacob.</a>
<a id='line_3139'></a>
<a id='line_3140'>35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,</a>
<a id='line_3141'>Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.</a>
<a id='line_3142'></a>
<a id='line_3143'>35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:</a>
<a id='line_3144'>because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his</a>
<a id='line_3145'>brother.</a>
<a id='line_3146'></a>
<a id='line_3147'>35:8 But Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath</a>
<a id='line_3148'>Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.</a>
<a id='line_3149'></a>
<a id='line_3150'>35:9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram,</a>
<a id='line_3151'>and blessed him.</a>
<a id='line_3152'></a>
<a id='line_3153'>35:10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be</a>
<a id='line_3154'>called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his</a>
<a id='line_3155'>name Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3156'></a>
<a id='line_3157'>35:11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and</a>
<a id='line_3158'>multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and</a>
<a id='line_3159'>kings shall come out of thy loins; 35:12 And the land which I gave</a>
<a id='line_3160'>Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee</a>
<a id='line_3161'>will I give the land.</a>
<a id='line_3162'></a>
<a id='line_3163'>35:13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.</a>
<a id='line_3164'></a>
<a id='line_3165'>35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,</a>
<a id='line_3166'>even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he</a>
<a id='line_3167'>poured oil thereon.</a>
<a id='line_3168'></a>
<a id='line_3169'>35:15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him,</a>
<a id='line_3170'>Bethel.</a>
<a id='line_3171'></a>
<a id='line_3172'>35:16 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way</a>
<a id='line_3173'>to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.</a>
<a id='line_3174'></a>
<a id='line_3175'>35:17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the</a>
<a id='line_3176'>midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.</a>
<a id='line_3177'></a>
<a id='line_3178'>35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she</a>
<a id='line_3179'>died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him</a>
<a id='line_3180'>Benjamin.</a>
<a id='line_3181'></a>
<a id='line_3182'>35:19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is</a>
<a id='line_3183'>Bethlehem.</a>
<a id='line_3184'></a>
<a id='line_3185'>35:20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of</a>
<a id='line_3186'>Rachel’s grave unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_3187'></a>
<a id='line_3188'>35:21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of</a>
<a id='line_3189'>Edar.</a>
<a id='line_3190'></a>
<a id='line_3191'>35:22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben</a>
<a id='line_3192'>went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine: and Israel heard it.</a>
<a id='line_3193'>Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 35:23 The sons of Leah; Reuben,</a>
<a id='line_3194'>Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and</a>
<a id='line_3195'>Zebulun: 35:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 35:25 And the</a>
<a id='line_3196'>sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 35:26 And the</a>
<a id='line_3197'>sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of</a>
<a id='line_3198'>Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.</a>
<a id='line_3199'></a>
<a id='line_3200'>35:27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city</a>
<a id='line_3201'>of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.</a>
<a id='line_3202'></a>
<a id='line_3203'>35:28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.</a>
<a id='line_3204'></a>
<a id='line_3205'>35:29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his</a>
<a id='line_3206'>people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried</a>
<a id='line_3207'>him.</a>
<a id='line_3208'></a>
<a id='line_3209'>36:1 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.</a>
<a id='line_3210'></a>
<a id='line_3211'>36:2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter</a>
<a id='line_3212'>of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter</a>
<a id='line_3213'>of Zibeon the Hivite; 36:3 And Bashemath Ishmael’s daughter, sister of</a>
<a id='line_3214'>Nebajoth.</a>
<a id='line_3215'></a>
<a id='line_3216'>36:4 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel; 36:5 And</a>
<a id='line_3217'>Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of</a>
<a id='line_3218'>Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.</a>
<a id='line_3219'></a>
<a id='line_3220'>36:6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all</a>
<a id='line_3221'>the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all</a>
<a id='line_3222'>his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into</a>
<a id='line_3223'>the country from the face of his brother Jacob.</a>
<a id='line_3224'></a>
<a id='line_3225'>36:7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together;</a>
<a id='line_3226'>and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because</a>
<a id='line_3227'>of their cattle.</a>
<a id='line_3228'></a>
<a id='line_3229'>36:8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.</a>
<a id='line_3230'></a>
<a id='line_3231'>36:9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites</a>
<a id='line_3232'>in mount Seir: 36:10 These are the names of Esau’s sons; Eliphaz the</a>
<a id='line_3233'>son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of</a>
<a id='line_3234'>Esau.</a>
<a id='line_3235'></a>
<a id='line_3236'>36:11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and</a>
<a id='line_3237'>Kenaz.</a>
<a id='line_3238'></a>
<a id='line_3239'>36:12 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau’s son; and she bare to</a>
<a id='line_3240'>Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau’s wife.</a>
<a id='line_3241'></a>
<a id='line_3242'>36:13 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and</a>
<a id='line_3243'>Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau’s wife.</a>

<a id='line_3245'>36:14 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the</a>
<a id='line_3246'>daughter of Zibeon, Esau’s wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and</a>
<a id='line_3247'>Jaalam, and Korah.</a>
<a id='line_3248'></a>
<a id='line_3249'>36:15 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the</a>
<a id='line_3250'>firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,</a>

<a id='line_3258'></a>
<a id='line_3259'>36:18 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau’s wife; duke Jeush,</a>
<a id='line_3260'>duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah</a>
<a id='line_3261'>the daughter of Anah, Esau’s wife.</a>
<a id='line_3262'></a>
<a id='line_3263'>36:19 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their</a>
<a id='line_3264'>dukes.</a>

<a id='line_3296'>36:31 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before</a>
<a id='line_3297'>there reigned any king over the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3298'></a>
<a id='line_3299'>36:32 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his</a>

<a id='line_3330'>the Edomites.</a>
<a id='line_3331'></a>
<a id='line_3332'>37:1 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in</a>
<a id='line_3333'>the land of Canaan.</a>
<a id='line_3334'></a>
<a id='line_3335'>37:2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years</a>
<a id='line_3336'>old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the</a>
<a id='line_3337'>sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives: and</a>
<a id='line_3338'>Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.</a>
<a id='line_3339'></a>
<a id='line_3340'>37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he</a>

<a id='line_3343'>37:4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than</a>
<a id='line_3344'>all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto</a>
<a id='line_3345'>him.</a>
<a id='line_3346'></a>
<a id='line_3347'>37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they</a>
<a id='line_3348'>hated him yet the more.</a>
<a id='line_3349'></a>
<a id='line_3350'>37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have</a>
<a id='line_3351'>dreamed: 37:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and,</a>
<a id='line_3352'>lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves</a>
<a id='line_3353'>stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.</a>
<a id='line_3354'></a>
<a id='line_3355'>37:8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or</a>
<a id='line_3356'>shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the</a>
<a id='line_3357'>more for his dreams, and for his words.</a>
<a id='line_3358'></a>
<a id='line_3359'>37:9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and</a>
<a id='line_3360'>said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and</a>
<a id='line_3361'>the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.</a>
<a id='line_3362'></a>
<a id='line_3363'>37:10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his</a>
<a id='line_3364'>father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou</a>
<a id='line_3365'>hast dreamed?  Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to</a>
<a id='line_3366'>bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?  37:11 And his brethren</a>
<a id='line_3367'>envied him; but his father observed the saying.</a>
<a id='line_3368'></a>
<a id='line_3369'>37:12 And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.</a>
<a id='line_3370'></a>
<a id='line_3371'>37:13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock</a>
<a id='line_3372'>in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him,</a>
<a id='line_3373'>Here am I.</a>
<a id='line_3374'></a>
<a id='line_3375'>37:14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with</a>
<a id='line_3376'>thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he</a>
<a id='line_3377'>sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</a>
<a id='line_3378'></a>
<a id='line_3379'>37:15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in</a>
<a id='line_3380'>the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?  37:16</a>
<a id='line_3381'>And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed</a>
<a id='line_3382'>their flocks.</a>
<a id='line_3383'></a>
<a id='line_3384'>37:17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say,</a>
<a id='line_3385'>Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found</a>
<a id='line_3386'>them in Dothan.</a>
<a id='line_3387'></a>
<a id='line_3388'>37:18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto</a>
<a id='line_3389'>them, they conspired against him to slay him.</a>
<a id='line_3390'></a>
<a id='line_3391'>37:19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.</a>
<a id='line_3392'></a>
<a id='line_3393'>37:20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some</a>
<a id='line_3394'>pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall</a>
<a id='line_3395'>see what will become of his dreams.</a>
<a id='line_3396'></a>
<a id='line_3397'>37:21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;</a>
<a id='line_3398'>and said, Let us not kill him.</a>
<a id='line_3399'></a>
<a id='line_3400'>37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this</a>
<a id='line_3401'>pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might</a>
<a id='line_3402'>rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.</a>
<a id='line_3403'></a>
<a id='line_3404'>37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,</a>
<a id='line_3405'>that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that</a>
<a id='line_3406'>was on him; 37:24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the</a>
<a id='line_3407'>pit was empty, there was no water in it.</a>
<a id='line_3408'></a>
<a id='line_3409'>37:25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes</a>
<a id='line_3410'>and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead</a>
<a id='line_3411'>with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry</a>
<a id='line_3412'>it down to Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_3413'></a>
<a id='line_3414'>37:26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay</a>
<a id='line_3415'>our brother, and conceal his blood?  37:27 Come, and let us sell him</a>
<a id='line_3416'>to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our</a>
<a id='line_3417'>brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.</a>
<a id='line_3418'></a>
<a id='line_3419'>37:28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and</a>
<a id='line_3420'>lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites</a>
<a id='line_3421'>for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_3422'></a>
<a id='line_3423'>37:29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in</a>
<a id='line_3424'>the pit; and he rent his clothes.</a>
<a id='line_3425'></a>
<a id='line_3426'>37:30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;</a>
<a id='line_3427'>and I, whither shall I go?  37:31 And they took Joseph’s coat, and</a>
<a id='line_3428'>killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 37:32 And</a>
<a id='line_3429'>they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their</a>
<a id='line_3430'>father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son’s</a>
<a id='line_3431'>coat or no.</a>
<a id='line_3432'></a>
<a id='line_3433'>37:33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son’s coat; an evil beast</a>
<a id='line_3434'>hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.</a>
<a id='line_3435'></a>
<a id='line_3436'>37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,</a>
<a id='line_3437'>and mourned for his son many days.</a>
<a id='line_3438'></a>
<a id='line_3439'>37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;</a>
<a id='line_3440'>but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into</a>
<a id='line_3441'>the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.</a>
<a id='line_3442'></a>
<a id='line_3443'>37:36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer</a>
<a id='line_3444'>of Pharaoh’s, and captain of the guard.</a>
<a id='line_3445'></a>
<a id='line_3446'>38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his</a>
<a id='line_3447'>brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.</a>
<a id='line_3448'></a>
<a id='line_3449'>38:2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name</a>
<a id='line_3450'>was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.</a>
<a id='line_3451'></a>
<a id='line_3452'>38:3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.</a>
<a id='line_3453'></a>
<a id='line_3454'>38:4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name</a>
<a id='line_3455'>Onan.</a>
<a id='line_3456'></a>
<a id='line_3457'>38:5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name</a>
<a id='line_3458'>Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.</a>
<a id='line_3459'></a>
<a id='line_3460'>38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.</a>
<a id='line_3461'></a>
<a id='line_3462'>38:7 And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD;</a>
<a id='line_3463'>and the LORD slew him.</a>
<a id='line_3464'></a>
<a id='line_3465'>38:8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and</a>
<a id='line_3466'>marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.</a>
<a id='line_3467'></a>
<a id='line_3468'>38:9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to</a>
<a id='line_3469'>pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on</a>
<a id='line_3470'>the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.</a>
<a id='line_3471'></a>
<a id='line_3472'>38:10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he</a>
<a id='line_3473'>slew him also.</a>
<a id='line_3474'></a>
<a id='line_3475'>38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at</a>
<a id='line_3476'>thy father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest</a>
<a id='line_3477'>peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and</a>
<a id='line_3478'>dwelt in her father’s house.</a>
<a id='line_3479'></a>
<a id='line_3480'>38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife died;</a>
<a id='line_3481'>and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to</a>
<a id='line_3482'>Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.</a>
<a id='line_3483'></a>
<a id='line_3484'>38:13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up</a>
<a id='line_3485'>to Timnath to shear his sheep.</a>
<a id='line_3486'></a>
<a id='line_3487'>38:14 And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her</a>
<a id='line_3488'>with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is</a>
<a id='line_3489'>by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was</a>
<a id='line_3490'>not given unto him to wife.</a>
<a id='line_3491'></a>
<a id='line_3492'>38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she</a>
<a id='line_3493'>had covered her face.</a>
<a id='line_3494'></a>
<a id='line_3495'>38:16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee,</a>
<a id='line_3496'>let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter</a>
<a id='line_3497'>in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come</a>
<a id='line_3498'>in unto me?  38:17 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock.</a>
<a id='line_3499'>And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?  38:18</a>
<a id='line_3500'>And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet,</a>
<a id='line_3501'>and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it</a>
<a id='line_3502'>her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.</a>
<a id='line_3503'></a>
<a id='line_3504'>38:19 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and</a>
<a id='line_3505'>put on the garments of her widowhood.</a>
<a id='line_3506'></a>
<a id='line_3507'>38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,</a>
<a id='line_3508'>to receive his pledge from the woman’s hand: but he found her not.</a>
<a id='line_3509'></a>
<a id='line_3510'>38:21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the</a>
<a id='line_3511'>harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no</a>
<a id='line_3512'>harlot in this place.</a>
<a id='line_3513'></a>
<a id='line_3514'>38:22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also</a>
<a id='line_3515'>the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.</a>
<a id='line_3516'></a>
<a id='line_3517'>38:23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:</a>
<a id='line_3518'>behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.</a>
<a id='line_3519'></a>
<a id='line_3520'>38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told</a>
<a id='line_3521'>Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and</a>
<a id='line_3522'>also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her</a>
<a id='line_3523'>forth, and let her be burnt.</a>
<a id='line_3524'></a>
<a id='line_3525'>38:25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,</a>
<a id='line_3526'>saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said,</a>
<a id='line_3527'>Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and</a>
<a id='line_3528'>staff.</a>
<a id='line_3529'></a>
<a id='line_3530'>38:26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more</a>
<a id='line_3531'>righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he</a>
<a id='line_3532'>knew her again no more.</a>
<a id='line_3533'></a>
<a id='line_3534'>38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,</a>
<a id='line_3535'>twins were in her womb.</a>
<a id='line_3536'></a>
<a id='line_3537'>38:28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out</a>
<a id='line_3538'>his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet</a>
<a id='line_3539'>thread, saying, This came out first.</a>
<a id='line_3540'></a>
<a id='line_3541'>38:29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his</a>
<a id='line_3542'>brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this</a>
<a id='line_3543'>breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.</a>
<a id='line_3544'></a>
<a id='line_3545'>38:30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread</a>
<a id='line_3546'>upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.</a>
<a id='line_3547'></a>
<a id='line_3548'>39:1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of</a>
<a id='line_3549'>Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of</a>
<a id='line_3550'>the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.</a>
<a id='line_3551'></a>
<a id='line_3552'>39:2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he</a>
<a id='line_3553'>was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</a>
<a id='line_3554'></a>
<a id='line_3555'>39:3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3556'>made all that he did to prosper in his hand.</a>
<a id='line_3557'></a>
<a id='line_3558'>39:4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he</a>
<a id='line_3559'>made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his</a>
<a id='line_3560'>hand.</a>
<a id='line_3561'></a>
<a id='line_3562'>39:5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer</a>
<a id='line_3563'>in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the</a>
<a id='line_3564'>Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was</a>
<a id='line_3565'>upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.</a>
<a id='line_3566'></a>
<a id='line_3567'>39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not</a>
<a id='line_3568'>ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly</a>
<a id='line_3569'>person, and well favoured.</a>
<a id='line_3570'></a>
<a id='line_3571'>39:7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife</a>
<a id='line_3572'>cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.</a>
<a id='line_3573'></a>
<a id='line_3574'>39:8 But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my</a>
<a id='line_3575'>master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed</a>
<a id='line_3576'>all that he hath to my hand; 39:9 There is none greater in this house</a>
<a id='line_3577'>than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because</a>
<a id='line_3578'>thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin</a>
<a id='line_3579'>against God?  39:10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by</a>
<a id='line_3580'>day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.</a>
<a id='line_3581'></a>
<a id='line_3582'>39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the</a>
<a id='line_3583'>house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house</a>
<a id='line_3584'>there within.</a>
<a id='line_3585'></a>
<a id='line_3586'>39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he</a>
<a id='line_3587'>left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.</a>
<a id='line_3588'></a>
<a id='line_3589'>39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment</a>
<a id='line_3590'>in her hand, and was fled forth, 39:14 That she called unto the men of</a>
<a id='line_3591'>her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an</a>
<a id='line_3592'>Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I</a>
<a id='line_3593'>cried with a loud voice: 39:15 And it came to pass, when he heard that</a>
<a id='line_3594'>I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and</a>
<a id='line_3595'>fled, and got him out.</a>
<a id='line_3596'></a>
<a id='line_3597'>39:16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.</a>
<a id='line_3598'></a>
<a id='line_3599'>39:17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The</a>
<a id='line_3600'>Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to</a>
<a id='line_3601'>mock me: 39:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried,</a>
<a id='line_3602'>that he left his garment with me, and fled out.</a>
<a id='line_3603'></a>
<a id='line_3604'>39:19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his</a>
<a id='line_3605'>wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy</a>
<a id='line_3606'>servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.</a>
<a id='line_3607'></a>
<a id='line_3608'>39:20 And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, a</a>
<a id='line_3609'>place where the king’s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the</a>
<a id='line_3610'>prison.</a>
<a id='line_3611'></a>
<a id='line_3612'>39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him</a>
<a id='line_3613'>favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.</a>
<a id='line_3614'></a>
<a id='line_3615'>39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the</a>
<a id='line_3616'>prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he</a>
<a id='line_3617'>was the doer of it.</a>
<a id='line_3618'></a>
<a id='line_3619'>39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under</a>
<a id='line_3620'>his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the</a>
<a id='line_3621'>LORD made it to prosper.</a>
<a id='line_3622'></a>
<a id='line_3623'>40:1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the</a>
<a id='line_3624'>king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_3625'></a>
<a id='line_3626'>40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the</a>
<a id='line_3627'>chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.</a>
<a id='line_3628'></a>
<a id='line_3629'>40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard,</a>
<a id='line_3630'>into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.</a>
<a id='line_3631'></a>
<a id='line_3632'>40:4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he</a>
<a id='line_3633'>served them: and they continued a season in ward.</a>
<a id='line_3634'></a>
<a id='line_3635'>40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one</a>
<a id='line_3636'>night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the</a>
<a id='line_3637'>butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the</a>
<a id='line_3638'>prison.</a>
<a id='line_3639'></a>
<a id='line_3640'>40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon</a>
<a id='line_3641'>them, and, behold, they were sad.</a>
<a id='line_3642'></a>
<a id='line_3643'>40:7 And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that were with him in the ward of</a>
<a id='line_3644'>his lord’s house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?  40:8 And</a>
<a id='line_3645'>they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no</a>
<a id='line_3646'>interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations</a>
<a id='line_3647'>belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.</a>
<a id='line_3648'></a>
<a id='line_3649'>40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,</a>
<a id='line_3650'>In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 40:10 And in the vine were</a>
<a id='line_3651'>three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot</a>
<a id='line_3652'>forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 40:11 And</a>
<a id='line_3653'>Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them</a>
<a id='line_3654'>into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.</a>
<a id='line_3655'></a>
<a id='line_3656'>40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The</a>
<a id='line_3657'>three branches are three days: 40:13 Yet within three days shall</a>
<a id='line_3658'>Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou</a>
<a id='line_3659'>shalt deliver Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner</a>
<a id='line_3660'>when thou wast his butler.</a>
<a id='line_3661'></a>
<a id='line_3662'>40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew</a>
<a id='line_3663'>kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,</a>
<a id='line_3664'>and bring me out of this house: 40:15 For indeed I was stolen away out</a>
<a id='line_3665'>of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that</a>
<a id='line_3666'>they should put me into the dungeon.</a>
<a id='line_3667'></a>
<a id='line_3668'>40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he</a>
<a id='line_3669'>said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three</a>
<a id='line_3670'>white baskets on my head: 40:17 And in the uppermost basket there was</a>
<a id='line_3671'>of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out</a>
<a id='line_3672'>of the basket upon my head.</a>
<a id='line_3673'></a>
<a id='line_3674'>40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation</a>
<a id='line_3675'>thereof: The three baskets are three days: 40:19 Yet within three days</a>
<a id='line_3676'>shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a</a>
<a id='line_3677'>tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.</a>
<a id='line_3678'></a>
<a id='line_3679'>40:20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday,</a>
<a id='line_3680'>that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head</a>
<a id='line_3681'>of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.</a>
<a id='line_3682'></a>
<a id='line_3683'>40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and</a>
<a id='line_3684'>he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand: 40:22 But he hanged the chief</a>
<a id='line_3685'>baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.</a>
<a id='line_3686'></a>
<a id='line_3687'>40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.</a>
<a id='line_3688'></a>
<a id='line_3689'>41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh</a>
<a id='line_3690'>dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.</a>
<a id='line_3691'></a>
<a id='line_3692'>41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured</a>
<a id='line_3693'>kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.</a>
<a id='line_3694'></a>
<a id='line_3695'>41:3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the</a>
<a id='line_3696'>river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon</a>
<a id='line_3697'>the brink of the river.</a>
<a id='line_3698'></a>
<a id='line_3699'>41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven</a>
<a id='line_3700'>well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.</a>
<a id='line_3701'></a>
<a id='line_3702'>41:5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears</a>
<a id='line_3703'>of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.</a>
<a id='line_3704'></a>
<a id='line_3705'>41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind</a>
<a id='line_3706'>sprung up after them.</a>
<a id='line_3707'></a>
<a id='line_3708'>41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.</a>
<a id='line_3709'>And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.</a>
<a id='line_3710'></a>
<a id='line_3711'>41:8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled;</a>
<a id='line_3712'>and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the</a>
<a id='line_3713'>wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none</a>
<a id='line_3714'>that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.</a>
<a id='line_3715'></a>
<a id='line_3716'>41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember</a>
<a id='line_3717'>my faults this day: 41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put</a>
<a id='line_3718'>me in ward in the captain of the guard’s house, both me and the chief</a>
<a id='line_3719'>baker: 41:11 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed</a>
<a id='line_3720'>each man according to the interpretation of his dream.</a>
<a id='line_3721'></a>
<a id='line_3722'>41:12 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to</a>
<a id='line_3723'>the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us</a>
<a id='line_3724'>our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.</a>
<a id='line_3725'></a>
<a id='line_3726'>41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he</a>
<a id='line_3727'>restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.</a>
<a id='line_3728'></a>
<a id='line_3729'>41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him</a>
<a id='line_3730'>hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his</a>
<a id='line_3731'>raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.</a>
<a id='line_3732'></a>
<a id='line_3733'>41:15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there</a>
<a id='line_3734'>is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou</a>
<a id='line_3735'>canst understand a dream to interpret it.</a>
<a id='line_3736'></a>
<a id='line_3737'>41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall</a>
<a id='line_3738'>give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</a>
<a id='line_3739'></a>
<a id='line_3740'>41:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon</a>
<a id='line_3741'>the bank of the river: 41:18 And, behold, there came up out of the</a>
<a id='line_3742'>river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a</a>
<a id='line_3743'>meadow: 41:19 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor</a>
<a id='line_3744'>and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the</a>
<a id='line_3745'>land of Egypt for badness: 41:20 And the lean and the ill favoured</a>
<a id='line_3746'>kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 41:21 And when they had</a>
<a id='line_3747'>eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but</a>
<a id='line_3748'>they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.</a>
<a id='line_3749'></a>
<a id='line_3750'>41:22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one</a>
<a id='line_3751'>stalk, full and good: 41:23 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin,</a>
<a id='line_3752'>and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: 41:24 And the</a>
<a id='line_3753'>thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the</a>
<a id='line_3754'>magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.</a>
<a id='line_3755'></a>
<a id='line_3756'>41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God</a>
<a id='line_3757'>hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.</a>
<a id='line_3758'></a>
<a id='line_3759'>41:26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are</a>
<a id='line_3760'>seven years: the dream is one.</a>
<a id='line_3761'></a>
<a id='line_3762'>41:27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them</a>
<a id='line_3763'>are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind</a>
<a id='line_3764'>shall be seven years of famine.</a>
<a id='line_3765'></a>
<a id='line_3766'>41:28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is</a>
<a id='line_3767'>about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.</a>
<a id='line_3768'></a>
<a id='line_3769'>41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all</a>
<a id='line_3770'>the land of Egypt: 41:30 And there shall arise after them seven years</a>
<a id='line_3771'>of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt;</a>
<a id='line_3772'>and the famine shall consume the land; 41:31 And the plenty shall not</a>
<a id='line_3773'>be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall</a>
<a id='line_3774'>be very grievous.</a>
<a id='line_3775'></a>
<a id='line_3776'>41:32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is</a>
<a id='line_3777'>because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it</a>
<a id='line_3778'>to pass.</a>
<a id='line_3779'></a>
<a id='line_3780'>41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and</a>
<a id='line_3781'>set him over the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_3782'></a>
<a id='line_3783'>41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land,</a>
<a id='line_3784'>and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous</a>
<a id='line_3785'>years.</a>
<a id='line_3786'></a>
<a id='line_3787'>41:35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come,</a>
<a id='line_3788'>and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in</a>
<a id='line_3789'>the cities.</a>
<a id='line_3790'></a>
<a id='line_3791'>41:36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven</a>
<a id='line_3792'>years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land</a>
<a id='line_3793'>perish not through the famine.</a>
<a id='line_3794'></a>
<a id='line_3795'>41:37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes</a>
<a id='line_3796'>of all his servants.</a>
<a id='line_3797'></a>
<a id='line_3798'>41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as</a>
<a id='line_3799'>this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?  41:39 And Pharaoh said</a>
<a id='line_3800'>unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none</a>
<a id='line_3801'>so discreet and wise as thou art: 41:40 Thou shalt be over my house,</a>
<a id='line_3802'>and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the</a>
<a id='line_3803'>throne will I be greater than thou.</a>
<a id='line_3804'></a>
<a id='line_3805'>41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the</a>
<a id='line_3806'>land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_3807'></a>
<a id='line_3808'>41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon</a>
<a id='line_3809'>Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a</a>
<a id='line_3810'>gold chain about his neck; 41:43 And he made him to ride in the second</a>
<a id='line_3811'>chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he</a>
<a id='line_3812'>made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_3813'></a>
<a id='line_3814'>41:44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee</a>
<a id='line_3815'>shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_3816'></a>
<a id='line_3817'>41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave</a>
<a id='line_3818'>him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And</a>
<a id='line_3819'>Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_3820'></a>
<a id='line_3821'>41:46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh</a>
<a id='line_3822'>king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and</a>
<a id='line_3823'>went throughout all the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_3824'></a>
<a id='line_3825'>41:47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by</a>
<a id='line_3826'>handfuls.</a>
<a id='line_3827'></a>
<a id='line_3828'>41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were</a>
<a id='line_3829'>in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of</a>
<a id='line_3830'>the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.</a>
<a id='line_3831'></a>
<a id='line_3832'>41:49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,</a>
<a id='line_3833'>until he left numbering; for it was without number.</a>
<a id='line_3834'></a>
<a id='line_3835'>41:50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine</a>
<a id='line_3836'>came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto</a>
<a id='line_3837'>him.</a>
<a id='line_3838'></a>
<a id='line_3839'>41:51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,</a>
<a id='line_3840'>said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.</a>
<a id='line_3841'></a>
<a id='line_3842'>41:52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath</a>
<a id='line_3843'>caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.</a>
<a id='line_3844'></a>
<a id='line_3845'>41:53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of</a>
<a id='line_3846'>Egypt, were ended.</a>
<a id='line_3847'></a>
<a id='line_3848'>41:54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph</a>
<a id='line_3849'>had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of</a>
<a id='line_3850'>Egypt there was bread.</a>
<a id='line_3851'></a>
<a id='line_3852'>41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to</a>
<a id='line_3853'>Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto</a>
<a id='line_3854'>Joseph; what he saith to you, do.</a>
<a id='line_3855'></a>
<a id='line_3856'>41:56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph</a>
<a id='line_3857'>opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the</a>
<a id='line_3858'>famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_3859'></a>
<a id='line_3860'>41:57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;</a>
<a id='line_3861'>because that the famine was so sore in all lands.</a>
<a id='line_3862'></a>
<a id='line_3863'>42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto</a>
<a id='line_3864'>his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?  42:2 And he said, Behold,</a>
<a id='line_3865'>I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and</a>
<a id='line_3866'>buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.</a>
<a id='line_3867'></a>
<a id='line_3868'>42:3 And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_3869'></a>
<a id='line_3870'>42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren;</a>
<a id='line_3871'>for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.</a>
<a id='line_3872'></a>
<a id='line_3873'>42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:</a>
<a id='line_3874'>for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</a>
<a id='line_3875'></a>
<a id='line_3876'>42:6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that</a>
<a id='line_3877'>sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph’s brethren came, and</a>
<a id='line_3878'>bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_3879'></a>
<a id='line_3880'>42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself</a>
<a id='line_3881'>strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them,</a>
<a id='line_3882'>Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.</a>
<a id='line_3883'></a>
<a id='line_3884'>42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.</a>
<a id='line_3885'></a>
<a id='line_3886'>42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and</a>
<a id='line_3887'>said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are</a>
<a id='line_3888'>come.</a>
<a id='line_3889'></a>
<a id='line_3890'>42:10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy</a>
<a id='line_3891'>servants come.</a>
<a id='line_3892'></a>
<a id='line_3893'>42:11 We are all one man’s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no</a>
<a id='line_3894'>spies.</a>
<a id='line_3895'></a>
<a id='line_3896'>42:12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land</a>
<a id='line_3897'>ye are come.</a>
<a id='line_3898'></a>
<a id='line_3899'>42:13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one</a>
<a id='line_3900'>man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with</a>
<a id='line_3901'>our father, and one is not.</a>
<a id='line_3902'></a>
<a id='line_3903'>42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,</a>
<a id='line_3904'>saying, Ye are spies: 42:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of</a>
<a id='line_3905'>Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come</a>
<a id='line_3906'>hither.</a>
<a id='line_3907'></a>
<a id='line_3908'>42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be</a>
<a id='line_3909'>kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any</a>
<a id='line_3910'>truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.</a>
<a id='line_3911'></a>
<a id='line_3912'>42:17 And he put them all together into ward three days.</a>
<a id='line_3913'></a>
<a id='line_3914'>42:18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for</a>
<a id='line_3915'>I fear God: 42:19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound</a>
<a id='line_3916'>in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your</a>
<a id='line_3917'>houses: 42:20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your</a>
<a id='line_3918'>words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.</a>
<a id='line_3919'></a>
<a id='line_3920'>42:21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning</a>
<a id='line_3921'>our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought</a>
<a id='line_3922'>us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.</a>
<a id='line_3923'></a>
<a id='line_3924'>42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying,</a>
<a id='line_3925'>Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore,</a>
<a id='line_3926'>behold, also his blood is required.</a>
<a id='line_3927'></a>
<a id='line_3928'>42:23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto</a>
<a id='line_3929'>them by an interpreter.</a>
<a id='line_3930'></a>
<a id='line_3931'>42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to</a>
<a id='line_3932'>them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and</a>
<a id='line_3933'>bound him before their eyes.</a>
<a id='line_3934'></a>
<a id='line_3935'>42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to</a>
<a id='line_3936'>restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision</a>
<a id='line_3937'>for the way: and thus did he unto them.</a>
<a id='line_3938'></a>
<a id='line_3939'>42:26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.</a>
<a id='line_3940'></a>
<a id='line_3941'>42:27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in</a>
<a id='line_3942'>the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack’s mouth.</a>
<a id='line_3943'></a>
<a id='line_3944'>42:28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it</a>
<a id='line_3945'>is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid,</a>
<a id='line_3946'>saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?  42:29</a>
<a id='line_3947'>And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and</a>
<a id='line_3948'>told him all that befell unto them; saying, 42:30 The man, who is the</a>
<a id='line_3949'>lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the</a>
<a id='line_3950'>country.</a>
<a id='line_3951'></a>
<a id='line_3952'>42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 42:32 We</a>
<a id='line_3953'>be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest</a>
<a id='line_3954'>is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.</a>
<a id='line_3955'></a>
<a id='line_3956'>42:33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall</a>
<a id='line_3957'>I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me,</a>
<a id='line_3958'>and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone: 42:34</a>
<a id='line_3959'>And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are</a>
<a id='line_3960'>no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your</a>
<a id='line_3961'>brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.</a>
<a id='line_3962'></a>
<a id='line_3963'>42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,</a>
<a id='line_3964'>every man’s bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and</a>
<a id='line_3965'>their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.</a>
<a id='line_3966'></a>
<a id='line_3967'>42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my</a>
<a id='line_3968'>children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin</a>
<a id='line_3969'>away: all these things are against me.</a>
<a id='line_3970'></a>
<a id='line_3971'>42:37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I</a>
<a id='line_3972'>bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him</a>
<a id='line_3973'>to thee again.</a>
<a id='line_3974'></a>
<a id='line_3975'>42:38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother</a>
<a id='line_3976'>is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in</a>
<a id='line_3977'>the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to</a>
<a id='line_3978'>the grave.</a>
<a id='line_3979'></a>
<a id='line_3980'>43:1 And the famine was sore in the land.</a>
<a id='line_3981'></a>
<a id='line_3982'>43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they</a>
<a id='line_3983'>had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy</a>
<a id='line_3984'>us a little food.</a>
<a id='line_3985'></a>
<a id='line_3986'>43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest</a>
<a id='line_3987'>unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with</a>
<a id='line_3988'>you.</a>
<a id='line_3989'></a>
<a id='line_3990'>43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy</a>
<a id='line_3991'>thee food: 43:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down:</a>
<a id='line_3992'>for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your</a>
<a id='line_3993'>brother be with you.</a>
<a id='line_3994'></a>
<a id='line_3995'>43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell</a>
<a id='line_3996'>the man whether ye had yet a brother?  43:7 And they said, The man</a>
<a id='line_3997'>asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your</a>
<a id='line_3998'>father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according</a>
<a id='line_3999'>to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would</a>
<a id='line_4000'>say, Bring your brother down?  43:8 And Judah said unto Israel his</a>
<a id='line_4001'>father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may</a>
<a id='line_4002'>live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.</a>
<a id='line_4003'></a>
<a id='line_4004'>43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I</a>
<a id='line_4005'>bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the</a>
<a id='line_4006'>blame for ever: 43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we had</a>
<a id='line_4007'>returned this second time.</a>
<a id='line_4008'></a>
<a id='line_4009'>43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do</a>
<a id='line_4010'>this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry</a>
<a id='line_4011'>down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and</a>
<a id='line_4012'>myrrh, nuts, and almonds: 43:12 And take double money in your hand;</a>
<a id='line_4013'>and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry</a>
<a id='line_4014'>it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 43:13 Take</a>
<a id='line_4015'>also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 43:14 And God</a>
<a id='line_4016'>Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your</a>
<a id='line_4017'>other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am</a>
<a id='line_4018'>bereaved.</a>
<a id='line_4019'></a>
<a id='line_4020'>43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in</a>
<a id='line_4021'>their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and</a>
<a id='line_4022'>stood before Joseph.</a>
<a id='line_4023'></a>
<a id='line_4024'>43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of</a>
<a id='line_4025'>his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these</a>
<a id='line_4026'>men shall dine with me at noon.</a>
<a id='line_4027'></a>
<a id='line_4028'>43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into</a>
<a id='line_4029'>Joseph’s house.</a>
<a id='line_4030'></a>
<a id='line_4031'>43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s</a>
<a id='line_4032'>house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our</a>
<a id='line_4033'>sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion</a>
<a id='line_4034'>against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.</a>
<a id='line_4035'></a>
<a id='line_4036'>43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they</a>
<a id='line_4037'>communed with him at the door of the house, 43:20 And said, O sir, we</a>
<a id='line_4038'>came indeed down at the first time to buy food: 43:21 And it came to</a>
<a id='line_4039'>pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold,</a>
<a id='line_4040'>every man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full</a>
<a id='line_4041'>weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.</a>
<a id='line_4042'></a>
<a id='line_4043'>43:22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:</a>
<a id='line_4044'>we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.</a>
<a id='line_4045'></a>
<a id='line_4046'>43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of</a>
<a id='line_4047'>your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.</a>
<a id='line_4048'>And he brought Simeon out unto them.</a>
<a id='line_4049'></a>
<a id='line_4050'>43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them</a>
<a id='line_4051'>water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.</a>
<a id='line_4052'></a>
<a id='line_4053'>43:25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for</a>
<a id='line_4054'>they heard that they should eat bread there.</a>
<a id='line_4055'></a>
<a id='line_4056'>43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which</a>
<a id='line_4057'>was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the</a>
<a id='line_4058'>earth.</a>
<a id='line_4059'></a>
<a id='line_4060'>43:27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father</a>
<a id='line_4061'>well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?  43:28 And they</a>
<a id='line_4062'>answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive.</a>
<a id='line_4063'>And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.</a>
<a id='line_4064'></a>
<a id='line_4065'>43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his</a>
<a id='line_4066'>mother’s son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake</a>
<a id='line_4067'>unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.</a>
<a id='line_4068'></a>
<a id='line_4069'>43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his</a>
<a id='line_4070'>brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber,</a>
<a id='line_4071'>and wept there.</a>
<a id='line_4072'></a>
<a id='line_4073'>43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and</a>
<a id='line_4074'>said, Set on bread.</a>
<a id='line_4075'></a>
<a id='line_4076'>43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves,</a>
<a id='line_4077'>and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because</a>
<a id='line_4078'>the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an</a>
<a id='line_4079'>abomination unto the Egyptians.</a>
<a id='line_4080'></a>
<a id='line_4081'>43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his</a>
<a id='line_4082'>birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men</a>
<a id='line_4083'>marvelled one at another.</a>
<a id='line_4084'></a>
<a id='line_4085'>43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but</a>
<a id='line_4086'>Benjamin’s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they</a>
<a id='line_4087'>drank, and were merry with him.</a>
<a id='line_4088'></a>
<a id='line_4089'>44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s</a>
<a id='line_4090'>sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money</a>
<a id='line_4091'>in his sack’s mouth.</a>
<a id='line_4092'></a>
<a id='line_4093'>44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the</a>
<a id='line_4094'>youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that</a>
<a id='line_4095'>Joseph had spoken.</a>
<a id='line_4096'></a>
<a id='line_4097'>44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they</a>
<a id='line_4098'>and their asses.</a>
<a id='line_4099'></a>
<a id='line_4100'>44:4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,</a>
<a id='line_4101'>Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou</a>
<a id='line_4102'>dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for</a>
<a id='line_4103'>good?  44:5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby</a>
<a id='line_4104'>indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.</a>
<a id='line_4105'></a>
<a id='line_4106'>44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.</a>
<a id='line_4107'></a>
<a id='line_4108'>44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God</a>
<a id='line_4109'>forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 44:8</a>
<a id='line_4110'>Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought</a>
<a id='line_4111'>again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal</a>
<a id='line_4112'>out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?  44:9 With whomsoever of thy</a>
<a id='line_4113'>servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord’s</a>
<a id='line_4114'>bondmen.</a>
<a id='line_4115'></a>
<a id='line_4116'>44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he</a>
<a id='line_4117'>with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.</a>
<a id='line_4118'></a>
<a id='line_4119'>44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,</a>
<a id='line_4120'>and opened every man his sack.</a>
<a id='line_4121'></a>
<a id='line_4122'>44:12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the</a>
<a id='line_4123'>youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.</a>
<a id='line_4124'></a>
<a id='line_4125'>44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and</a>
<a id='line_4126'>returned to the city.</a>
<a id='line_4127'></a>
<a id='line_4128'>44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he was</a>
<a id='line_4129'>yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_4130'></a>
<a id='line_4131'>44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done?</a>
<a id='line_4132'>wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?  44:16 And Judah</a>
<a id='line_4133'>said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak?  or how</a>
<a id='line_4134'>shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy</a>
<a id='line_4135'>servants: behold, we are my lord’s servants, both we, and he also with</a>
<a id='line_4136'>whom the cup is found.</a>
<a id='line_4137'></a>
<a id='line_4138'>44:17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in</a>
<a id='line_4139'>whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you,</a>
<a id='line_4140'>get you up in peace unto your father.</a>
<a id='line_4141'></a>
<a id='line_4142'>44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy</a>
<a id='line_4143'>servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not</a>
<a id='line_4144'>thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.</a>
<a id='line_4145'></a>
<a id='line_4146'>44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a</a>
<a id='line_4147'>brother?  44:20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old</a>
<a id='line_4148'>man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is</a>
<a id='line_4149'>dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.</a>
<a id='line_4150'></a>
<a id='line_4151'>44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that</a>
<a id='line_4152'>I may set mine eyes upon him.</a>
<a id='line_4153'></a>
<a id='line_4154'>44:22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for</a>
<a id='line_4155'>if he should leave his father, his father would die.</a>
<a id='line_4156'></a>
<a id='line_4157'>44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother</a>
<a id='line_4158'>come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</a>
<a id='line_4159'></a>
<a id='line_4160'>44:24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father,</a>
<a id='line_4161'>we told him the words of my lord.</a>
<a id='line_4162'></a>
<a id='line_4163'>44:25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.</a>
<a id='line_4164'></a>
<a id='line_4165'>44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with</a>
<a id='line_4166'>us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, except</a>
<a id='line_4167'>our youngest brother be with us.</a>
<a id='line_4168'></a>
<a id='line_4169'>44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife</a>
<a id='line_4170'>bare me two sons: 44:28 And the one went out from me, and I said,</a>
<a id='line_4171'>Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 44:29 And if ye</a>
<a id='line_4172'>take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down</a>
<a id='line_4173'>my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</a>
<a id='line_4174'></a>
<a id='line_4175'>44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad</a>
<a id='line_4176'>be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life;</a>
<a id='line_4177'>44:31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with</a>
<a id='line_4178'>us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs</a>
<a id='line_4179'>of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.</a>
<a id='line_4180'></a>
<a id='line_4181'>44:32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,</a>
<a id='line_4182'>saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to</a>
<a id='line_4183'>my father for ever.</a>
<a id='line_4184'></a>
<a id='line_4185'>44:33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the</a>
<a id='line_4186'>lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.</a>
<a id='line_4187'></a>
<a id='line_4188'>44:34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me?</a>
<a id='line_4189'>lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.</a>
<a id='line_4190'></a>
<a id='line_4191'>45:1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood</a>
<a id='line_4192'>by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there</a>
<a id='line_4193'>stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his</a>
<a id='line_4194'>brethren.</a>
<a id='line_4195'></a>
<a id='line_4196'>45:2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh</a>
<a id='line_4197'>heard.</a>
<a id='line_4198'></a>
<a id='line_4199'>45:3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father</a>
<a id='line_4200'>yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were</a>
<a id='line_4201'>troubled at his presence.</a>
<a id='line_4202'></a>
<a id='line_4203'>45:4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you.</a>
<a id='line_4204'>And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye</a>
<a id='line_4205'>sold into Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_4206'></a>
<a id='line_4207'>45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye</a>
<a id='line_4208'>sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.</a>
<a id='line_4209'></a>
<a id='line_4210'>45:6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet</a>
<a id='line_4211'>there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor</a>
<a id='line_4212'>harvest.</a>
<a id='line_4213'></a>
<a id='line_4214'>45:7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the</a>
<a id='line_4215'>earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.</a>
<a id='line_4216'></a>
<a id='line_4217'>45:8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath</a>
<a id='line_4218'>made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler</a>
<a id='line_4219'>throughout all the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_4220'></a>
<a id='line_4221'>45:9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith</a>
<a id='line_4222'>thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me,</a>
<a id='line_4223'>tarry not: 45:10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou</a>
<a id='line_4224'>shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children’s</a>
<a id='line_4225'>children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: 45:11</a>
<a id='line_4226'>And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine;</a>
<a id='line_4227'>lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.</a>
<a id='line_4228'></a>
<a id='line_4229'>45:12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,</a>
<a id='line_4230'>that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.</a>
<a id='line_4231'></a>
<a id='line_4232'>45:13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all</a>
<a id='line_4233'>that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.</a>
<a id='line_4234'></a>
<a id='line_4235'>45:14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and</a>
<a id='line_4236'>Benjamin wept upon his neck.</a>
<a id='line_4237'></a>
<a id='line_4238'>45:15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and</a>
<a id='line_4239'>after that his brethren talked with him.</a>
<a id='line_4240'></a>
<a id='line_4241'>45:16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying,</a>
<a id='line_4242'>Joseph’s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his</a>
<a id='line_4243'>servants.</a>
<a id='line_4244'></a>
<a id='line_4245'>45:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye;</a>
<a id='line_4246'>lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; 45:18 And</a>
<a id='line_4247'>take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will</a>
<a id='line_4248'>give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of</a>
<a id='line_4249'>the land.</a>
<a id='line_4250'></a>
<a id='line_4251'>45:19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the</a>
<a id='line_4252'>land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your</a>
<a id='line_4253'>father, and come.</a>
<a id='line_4254'></a>
<a id='line_4255'>45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of</a>
<a id='line_4256'>Egypt is yours.</a>
<a id='line_4257'></a>
<a id='line_4258'>45:21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,</a>
<a id='line_4259'>according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for</a>
<a id='line_4260'>the way.</a>
<a id='line_4261'></a>
<a id='line_4262'>45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to</a>
<a id='line_4263'>Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of</a>
<a id='line_4264'>raiment.</a>
<a id='line_4265'></a>
<a id='line_4266'>45:23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden</a>
<a id='line_4267'>with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and</a>
<a id='line_4268'>bread and meat for his father by the way.</a>
<a id='line_4269'></a>
<a id='line_4270'>45:24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said</a>
<a id='line_4271'>unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.</a>
<a id='line_4272'></a>
<a id='line_4273'>45:25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan</a>
<a id='line_4274'>unto Jacob their father, 45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet</a>
<a id='line_4275'>alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob’s</a>
<a id='line_4276'>heart fainted, for he believed them not.</a>
<a id='line_4277'></a>
<a id='line_4278'>45:27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said</a>
<a id='line_4279'>unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry</a>
<a id='line_4280'>him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: 45:28 And Israel said,</a>
<a id='line_4281'>It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before</a>
<a id='line_4282'>I die.</a>
<a id='line_4283'></a>
<a id='line_4284'>46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to</a>
<a id='line_4285'>Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.</a>
<a id='line_4286'></a>
<a id='line_4287'>46:2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,</a>
<a id='line_4288'>Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.</a>
<a id='line_4289'></a>
<a id='line_4290'>46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down</a>
<a id='line_4291'>into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: 46:4 I will</a>
<a id='line_4292'>go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up</a>
<a id='line_4293'>again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.</a>
<a id='line_4294'></a>
<a id='line_4295'>46:5 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried</a>
<a id='line_4296'>Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the</a>
<a id='line_4297'>wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.</a>
<a id='line_4298'></a>
<a id='line_4299'>46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had</a>
<a id='line_4300'>gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his</a>
<a id='line_4301'>seed with him: 46:7 His sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his</a>
<a id='line_4302'>daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed brought he with</a>
<a id='line_4303'>him into Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_4304'></a>
<a id='line_4305'>46:8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came</a>
<a id='line_4306'>into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn.</a>
<a id='line_4307'></a>
<a id='line_4308'>46:9 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and</a>
<a id='line_4309'>Carmi.</a>
<a id='line_4310'></a>
<a id='line_4311'>46:10 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,</a>
<a id='line_4312'>and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.</a>

<a id='line_4314'>46:11 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</a>

<a id='line_4316'>46:12 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and</a>
<a id='line_4317'>Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of</a>
<a id='line_4318'>Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.</a>
<a id='line_4319'></a>
<a id='line_4320'>46:13 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and</a>
<a id='line_4321'>Shimron.</a>
<a id='line_4322'></a>

<a id='line_4324'></a>
<a id='line_4325'>46:15 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in</a>
<a id='line_4326'>Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his</a>
<a id='line_4327'>daughters were thirty and three.</a>
<a id='line_4328'></a>
<a id='line_4329'>46:16 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri,</a>

<a id='line_4334'></a>
<a id='line_4335'>46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his</a>
<a id='line_4336'>daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.</a>
<a id='line_4337'></a>
<a id='line_4338'>46:19 The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.</a>
<a id='line_4339'></a>
<a id='line_4340'>46:20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and</a>
<a id='line_4341'>Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare</a>
<a id='line_4342'>unto him.</a>
<a id='line_4343'></a>
<a id='line_4344'>46:21 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,</a>

<a id='line_4347'>46:22 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the</a>
<a id='line_4348'>souls were fourteen.</a>
<a id='line_4349'></a>

<a id='line_4351'></a>
<a id='line_4352'>46:24 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and</a>

<a id='line_4358'>46:26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of</a>

<a id='line_4360'>and six; 46:27 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt,</a>
<a id='line_4361'>were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into</a>
<a id='line_4362'>Egypt, were threescore and ten.</a>
<a id='line_4363'></a>
<a id='line_4364'>46:28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face</a>
<a id='line_4365'>unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.</a>
<a id='line_4366'></a>
<a id='line_4367'>46:29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel</a>
<a id='line_4368'>his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on</a>
<a id='line_4369'>his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.</a>
<a id='line_4370'></a>
<a id='line_4371'>46:30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen</a>
<a id='line_4372'>thy face, because thou art yet alive.</a>
<a id='line_4373'></a>
<a id='line_4374'>46:31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house,</a>
<a id='line_4375'>I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my</a>
<a id='line_4376'>father’s house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;</a>
<a id='line_4377'>46:32 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed</a>
<a id='line_4378'>cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all</a>
<a id='line_4379'>that they have.</a>
<a id='line_4380'></a>
<a id='line_4381'>46:33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and</a>
<a id='line_4382'>shall say, What is your occupation?  46:34 That ye shall say, Thy</a>
<a id='line_4383'>servants’ trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now,</a>
<a id='line_4384'>both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of</a>
<a id='line_4385'>Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</a>
<a id='line_4386'></a>
<a id='line_4387'>47:1 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my</a>
<a id='line_4388'>brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have,</a>
<a id='line_4389'>are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land</a>
<a id='line_4390'>of Goshen.</a>
<a id='line_4391'></a>
<a id='line_4392'>47:2 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented</a>
<a id='line_4393'>them unto Pharaoh.</a>
<a id='line_4394'></a>
<a id='line_4395'>47:3 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And</a>
<a id='line_4396'>they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also</a>
<a id='line_4397'>our fathers.</a>
<a id='line_4398'></a>
<a id='line_4399'>47:4 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we</a>
<a id='line_4400'>come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the</a>
<a id='line_4401'>famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let</a>
<a id='line_4402'>thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.</a>
<a id='line_4403'></a>
<a id='line_4404'>47:5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy</a>
<a id='line_4405'>brethren are come unto thee: 47:6 The land of Egypt is before thee; in</a>
<a id='line_4406'>the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the</a>
<a id='line_4407'>land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity</a>
<a id='line_4408'>among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.</a>
<a id='line_4409'></a>
<a id='line_4410'>47:7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before</a>
<a id='line_4411'>Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.</a>
<a id='line_4412'></a>
<a id='line_4413'>47:8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?  47:9 And Jacob</a>
<a id='line_4414'>said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an</a>
<a id='line_4415'>hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of</a>
<a id='line_4416'>my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the</a>
<a id='line_4417'>life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.</a>
<a id='line_4418'></a>
<a id='line_4419'>47:10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.</a>
<a id='line_4420'></a>
<a id='line_4421'>47:11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a</a>
<a id='line_4422'>possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land</a>
<a id='line_4423'>of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.</a>
<a id='line_4424'></a>
<a id='line_4425'>47:12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his</a>
<a id='line_4426'>father’s household, with bread, according to their families.</a>
<a id='line_4427'></a>
<a id='line_4428'>47:13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very</a>
<a id='line_4429'>sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by</a>
<a id='line_4430'>reason of the famine.</a>
<a id='line_4431'></a>
<a id='line_4432'>47:14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land</a>
<a id='line_4433'>of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought:</a>
<a id='line_4434'>and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.</a>
<a id='line_4435'></a>
<a id='line_4436'>47:15 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of</a>
<a id='line_4437'>Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread:</a>
<a id='line_4438'>for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.</a>
<a id='line_4439'></a>
<a id='line_4440'>47:16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your</a>
<a id='line_4441'>cattle, if money fail.</a>
<a id='line_4442'></a>
<a id='line_4443'>47:17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them</a>
<a id='line_4444'>bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle</a>
<a id='line_4445'>of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all</a>
<a id='line_4446'>their cattle for that year.</a>
<a id='line_4447'></a>
<a id='line_4448'>47:18 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,</a>
<a id='line_4449'>and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our</a>
<a id='line_4450'>money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not</a>
<a id='line_4451'>ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:</a>
<a id='line_4452'>47:19 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?</a>
<a id='line_4453'>buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants</a>
<a id='line_4454'>unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that</a>
<a id='line_4455'>the land be not desolate.</a>
<a id='line_4456'></a>
<a id='line_4457'>47:20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the</a>
<a id='line_4458'>Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over</a>
<a id='line_4459'>them: so the land became Pharaoh’s.</a>
<a id='line_4460'></a>
<a id='line_4461'>47:21 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of</a>
<a id='line_4462'>the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.</a>
<a id='line_4463'></a>
<a id='line_4464'>47:22 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had</a>
<a id='line_4465'>a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which</a>
<a id='line_4466'>Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.</a>
<a id='line_4467'></a>
<a id='line_4468'>47:23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this</a>
<a id='line_4469'>day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall</a>
<a id='line_4470'>sow the land.</a>
<a id='line_4471'></a>
<a id='line_4472'>47:24 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give</a>
<a id='line_4473'>the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for</a>
<a id='line_4474'>seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households,</a>
<a id='line_4475'>and for food for your little ones.</a>
<a id='line_4476'></a>
<a id='line_4477'>47:25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in</a>
<a id='line_4478'>the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.</a>
<a id='line_4479'></a>
<a id='line_4480'>47:26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,</a>
<a id='line_4481'>that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the</a>
<a id='line_4482'>priests only, which became not Pharaoh’s.</a>
<a id='line_4483'></a>
<a id='line_4484'>47:27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen;</a>
<a id='line_4485'>and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied</a>
<a id='line_4486'>exceedingly.</a>
<a id='line_4487'></a>
<a id='line_4488'>47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the</a>
<a id='line_4489'>whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.</a>
<a id='line_4490'></a>
<a id='line_4491'>47:29 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his</a>
<a id='line_4492'>son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,</a>
<a id='line_4493'>put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly</a>
<a id='line_4494'>with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: 47:30 But I will lie with</a>
<a id='line_4495'>my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their</a>
<a id='line_4496'>buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.</a>
<a id='line_4497'></a>
<a id='line_4498'>47:31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel</a>
<a id='line_4499'>bowed himself upon the bed’s head.</a>
<a id='line_4500'></a>
<a id='line_4501'>48:1 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,</a>
<a id='line_4502'>Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons,</a>
<a id='line_4503'>Manasseh and Ephraim.</a>
<a id='line_4504'></a>
<a id='line_4505'>48:2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto</a>
<a id='line_4506'>thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.</a>
<a id='line_4507'></a>
<a id='line_4508'>48:3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz</a>
<a id='line_4509'>in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 48:4 And said unto me, Behold,</a>
<a id='line_4510'>I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee</a>
<a id='line_4511'>a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee</a>
<a id='line_4512'>for an everlasting possession.</a>
<a id='line_4513'></a>
<a id='line_4514'>48:5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto</a>
<a id='line_4515'>thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are</a>
<a id='line_4516'>mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.</a>
<a id='line_4517'></a>
<a id='line_4518'>48:6 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine,</a>
<a id='line_4519'>and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their</a>
<a id='line_4520'>inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_4521'></a>
<a id='line_4522'>48:7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the</a>
<a id='line_4523'>land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come</a>
<a id='line_4524'>unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same</a>
<a id='line_4525'>is Bethlehem.</a>
<a id='line_4526'></a>
<a id='line_4527'>48:8 And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who are these?  48:9</a>
<a id='line_4528'>And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given</a>
<a id='line_4529'>me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I</a>
<a id='line_4530'>will bless them.</a>
<a id='line_4531'></a>
<a id='line_4532'>48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not</a>
<a id='line_4533'>see.</a>
<a id='line_4534'></a>
<a id='line_4535'>And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced</a>
<a id='line_4536'>them.</a>
<a id='line_4537'></a>
<a id='line_4538'>48:11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face:</a>
<a id='line_4539'>and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.</a>
<a id='line_4540'></a>
<a id='line_4541'>48:12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed</a>
<a id='line_4542'>himself with his face to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_4543'></a>
<a id='line_4544'>48:13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward</a>
<a id='line_4545'>Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s</a>
<a id='line_4546'>right hand, and brought them near unto him.</a>
<a id='line_4547'></a>
<a id='line_4548'>48:14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon</a>
<a id='line_4549'>Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s</a>
<a id='line_4550'>head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.</a>
<a id='line_4551'></a>
<a id='line_4552'>48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers</a>
<a id='line_4553'>Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto</a>
<a id='line_4554'>this day, 48:16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the</a>
<a id='line_4555'>lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers</a>
<a id='line_4556'>Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of</a>
<a id='line_4557'>the earth.</a>
<a id='line_4558'></a>
<a id='line_4559'>48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the</a>
<a id='line_4560'>head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s hand,</a>
<a id='line_4561'>to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.</a>
<a id='line_4562'></a>
<a id='line_4563'>48:18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is</a>
<a id='line_4564'>the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.</a>
<a id='line_4565'></a>
<a id='line_4566'>48:19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it:</a>
<a id='line_4567'>he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly</a>
<a id='line_4568'>his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall</a>
<a id='line_4569'>become a multitude of nations.</a>
<a id='line_4570'></a>
<a id='line_4571'>48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel</a>
<a id='line_4572'>bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set</a>
<a id='line_4573'>Ephraim before Manasseh.</a>
<a id='line_4574'></a>
<a id='line_4575'>48:21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be</a>
<a id='line_4576'>with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.</a>
<a id='line_4577'></a>
<a id='line_4578'>48:22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,</a>
<a id='line_4579'>which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my</a>
<a id='line_4580'>bow.</a>
<a id='line_4581'></a>
<a id='line_4582'>49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves</a>
<a id='line_4583'>together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last</a>
<a id='line_4584'>days.</a>
<a id='line_4585'></a>
<a id='line_4586'>49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and</a>
<a id='line_4587'>hearken unto Israel your father.</a>
<a id='line_4588'></a>
<a id='line_4589'>49:3 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my</a>
<a id='line_4590'>strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: 49:4</a>
<a id='line_4591'>Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to</a>
<a id='line_4592'>thy father’s bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.</a>
<a id='line_4593'></a>
<a id='line_4594'>49:5 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their</a>
<a id='line_4595'>habitations.</a>
<a id='line_4596'></a>
<a id='line_4597'>49:6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly,</a>
<a id='line_4598'>mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man,</a>
<a id='line_4599'>and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.</a>
<a id='line_4600'></a>
<a id='line_4601'>49:7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it</a>
<a id='line_4602'>was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4603'></a>
<a id='line_4604'>49:8 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall</a>
<a id='line_4605'>be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall bow down</a>
<a id='line_4606'>before thee.</a>
<a id='line_4607'></a>
<a id='line_4608'>49:9 Judah is a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up:</a>
<a id='line_4609'>he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall</a>
<a id='line_4610'>rouse him up?  49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a</a>
<a id='line_4611'>lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall</a>
<a id='line_4612'>the gathering of the people be.</a>
<a id='line_4613'></a>
<a id='line_4614'>49:11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the</a>
<a id='line_4615'>choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the</a>
<a id='line_4616'>blood of grapes: 49:12 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth</a>
<a id='line_4617'>white with milk.</a>
<a id='line_4618'></a>
<a id='line_4619'>49:13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for</a>
<a id='line_4620'>an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.</a>
<a id='line_4621'></a>
<a id='line_4622'>49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:</a>
<a id='line_4623'>49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was</a>
<a id='line_4624'>pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto</a>
<a id='line_4625'>tribute.</a>
<a id='line_4626'></a>
<a id='line_4627'>49:16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4628'></a>
<a id='line_4629'>49:17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that</a>
<a id='line_4630'>biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.</a>
<a id='line_4631'></a>
<a id='line_4632'>49:18 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4633'></a>
<a id='line_4634'>49:19 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the</a>
<a id='line_4635'>last.</a>
<a id='line_4636'></a>
<a id='line_4637'>49:20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal</a>
<a id='line_4638'>dainties.</a>

<a id='line_4640'>49:21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.</a>
<a id='line_4641'></a>
<a id='line_4642'>49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;</a>
<a id='line_4643'>whose branches run over the wall: 49:23 The archers have sorely</a>
<a id='line_4644'>grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: 49:24 But his bow abode</a>
<a id='line_4645'>in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands</a>
<a id='line_4646'>of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of</a>
<a id='line_4647'>Israel:) 49:25 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and</a>
<a id='line_4648'>by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,</a>
<a id='line_4649'>blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and</a>
<a id='line_4650'>of the womb: 49:26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above</a>
<a id='line_4651'>the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the</a>
<a id='line_4652'>everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the</a>
<a id='line_4653'>crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.</a>
<a id='line_4654'></a>
<a id='line_4655'>49:27 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour</a>
<a id='line_4656'>the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.</a>
<a id='line_4657'></a>
<a id='line_4658'>49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that</a>
<a id='line_4659'>their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to</a>
<a id='line_4660'>his blessing he blessed them.</a>
<a id='line_4661'></a>
<a id='line_4662'>49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered</a>
<a id='line_4663'>unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the</a>
<a id='line_4664'>field of Ephron the Hittite, 49:30 In the cave that is in the field of</a>
<a id='line_4665'>Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham</a>
<a id='line_4666'>bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a</a>
<a id='line_4667'>buryingplace.</a>
<a id='line_4668'></a>
<a id='line_4669'>49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried</a>
<a id='line_4670'>Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.</a>
<a id='line_4671'></a>
<a id='line_4672'>49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was</a>
<a id='line_4673'>from the children of Heth.</a>
<a id='line_4674'></a>
<a id='line_4675'>49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he</a>
<a id='line_4676'>gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was</a>
<a id='line_4677'>gathered unto his people.</a>
<a id='line_4678'></a>
<a id='line_4679'>50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and</a>
<a id='line_4680'>kissed him.</a>
<a id='line_4681'></a>
<a id='line_4682'>50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his</a>
<a id='line_4683'>father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4684'></a>
<a id='line_4685'>50:3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the</a>
<a id='line_4686'>days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him</a>
<a id='line_4687'>threescore and ten days.</a>
<a id='line_4688'></a>
<a id='line_4689'>50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto</a>
<a id='line_4690'>the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes,</a>
<a id='line_4691'>speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 50:5 My father made</a>
<a id='line_4692'>me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in</a>
<a id='line_4693'>the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go</a>
<a id='line_4694'>up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.</a>
<a id='line_4695'></a>
<a id='line_4696'>50:6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he</a>
<a id='line_4697'>made thee swear.</a>
<a id='line_4698'></a>
<a id='line_4699'>50:7 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all</a>
<a id='line_4700'>the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders</a>
<a id='line_4701'>of the land of Egypt, 50:8 And all the house of Joseph, and his</a>
<a id='line_4702'>brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their</a>
<a id='line_4703'>flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.</a>
<a id='line_4704'></a>
<a id='line_4705'>50:9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was</a>
<a id='line_4706'>a very great company.</a>
<a id='line_4707'></a>
<a id='line_4708'>50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond</a>
<a id='line_4709'>Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation:</a>
<a id='line_4710'>and he made a mourning for his father seven days.</a>
<a id='line_4711'></a>
<a id='line_4712'>50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the</a>
<a id='line_4713'>mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning</a>
<a id='line_4714'>to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim,</a>
<a id='line_4715'>which is beyond Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_4716'></a>
<a id='line_4717'>50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 50:13</a>
<a id='line_4718'>For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in</a>
<a id='line_4719'>the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the</a>
<a id='line_4720'>field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before</a>
<a id='line_4721'>Mamre.</a>
<a id='line_4722'></a>
<a id='line_4723'>50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all</a>
<a id='line_4724'>that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his</a>
<a id='line_4725'>father.</a>
<a id='line_4726'></a>
<a id='line_4727'>50:15 And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they</a>
<a id='line_4728'>said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us</a>
<a id='line_4729'>all the evil which we did unto him.</a>
<a id='line_4730'></a>
<a id='line_4731'>50:16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did</a>
<a id='line_4732'>command before he died, saying, 50:17 So shall ye say unto Joseph,</a>
<a id='line_4733'>Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin;</a>
<a id='line_4734'>for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the</a>
<a id='line_4735'>trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept</a>
<a id='line_4736'>when they spake unto him.</a>
<a id='line_4737'></a>
<a id='line_4738'>50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and</a>
<a id='line_4739'>they said, Behold, we be thy servants.</a>
<a id='line_4740'></a>
<a id='line_4741'>50:19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of</a>
<a id='line_4742'>God?  50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant</a>
<a id='line_4743'>it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people</a>
<a id='line_4744'>alive.</a>
<a id='line_4745'></a>
<a id='line_4746'>50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little</a>
<a id='line_4747'>ones.</a>
<a id='line_4748'></a>
<a id='line_4749'>And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.</a>
<a id='line_4750'></a>
<a id='line_4751'>50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and</a>
<a id='line_4752'>Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.</a>
<a id='line_4753'></a>
<a id='line_4754'>50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation: the</a>
<a id='line_4755'>children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon</a>
<a id='line_4756'>Joseph’s knees.</a>
<a id='line_4757'></a>
<a id='line_4758'>50:24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely</a>
<a id='line_4759'>visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware</a>
<a id='line_4760'>to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</a>
<a id='line_4761'></a>
<a id='line_4762'>50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God</a>
<a id='line_4763'>will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.</a>
<a id='line_4764'></a>
<a id='line_4765'>50:26 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they</a>
<a id='line_4766'>embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_4767'></a>
<a id='line_4768'></a>
