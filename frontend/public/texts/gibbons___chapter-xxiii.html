<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>      The character of Apostate has injured the reputation of Julian;</a>
<a id='line_9'>      and the enthusiasm which clouded his virtues has exaggerated the</a>
<a id='line_10'>      real and apparent magnitude of his faults. Our partial ignorance</a>
<a id='line_11'>      may represent him as a philosophic monarch, who studied to</a>
<a id='line_12'>      protect, with an equal hand, the religious factions of the</a>
<a id='line_13'>      empire; and to allay the theological fever which had inflamed the</a>
<a id='line_14'>      minds of the people, from the edicts of Diocletian to the exile</a>
<a id='line_15'>      of Athanasius. A more accurate view of the character and conduct</a>
<a id='line_16'>      of Julian will remove this favorable prepossession for a prince</a>
<a id='line_17'>      who did not escape the general contagion of the times. We enjoy</a>
<a id='line_18'>      the singular advantage of comparing the pictures which have been</a>
<a id='line_19'>      delineated by his fondest admirers and his implacable enemies.</a>
<a id='line_20'>      The actions of Julian are faithfully related by a judicious and</a>
<a id='line_21'>      candid historian, the impartial spectator of his life and death.</a>
<a id='line_22'>      The unanimous evidence of his contemporaries is confirmed by the</a>
<a id='line_23'>      public and private declarations of the emperor himself; and his</a>
<a id='line_24'>      various writings express the uniform tenor of his religious</a>
<a id='line_25'>      sentiments, which policy would have prompted him to dissemble</a>
<a id='line_26'>      rather than to affect. A devout and sincere attachment for the</a>
<a id='line_27'>      gods of Athens and Rome constituted the ruling passion of Julian;</a>
<a id='line_28'>      1 the powers of an enlightened understanding were betrayed and</a>
<a id='line_29'>      corrupted by the influence of superstitious prejudice; and the</a>
<a id='line_30'>      phantoms which existed only in the mind of the emperor had a real</a>
<a id='line_31'>      and pernicious effect on the government of the empire. The</a>
<a id='line_32'>      vehement zeal of the Christians, who despised the worship, and</a>
<a id='line_33'>      overturned the altars of those fabulous deities, engaged their</a>
<a id='line_34'>      votary in a state of irreconcilable hostility with a very</a>
<a id='line_35'>      numerous party of his subjects; and he was sometimes tempted by</a>
<a id='line_36'>      the desire of victory, or the shame of a repulse, to violate the</a>
<a id='line_37'>      laws of prudence, and even of justice. The triumph of the party,</a>
<a id='line_38'>      which he deserted and opposed, has fixed a stain of infamy on the</a>
<a id='line_39'>      name of Julian; and the unsuccessful apostate has been</a>
<a id='line_40'>      overwhelmed with a torrent of pious invectives, of which the</a>
<a id='line_41'>      signal was given by the sonorous trumpet 2 of Gregory Nazianzen.</a>
<a id='line_42'>      3 The interesting nature of the events which were crowded into</a>
<a id='line_43'>      the short reign of this active emperor, deserve a just and</a>
<a id='line_44'>      circumstantial narrative. His motives, his counsels, and his</a>
<a id='line_45'>      actions, as far as they are connected with the history of</a>
<a id='line_46'>      religion, will be the subject of the present chapter.</a>

<a id='line_51'>      variety and copiousness of the Greek tongue seem inadequate to</a>

<a id='line_70'></a>
<a id='line_71'>      The cause of his strange and fatal apostasy may be derived from</a>
<a id='line_72'>      the early period of his life, when he was left an orphan in the</a>
<a id='line_73'>      hands of the murderers of his family. The names of Christ and of</a>
<a id='line_74'>      Constantius, the ideas of slavery and of religion, were soon</a>
<a id='line_75'>      associated in a youthful imagination, which was susceptible of</a>
<a id='line_76'>      the most lively impressions. The care of his infancy was</a>
<a id='line_77'>      intrusted to Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, 4 who was related to</a>
<a id='line_78'>      him on the side of his mother; and till Julian reached the</a>
<a id='line_79'>      twentieth year of his age, he received from his Christian</a>
<a id='line_80'>      preceptors the education, not of a hero, but of a saint. The</a>
<a id='line_81'>      emperor, less jealous of a heavenly than of an earthly crown,</a>
<a id='line_82'>      contented himself with the imperfect character of a catechumen,</a>
<a id='line_83'>      while he bestowed the advantages of baptism 5 on the nephews of</a>
<a id='line_84'>      Constantine. 6 They were even admitted to the inferior offices of</a>
<a id='line_85'>      the ecclesiastical order; and Julian publicly read the Holy</a>
<a id='line_86'>      Scriptures in the church of Nicomedia. The study of religion,</a>
<a id='line_87'>      which they assiduously cultivated, appeared to produce the</a>
<a id='line_88'>      fairest fruits of faith and devotion. 7 They prayed, they fasted,</a>
<a id='line_89'>      they distributed alms to the poor, gifts to the clergy, and</a>
<a id='line_90'>      oblations to the tombs of the martyrs; and the splendid monument</a>
<a id='line_91'>      of St. Mamas, at C¾sarea, was erected, or at least was</a>
<a id='line_92'>      undertaken, by the joint labor of Gallus and Julian. 8 They</a>
<a id='line_93'>      respectfully conversed with the bishops, who were eminent for</a>
<a id='line_94'>      superior sanctity, and solicited the benediction of the monks and</a>
<a id='line_95'>      hermits, who had introduced into Cappadocia the voluntary</a>
<a id='line_96'>      hardships of the ascetic life. 9 As the two princes advanced</a>
<a id='line_97'>      towards the years of manhood, they discovered, in their religious</a>
<a id='line_98'>      sentiments, the difference of their characters. The dull and</a>
<a id='line_99'>      obstinate understanding of Gallus embraced, with implicit zeal,</a>
<a id='line_100'>      the doctrines of Christianity; which never influenced his</a>
<a id='line_101'>      conduct, or moderated his passions. The mild disposition of the</a>
<a id='line_102'>      younger brother was less repugnant to the precepts of the gospel;</a>
<a id='line_103'>      and his active curiosity might have been gratified by a</a>
<a id='line_104'>      theological system, which explains the mysterious essence of the</a>
<a id='line_105'>      Deity, and opens the boundless prospect of invisible and future</a>
<a id='line_106'>      worlds. But the independent spirit of Julian refused to yield the</a>
<a id='line_107'>      passive and unresisting obedience which was required, in the name</a>
<a id='line_108'>      of religion, by the haughty ministers of the church. Their</a>
<a id='line_109'>      speculative opinions were imposed as positive laws, and guarded</a>
<a id='line_110'>      by the terrors of eternal punishments; but while they prescribed</a>
<a id='line_111'>      the rigid formulary of the thoughts, the words, and the actions</a>
<a id='line_112'>      of the young prince; whilst they silenced his objections, and</a>
<a id='line_113'>      severely checked the freedom of his inquiries, they secretly</a>
<a id='line_114'>      provoked his impatient genius to disclaim the authority of his</a>
<a id='line_115'>      ecclesiastical guides. He was educated in the Lesser Asia, amidst</a>
<a id='line_116'>      the scandals of the Arian controversy. 10 The fierce contests of</a>
<a id='line_117'>      the Eastern bishops, the incessant alterations of their creeds,</a>
<a id='line_118'>      and the profane motives which appeared to actuate their conduct,</a>
<a id='line_119'>      insensibly strengthened the prejudice of Julian, that they</a>
<a id='line_120'>      neither understood nor believed the religion for which they so</a>
<a id='line_121'>      fiercely contended. Instead of listening to the proofs of</a>
<a id='line_122'>      Christianity with that favorable attention which adds weight to</a>
<a id='line_123'>      the most respectable evidence, he heard with suspicion, and</a>
<a id='line_124'>      disputed with obstinacy and acuteness, the doctrines for which he</a>
<a id='line_125'>      already entertained an invincible aversion. Whenever the young</a>
<a id='line_126'>      princes were directed to compose declamations on the subject of</a>
<a id='line_127'>      the prevailing controversies, Julian always declared himself the</a>
<a id='line_128'>      advocate of Paganism; under the specious excuse that, in the</a>
<a id='line_129'>      defence of the weaker cause, his learning and ingenuity might be</a>
<a id='line_130'>      more advantageously exercised and displayed.</a>

<a id='line_135'>      preceptor, the eunuch Mardonius, and describes his mode of</a>
<a id='line_136'>      education, which inspired his pupil with a passionate admiration</a>

<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>      As soon as Gallus was invested with the honors of the purple,</a>
<a id='line_176'>      Julian was permitted to breathe the air of freedom, of</a>
<a id='line_177'>      literature, and of Paganism. 11 The crowd of sophists, who were</a>
<a id='line_178'>      attracted by the taste and liberality of their royal pupil, had</a>
<a id='line_179'>      formed a strict alliance between the learning and the religion of</a>
<a id='line_180'>      Greece; and the poems of Homer, instead of being admired as the</a>
<a id='line_181'>      original productions of human genius, were seriously ascribed to</a>
<a id='line_182'>      the heavenly inspiration of Apollo and the muses. The deities of</a>
<a id='line_183'>      Olympus, as they are painted by the immortal bard, imprint</a>
<a id='line_184'>      themselves on the minds which are the least addicted to</a>
<a id='line_185'>      superstitious credulity. Our familiar knowledge of their names</a>
<a id='line_186'>      and characters, their forms and attributes, _seems_ to bestow on</a>
<a id='line_187'>      those airy beings a real and substantial existence; and the</a>
<a id='line_188'>      pleasing enchantment produces an imperfect and momentary assent</a>
<a id='line_189'>      of the imagination to those fables, which are the most repugnant</a>
<a id='line_190'>      to our reason and experience. In the age of Julian, every</a>
<a id='line_191'>      circumstance contributed to prolong and fortify the illusion; the</a>
<a id='line_192'>      magnificent temples of Greece and Asia; the works of those</a>
<a id='line_193'>      artists who had expressed, in painting or in sculpture, the</a>
<a id='line_194'>      divine conceptions of the poet; the pomp of festivals and</a>
<a id='line_195'>      sacrifices; the successful arts of divination; the popular</a>
<a id='line_196'>      traditions of oracles and prodigies; and the ancient practice of</a>
<a id='line_197'>      two thousand years. The weakness of polytheism was, in some</a>
<a id='line_198'>      measure, excused by the moderation of its claims; and the</a>
<a id='line_199'>      devotion of the Pagans was not incompatible with the most</a>
<a id='line_200'>      licentious scepticism. 12 Instead of an indivisible and regular</a>
<a id='line_201'>      system, which occupies the whole extent of the believing mind,</a>
<a id='line_202'>      the mythology of the Greeks was composed of a thousand loose and</a>
<a id='line_203'>      flexible parts, and the servant of the gods was at liberty to</a>
<a id='line_204'>      define the degree and measure of his religious faith. The creed</a>
<a id='line_205'>      which Julian adopted for his own use was of the largest</a>
<a id='line_206'>      dimensions; and, by strange contradiction, he disdained the</a>
<a id='line_207'>      salutary yoke of the gospel, whilst he made a voluntary offering</a>
<a id='line_208'>      of his reason on the altars of Jupiter and Apollo. One of the</a>
<a id='line_209'>      orations of Julian is consecrated to the honor of Cybele, the</a>
<a id='line_210'>      mother of the gods, who required from her effeminate priests the</a>
<a id='line_211'>      bloody sacrifice, so rashly performed by the madness of the</a>
<a id='line_212'>      Phrygian boy. The pious emperor condescends to relate, without a</a>
<a id='line_213'>      blush, and without a smile, the voyage of the goddess from the</a>
<a id='line_214'>      shores of Pergamus to the mouth of the Tyber, and the stupendous</a>
<a id='line_215'>      miracle, which convinced the senate and people of Rome that the</a>
<a id='line_216'>      lump of clay, which their ambassadors had transported over the</a>
<a id='line_217'>      seas, was endowed with life, and sentiment, and divine power. 13</a>
<a id='line_218'>      For the truth of this prodigy he appeals to the public monuments</a>
<a id='line_219'>      of the city; and censures, with some acrimony, the sickly and</a>

<a id='line_254'>      diligently explore the occult wisdom, which had been disguised,</a>
<a id='line_255'>      by the prudence of antiquity, under the mask of folly and of</a>
<a id='line_256'>      fable. 15 The philosophers of the Platonic school, 16 Plotinus,</a>
<a id='line_257'>      Porphyry, and the divine Iamblichus, were admired as the most</a>
<a id='line_258'>      skilful masters of this allegorical science, which labored to</a>
<a id='line_259'>      soften and harmonize the deformed features of Paganism. Julian</a>
<a id='line_260'>      himself, who was directed in the mysterious pursuit by ®desius,</a>
<a id='line_261'>      the venerable successor of Iamblichus, aspired to the possession</a>
<a id='line_262'>      of a treasure, which he esteemed, if we may credit his solemn</a>
<a id='line_263'>      asseverations, far above the empire of the world. 17 It was</a>
<a id='line_264'>      indeed a treasure, which derived its value only from opinion; and</a>
<a id='line_265'>      every artist who flattered himself that he had extracted the</a>
<a id='line_266'>      precious ore from the surrounding dross, claimed an equal right</a>
<a id='line_267'>      of stamping the name and figure the most agreeable to his</a>
<a id='line_268'>      peculiar fancy. The fable of Atys and Cybele had been already</a>
<a id='line_269'>      explained by Porphyry; but his labors served only to animate the</a>
<a id='line_270'>      pious industry of Julian, who invented and published his own</a>
<a id='line_271'>      allegory of that ancient and mystic tale. This freedom of</a>
<a id='line_272'>      interpretation, which might gratify the pride of the Platonists,</a>
<a id='line_273'>      exposed the vanity of their art. Without a tedious detail, the</a>
<a id='line_274'>      modern reader could not form a just idea of the strange</a>
<a id='line_275'>      allusions, the forced etymologies, the solemn trifling, and the</a>
<a id='line_276'>      impenetrable obscurity of these sages, who professed to reveal</a>
<a id='line_277'>      the system of the universe. As the traditions of Pagan mythology</a>
<a id='line_278'>      were variously related, the sacred interpreters were at liberty</a>
<a id='line_279'>      to select the most convenient circumstances; and as they</a>
<a id='line_280'>      translated an arbitrary cipher, they could extract from _any_</a>
<a id='line_281'>      fable _any_ sense which was adapted to their favorite system of</a>
<a id='line_282'>      religion and philosophy. The lascivious form of a naked Venus was</a>
<a id='line_283'>      tortured into the discovery of some moral precept, or some</a>
<a id='line_284'>      physical truth; and the castration of Atys explained the</a>
<a id='line_285'>      revolution of the sun between the tropics, or the separation of</a>

<a id='line_311'>      The theological system of Julian appears to have contained the</a>

<a id='line_314'>      of any firm assurance, the disciple of Plato imprudently relapsed</a>

<a id='line_316'>      philosophic notion of the Deity seems to have been confounded in</a>

<a id='line_318'>      The pious emperor acknowledged and adored the Eternal Cause of</a>
<a id='line_319'>      the universe, to whom he ascribed all the perfections of an</a>
<a id='line_320'>      infinite nature, invisible to the eyes and inaccessible to the</a>
<a id='line_321'>      understanding, of feeble mortals. The Supreme God had created, or</a>
<a id='line_322'>      rather, in the Platonic language, had generated, the gradual</a>
<a id='line_323'>      succession of dependent spirits, of gods, of d¾mons, of heroes,</a>
<a id='line_324'>      and of men; and every being which derived its existence</a>
<a id='line_325'>      immediately from the First Cause, received the inherent gift of</a>
<a id='line_326'>      immortality. That so precious an advantage might not be lavished</a>
<a id='line_327'>      upon unworthy objects, the Creator had intrusted to the skill and</a>
<a id='line_328'>      power of the inferior gods the office of forming the human body,</a>
<a id='line_329'>      and of arranging the beautiful harmony of the animal, the</a>
<a id='line_330'>      vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms. To the conduct of these</a>
<a id='line_331'>      divine ministers he delegated the temporal government of this</a>
<a id='line_332'>      lower world; but their imperfect administration is not exempt</a>
<a id='line_333'>      from discord or error. The earth and its inhabitants are divided</a>
<a id='line_334'>      among them, and the characters of Mars or Minerva, of Mercury or</a>
<a id='line_335'>      Venus, may be distinctly traced in the laws and manners of their</a>
<a id='line_336'>      peculiar votaries. As long as our immortal souls are confined in</a>
<a id='line_337'>      a mortal prison, it is our interest, as well as our duty, to</a>
<a id='line_338'>      solicit the favor, and to deprecate the wrath, of the powers of</a>
<a id='line_339'>      heaven; whose pride is gratified by the devotion of mankind; and</a>
<a id='line_340'>      whose grosser parts may be supposed to derive some nourishment</a>
<a id='line_341'>      from the fumes of sacrifice. 20 The inferior gods might sometimes</a>
<a id='line_342'>      condescend to animate the statues, and to inhabit the temples,</a>
<a id='line_343'>      which were dedicated to their honor. They might occasionally</a>
<a id='line_344'>      visit the earth, but the heavens were the proper throne and</a>
<a id='line_345'>      symbol of their glory. The invariable order of the sun, moon, and</a>
<a id='line_346'>      stars, was hastily admitted by Julian, as a proof of their</a>
<a id='line_347'>      _eternal_ duration; and their eternity was a sufficient evidence</a>
<a id='line_348'>      that they were the workmanship, not of an inferior deity, but of</a>
<a id='line_349'>      the Omnipotent King. In the system of Platonists, the visible was</a>
<a id='line_350'>      a type of the invisible world. The celestial bodies, as they were</a>
<a id='line_351'>      informed by a divine spirit, might be considered as the objects</a>
<a id='line_352'>      the most worthy of religious worship. The Sun, whose genial</a>

<a id='line_405'>      most important consequences. 23 Julian imbibed the first</a>

<a id='line_410'>      two of his most learned disciples, Chrysanthes and Eusebius,</a>
<a id='line_411'>      supplied, at his own desire, the place of their aged master.</a>
<a id='line_412'>      These philosophers seem to have prepared and distributed their</a>
<a id='line_413'>      respective parts; and they artfully contrived, by dark hints and</a>
<a id='line_414'>      affected disputes, to excite the impatient hopes of the</a>
<a id='line_415'>      _aspirant_, till they delivered him into the hands of their</a>
<a id='line_416'>      associate, Maximus, the boldest and most skilful master of the</a>
<a id='line_417'>      Theurgic science. By his hands, Julian was secretly initiated at</a>
<a id='line_418'>      Ephesus, in the twentieth year of his age. His residence at</a>
<a id='line_419'>      Athens confirmed this unnatural alliance of philosophy and</a>
<a id='line_420'>      superstition.</a>
<a id='line_421'></a>
<a id='line_422'>      He obtained the privilege of a solemn initiation into the</a>
<a id='line_423'>      mysteries of Eleusis, which, amidst the general decay of the</a>
<a id='line_424'>      Grecian worship, still retained some vestiges of their prim¾val</a>
<a id='line_425'>      sanctity; and such was the zeal of Julian, that he afterwards</a>
<a id='line_426'>      invited the Eleusinian pontiff to the court of Gaul, for the sole</a>
<a id='line_427'>      purpose of consummating, by mystic rites and sacrifices, the</a>
<a id='line_428'>      great work of his sanctification. As these ceremonies were</a>
<a id='line_429'>      performed in the depth of caverns, and in the silence of the</a>
<a id='line_430'>      night, and as the inviolable secret of the mysteries was</a>
<a id='line_431'>      preserved by the discretion of the initiated, I shall not presume</a>
<a id='line_432'>      to describe the horrid sounds, and fiery apparitions, which were</a>
<a id='line_433'>      presented to the senses, or the imagination, of the credulous</a>
<a id='line_434'>      aspirant, 24 till the visions of comfort and knowledge broke upon</a>
<a id='line_435'>      him in a blaze of celestial light. 25 In the caverns of Ephesus</a>
<a id='line_436'>      and Eleusis, the mind of Julian was penetrated with sincere,</a>
<a id='line_437'>      deep, and unalterable enthusiasm; though he might sometimes</a>
<a id='line_438'>      exhibit the vicissitudes of pious fraud and hypocrisy, which may</a>
<a id='line_439'>      be observed, or at least suspected, in the characters of the most</a>
<a id='line_440'>      conscientious fanatics. From that moment he consecrated his life</a>
<a id='line_441'>      to the service of the gods; and while the occupations of war, of</a>
<a id='line_442'>      government, and of study, seemed to claim the whole measure of</a>
<a id='line_443'>      his time, a stated portion of the hours of the night was</a>
<a id='line_444'>      invariably reserved for the exercise of private devotion. The</a>
<a id='line_445'>      temperance which adorned the severe manners of the soldier and</a>
<a id='line_446'>      the philosopher was connected with some strict and frivolous</a>
<a id='line_447'>      rules of religious abstinence; and it was in honor of Pan or</a>
<a id='line_448'>      Mercury, of Hecate or Isis, that Julian, on particular days,</a>
<a id='line_449'>      denied himself the use of some particular food, which might have</a>
<a id='line_450'>      been offensive to his tutelar deities. By these voluntary fasts,</a>
<a id='line_451'>      he prepared his senses and his understanding for the frequent and</a>
<a id='line_452'>      familiar visits with which he was honored by the celestial</a>
<a id='line_453'>      powers. Notwithstanding the modest silence of Julian himself, we</a>
<a id='line_454'>      may learn from his faithful friend, the orator Libanius, that he</a>
<a id='line_455'>      lived in a perpetual intercourse with the gods and goddesses;</a>
<a id='line_456'>      that they descended upon earth to enjoy the conversation of their</a>
<a id='line_457'>      favorite hero; that they gently interrupted his slumbers by</a>
<a id='line_458'>      touching his hand or his hair; that they warned him of every</a>
<a id='line_459'>      impending danger, and conducted him, by their infallible wisdom,</a>
<a id='line_460'>      in every action of his life; and that he had acquired such an</a>
<a id='line_461'>      intimate knowledge of his heavenly guests, as readily to</a>
<a id='line_462'>      distinguish the voice of Jupiter from that of Minerva, and the</a>
<a id='line_463'>      form of Apollo from the figure of Hercules. 26 These sleeping or</a>
<a id='line_464'>      waking visions, the ordinary effects of abstinence and</a>
<a id='line_465'>      fanaticism, would almost degrade the emperor to the level of an</a>
<a id='line_466'>      Egyptian monk. But the useless lives of Antony or Pachomius were</a>
<a id='line_467'>      consumed in these vain occupations. Julian could break from the</a>
<a id='line_468'>      dream of superstition to arm himself for battle; and after</a>
<a id='line_469'>      vanquishing in the field the enemies of Rome, he calmly retired</a>
<a id='line_470'>      into his tent, to dictate the wise and salutary laws of an</a>

<a id='line_510'>      with a hostile eye by the successor of Constantine, whose</a>
<a id='line_511'>      capricious passions altercately saved and threatened the life of</a>
<a id='line_512'>      Julian. The arts of magic and divination were strictly prohibited</a>
<a id='line_513'>      under a despotic government, which condescended to fear them; and</a>
<a id='line_514'>      if the Pagans were reluctantly indulged in the exercise of their</a>
<a id='line_515'>      superstition, the rank of Julian would have excepted him from the</a>
<a id='line_516'>      general toleration. The apostate soon became the presumptive heir</a>
<a id='line_517'>      of the monarchy, and his death could alone have appeased the just</a>
<a id='line_518'>      apprehensions of the Christians. 28 But the young prince, who</a>
<a id='line_519'>      aspired to the glory of a hero rather than of a martyr, consulted</a>
<a id='line_520'>      his safety by dissembling his religion; and the easy temper of</a>
<a id='line_521'>      polytheism permitted him to join in the public worship of a sect</a>
<a id='line_522'>      which he inwardly despised. Libanius has considered the hypocrisy</a>
<a id='line_523'>      of his friend as a subject, not of censure, but of praise. ÒAs</a>
<a id='line_524'>      the statues of the gods,Ó says that orator, Òwhich have been</a>
<a id='line_525'>      defiled with filth, are again placed in a magnificent temple, so</a>
<a id='line_526'>      the beauty of truth was seated in the mind of Julian, after it</a>
<a id='line_527'>      had been purified from the errors and follies of his education.</a>
<a id='line_528'>      His sentiments were changed; but as it would have been dangerous</a>
<a id='line_529'>      to have avowed his sentiments, his conduct still continued the</a>
<a id='line_530'>      same. Very different from the ass in ®sop, who disguised himself</a>
<a id='line_531'>      with a lionÕs hide, our lion was obliged to conceal himself under</a>
<a id='line_532'>      the skin of an ass; and, while he embraced the dictates of</a>
<a id='line_533'>      reason, to obey the laws of prudence and necessity.Ó 29 The</a>
<a id='line_534'>      dissimulation of Julian lasted about ten years, from his secret</a>
<a id='line_535'>      initiation at Ephesus to the beginning of the civil war; when he</a>
<a id='line_536'>      declared himself at once the implacable enemy of Christ and of</a>
<a id='line_537'>      Constantius. This state of constraint might contribute to</a>
<a id='line_538'>      strengthen his devotion; and as soon as he had satisfied the</a>
<a id='line_539'>      obligation of assisting, on solemn festivals, at the assemblies</a>
<a id='line_540'>      of the Christians, Julian returned, with the impatience of a</a>
<a id='line_541'>      lover, to burn his free and voluntary incense on the domestic</a>
<a id='line_542'>      chapels of Jupiter and Mercury. But as every act of dissimulation</a>
<a id='line_543'>      must be painful to an ingenuous spirit, the profession of</a>
<a id='line_544'>      Christianity increased the aversion of Julian for a religion</a>
<a id='line_545'>      which oppressed the freedom of his mind, and compelled him to</a>
<a id='line_546'>      hold a conduct repugnant to the noblest attributes of human</a>

<a id='line_619'></a>
<a id='line_620'>      The Christians, who beheld with horror and indignation the</a>
<a id='line_621'>      apostasy of Julian, had much more to fear from his power than</a>
<a id='line_622'>      from his arguments. The pagans, who were conscious of his fervent</a>
<a id='line_623'>      zeal, expected, perhaps with impatience, that the flames of</a>
<a id='line_624'>      persecution should be immediately kindled against the enemies of</a>

<a id='line_627'>      unknown to the rude and inexperienced fury of his predecessors.</a>
<a id='line_628'>      But the hopes, as well as the fears, of the religious factions</a>
<a id='line_629'>      were apparently disappointed, by the prudent humanity of a</a>
<a id='line_630'>      prince, 33 who was careful of his own fame, of the public peace,</a>
<a id='line_631'>      and of the rights of mankind. Instructed by history and</a>
<a id='line_632'>      reflection, Julian was persuaded, that if the diseases of the</a>
<a id='line_633'>      body may sometimes be cured by salutary violence, neither steel</a>
<a id='line_634'>      nor fire can eradicate the erroneous opinions of the mind. The</a>
<a id='line_635'>      reluctant victim may be dragged to the foot of the altar; but the</a>
<a id='line_636'>      heart still abhors and disclaims the sacrilegious act of the</a>
<a id='line_637'>      hand. Religious obstinacy is hardened and exasperated by</a>
<a id='line_638'>      oppression; and, as soon as the persecution subsides, those who</a>
<a id='line_639'>      have yielded are restored as penitents, and those who have</a>
<a id='line_640'>      resisted are honored as saints and martyrs. If Julian adopted the</a>
<a id='line_641'>      unsuccessful cruelty of Diocletian and his colleagues, he was</a>
<a id='line_642'>      sensible that he should stain his memory with the name of a</a>
<a id='line_643'>      tyrant, and add new glories to the Catholic church, which had</a>
<a id='line_644'>      derived strength and increase from the severity of the pagan</a>
<a id='line_645'>      magistrates. Actuated by these motives, and apprehensive of</a>
<a id='line_646'>      disturbing the repose of an unsettled reign, Julian surprised the</a>
<a id='line_647'>      world by an edict, which was not unworthy of a statesman, or a</a>
<a id='line_648'>      philosopher. He extended to all the inhabitants of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_649'>      world the benefits of a free and equal toleration; and the only</a>
<a id='line_650'>      hardship which he inflicted on the Christians, was to deprive</a>
<a id='line_651'>      them of the power of tormenting their fellow-subjects, whom they</a>
<a id='line_652'>      stigmatized with the odious titles of idolaters and heretics. The</a>
<a id='line_653'>      pagans received a gracious permission, or rather an express</a>
<a id='line_654'>      order, to open All their temples; 34 and they were at once</a>
<a id='line_655'>      delivered from the oppressive laws, and arbitrary vexations,</a>
<a id='line_656'>      which they had sustained under the reign of Constantine, and of</a>
<a id='line_657'>      his sons. At the same time the bishops and clergy, who had been</a>
<a id='line_658'>      banished by the Arian monarch, were recalled from exile, and</a>
<a id='line_659'>      restored to their respective churches; the Donatists, the</a>
<a id='line_660'>      Novatians, the Macedonians, the Eunomians, and those who, with a</a>
<a id='line_661'>      more prosperous fortune, adhered to the doctrine of the Council</a>
<a id='line_662'>      of Nice. Julian, who understood and derided their theological</a>
<a id='line_663'>      disputes, invited to the palace the leaders of the hostile sects,</a>
<a id='line_664'>      that he might enjoy the agreeable spectacle of their furious</a>
<a id='line_665'>      encounters. The clamor of controversy sometimes provoked the</a>
<a id='line_666'>      emperor to exclaim, ÒHear me! the Franks have heard me, and the</a>
<a id='line_667'>      Alemanni;Ó but he soon discovered that he was now engaged with</a>
<a id='line_668'>      more obstinate and implacable enemies; and though he exerted the</a>
<a id='line_669'>      powers of oratory to persuade them to live in concord, or at</a>
<a id='line_670'>      least in peace, he was perfectly satisfied, before he dismissed</a>
<a id='line_671'>      them from his presence, that he had nothing to dread from the</a>
<a id='line_672'>      union of the Christians. The impartial Ammianus has ascribed this</a>
<a id='line_673'>      affected clemency to the desire of fomenting the intestine</a>
<a id='line_674'>      divisions of the church, and the insidious design of undermining</a>
<a id='line_675'>      the foundations of Christianity, was inseparably connected with</a>
<a id='line_676'>      the zeal which Julian professed, to restore the ancient religion</a>

<a id='line_731'>      superstition, which affected to despise the restraints of</a>
<a id='line_732'>      prudence and decency. Under the reign of a prince, who practised</a>
<a id='line_733'>      the rigid maxims of economy, the expense of religious worship</a>
<a id='line_734'>      consumed a very large portion of the revenue; a constant supply</a>

<a id='line_763'>      facts; but the different lights in which they view the extreme</a>
<a id='line_764'>      devotion of Julian, are expressive of the gradations of</a>
<a id='line_765'>      self-applause, passionate admiration, mild reproof, and partial</a>
<a id='line_766'>      invective.]</a>
<a id='line_767'></a>
<a id='line_768'>      But the genius and power of Julian were unequal to the enterprise</a>
<a id='line_769'>      of restoring a religion which was destitute of theological</a>
<a id='line_770'>      principles, of moral precepts, and of ecclesiastical discipline;</a>
<a id='line_771'>      which rapidly hastened to decay and dissolution, and was not</a>
<a id='line_772'>      susceptible of any solid or consistent reformation. The</a>
<a id='line_773'>      jurisdiction of the supreme pontiff, more especially after that</a>
<a id='line_774'>      office had been united with the Imperial dignity, comprehended</a>
<a id='line_775'>      the whole extent of the Roman empire. Julian named for his</a>
<a id='line_776'>      vicars, in the several provinces, the priests and philosophers</a>
<a id='line_777'>      whom he esteemed the best qualified to cooperate in the execution</a>
<a id='line_778'>      of his great design; and his pastoral letters, 37 if we may use</a>
<a id='line_779'>      that name, still represent a very curious sketch of his wishes</a>
<a id='line_780'>      and intentions. He directs, that in every city the sacerdotal</a>
<a id='line_781'>      order should be composed, without any distinction of birth and</a>
<a id='line_782'>      fortune, of those persons who were the most conspicuous for the</a>
<a id='line_783'>      love of the gods, and of men. ÒIf they are guilty,Ó continues he,</a>
<a id='line_784'>      Òof any scandalous offence, they should be censured or degraded</a>
<a id='line_785'>      by the superior pontiff; but as long as they retain their rank,</a>
<a id='line_786'>      they are entitled to the respect of the magistrates and people.</a>
<a id='line_787'>      Their humility may be shown in the plainness of their domestic</a>
<a id='line_788'>      garb; their dignity, in the pomp of holy vestments. When they are</a>
<a id='line_789'>      summoned in their turn to officiate before the altar, they ought</a>
<a id='line_790'>      not, during the appointed number of days, to depart from the</a>
<a id='line_791'>      precincts of the temple; nor should a single day be suffered to</a>
<a id='line_792'>      elapse, without the prayers and the sacrifice, which they are</a>
<a id='line_793'>      obliged to offer for the prosperity of the state, and of</a>
<a id='line_794'>      individuals. The exercise of their sacred functions requires an</a>
<a id='line_795'>      immaculate purity, both of mind and body; and even when they are</a>
<a id='line_796'>      dismissed from the temple to the occupations of common life, it</a>
<a id='line_797'>      is incumbent on them to excel in decency and virtue the rest of</a>
<a id='line_798'>      their fellow-citizens. The priest of the gods should never be</a>
<a id='line_799'>      seen in theatres or taverns. His conversation should be chaste,</a>
<a id='line_800'>      his diet temperate, his friends of honorable reputation; and if</a>
<a id='line_801'>      he sometimes visits the Forum or the Palace, he should appear</a>
<a id='line_802'>      only as the advocate of those who have vainly solicited either</a>
<a id='line_803'>      justice or mercy. His studies should be suited to the sanctity of</a>
<a id='line_804'>      his profession. Licentious tales, or comedies, or satires, must</a>
<a id='line_805'>      be banished from his library, which ought solely to consist of</a>
<a id='line_806'>      historical or philosophical writings; of history, which is</a>
<a id='line_807'>      founded in truth, and of philosophy, which is connected with</a>
<a id='line_808'>      religion. The impious opinions of the Epicureans and sceptics</a>
<a id='line_809'>      deserve his abhorrence and contempt; 38 but he should diligently</a>
<a id='line_810'>      study the systems of Pythagoras, of Plato, and of the Stoics,</a>
<a id='line_811'>      which unanimously teach that there _are_ gods; that the world is</a>
<a id='line_812'>      governed by their providence; that their goodness is the source</a>
<a id='line_813'>      of every temporal blessing; and that they have prepared for the</a>
<a id='line_814'>      human soul a future state of reward or punishment.Ó The Imperial</a>
<a id='line_815'>      pontiff inculcates, in the most persuasive language, the duties</a>
<a id='line_816'>      of benevolence and hospitality; exhorts his inferior clergy to</a>
<a id='line_817'>      recommend the universal practice of those virtues; promises to</a>
<a id='line_818'>      assist their indigence from the public treasury; and declares his</a>
<a id='line_819'>      resolution of establishing hospitals in every city, where the</a>
<a id='line_820'>      poor should be received without any invidious distinction of</a>
<a id='line_821'>      country or of religion. Julian beheld with envy the wise and</a>
<a id='line_822'>      humane regulations of the church; and he very frankly confesses</a>
<a id='line_823'>      his intention to deprive the Christians of the applause, as well</a>
<a id='line_824'>      as advantage, which they had acquired by the exclusive practice</a>
<a id='line_825'>      of charity and beneficence. 39 The same spirit of imitation might</a>
<a id='line_826'>      dispose the emperor to adopt several ecclesiastical institutions,</a>
<a id='line_827'>      the use and importance of which were approved by the success of</a>
<a id='line_828'>      his enemies. But if these imaginary plans of reformation had been</a>
<a id='line_829'>      realized, the forced and imperfect copy would have been less</a>
<a id='line_830'>      beneficial to Paganism, than honorable to Christianity. 40 The</a>
<a id='line_831'>      Gentiles, who peaceably followed the customs of their ancestors,</a>
<a id='line_832'>      were rather surprised than pleased with the introduction of</a>
<a id='line_833'>      foreign manners; and in the short period of his reign, Julian had</a>
<a id='line_834'>      frequent occasions to complain of the want of fervor of his own</a>

<a id='line_867'></a>
<a id='line_868'>      The enthusiasm of Julian prompted him to embrace the friends of</a>

<a id='line_873'>      they cultivated the literature, as well as the religion, of the</a>
<a id='line_874'>      Greeks, they acquired an additional claim to the friendship of</a>
<a id='line_875'>      Julian, who ranked the Muses in the number of his tutelar</a>
<a id='line_876'>      deities. In the religion which he had adopted, piety and learning</a>
<a id='line_877'>      were almost synonymous; 43 and a crowd of poets, of rhetoricians,</a>
<a id='line_878'>      and of philosophers, hastened to the Imperial court, to occupy</a>
<a id='line_879'>      the vacant places of the bishops, who had seduced the credulity</a>
<a id='line_880'>      of Constantius. His successor esteemed the ties of common</a>
<a id='line_881'>      initiation as far more sacred than those of consanguinity; he</a>
<a id='line_882'>      chose his favorites among the sages, who were deeply skilled in</a>
<a id='line_883'>      the occult sciences of magic and divination; and every impostor,</a>
<a id='line_884'>      who pretended to reveal the secrets of futurity, was assured of</a>
<a id='line_885'>      enjoying the present hour in honor and affluence. 44 Among the</a>
<a id='line_886'>      philosophers, Maximus obtained the most eminent rank in the</a>
<a id='line_887'>      friendship of his royal disciple, who communicated, with</a>
<a id='line_888'>      unreserved confidence, his actions, his sentiments, and his</a>
<a id='line_889'>      religious designs, during the anxious suspense of the civil war.</a>
<a id='line_890'>      45 As soon as Julian had taken possession of the palace of</a>
<a id='line_891'>      Constantinople, he despatched an honorable and pressing</a>
<a id='line_892'>      invitation to Maximus, who then resided at Sardes in Lydia, with</a>
<a id='line_893'>      Chrysanthius, the associate of his art and studies. The prudent</a>
<a id='line_894'>      and superstitious Chrysanthius refused to undertake a journey</a>
<a id='line_895'>      which showed itself, according to the rules of divination, with</a>
<a id='line_896'>      the most threatening and malignant aspect: but his companion,</a>
<a id='line_897'>      whose fanaticism was of a bolder cast, persisted in his</a>
<a id='line_898'>      interrogations, till he had extorted from the gods a seeming</a>
<a id='line_899'>      consent to his own wishes, and those of the emperor. The journey</a>
<a id='line_900'>      of Maximus through the cities of Asia displayed the triumph of</a>
<a id='line_901'>      philosophic vanity; and the magistrates vied with each other in</a>
<a id='line_902'>      the honorable reception which they prepared for the friend of</a>
<a id='line_903'>      their sovereign. Julian was pronouncing an oration before the</a>
<a id='line_904'>      senate, when he was informed of the arrival of Maximus. The</a>
<a id='line_905'>      emperor immediately interrupted his discourse, advanced to meet</a>
<a id='line_906'>      him, and after a tender embrace, conducted him by the hand into</a>
<a id='line_907'>      the midst of the assembly; where he publicly acknowledged the</a>
<a id='line_908'>      benefits which he had derived from the instructions of the</a>
<a id='line_909'>      philosopher. Maximus, 46 who soon acquired the confidence, and</a>
<a id='line_910'>      influenced the councils of Julian, was insensibly corrupted by</a>
<a id='line_911'>      the temptations of a court. His dress became more splendid, his</a>
<a id='line_912'>      demeanor more lofty, and he was exposed, under a succeeding</a>
<a id='line_913'>      reign, to a disgraceful inquiry into the means by which the</a>
<a id='line_914'>      disciple of Plato had accumulated, in the short duration of his</a>
<a id='line_915'>      favor, a very scandalous proportion of wealth. Of the other</a>
<a id='line_916'>      philosophers and sophists, who were invited to the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_917'>      residence by the choice of Julian, or by the success of Maximus,</a>
<a id='line_918'>      few were able to preserve their innocence or their reputation.</a>
<a id='line_919'>      The liberal gifts of money, lands, and houses, were insufficient</a>
<a id='line_920'>      to satiate their rapacious avarice; and the indignation of the</a>
<a id='line_921'>      people was justly excited by the remembrance of their abject</a>
<a id='line_922'>      poverty and disinterested professions. The penetration of Julian</a>
<a id='line_923'>      could not always be deceived: but he was unwilling to despise the</a>
<a id='line_924'>      characters of those men whose talents deserved his esteem: he</a>
<a id='line_925'>      desired to escape the double reproach of imprudence and</a>

<a id='line_1004'>      the merit, of the troops. His throne of state was encircled with</a>
<a id='line_1005'>      the military ensigns of Rome and the republic; the holy name of</a>
<a id='line_1006'>      Christ was erased from the _Labarum;_ and the symbols of war, of</a>

<a id='line_1504'>      Jud. l. vii. c. 2. It is probable that the greater part of these</a>
<a id='line_1505'>      excavations were the remains of the time of Solomon, when it was</a>
<a id='line_1506'>      the custom to work to a great extent under ground: no other date</a>
<a id='line_1507'>      can be assigned to them. The Jews, on their return from the</a>
<a id='line_1508'>      captivity, were too poor to undertake such works; and, although</a>
<a id='line_1509'>      Herod, on rebuilding the Temple, made some excavations, (Joseph.</a>
<a id='line_1510'>      Ant. Jud. xv. 11, vii.,) the haste with which that building was</a>
<a id='line_1511'>      completed will not allow us to suppose that they belonged to that</a>
<a id='line_1512'>      period. Some were used for sewers and drains, others served to</a>
<a id='line_1513'>      conceal the immense treasures of which Crassus, a hundred and</a>
<a id='line_1514'>      twenty years before, plundered the Jews, and which doubtless had</a>
<a id='line_1515'>      been since replaced. The Temple was destroyed A. C. 70; the</a>
<a id='line_1516'>      attempt of Julian to rebuild it, and the fact related by</a>
<a id='line_1517'>      Ammianus, coincide with the year 363. There had then elapsed</a>
<a id='line_1518'>      between these two epochs an interval of near 300 years, during</a>
<a id='line_1519'>      which the excavations, choked up with ruins, must have become</a>
<a id='line_1520'>      full of inflammable air. The workmen employed by Julian as they</a>
<a id='line_1521'>      were digging, arrived at the excavations of the Temple; they</a>
<a id='line_1522'>      would take torches to explore them; sudden flames repelled those</a>
<a id='line_1523'>      who approached; explosions were heard, and these phenomena were</a>
<a id='line_1524'>      renewed every time that they penetrated into new subterranean</a>
<a id='line_1525'>      passages. This explanation is confirmed by the relation of an</a>
<a id='line_1526'>      event nearly similar, by Josephus. King Herod having heard that</a>
<a id='line_1527'>      immense treasures had been concealed in the sepulchre of David,</a>
<a id='line_1528'>      he descended into it with a few confidential persons; he found in</a>
<a id='line_1529'>      the first subterranean chamber only jewels and precious stuffs:</a>
<a id='line_1530'>      but having wished to penetrate into a second chamber, which had</a>
<a id='line_1531'>      been long closed, he was repelled, when he opened it, by flames</a>
<a id='line_1532'>      which killed those who accompanied him. (Ant. Jud. xvi. 7, i.) As</a>
<a id='line_1533'>      here there is no room for miracle, this fact may be considered as</a>
<a id='line_1534'>      a new proof of the veracity of that related by Ammianus and the</a>

<a id='line_1565'>      The restoration of the Jewish temple was secretly connected with</a>
<a id='line_1566'>      the ruin of the Christian church. Julian still continued to</a>
<a id='line_1567'>      maintain the freedom of religious worship, without distinguishing</a>
<a id='line_1568'>      whether this universal toleration proceeded from his justice or</a>
<a id='line_1569'>      his clemency. He affected to pity the unhappy Christians, who</a>
<a id='line_1570'>      were mistaken in the most important object of their lives; but</a>
<a id='line_1571'>      his pity was degraded by contempt, his contempt was embittered by</a>
<a id='line_1572'>      hatred; and the sentiments of Julian were expressed in a style of</a>
<a id='line_1573'>      sarcastic wit, which inflicts a deep and deadly wound, whenever</a>
<a id='line_1574'>      it issues from the mouth of a sovereign. As he was sensible that</a>
<a id='line_1575'>      the Christians gloried in the name of their Redeemer, he</a>
<a id='line_1576'>      countenanced, and perhaps enjoined, the use of the less honorable</a>
<a id='line_1577'>      appellation of Galil¾ans. 85 He declared, that by the folly of</a>
<a id='line_1578'>      the Galil¾ans, whom he describes as a sect of fanatics,</a>
<a id='line_1579'>      contemptible to men, and odious to the gods, the empire had been</a>
<a id='line_1580'>      reduced to the brink of destruction; and he insinuates in a</a>
<a id='line_1581'>      public edict, that a frantic patient might sometimes be cured by</a>
<a id='line_1582'>      salutary violence. 86 An ungenerous distinction was admitted into</a>
<a id='line_1583'>      the mind and counsels of Julian, that, according to the</a>
<a id='line_1584'>      difference of their religious sentiments, one part of his</a>
<a id='line_1585'>      subjects deserved his favor and friendship, while the other was</a>
<a id='line_1586'>      entitled only to the common benefits that his justice could not</a>
<a id='line_1587'>      refuse to an obedient people. According to a principle, pregnant</a>
<a id='line_1588'>      with mischief and oppression, the emperor transferred to the</a>
<a id='line_1589'>      pontiffs of his own religion the management of the liberal</a>
<a id='line_1590'>      allowances from the public revenue, which had been granted to the</a>
<a id='line_1591'>      church by the piety of Constantine and his sons. The proud system</a>
<a id='line_1592'>      of clerical honors and immunities, which had been constructed</a>
<a id='line_1593'>      with so much art and labor, was levelled to the ground; the hopes</a>
<a id='line_1594'>      of testamentary donations were intercepted by the rigor of the</a>
<a id='line_1595'>      laws; and the priests of the Christian sect were confounded with</a>
<a id='line_1596'>      the last and most ignominious class of the people. Such of these</a>
<a id='line_1597'>      regulations as appeared necessary to check the ambition and</a>
<a id='line_1598'>      avarice of the ecclesiastics, were soon afterwards imitated by</a>

<a id='line_1750'>      clearly defined, and easily restored. But on these lands, and on</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      the ruins of Pagan superstition, the Christians had frequently</a>
<a id='line_1752'>      erected their own religious edifices: and as it was necessary to</a>
<a id='line_1753'>      remove the church before the temple could be rebuilt, the justice</a>
<a id='line_1754'>      and piety of the emperor were applauded by one party, while the</a>
<a id='line_1755'>      other deplored and execrated his sacrilegious violence. 97 After</a>
<a id='line_1756'>      the ground was cleared, the restitution of those stately</a>
<a id='line_1757'>      structures which had been levelled with the dust, and of the</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      precious ornaments which had been converted to Christian uses,</a>
<a id='line_1759'>      swelled into a very large account of damages and debt. The</a>
<a id='line_1760'>      authors of the injury had neither the ability nor the inclination</a>
<a id='line_1761'>      to discharge this accumulated demand: and the impartial wisdom of</a>
<a id='line_1762'>      a legislator would have been displayed in balancing the adverse</a>

<a id='line_1764'></a>
<a id='line_1765'>      But the whole empire, and particularly the East, was thrown into</a>
<a id='line_1766'>      confusion by the rash edicts of Julian; and the Pagan</a>

<a id='line_1768'>      privilege of the Roman law, which substitutes, in the place of</a>

<a id='line_1770'>      Under the preceding reign, Mark, bishop of Arethusa, 98 had</a>
<a id='line_1771'>      labored in the conversion of his people with arms more effectual</a>

<a id='line_1773'>      value of a temple which had been destroyed by his intolerant</a>
<a id='line_1774'>      zeal: but as they were satisfied of his poverty, they desired</a>
<a id='line_1775'>      only to bend his inflexible spirit to the promise of the</a>
<a id='line_1776'>      slightest compensation. They apprehended the aged prelate, they</a>
<a id='line_1777'>      inhumanly scourged him, they tore his beard; and his naked body,</a>
<a id='line_1778'>      annointed with honey, was suspended, in a net, between heaven and</a>
<a id='line_1779'>      earth, and exposed to the stings of insects and the rays of a</a>
<a id='line_1780'>      Syrian sun. 100 From this lofty station, Mark still persisted to</a>
<a id='line_1781'>      glory in his crime, and to insult the impotent rage of his</a>
<a id='line_1782'>      persecutors. He was at length rescued from their hands, and</a>
<a id='line_1783'>      dismissed to enjoy the honor of his divine triumph. The Arians</a>

<a id='line_1785'>      ambitiously claimed his alliance; 101 and the Pagans, who might</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      be susceptible of shame or remorse, were deterred from the</a>
<a id='line_1787'>      repetition of such unavailing cruelty. 102 Julian spared his</a>

<a id='line_1842'>      filled the capacious sanctuary, which was enriched with gold and</a>

<a id='line_1849'>      of the Peneus to those of the Orontes. The ancient rites of</a>
<a id='line_1850'>      Greece were imitated by the royal colony of Antioch. A stream of</a>
<a id='line_1851'>      prophecy, which rivalled the truth and reputation of the Delphic</a>

<a id='line_1854'>      107 which had been purchased from Elis; the Olympic games were</a>
<a id='line_1855'>      celebrated at the expense of the city; and a revenue of thirty</a>
<a id='line_1856'>      thousand pounds sterling was annually applied to the public</a>
<a id='line_1857'>      pleasures. 108 The perpetual resort of pilgrims and spectators</a>
<a id='line_1858'>      insensibly formed, in the neighborhood of the temple, the stately</a>
<a id='line_1859'>      and populous village of Daphne, which emulated the splendor,</a>
<a id='line_1860'>      without acquiring the title, of a provincial city. The temple and</a>
<a id='line_1861'>      the village were deeply bosomed in a thick grove of laurels and</a>
<a id='line_1862'>      cypresses, which reached as far as a circumference of ten miles,</a>
<a id='line_1863'>      and formed in the most sultry summers a cool and impenetrable</a>
<a id='line_1864'>      shade. A thousand streams of the purest water, issuing from every</a>
<a id='line_1865'>      hill, preserved the verdure of the earth, and the temperature of</a>
<a id='line_1866'>      the air; the senses were gratified with harmonious sounds and</a>
<a id='line_1867'>      aromatic odors; and the peaceful grove was consecrated to health</a>

<a id='line_1938'>      (a bishop of Antioch, who died in prison in the persecution of</a>

<a id='line_1940'>      order of C¾sar Gallus, was transported into the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_1941'>      grove of Daphne. A magnificent church was erected over his</a>
<a id='line_1942'>      remains; a portion of the sacred lands was usurped for the</a>
<a id='line_1943'>      maintenance of the clergy, and for the burial of the Christians</a>
<a id='line_1944'>      at Antioch, who were ambitious of lying at the feet of their</a>

<a id='line_1946'>      and indignant votaries. As soon as another revolution seemed to</a>
<a id='line_1947'>      restore the fortune of Paganism, the church of St. Babylas was</a>
<a id='line_1948'>      demolished, and new buildings were added to the mouldering</a>
<a id='line_1949'>      edifice which had been raised by the piety of Syrian kings. But</a>

<a id='line_1952'>      Christians, who had so effectually suppressed the voice of fraud</a>
<a id='line_1953'>      or enthusiasm. 113 The scene of infection was purified, according</a>
<a id='line_1954'>      to the forms of ancient rituals; the bodies were decently</a>
<a id='line_1955'>      removed; and the ministers of the church were permitted to convey</a>
<a id='line_1956'>      the remains of St. Babylas to their former habitation within the</a>
<a id='line_1957'>      walls of Antioch. The modest behavior which might have assuaged</a>
<a id='line_1958'>      the jealousy of a hostile government was neglected, on this</a>
<a id='line_1959'>      occasion, by the zeal of the Christians. The lofty car, that</a>
<a id='line_1960'>      transported the relics of Babylas, was followed, and accompanied,</a>
<a id='line_1961'>      and received, by an innumerable multitude; who chanted, with</a>
<a id='line_1962'>      thundering acclamations, the Psalms of David the most expressive</a>
<a id='line_1963'>      of their contempt for idols and idolaters. The return of the</a>
<a id='line_1964'>      saint was a triumph; and the triumph was an insult on the</a>
<a id='line_1965'>      religion of the emperor, who exerted his pride to dissemble his</a>
<a id='line_1966'>      resentment. During the night which terminated this indiscreet</a>
<a id='line_1967'>      procession, the temple of Daphne was in flames; the statue of</a>
<a id='line_1968'>      Apollo was consumed; and the walls of the edifice were left a</a>
<a id='line_1969'>      naked and awful monument of ruin. The Christians of Antioch</a>

<a id='line_1971'>      intercession of St. Babylas had pointed the lightnings of heaven</a>

<a id='line_2089'>      assumed the pomp and insolence of his lofty station; but he still</a>
<a id='line_2090'>      betrayed the vices of his base and servile extraction. The</a>

<a id='line_2112'>      end of twenty-four days, the prison was forced open by the rage</a>
<a id='line_2113'>      of a superstitious multitude, impatient of the tedious forms of</a>

<a id='line_2246'>      After the tumult of Alexandria had subsided, Athanasius, amidst</a>

<a id='line_2250'>      authority tended not to inflame, but to reconcile, the minds of</a>
<a id='line_2251'>      the people. His pastoral labors were not confined to the narrow</a>
<a id='line_2252'>      limits of Egypt. The state of the Christian world was present to</a>
<a id='line_2253'>      his active and capacious mind; and the age, the merit, the</a>
<a id='line_2254'>      reputation of Athanasius, enabled him to assume, in a moment of</a>
<a id='line_2255'>      danger, the office of Ecclesiastical Dictator. 129 Three years</a>
<a id='line_2256'>      were not yet elapsed since the majority of the bishops of the</a>
<a id='line_2257'>      West had ignorantly, or reluctantly, subscribed the Confession of</a>
<a id='line_2258'>      Rimini. They repented, they believed, but they dreaded the</a>
<a id='line_2259'>      unseasonable rigor of their orthodox brethren; and if their pride</a>
<a id='line_2260'>      was stronger than their faith, they might throw themselves into</a>
<a id='line_2261'>      the arms of the Arians, to escape the indignity of a public</a>
<a id='line_2262'>      penance, which must degrade them to the condition of obscure</a>

<a id='line_2265'>      some heat among the Catholic doctors; and the progress of this</a>
<a id='line_2266'>      metaphysical controversy seemed to threaten a public and lasting</a>

<a id='line_2300'>      honored Athanasius with his sincere and peculiar hatred. For his</a>
<a id='line_2301'>      sake alone, he introduced an arbitrary distinction, repugnant at</a>

<a id='line_2304'>      restored, by that general indulgence, to the possession of their</a>

<a id='line_2308'>      insolently usurp the archiepiscopal throne of Alexandria, without</a>
<a id='line_2309'>      expecting the orders of his sovereign. As a punishment for the</a>

<a id='line_2311'>      and he was pleased to suppose, that this act of justice would be</a>
<a id='line_2312'>      highly agreeable to his pious subjects. The pressing</a>
<a id='line_2313'>      solicitations of the people soon convinced him, that the majority</a>
<a id='line_2314'>      of the Alexandrians were Christians; and that the greatest part</a>
<a id='line_2315'>      of the Christians were firmly attached to the cause of their</a>
<a id='line_2316'>      oppressed primate. But the knowledge of their sentiments, instead</a>
<a id='line_2317'>      of persuading him to recall his decree, provoked him to extend to</a>
<a id='line_2318'>      all Egypt the term of the exile of Athanasius. The zeal of the</a>
<a id='line_2319'>      multitude rendered Julian still more inexorable: he was alarmed</a>
<a id='line_2320'>      by the danger of leaving at the head of a tumultuous city, a</a>
<a id='line_2321'>      daring and popular leader; and the language of his resentment</a>
<a id='line_2322'>      discovers the opinion which he entertained of the courage and</a>

<a id='line_2377'>      of fanaticism perverted the heart and understanding of a virtuous</a>
<a id='line_2378'>      prince, it must, at the same time, be confessed that the _real_</a>
<a id='line_2379'>      sufferings of the Christians were inflamed and magnified by human</a>
<a id='line_2380'>      passions and religious enthusiasm. The meekness and resignation</a>
<a id='line_2381'>      which had distinguished the primitive disciples of the gospel,</a>
<a id='line_2382'>      was the object of the applause, rather than of the imitation of</a>
<a id='line_2383'>      their successors. The Christians, who had now possessed above</a>
<a id='line_2384'>      forty years the civil and ecclesiastical government of the</a>
<a id='line_2385'>      empire, had contracted the insolent vices of prosperity, 135 and</a>
<a id='line_2386'>      the habit of believing that the saints alone were entitled to</a>
<a id='line_2387'>      reign over the earth. As soon as the enmity of Julian deprived</a>
<a id='line_2388'>      the clergy of the privileges which had been conferred by the</a>
<a id='line_2389'>      favor of Constantine, they complained of the most cruel</a>
<a id='line_2390'>      oppression; and the free toleration of idolaters and heretics was</a>
<a id='line_2391'>      a subject of grief and scandal to the orthodox party. 136 The</a>
<a id='line_2392'>      acts of violence, which were no longer countenanced by the</a>
<a id='line_2393'>      magistrates, were still committed by the zeal of the people. At</a>
<a id='line_2394'>      Pessinus, the altar of Cybele was overturned almost in the</a>
<a id='line_2395'>      presence of the emperor; and in the city of C¾sarea in</a>
<a id='line_2396'>      Cappadocia, the temple of Fortune, the sole place of worship</a>
<a id='line_2397'>      which had been left to the Pagans, was destroyed by the rage of a</a>
<a id='line_2398'>      popular tumult. On these occasions, a prince, who felt for the</a>
<a id='line_2399'>      honor of the gods, was not disposed to interrupt the course of</a>
<a id='line_2400'>      justice; and his mind was still more deeply exasperated, when he</a>
<a id='line_2401'>      found that the fanatics, who had deserved and suffered the</a>
<a id='line_2402'>      punishment of incendiaries, were rewarded with the honors of</a>
<a id='line_2403'>      martyrdom. 137 The Christian subjects of Julian were assured of</a>
<a id='line_2404'>      the hostile designs of their sovereign; and, to their jealous</a>
<a id='line_2405'>      apprehension, every circumstance of his government might afford</a>
<a id='line_2406'>      some grounds of discontent and suspicion. In the ordinary</a>
<a id='line_2407'>      administration of the laws, the Christians, who formed so large a</a>
<a id='line_2408'>      part of the people, must frequently be condemned: but their</a>
<a id='line_2409'>      indulgent brethren, without examining the merits of the cause,</a>
<a id='line_2410'>      presumed their innocence, allowed their claims, and imputed the</a>
<a id='line_2411'>      severity of their judge to the partial malice of religious</a>
<a id='line_2412'>      persecution. 138 These present hardships, intolerable as they</a>
<a id='line_2413'>      might appear, were represented as a slight prelude of the</a>
<a id='line_2414'>      impending calamities. The Christians considered Julian as a cruel</a>
<a id='line_2415'>      and crafty tyrant; who suspended the execution of his revenge</a>
<a id='line_2416'>      till he should return victorious from the Persian war. They</a>
<a id='line_2417'>      expected, that as soon as he had triumphed over the foreign</a>
<a id='line_2418'>      enemies of Rome, he would lay aside the irksome mask of</a>
<a id='line_2419'>      dissimulation; that the amphitheatre would stream with the blood</a>
<a id='line_2420'>      of hermits and bishops; and that the Christians who still</a>
<a id='line_2421'>      persevered in the profession of the faith, would be deprived of</a>
<a id='line_2422'>      the common benefits of nature and society. 139 Every calumny 140</a>
<a id='line_2423'>      that could wound the reputation of the Apostate, was credulously</a>
<a id='line_2424'>      embraced by the fears and hatred of his adversaries; and their</a>
<a id='line_2425'>      indiscreet clamors provoked the temper of a sovereign, whom it</a>
<a id='line_2426'>      was their duty to respect, and their interest to flatter.</a>
<a id='line_2427'></a>
<a id='line_2428'>      They still protested, that prayers and tears were their only</a>
<a id='line_2429'>      weapons against the impious tyrant, whose head they devoted to</a>
<a id='line_2430'>      the justice of offended Heaven. But they insinuated, with sullen</a>
<a id='line_2431'>      resolution, that their submission was no longer the effect of</a>
<a id='line_2432'>      weakness; and that, in the imperfect state of human virtue, the</a>
<a id='line_2433'>      patience, which is founded on principle, may be exhausted by</a>
<a id='line_2434'>      persecution. It is impossible to determine how far the zeal of</a>
