<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>      The philosophical fable which Julian composed under the name of</a>
<a id='line_9'>      the C¾sars, 1 is one of the most agreeable and instructive</a>
<a id='line_10'>      productions of ancient wit. 2 During the freedom and equality of</a>
<a id='line_11'>      the days of the Saturnalia, Romulus prepared a feast for the</a>
<a id='line_12'>      deities of Olympus, who had adopted him as a worthy associate,</a>
<a id='line_13'>      and for the Roman princes, who had reigned over his martial</a>
<a id='line_14'>      people, and the vanquished nations of the earth. The immortals</a>
<a id='line_15'>      were placed in just order on their thrones of state, and the</a>
<a id='line_16'>      table of the C¾sars was spread below the Moon in the upper region</a>
<a id='line_17'>      of the air. The tyrants, who would have disgraced the society of</a>
<a id='line_18'>      gods and men, were thrown headlong, by the inexorable Nemesis,</a>
<a id='line_19'>      into the Tartarean abyss. The rest of the C¾sars successively</a>
<a id='line_20'>      advanced to their seats; and as they passed, the vices, the</a>
<a id='line_21'>      defects, the blemishes of their respective characters, were</a>
<a id='line_22'>      maliciously noticed by old Silenus, a laughing moralist, who</a>
<a id='line_23'>      disguised the wisdom of a philosopher under the mask of a</a>
<a id='line_24'>      Bacchanal. 3 As soon as the feast was ended, the voice of Mercury</a>
<a id='line_25'>      proclaimed the will of Jupiter, that a celestial crown should be</a>
<a id='line_26'>      the reward of superior merit. Julius C¾sar, Augustus, Trajan, and</a>
<a id='line_27'>      Marcus Antoninus, were selected as the most illustrious</a>
<a id='line_28'>      candidates; the effeminate Constantine 4 was not excluded from</a>
<a id='line_29'>      this honorable competition, and the great Alexander was invited</a>
<a id='line_30'>      to dispute the prize of glory with the Roman heroes. Each of the</a>
<a id='line_31'>      candidates was allowed to display the merit of his own exploits;</a>
<a id='line_32'>      but, in the judgment of the gods, the modest silence of Marcus</a>
<a id='line_33'>      pleaded more powerfully than the elaborate orations of his</a>
<a id='line_34'>      haughty rivals. When the judges of this awful contest proceeded</a>
<a id='line_35'>      to examine the heart, and to scrutinize the springs of action,</a>
<a id='line_36'>      the superiority of the Imperial Stoic appeared still more</a>
<a id='line_37'>      decisive and conspicuous. 5 Alexander and C¾sar, Augustus,</a>
<a id='line_38'>      Trajan, and Constantine, acknowledged, with a blush, that fame,</a>
<a id='line_39'>      or power, or pleasure had been the important object of _their_</a>
<a id='line_40'>      labors: but the gods themselves beheld, with reverence and love,</a>
<a id='line_41'>      a virtuous mortal, who had practised on the throne the lessons of</a>
<a id='line_42'>      philosophy; and who, in a state of human imperfection, had</a>
<a id='line_43'>      aspired to imitate the moral attributes of the Deity. The value</a>
<a id='line_44'>      of this agreeable composition (the C¾sars of Julian) is enhanced</a>
<a id='line_45'>      by the rank of the author. A prince, who delineates, with</a>
<a id='line_46'>      freedom, the vices and virtues of his predecessors, subscribes,</a>
<a id='line_47'>      in every line, the censure or approbation of his own conduct.</a>

<a id='line_72'>      partiality of Julian against his uncle Constantine, and the</a>

<a id='line_74'>      compelled, by a most sacred interest, to renounce their</a>
<a id='line_75'>      allegiance, and to desert the cause of their author.]</a>
<a id='line_76'></a>
<a id='line_77'>      5 (return) [ Julian was secretly inclined to prefer a Greek to a</a>
<a id='line_78'>      Roman. But when he seriously compared a hero with a philosopher,</a>
<a id='line_79'>      he was sensible that mankind had much greater obligations to</a>
<a id='line_80'>      Socrates than to Alexander, (Orat. ad Themistium, p. 264.)]</a>
<a id='line_81'></a>
<a id='line_82'>      In the cool moments of reflection, Julian preferred the useful</a>
<a id='line_83'>      and benevolent virtues of Antoninus; but his ambitious spirit was</a>
<a id='line_84'>      inflamed by the glory of Alexander; and he solicited, with equal</a>
<a id='line_85'>      ardor, the esteem of the wise, and the applause of the multitude.</a>
<a id='line_86'>      In the season of life when the powers of the mind and body enjoy</a>
<a id='line_87'>      the most active vigor, the emperor who was instructed by the</a>
<a id='line_88'>      experience, and animated by the success, of the German war,</a>
<a id='line_89'>      resolved to signalize his reign by some more splendid and</a>
<a id='line_90'>      memorable achievement. The ambassadors of the East, from the</a>
<a id='line_91'>      continent of India, and the Isle of Ceylon, 6 had respectfully</a>
<a id='line_92'>      saluted the Roman purple. 7 The nations of the West esteemed and</a>
<a id='line_93'>      dreaded the personal virtues of Julian, both in peace and war. He</a>
<a id='line_94'>      despised the trophies of a Gothic victory, and was satisfied that</a>
<a id='line_95'>      the rapacious Barbarians of the Danube would be restrained from</a>
<a id='line_96'>      any future violation of the faith of treaties by the terror of</a>
<a id='line_97'>      his name, and the additional fortifications with which he</a>
<a id='line_98'>      strengthened the Thracian and Illyrian frontiers. The successor</a>
<a id='line_99'>      of Cyrus and Artaxerxes was the only rival whom he deemed worthy</a>
<a id='line_100'>      of his arms; and he resolved, by the final conquest of Persia, to</a>
<a id='line_101'>      chastise the naughty nation which had so long resisted and</a>
<a id='line_102'>      insulted the majesty of Rome. 9 As soon as the Persian monarch</a>
<a id='line_103'>      was informed that the throne of Constantius was filled by a</a>
<a id='line_104'>      prince of a very different character, he condescended to make</a>
<a id='line_105'>      some artful, or perhaps sincere, overtures towards a negotiation</a>
<a id='line_106'>      of peace. But the pride of Sapor was astonished by the firmness</a>
<a id='line_107'>      of Julian; who sternly declared, that he would never consent to</a>
<a id='line_108'>      hold a peaceful conference among the flames and ruins of the</a>
<a id='line_109'>      cities of Mesopotamia; and who added, with a smile of contempt,</a>
<a id='line_110'>      that it was needless to treat by ambassadors, as he himself had</a>
<a id='line_111'>      determined to visit speedily the court of Persia. The impatience</a>
<a id='line_112'>      of the emperor urged the diligence of the military preparations.</a>
<a id='line_113'>      The generals were named; and Julian, marching from Constantinople</a>
<a id='line_114'>      through the provinces of Asia Minor, arrived at Antioch about</a>
<a id='line_115'>      eight months after the death of his predecessor. His ardent</a>
<a id='line_116'>      desire to march into the heart of Persia, was checked by the</a>
<a id='line_117'>      indispensable duty of regulating the state of the empire; by his</a>
<a id='line_118'>      zeal to revive the worship of the gods; and by the advice of his</a>
<a id='line_119'>      wisest friends; who represented the necessity of allowing the</a>
<a id='line_120'>      salutary interval of winter quarters, to restore the exhausted</a>
<a id='line_121'>      strength of the legions of Gaul, and the discipline and spirit of</a>
<a id='line_122'>      the Eastern troops. Julian was persuaded to fix, till the ensuing</a>
<a id='line_123'>      spring, his residence at Antioch, among a people maliciously</a>
<a id='line_124'>      disposed to deride the haste, and to censure the delays, of their</a>
<a id='line_125'>      sovereign. 10</a>

<a id='line_161'>      three hundred years, had not yet subdued the single province of</a>

<a id='line_169'>      If Julian had flattered himself, that his personal connection</a>
<a id='line_170'>      with the capital of the East would be productive of mutual</a>
<a id='line_171'>      satisfaction to the prince and people, he made a very false</a>
<a id='line_172'>      estimate of his own character, and of the manners of Antioch. 11</a>
<a id='line_173'>      The warmth of the climate disposed the natives to the most</a>
<a id='line_174'>      intemperate enjoyment of tranquillity and opulence; and the</a>
<a id='line_175'>      lively licentiousness of the Greeks was blended with the</a>
<a id='line_176'>      hereditary softness of the Syrians. Fashion was the only law,</a>
<a id='line_177'>      pleasure the only pursuit, and the splendor of dress and</a>
<a id='line_178'>      furniture was the only distinction of the citizens of Antioch.</a>
<a id='line_179'>      The arts of luxury were honored; the serious and manly virtues</a>
<a id='line_180'>      were the subject of ridicule; and the contempt for female modesty</a>
<a id='line_181'>      and reverent age announced the universal corruption of the</a>
<a id='line_182'>      capital of the East. The love of spectacles was the taste, or</a>
<a id='line_183'>      rather passion, of the Syrians; the most skilful artists were</a>
<a id='line_184'>      procured from the adjacent cities; 12 a considerable share of the</a>
<a id='line_185'>      revenue was devoted to the public amusements; and the</a>
<a id='line_186'>      magnificence of the games of the theatre and circus was</a>
<a id='line_187'>      considered as the happiness and as the glory of Antioch. The</a>
<a id='line_188'>      rustic manners of a prince who disdained such glory, and was</a>
<a id='line_189'>      insensible of such happiness, soon disgusted the delicacy of his</a>
<a id='line_190'>      subjects; and the effeminate Orientals could neither imitate, nor</a>
<a id='line_191'>      admire, the severe simplicity which Julian always maintained, and</a>
<a id='line_192'>      sometimes affected. The days of festivity, consecrated, by</a>
<a id='line_193'>      ancient custom, to the honor of the gods, were the only occasions</a>
<a id='line_194'>      in which Julian relaxed his philosophic severity; and those</a>
<a id='line_195'>      festivals were the only days in which the Syrians of Antioch</a>
<a id='line_196'>      could reject the allurements of pleasure. The majority of the</a>
<a id='line_197'>      people supported the glory of the Christian name, which had been</a>
<a id='line_198'>      first invented by their ancestors: 13 they contended themselves</a>
<a id='line_199'>      with disobeying the moral precepts, but they were scrupulously</a>
<a id='line_200'>      attached to the speculative doctrines of their religion. The</a>
<a id='line_201'>      church of Antioch was distracted by heresy and schism; but the</a>
<a id='line_202'>      Arians and the Athanasians, the followers of Meletius and those</a>
<a id='line_203'>      of Paulinus, 14 were actuated by the same pious hatred of their</a>

<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>      The strongest prejudice was entertained against the character of</a>
<a id='line_228'>      an apostate, the enemy and successor of a prince who had engaged</a>
<a id='line_229'>      the affections of a very numerous sect; and the removal of St.</a>
<a id='line_230'>      Babylas excited an implacable opposition to the person of Julian.</a>
<a id='line_231'>      His subjects complained, with superstitious indignation, that</a>
<a id='line_232'>      famine had pursued the emperorÕs steps from Constantinople to</a>
<a id='line_233'>      Antioch; and the discontent of a hungry people was exasperated by</a>
<a id='line_234'>      the injudicious attempt to relieve their distress. The inclemency</a>
<a id='line_235'>      of the season had affected the harvests of Syria; and the price</a>
<a id='line_236'>      of bread, 15 in the markets of Antioch, had naturally risen in</a>
<a id='line_237'>      proportion to the scarcity of corn. But the fair and reasonable</a>
<a id='line_238'>      proportion was soon violated by the rapacious arts of monopoly.</a>
<a id='line_239'>      In this unequal contest, in which the produce of the land is</a>
<a id='line_240'>      claimed by one party as his exclusive property, is used by</a>
<a id='line_241'>      another as a lucrative object of trade, and is required by a</a>
<a id='line_242'>      third for the daily and necessary support of life, all the</a>
<a id='line_243'>      profits of the intermediate agents are accumulated on the head of</a>
<a id='line_244'>      the defenceless customers. The hardships of their situation were</a>
<a id='line_245'>      exaggerated and increased by their own impatience and anxiety;</a>
<a id='line_246'>      and the apprehension of a scarcity gradually produced the</a>
<a id='line_247'>      appearances of a famine. When the luxurious citizens of Antioch</a>
<a id='line_248'>      complained of the high price of poultry and fish, Julian publicly</a>
<a id='line_249'>      declared, that a frugal city ought to be satisfied with a regular</a>
<a id='line_250'>      supply of wine, oil, and bread; but he acknowledged, that it was</a>
<a id='line_251'>      the duty of a sovereign to provide for the subsistence of his</a>
<a id='line_252'>      people. With this salutary view, the emperor ventured on a very</a>
<a id='line_253'>      dangerous and doubtful step, of fixing, by legal authority, the</a>
<a id='line_254'>      value of corn. He enacted, that, in a time of scarcity, it should</a>
<a id='line_255'>      be sold at a price which had seldom been known in the most</a>
<a id='line_256'>      plentiful years; and that his own example might strengthen his</a>
<a id='line_257'>      laws, he sent into the market four hundred and twenty-two</a>
<a id='line_258'>      thousand _modii_, or measures, which were drawn by his order from</a>
<a id='line_259'>      the granaries of Hierapolis, of Chalcis, and even of Egypt. The</a>
<a id='line_260'>      consequences might have been foreseen, and were soon felt. The</a>
<a id='line_261'>      Imperial wheat was purchased by the rich merchants; the</a>
<a id='line_262'>      proprietors of land, or of corn, withheld from the city the</a>
<a id='line_263'>      accustomed supply; and the small quantities that appeared in the</a>
<a id='line_264'>      market were secretly sold at an advanced and illegal price.</a>
<a id='line_265'>      Julian still continued to applaud his own policy, treated the</a>
<a id='line_266'>      complaints of the people as a vain and ungrateful murmur, and</a>
<a id='line_267'>      convinced Antioch that he had inherited the obstinacy, though not</a>
<a id='line_268'>      the cruelty, of his brother Gallus. 16 The remonstrances of the</a>
<a id='line_269'>      municipal senate served only to exasperate his inflexible mind.</a>
<a id='line_270'>      He was persuaded, perhaps with truth, that the senators of</a>
<a id='line_271'>      Antioch who possessed lands, or were concerned in trade, had</a>
<a id='line_272'>      themselves contributed to the calamities of their country; and he</a>
<a id='line_273'>      imputed the disrespectful boldness which they assumed, to the</a>
<a id='line_274'>      sense, not of public duty, but of private interest. The whole</a>
<a id='line_275'>      body, consisting of two hundred of the most noble and wealthy</a>
<a id='line_276'>      citizens, were sent, under a guard, from the palace to the</a>
<a id='line_277'>      prison; and though they were permitted, before the close of</a>
<a id='line_278'>      evening, to return to their respective houses, 17 the emperor</a>
<a id='line_279'>      himself could not obtain the forgiveness which he had so easily</a>
<a id='line_280'>      granted. The same grievances were still the subject of the same</a>
<a id='line_281'>      complaints, which were industriously circulated by the wit and</a>
<a id='line_282'>      levity of the Syrian Greeks. During the licentious days of the</a>
<a id='line_283'>      Saturnalia, the streets of the city resounded with insolent</a>
<a id='line_284'>      songs, which derided the laws, the religion, the personal</a>
<a id='line_285'>      conduct, and even the _beard_, of the emperor; the spirit of</a>
<a id='line_286'>      Antioch was manifested by the connivance of the magistrates, and</a>
<a id='line_287'>      the applause of the multitude. 18 The disciple of Socrates was</a>
<a id='line_288'>      too deeply affected by these popular insults; but the monarch,</a>
<a id='line_289'>      endowed with a quick sensibility, and possessed of absolute</a>
<a id='line_290'>      power, refused his passions the gratification of revenge. A</a>
<a id='line_291'>      tyrant might have proscribed, without distinction, the lives and</a>
<a id='line_292'>      fortunes of the citizens of Antioch; and the unwarlike Syrians</a>
<a id='line_293'>      must have patiently submitted to the lust, the rapaciousness and</a>
<a id='line_294'>      the cruelty, of the faithful legions of Gaul. A milder sentence</a>
<a id='line_295'>      might have deprived the capital of the East of its honors and</a>
<a id='line_296'>      privileges; and the courtiers, perhaps the subjects, of Julian,</a>
<a id='line_297'>      would have applauded an act of justice, which asserted the</a>
<a id='line_298'>      dignity of the supreme magistrate of the republic. 19 But instead</a>
<a id='line_299'>      of abusing, or exerting, the authority of the state, to revenge</a>
<a id='line_300'>      his personal injuries, Julian contented himself with an</a>
<a id='line_301'>      inoffensive mode of retaliation, which it would be in the power</a>
<a id='line_302'>      of few princes to employ. He had been insulted by satires and</a>
<a id='line_303'>      libels; in his turn, he composed, under the title of the _Enemy</a>
<a id='line_304'>      of the Beard_, an ironical confession of his own faults, and a</a>
<a id='line_305'>      severe satire on the licentious and effeminate manners of</a>
<a id='line_306'>      Antioch. This Imperial reply was publicly exposed before the</a>
<a id='line_307'>      gates of the palace; and the Misopogon 20 still remains a</a>
<a id='line_308'>      singular monument of the resentment, the wit, the humanity, and</a>
<a id='line_309'>      the indiscretion of Julian. Though he affected to laugh, he could</a>
<a id='line_310'>      not forgive. 21 His contempt was expressed, and his revenge might</a>
<a id='line_311'>      be gratified, by the nomination of a governor 22 worthy only of</a>
<a id='line_312'>      such subjects; and the emperor, forever renouncing the ungrateful</a>
<a id='line_313'>      city, proclaimed his resolution to pass the ensuing winter at</a>

<a id='line_374'></a>
<a id='line_375'>      Yet Antioch possessed one citizen, whose genius and virtues might</a>
<a id='line_376'>      atone, in the opinion of Julian, for the vice and folly of his</a>
<a id='line_377'>      country. The sophist Libanius was born in the capital of the</a>
<a id='line_378'>      East; he publicly professed the arts of rhetoric and declamation</a>
<a id='line_379'>      at Nice, Nicomedia, Constantinople, Athens, and, during the</a>
<a id='line_380'>      remainder of his life, at Antioch. His school was assiduously</a>
<a id='line_381'>      frequented by the Grecian youth; his disciples, who sometimes</a>
<a id='line_382'>      exceeded the number of eighty, celebrated their incomparable</a>
<a id='line_383'>      master; and the jealousy of his rivals, who persecuted him from</a>
<a id='line_384'>      one city to another, confirmed the favorable opinion which</a>
<a id='line_385'>      Libanius ostentatiously displayed of his superior merit. The</a>
<a id='line_386'>      preceptors of Julian had extorted a rash but solemn assurance,</a>
<a id='line_387'>      that he would never attend the lectures of their adversary: the</a>
<a id='line_388'>      curiosity of the royal youth was checked and inflamed: he</a>
<a id='line_389'>      secretly procured the writings of this dangerous sophist, and</a>
<a id='line_390'>      gradually surpassed, in the perfect imitation of his style, the</a>
<a id='line_391'>      most laborious of his domestic pupils. 24 When Julian ascended</a>
<a id='line_392'>      the throne, he declared his impatience to embrace and reward the</a>
<a id='line_393'>      Syrian sophist, who had preserved, in a degenerate age, the</a>
<a id='line_394'>      Grecian purity of taste, of manners, and of religion. The</a>
<a id='line_395'>      emperorÕs prepossession was increased and justified by the</a>
<a id='line_396'>      discreet pride of his favorite. Instead of pressing, with the</a>
<a id='line_397'>      foremost of the crowd, into the palace of Constantinople,</a>
<a id='line_398'>      Libanius calmly expected his arrival at Antioch; withdrew from</a>
<a id='line_399'>      court on the first symptoms of coldness and indifference;</a>
<a id='line_400'>      required a formal invitation for each visit; and taught his</a>
<a id='line_401'>      sovereign an important lesson, that he might command the</a>
<a id='line_402'>      obedience of a subject, but that he must deserve the attachment</a>
<a id='line_403'>      of a friend. The sophists of every age, despising, or affecting</a>
<a id='line_404'>      to despise, the accidental distinctions of birth and fortune, 25</a>
<a id='line_405'>      reserve their esteem for the superior qualities of the mind, with</a>
<a id='line_406'>      which they themselves are so plentifully endowed. Julian might</a>
<a id='line_407'>      disdain the acclamations of a venal court, who adored the</a>
<a id='line_408'>      Imperial purple; but he was deeply flattered by the praise, the</a>
<a id='line_409'>      admonition, the freedom, and the envy of an independent</a>
<a id='line_410'>      philosopher, who refused his favors, loved his person, celebrated</a>
<a id='line_411'>      his fame, and protected his memory. The voluminous writings of</a>
<a id='line_412'>      Libanius still exist; for the most part, they are the vain and</a>
<a id='line_413'>      idle compositions of an orator, who cultivated the science of</a>
<a id='line_414'>      words; the productions of a recluse student, whose mind,</a>
<a id='line_415'>      regardless of his contemporaries, was incessantly fixed on the</a>
<a id='line_416'>      Trojan war and the Athenian commonwealth. Yet the sophist of</a>
<a id='line_417'>      Antioch sometimes descended from this imaginary elevation; he</a>
<a id='line_418'>      entertained a various and elaborate correspondence; 26 he praised</a>
<a id='line_419'>      the virtues of his own times; he boldly arraigned the abuse of</a>
<a id='line_420'>      public and private life; and he eloquently pleaded the cause of</a>
<a id='line_421'>      Antioch against the just resentment of Julian and Theodosius. It</a>
<a id='line_422'>      is the common calamity of old age, 27 to lose whatever might have</a>
<a id='line_423'>      rendered it desirable; but Libanius experienced the peculiar</a>
<a id='line_424'>      misfortune of surviving the religion and the sciences, to which</a>
<a id='line_425'>      he had consecrated his genius. The friend of Julian was an</a>
<a id='line_426'>      indignant spectator of the triumph of Christianity; and his</a>
<a id='line_427'>      bigotry, which darkened the prospect of the visible world, did</a>
<a id='line_428'>      not inspire Libanius with any lively hopes of celestial glory and</a>

<a id='line_464'></a>
<a id='line_465'></a>
<a id='line_466'>      The martial impatience of Julian urged him to take the field in</a>
<a id='line_467'>      the beginning of the spring; and he dismissed, with contempt and</a>
<a id='line_468'>      reproach, the senate of Antioch, who accompanied the emperor</a>
<a id='line_469'>      beyond the limits of their own territory, to which he was</a>
<a id='line_470'>      resolved never to return. After a laborious march of two days, 29</a>
<a id='line_471'>      he halted on the third at Ber¾a, or Aleppo, where he had the</a>
<a id='line_472'>      mortification of finding a senate almost entirely Christian; who</a>
<a id='line_473'>      received with cold and formal demonstrations of respect the</a>
<a id='line_474'>      eloquent sermon of the apostle of paganism. The son of one of the</a>
<a id='line_475'>      most illustrious citizens of Ber¾a, who had embraced, either from</a>
<a id='line_476'>      interest or conscience, the religion of the emperor, was</a>
<a id='line_477'>      disinherited by his angry parent. The father and the son were</a>
<a id='line_478'>      invited to the Imperial table. Julian, placing himself between</a>
<a id='line_479'>      them, attempted, without success, to inculcate the lesson and</a>
<a id='line_480'>      example of toleration; supported, with affected calmness, the</a>
<a id='line_481'>      indiscreet zeal of the aged Christian, who seemed to forget the</a>
<a id='line_482'>      sentiments of nature, and the duty of a subject; and at length,</a>
<a id='line_483'>      turning towards the afflicted youth, ÒSince you have lost a</a>
<a id='line_484'>      father,Ó said he, Òfor my sake, it is incumbent on me to supply</a>
<a id='line_485'>      his place.Ó 30 The emperor was received in a manner much more</a>
<a id='line_486'>      agreeable to his wishes at Batn¾, 3011 a small town pleasantly</a>
<a id='line_487'>      seated in a grove of cypresses, about twenty miles from the city</a>
<a id='line_488'>      of Hierapolis. The solemn rites of sacrifice were decently</a>
<a id='line_489'>      prepared by the inhabitants of Batn¾, who seemed attached to the</a>
<a id='line_490'>      worship of their tutelar deities, Apollo and Jupiter; but the</a>
<a id='line_491'>      serious piety of Julian was offended by the tumult of their</a>
<a id='line_492'>      applause; and he too clearly discerned, that the smoke which</a>
<a id='line_493'>      arose from their altars was the incense of flattery, rather than</a>
<a id='line_494'>      of devotion. The ancient and magnificent temple which had</a>
<a id='line_495'>      sanctified, for so many ages, the city of Hierapolis, 31 no</a>
<a id='line_496'>      longer subsisted; and the consecrated wealth, which afforded a</a>
<a id='line_497'>      liberal maintenance to more than three hundred priests, might</a>
<a id='line_498'>      hasten its downfall. Yet Julian enjoyed the satisfaction of</a>

<a id='line_552'>      have wasted the active and important season of the year in the</a>

<a id='line_563'>      the dominions of Sapor on the side of the Tigris, or on that of</a>
<a id='line_564'>      the Euphrates. The emperor detached an army of thirty thousand</a>
<a id='line_565'>      men, under the command of his kinsman Procopius, and of</a>
<a id='line_566'>      Sebastian, who had been duke of Egypt. They were ordered to</a>
<a id='line_567'>      direct their march towards Nisibis, and to secure the frontier</a>
<a id='line_568'>      from the desultory incursions of the enemy, before they attempted</a>
<a id='line_569'>      the passage of the Tigris. Their subsequent operations were left</a>
<a id='line_570'>      to the discretion of the generals; but Julian expected, that</a>
<a id='line_571'>      after wasting with fire and sword the fertile districts of Media</a>
<a id='line_572'>      and Adiabene, they might arrive under the walls of Ctesiphon at</a>

<a id='line_574'>      the banks of the Euphrates, should besiege the capital of the</a>
<a id='line_575'>      Persian monarchy. The success of this well-concerted plan</a>
<a id='line_576'>      depended, in a great measure, on the powerful and ready</a>
<a id='line_577'>      assistance of the king of Armenia, who, without exposing the</a>
<a id='line_578'>      safety of his own dominions, might detach an army of four</a>
<a id='line_579'>      thousand horse, and twenty thousand foot, to the assistance of</a>
<a id='line_580'>      the Romans. 37 But the feeble Arsaces Tiranus, 38 king of</a>
<a id='line_581'>      Armenia, had degenerated still more shamefully than his father</a>
<a id='line_582'>      Chosroes, from the manly virtues of the great Tiridates; and as</a>
<a id='line_583'>      the pusillanimous monarch was averse to any enterprise of danger</a>
<a id='line_584'>      and glory, he could disguise his timid indolence by the more</a>
<a id='line_585'>      decent excuses of religion and gratitude. He expressed a pious</a>
<a id='line_586'>      attachment to the memory of Constantius, from whose hands he had</a>
<a id='line_587'>      received in marriage Olympias, the daughter of the pr¾fect</a>
<a id='line_588'>      Ablavius; and the alliance of a female, who had been educated as</a>
<a id='line_589'>      the destined wife of the emperor Constans, exalted the dignity of</a>
<a id='line_590'>      a Barbarian king. 39 Tiranus professed the Christian religion; he</a>
<a id='line_591'>      reigned over a nation of Christians; and he was restrained, by</a>
<a id='line_592'>      every principle of conscience and interest, from contributing to</a>
<a id='line_593'>      the victory, which would consummate the ruin of the church. The</a>
<a id='line_594'>      alienated mind of Tiranus was exasperated by the indiscretion of</a>
<a id='line_595'>      Julian, who treated the king of Armenia as _his_ slave, and as</a>
<a id='line_596'>      the enemy of the gods. The haughty and threatening style of the</a>

<a id='line_684'>      army of Julian, the most numerous that any of the C¾sars had ever</a>
<a id='line_685'>      led against Persia, consisted of sixty-five thousand effective</a>
<a id='line_686'>      and well-disciplined soldiers. The veteran bands of cavalry and</a>
<a id='line_687'>      infantry, of Romans and Barbarians, had been selected from the</a>
<a id='line_688'>      different provinces; and a just pre‘minence of loyalty and valor</a>
<a id='line_689'>      was claimed by the hardy Gauls, who guarded the throne and person</a>
<a id='line_690'>      of their beloved prince. A formidable body of Scythian</a>
<a id='line_691'>      auxiliaries had been transported from another climate, and almost</a>
<a id='line_692'>      from another world, to invade a distant country, of whose name</a>
<a id='line_693'>      and situation they were ignorant. The love of rapine and war</a>
<a id='line_694'>      allured to the Imperial standard several tribes of Saracens, or</a>
<a id='line_695'>      roving Arabs, whose service Julian had commanded, while he</a>
<a id='line_696'>      sternly refused the payment of the accustomed subsidies. The</a>
<a id='line_697'>      broad channel of the Euphrates 41 was crowded by a fleet of</a>
<a id='line_698'>      eleven hundred ships, destined to attend the motions, and to</a>
<a id='line_699'>      satisfy the wants, of the Roman army. The military strength of</a>
<a id='line_700'>      the fleet was composed of fifty armed galleys; and these were</a>
<a id='line_701'>      accompanied by an equal number of flat-bottomed boats, which</a>
<a id='line_702'>      might occasionally be connected into the form of temporary</a>
<a id='line_703'>      bridges. The rest of the ships, partly constructed of timber, and</a>
<a id='line_704'>      partly covered with raw hides, were laden with an almost</a>
<a id='line_705'>      inexhaustible supply of arms and engines, of utensils and</a>
<a id='line_706'>      provisions. The vigilant humanity of Julian had embarked a very</a>
<a id='line_707'>      large magazine of vinegar and biscuit for the use of the</a>
<a id='line_708'>      soldiers, but he prohibited the indulgence of wine; and</a>
<a id='line_709'>      rigorously stopped a long string of superfluous camels that</a>
<a id='line_710'>      attempted to follow the rear of the army. The River Chaboras</a>
<a id='line_711'>      falls into the Euphrates at Circesium; 42 and as soon as the</a>
<a id='line_712'>      trumpet gave the signal of march, the Romans passed the little</a>
<a id='line_713'>      stream which separated two mighty and hostile empires. The custom</a>
<a id='line_714'>      of ancient discipline required a military oration; and Julian</a>
<a id='line_715'>      embraced every opportunity of displaying his eloquence. He</a>
<a id='line_716'>      animated the impatient and attentive legions by the example of</a>
<a id='line_717'>      the inflexible courage and glorious triumphs of their ancestors.</a>
<a id='line_718'>      He excited their resentment by a lively picture of the insolence</a>

<a id='line_720'>      resolution, either to extirpate that perfidious nation, or to</a>
<a id='line_721'>      devote his life in the cause of the republic. The eloquence of</a>
<a id='line_722'>      Julian was enforced by a donative of one hundred and thirty</a>

<a id='line_756'>      disposed in three columns. 45 The strength of the infantry, and</a>
<a id='line_757'>      consequently of the whole army was placed in the centre, under</a>
<a id='line_758'>      the peculiar command of their master-general Victor. On the</a>
<a id='line_759'>      right, the brave Nevitta led a column of several legions along</a>
<a id='line_760'>      the banks of the Euphrates, and almost always in sight of the</a>
<a id='line_761'>      fleet. The left flank of the army was protected by the column of</a>
<a id='line_762'>      cavalry. Hormisdas and Arinth¾us were appointed generals of the</a>
<a id='line_763'>      horse; and the singular adventures of Hormisdas 46 are not</a>
<a id='line_764'>      undeserving of our notice. He was a Persian prince, of the royal</a>
<a id='line_765'>      race of the Sassanides, who, in the troubles of the minority of</a>
<a id='line_766'>      Sapor, had escaped from prison to the hospitable court of the</a>
<a id='line_767'>      great Constantine. Hormisdas at first excited the compassion, and</a>
<a id='line_768'>      at length acquired the esteem, of his new masters; his valor and</a>
<a id='line_769'>      fidelity raised him to the military honors of the Roman service;</a>
<a id='line_770'>      and though a Christian, he might indulge the secret satisfaction</a>
<a id='line_771'>      of convincing his ungrateful country, that an oppressed subject</a>
<a id='line_772'>      may prove the most dangerous enemy. Such was the disposition of</a>
<a id='line_773'>      the three principal columns. The front and flanks of the army</a>
<a id='line_774'>      were covered by Lucilianus with a flying detachment of fifteen</a>
<a id='line_775'>      hundred light-armed soldiers, whose active vigilance observed the</a>
<a id='line_776'>      most distant signs, and conveyed the earliest notice, of any</a>
<a id='line_777'>      hostile approach. Dagalaiphus, and Secundinus duke of Osrhoene,</a>
<a id='line_778'>      conducted the troops of the rear-guard; the baggage securely</a>
<a id='line_779'>      proceeded in the intervals of the columns; and the ranks, from a</a>
<a id='line_780'>      motive either of use or ostentation, were formed in such open</a>
<a id='line_781'>      order, that the whole line of march extended almost ten miles.</a>
<a id='line_782'>      The ordinary post of Julian was at the head of the centre column;</a>
<a id='line_783'>      but as he preferred the duties of a general to the state of a</a>
<a id='line_784'>      monarch, he rapidly moved, with a small escort of light cavalry,</a>
<a id='line_785'>      to the front, the rear, the flanks, wherever his presence could</a>
<a id='line_786'>      animate or protect the march of the Roman army. The country which</a>

<a id='line_1003'>      The fields of Assyria were devoted by Julian to the calamities of</a>
<a id='line_1004'>      war; and the philosopher retaliated on a guiltless people the</a>
<a id='line_1005'>      acts of rapine and cruelty which had been committed by their</a>
<a id='line_1006'>      haughty master in the Roman provinces. The trembling Assyrians</a>
<a id='line_1007'>      summoned the rivers to their assistance; and completed, with</a>
<a id='line_1008'>      their own hands, the ruin of their country. The roads were</a>
<a id='line_1009'>      rendered impracticable; a flood of waters was poured into the</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      camp; and, during several days, the troops of Julian were obliged</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      to contend with the most discouraging hardships. But every</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      obstacle was surmounted by the perseverance of the legionaries,</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      who were inured to toil as well as to danger, and who felt</a>
<a id='line_1014'>      themselves animated by the spirit of their leader. The damage was</a>
<a id='line_1015'>      gradually repaired; the waters were restored to their proper</a>
<a id='line_1016'>      channels; whole groves of palm-trees were cut down, and placed</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      along the broken parts of the road; and the army passed over the</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      broad and deeper canals, on bridges of floating rafts, which were</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      supported by the help of bladders. Two cities of Assyria presumed</a>
<a id='line_1020'>      to resist the arms of a Roman emperor: and they both paid the</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      severe penalty of their rashness. At the distance of fifty miles</a>
<a id='line_1022'>      from the royal residence of Ctesiphon, Perisabor, 5711 or Anbar,</a>
<a id='line_1023'>      held the second rank in the province; a city, large, populous,</a>
<a id='line_1024'>      and well fortified, surrounded with a double wall, almost</a>
<a id='line_1025'>      encompassed by a branch of the Euphrates, and defended by the</a>
<a id='line_1026'>      valor of a numerous garrison. The exhortations of Hormisdas were</a>
<a id='line_1027'>      repulsed with contempt; and the ears of the Persian prince were</a>
<a id='line_1028'>      wounded by a just reproach, that, unmindful of his royal birth,</a>
<a id='line_1029'>      he conducted an army of strangers against his king and country.</a>
<a id='line_1030'>      The Assyrians maintained their loyalty by a skilful, as well as</a>
<a id='line_1031'>      vigorous, defence; till the lucky stroke of a battering-ram,</a>
<a id='line_1032'>      having opened a large breach, by shattering one of the angles of</a>
<a id='line_1033'>      the wall, they hastily retired into the fortifications of the</a>
<a id='line_1034'>      interior citadel. The soldiers of Julian rushed impetuously into</a>
<a id='line_1035'>      the town, and after the full gratification of every military</a>
<a id='line_1036'>      appetite, Perisabor was reduced to ashes; and the engines which</a>
<a id='line_1037'>      assaulted the citadel were planted on the ruins of the smoking</a>
<a id='line_1038'>      houses. The contest was continued by an incessant and mutual</a>
<a id='line_1039'>      discharge of missile weapons; and the superiority which the</a>
<a id='line_1040'>      Romans might derive from the mechanical powers of their balist¾</a>
<a id='line_1041'>      and catapult¾ was counterbalanced by the advantage of the ground</a>
<a id='line_1042'>      on the side of the besieged. But as soon as an _Helepolis_ had</a>
<a id='line_1043'>      been constructed, which could engage on equal terms with the</a>
<a id='line_1044'>      loftiest ramparts, the tremendous aspect of a moving turret, that</a>
<a id='line_1045'>      would leave no hope of resistance or mercy, terrified the</a>
<a id='line_1046'>      defenders of the citadel into an humble submission; and the place</a>
<a id='line_1047'>      was surrendered only two days after Julian first appeared under</a>
<a id='line_1048'>      the walls of Perisabor. Two thousand five hundred persons, of</a>
<a id='line_1049'>      both sexes, the feeble remnant of a flourishing people, were</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      permitted to retire; the plentiful magazines of corn, of arms,</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      and of splendid furniture, were partly distributed among the</a>
<a id='line_1052'>      troops, and partly reserved for the public service; the useless</a>
<a id='line_1053'>      stores were destroyed by fire or thrown into the stream of the</a>
<a id='line_1054'>      Euphrates; and the fate of Amida was revenged by the total ruin</a>

<a id='line_1064'>      The city or rather fortress, of Maogamalcha, which was defended</a>
<a id='line_1065'>      by sixteen large towers, a deep ditch, and two strong and solid</a>
<a id='line_1066'>      walls of brick and bitumen, appears to have been constructed at</a>
<a id='line_1067'>      the distance of eleven miles, as the safeguard of the capital of</a>
<a id='line_1068'>      Persia. The emperor, apprehensive of leaving such an important</a>
<a id='line_1069'>      fortress in his rear, immediately formed the siege of</a>
<a id='line_1070'>      Maogamalcha; and the Roman army was distributed, for that</a>
<a id='line_1071'>      purpose, into three divisions. Victor, at the head of the</a>
<a id='line_1072'>      cavalry, and of a detachment of heavy-armed foot, was ordered to</a>
<a id='line_1073'>      clear the country, as far as the banks of the Tigris, and the</a>
<a id='line_1074'>      suburbs of Ctesiphon. The conduct of the attack was assumed by</a>
<a id='line_1075'>      Julian himself, who seemed to place his whole dependence in the</a>
<a id='line_1076'>      military engines which he erected against the walls; while he</a>
<a id='line_1077'>      secretly contrived a more efficacious method of introducing his</a>
<a id='line_1078'>      troops into the heart of the city. Under the direction of Nevitta</a>
<a id='line_1079'>      and Dagalaiphus, the trenches were opened at a considerable</a>
<a id='line_1080'>      distance, and gradually prolonged as far as the edge of the</a>
<a id='line_1081'>      ditch. The ditch was speedily filled with earth; and, by the</a>
<a id='line_1082'>      incessant labor of the troops, a mine was carried under the</a>
<a id='line_1083'>      foundations of the walls, and sustained, at sufficient intervals,</a>
<a id='line_1084'>      by props of timber. Three chosen cohorts, advancing in a single</a>
<a id='line_1085'>      file, silently explored the dark and dangerous passage; till</a>
<a id='line_1086'>      their intrepid leader whispered back the intelligence, that he</a>
<a id='line_1087'>      was ready to issue from his confinement into the streets of the</a>
<a id='line_1088'>      hostile city. Julian checked their ardor, that he might insure</a>
<a id='line_1089'>      their success; and immediately diverted the attention of the</a>
<a id='line_1090'>      garrison, by the tumult and clamor of a general assault. The</a>
<a id='line_1091'>      Persians, who, from their walls, contemptuously beheld the</a>
<a id='line_1092'>      progress of an impotent attack, celebrated with songs of triumph</a>
<a id='line_1093'>      the glory of Sapor; and ventured to assure the emperor, that he</a>
<a id='line_1094'>      might ascend the starry mansion of Ormusd, before he could hope</a>
<a id='line_1095'>      to take the impregnable city of Maogamalcha. The city was already</a>
<a id='line_1096'>      taken. History has recorded the name of a private soldier the</a>
<a id='line_1097'>      first who ascended from the mine into a deserted tower. The</a>
<a id='line_1098'>      passage was widened by his companions, who pressed forwards with</a>
<a id='line_1099'>      impatient valor. Fifteen hundred enemies were already in the</a>
<a id='line_1100'>      midst of the city. The astonished garrison abandoned the walls,</a>
<a id='line_1101'>      and their only hope of safety; the gates were instantly burst</a>
<a id='line_1102'>      open; and the revenge of the soldier, unless it were suspended by</a>
<a id='line_1103'>      lust or avarice, was satiated by an undistinguishing massacre.</a>
<a id='line_1104'>      The governor, who had yielded on a promise of mercy, was burnt</a>
<a id='line_1105'>      alive, a few days afterwards, on a charge of having uttered some</a>
<a id='line_1106'>      disrespectful words against the honor of Prince Hormisdas. The</a>
<a id='line_1107'>      fortifications were razed to the ground; and not a vestige was</a>
<a id='line_1108'>      left, that the city of Maogamalcha had ever existed. The</a>
<a id='line_1109'>      neighborhood of the capital of Persia was adorned with three</a>
<a id='line_1110'>      stately palaces, laboriously enriched with every production that</a>
<a id='line_1111'>      could gratify the luxury and pride of an Eastern monarch. The</a>
<a id='line_1112'>      pleasant situation of the gardens along the banks of the Tigris,</a>
<a id='line_1113'>      was improved, according to the Persian taste, by the symmetry of</a>
<a id='line_1114'>      flowers, fountains, and shady walks: and spacious parks were</a>
<a id='line_1115'>      enclosed for the reception of the bears, lions, and wild boars,</a>
<a id='line_1116'>      which were maintained at a considerable expense for the pleasure</a>
<a id='line_1117'>      of the royal chase. The park walls were broken down, the savage</a>
<a id='line_1118'>      game was abandoned to the darts of the soldiers, and the palaces</a>
<a id='line_1119'>      of Sapor were reduced to ashes, by the command of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1120'>      emperor. Julian, on this occasion, showed himself ignorant, or</a>
<a id='line_1121'>      careless, of the laws of civility, which the prudence and</a>
<a id='line_1122'>      refinement of polished ages have established between hostile</a>
<a id='line_1123'>      princes. Yet these wanton ravages need not excite in our breasts</a>
<a id='line_1124'>      any vehement emotions of pity or resentment. A simple, naked</a>
<a id='line_1125'>      statue, finished by the hand of a Grecian artist, is of more</a>
<a id='line_1126'>      genuine value than all these rude and costly monuments of</a>
<a id='line_1127'>      Barbaric labor; and, if we are more deeply affected by the ruin</a>
<a id='line_1128'>      of a palace than by the conflagration of a cottage, our humanity</a>
<a id='line_1129'>      must have formed a very erroneous estimate of the miseries of</a>
<a id='line_1130'>      human life. 57</a>

<a id='line_1144'>      more conspicuously displayed, than in the last and most active</a>
<a id='line_1145'>      period of his life. He practised, without effort, and almost</a>
<a id='line_1146'>      without merit, the habitual qualities of temperance and sobriety.</a>
<a id='line_1147'>      According to the dictates of that artificial wisdom, which</a>
<a id='line_1148'>      assumes an absolute dominion over the mind and body, he sternly</a>
<a id='line_1149'>      refused himself the indulgence of the most natural appetites. 59</a>
<a id='line_1150'>      In the warm climate of Assyria, which solicited a luxurious</a>
<a id='line_1151'>      people to the gratification of every sensual desire, 60 a</a>
<a id='line_1152'>      youthful conqueror preserved his chastity pure and inviolate; nor</a>
<a id='line_1153'>      was Julian ever tempted, even by a motive of curiosity, to visit</a>
<a id='line_1154'>      his female captives of exquisite beauty, 61 who, instead of</a>
<a id='line_1155'>      resisting his power, would have disputed with each other the</a>
<a id='line_1156'>      honor of his embraces. With the same firmness that he resisted</a>
<a id='line_1157'>      the allurements of love, he sustained the hardships of war. When</a>
<a id='line_1158'>      the Romans marched through the flat and flooded country, their</a>
<a id='line_1159'>      sovereign, on foot, at the head of his legions, shared their</a>
<a id='line_1160'>      fatigues and animated their diligence. In every useful labor, the</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      hand of Julian was prompt and strenuous; and the Imperial purple</a>
<a id='line_1162'>      was wet and dirty as the coarse garment of the meanest soldier.</a>
<a id='line_1163'>      The two sieges allowed him some remarkable opportunities of</a>
<a id='line_1164'>      signalizing his personal valor, which, in the improved state of</a>
<a id='line_1165'>      the military art, can seldom be exerted by a prudent general. The</a>
<a id='line_1166'>      emperor stood before the citadel of Perisabor, insensible of his</a>
<a id='line_1167'>      extreme danger, and encouraged his troops to burst open the gates</a>
<a id='line_1168'>      of iron, till he was almost overwhelmed under a cloud of missile</a>
<a id='line_1169'>      weapons and huge stones, that were directed against his person.</a>
<a id='line_1170'>      As he examined the exterior fortifications of Maogamalcha, two</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      Persians, devoting themselves for their country, suddenly rushed</a>
<a id='line_1172'>      upon him with drawn cimeters: the emperor dexterously received</a>
<a id='line_1173'>      their blows on his uplifted shield; and, with a steady and</a>

<a id='line_1177'>      the authority which Julian derived from his personal merit,</a>
<a id='line_1178'>      enabled him to revive and enforce the rigor of ancient</a>
<a id='line_1179'>      discipline. He punished with death or ignominy the misbehavior of</a>
<a id='line_1180'>      three troops of horse, who, in a skirmish with the Surenas, had</a>
<a id='line_1181'>      lost their honor and one of their standards: and he distinguished</a>

<a id='line_1185'>      After the siege of Perisabor, the firmness of the emperor was</a>

<a id='line_1197'>      Barbarians. The revenue is exhausted; the cities are ruined; the</a>
<a id='line_1198'>      provinces are dispeopled. For myself, the only inheritance that I</a>
<a id='line_1199'>      have received from my royal ancestors is a soul incapable of</a>
<a id='line_1200'>      fear; and as long as I am convinced that every real advantage is</a>
<a id='line_1201'>      seated in the mind, I shall not blush to acknowledge an honorable</a>
<a id='line_1202'>      poverty, which, in the days of ancient virtue, was considered as</a>
<a id='line_1203'>      the glory of Fabricius. That glory, and that virtue, may be your</a>
<a id='line_1204'>      own, if you will listen to the voice of Heaven and of your</a>

<a id='line_1286'>      by a ditch and rampart, against the sallies of the numerous and</a>
<a id='line_1287'>      enterprising garrison of Coche. In this fruitful and pleasant</a>
<a id='line_1288'>      country, the Romans were plentifully supplied with water and</a>

<a id='line_1290'>      motions of the army, submitted, after some resistance, to the</a>
<a id='line_1291'>      efforts of their valor. The fleet passed from the Euphrates into</a>
<a id='line_1292'>      an artificial derivation of that river, which pours a copious and</a>

<a id='line_1295'>      name of Nahar-Malcha, 66 the intermediate situation of Coche</a>
<a id='line_1296'>      would have separated the fleet and army of Julian; and the rash</a>
<a id='line_1297'>      attempt of steering against the current of the Tigris, and</a>
<a id='line_1298'>      forcing their way through the midst of a hostile capital, must</a>
<a id='line_1299'>      have been attended with the total destruction of the Roman navy.</a>
<a id='line_1300'>      The prudence of the emperor foresaw the danger, and provided the</a>
<a id='line_1301'>      remedy. As he had minutely studied the operations of Trajan in</a>

<a id='line_1303'>      predecessor had dug a new and navigable canal, which, leaving</a>

<a id='line_1307'>      of this ancient work, which were almost obliterated by design or</a>

<a id='line_1333'>      Tigris, another labor presented itself, of less toil, but of more</a>
<a id='line_1334'>      danger, than the preceding expedition. The stream was broad and</a>
<a id='line_1335'>      rapid; the ascent steep and difficult; and the intrenchments</a>
<a id='line_1336'>      which had been formed on the ridge of the opposite bank, were</a>

<a id='line_1348'>      for some secret expedition, was ordered to stand to their arms on</a>
<a id='line_1349'>      the first signal. Julian disguised the silent anxiety of his own</a>
<a id='line_1350'>      mind with smiles of confidence and joy; and amused the hostile</a>
<a id='line_1351'>      nations with the spectacle of military games, which he</a>
<a id='line_1352'>      insultingly celebrated under the walls of Coche. The day was</a>
<a id='line_1353'>      consecrated to pleasure; but, as soon as the hour of supper was</a>
<a id='line_1354'>      passed, the emperor summoned the generals to his tent, and</a>
<a id='line_1355'>      acquainted them that he had fixed that night for the passage of</a>
<a id='line_1356'>      the Tigris. They stood in silent and respectful astonishment;</a>
<a id='line_1357'>      but, when the venerable Sallust assumed the privilege of his age</a>
<a id='line_1358'>      and experience, the rest of the chiefs supported with freedom the</a>
<a id='line_1359'>      weight of his prudent remonstrances. 68 Julian contented himself</a>
<a id='line_1360'>      with observing, that conquest and safety depended on the attempt;</a>
<a id='line_1361'>      that instead of diminishing, the number of their enemies would be</a>
<a id='line_1362'>      increased, by successive reenforcements; and that a longer delay</a>
<a id='line_1363'>      would neither contract the breadth of the stream, nor level the</a>
<a id='line_1364'>      height of the bank. The signal was instantly given, and obeyed;</a>
<a id='line_1365'>      the most impatient of the legionaries leaped into five vessels</a>
<a id='line_1366'>      that lay nearest to the bank; and as they plied their oars with</a>
<a id='line_1367'>      intrepid diligence, they were lost, after a few moments, in the</a>
<a id='line_1368'>      darkness of the night. A flame arose on the opposite side; and</a>
<a id='line_1369'>      Julian, who too clearly understood that his foremost vessels, in</a>
<a id='line_1370'>      attempting to land, had been fired by the enemy, dexterously</a>
<a id='line_1371'>      converted their extreme danger into a presage of victory. ÒOur</a>

<a id='line_1373'>      the bank; seeÑthey make the appointed signal; let us hasten to</a>
<a id='line_1374'>      emulate and assist their courage.Ó The united and rapid motion of</a>
<a id='line_1375'>      a great fleet broke the violence of the current, and they reached</a>
<a id='line_1376'>      the eastern shore of the Tigris with sufficient speed to</a>
<a id='line_1377'>      extinguish the flames, and rescue their adventurous companions.</a>
<a id='line_1378'>      The difficulties of a steep and lofty ascent were increased by</a>
<a id='line_1379'>      the weight of armor, and the darkness of the night. A shower of</a>
<a id='line_1380'>      stones, darts, and fire, was incessantly discharged on the heads</a>
<a id='line_1381'>      of the assailants; who, after an arduous struggle, climbed the</a>
<a id='line_1382'>      bank and stood victorious upon the rampart. As soon as they</a>
<a id='line_1383'>      possessed a more equal field, Julian, who, with his light</a>
<a id='line_1384'>      infantry, had led the attack, 69 darted through the ranks a</a>
<a id='line_1385'>      skilful and experienced eye: his bravest soldiers, according to</a>
<a id='line_1386'>      the precepts of Homer, 70 were distributed in the front and rear:</a>
<a id='line_1387'>      and all the trumpets of the Imperial army sounded to battle. The</a>
<a id='line_1388'>      Romans, after sending up a military shout, advanced in measured</a>
<a id='line_1389'>      steps to the animating notes of martial music; launched their</a>
<a id='line_1390'>      formidable javelins; and rushed forwards with drawn swords, to</a>
<a id='line_1391'>      deprive the Barbarians, by a closer onset, of the advantage of</a>
<a id='line_1392'>      their missile weapons. The whole engagement lasted above twelve</a>
<a id='line_1393'>      hours; till the gradual retreat of the Persians was changed into</a>
<a id='line_1394'>      a disorderly flight, of which the shameful example was given by</a>
<a id='line_1395'>      the principal leader, and the Surenas himself. They were pursued</a>
<a id='line_1396'>      to the gates of Ctesiphon; and the conquerors might have entered</a>
<a id='line_1397'>      the dismayed city, 71 if their general, Victor, who was</a>
<a id='line_1398'>      dangerously wounded with an arrow, had not conjured them to</a>
<a id='line_1399'>      desist from a rash attempt, which must be fatal, if it were not</a>
<a id='line_1400'>      successful. On _their_ side, the Romans acknowledged the loss of</a>

<a id='line_1402'>      had left on the field of battle two thousand five hundred, or</a>
<a id='line_1403'>      even six thousand, of their bravest soldiers. The spoil was such</a>
<a id='line_1404'>      as might be expected from the riches and luxury of an Oriental</a>
<a id='line_1405'>      camp; large quantities of silver and gold, splendid arms and</a>

<a id='line_1477'>      of Ctesiphon, as a fruitless and pernicious undertaking. It is</a>
<a id='line_1478'>      not easy for us to conceive, by what arts of fortification a city</a>
<a id='line_1479'>      thrice besieged and taken by the predecessors of Julian could be</a>
<a id='line_1480'>      rendered impregnable against an army of sixty thousand Romans,</a>
<a id='line_1481'>      commanded by a brave and experienced general, and abundantly</a>
<a id='line_1482'>      supplied with ships, provisions, battering engines, and military</a>
<a id='line_1483'>      stores. But we may rest assured, from the love of glory, and</a>
<a id='line_1484'>      contempt of danger, which formed the character of Julian, that he</a>
<a id='line_1485'>      was not discouraged by any trivial or imaginary obstacles. 75 At</a>
<a id='line_1486'>      the very time when he declined the siege of Ctesiphon, he</a>
<a id='line_1487'>      rejected, with obstinacy and disdain, the most flattering offers</a>
<a id='line_1488'>      of a negotiation of peace. Sapor, who had been so long accustomed</a>
<a id='line_1489'>      to the tardy ostentation of Constantius, was surprised by the</a>
<a id='line_1490'>      intrepid diligence of his successor. As far as the confines of</a>
<a id='line_1491'>      India and Scythia, the satraps of the distant provinces were</a>
<a id='line_1492'>      ordered to assemble their troops, and to march, without delay, to</a>
<a id='line_1493'>      the assistance of their monarch. But their preparations were</a>
<a id='line_1494'>      dilatory, their motions slow; and before Sapor could lead an army</a>
<a id='line_1495'>      into the field, he received the melancholy intelligence of the</a>
<a id='line_1496'>      devastation of Assyria, the ruin of his palaces, and the</a>
<a id='line_1497'>      slaughter of his bravest troops, who defended the passage of the</a>
<a id='line_1498'>      Tigris. The pride of royalty was humbled in the dust; he took his</a>
<a id='line_1499'>      repasts on the ground; and the disorder of his hair expressed the</a>
<a id='line_1500'>      grief and anxiety of his mind. Perhaps he would not have refused</a>
<a id='line_1501'>      to purchase, with one half of his kingdom, the safety of the</a>
<a id='line_1502'>      remainder; and he would have gladly subscribed himself, in a</a>
<a id='line_1503'>      treaty of peace, the faithful and dependent ally of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1504'>      conqueror. Under the pretence of private business, a minister of</a>
<a id='line_1505'>      rank and confidence was secretly despatched to embrace the knees</a>
<a id='line_1506'>      of Hormisdas, and to request, in the language of a suppliant,</a>
<a id='line_1507'>      that he might be introduced into the presence of the emperor. The</a>
<a id='line_1508'>      Sassanian prince, whether he listened to the voice of pride or</a>
<a id='line_1509'>      humanity, whether he consulted the sentiments of his birth, or</a>
<a id='line_1510'>      the duties of his situation, was equally inclined to promote a</a>
<a id='line_1511'>      salutary measure, which would terminate the calamities of Persia,</a>
<a id='line_1512'>      and secure the triumph of Rome. He was astonished by the</a>
<a id='line_1513'>      inflexible firmness of a hero, who remembered, most unfortunately</a>
<a id='line_1514'>      for himself and for his country, that Alexander had uniformly</a>
<a id='line_1515'>      rejected the propositions of Darius. But as Julian was sensible,</a>
<a id='line_1516'>      that the hope of a safe and honorable peace might cool the ardor</a>
<a id='line_1517'>      of his troops, he earnestly requested that Hormisdas would</a>
<a id='line_1518'>      privately dismiss the minister of Sapor, and conceal this</a>

<a id='line_1550'>      The honor, as well as interest, of Julian, forbade him to consume</a>
<a id='line_1551'>      his time under the impregnable walls of Ctesiphon and as often as</a>
<a id='line_1552'>      he defied the Barbarians, who defended the city, to meet him on</a>

<a id='line_1554'>      exercise his valor, he might seek the army of the Great King. He</a>
<a id='line_1555'>      felt the insult, and he accepted the advice. Instead of confining</a>
<a id='line_1556'>      his servile march to the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris, he</a>
<a id='line_1557'>      resolved to imitate the adventurous spirit of Alexander, and</a>
<a id='line_1558'>      boldly to advance into the inland provinces, till he forced his</a>
<a id='line_1559'>      rival to contend with him, perhaps in the plains of Arbela, for</a>
<a id='line_1560'>      the empire of Asia. The magnanimity of Julian was applauded and</a>
<a id='line_1561'>      betrayed, by the arts of a noble Persian, who, in the cause of</a>
<a id='line_1562'>      his country, had generously submitted to act a part full of</a>
<a id='line_1563'>      danger, of falsehood, and of shame. 77 With a train of faithful</a>
<a id='line_1564'>      followers, he deserted to the Imperial camp; exposed, in a</a>
<a id='line_1565'>      specious tale, the injuries which he had sustained; exaggerated</a>
<a id='line_1566'>      the cruelty of Sapor, the discontent of the people, and the</a>
<a id='line_1567'>      weakness of the monarchy; and confidently offered himself as the</a>
<a id='line_1568'>      hostage and guide of the Roman march. The most rational grounds</a>
<a id='line_1569'>      of suspicion were urged, without effect, by the wisdom and</a>
<a id='line_1570'>      experience of Hormisdas; and the credulous Julian, receiving the</a>
<a id='line_1571'>      traitor into his bosom, was persuaded to issue a hasty order,</a>
<a id='line_1572'>      which, in the opinion of mankind, appeared to arraign his</a>
<a id='line_1573'>      prudence, and to endanger his safety. He destroyed, in a single</a>
<a id='line_1574'>      hour, the whole navy, which had been transported above five</a>
<a id='line_1575'>      hundred miles, at so great an expense of toil, of treasure, and</a>
<a id='line_1576'>      of blood. Twelve, or, at the most, twenty-two small vessels were</a>
<a id='line_1577'>      saved, to accompany, on carriages, the march of the army, and to</a>
<a id='line_1578'>      form occasional bridges for the passage of the rivers. A supply</a>
<a id='line_1579'>      of twenty daysÕ provisions was reserved for the use of the</a>
<a id='line_1580'>      soldiers; and the rest of the magazines, with a fleet of eleven</a>
<a id='line_1581'>      hundred vessels, which rode at anchor in the Tigris, were</a>
<a id='line_1582'>      abandoned to the flames, by the absolute command of the emperor.</a>
<a id='line_1583'>      The Christian bishops, Gregory and Augustin, insult the madness</a>
<a id='line_1584'>      of the Apostate, who executed, with his own hands, the sentence</a>
<a id='line_1585'>      of divine justice. Their authority, of less weight, perhaps, in a</a>
<a id='line_1586'>      military question, is confirmed by the cool judgment of an</a>
<a id='line_1587'>      experienced soldier, who was himself spectator of the</a>
<a id='line_1588'>      conflagration, and who could not disapprove the reluctant murmurs</a>
<a id='line_1589'>      of the troops. 78 Yet there are not wanting some specious, and</a>
<a id='line_1590'>      perhaps solid, reasons, which might justify the resolution of</a>
<a id='line_1591'>      Julian. The navigation of the Euphrates never ascended above</a>
<a id='line_1592'>      Babylon, nor that of the Tigris above Opis. 79 The distance of</a>
<a id='line_1593'>      the last-mentioned city from the Roman camp was not very</a>
<a id='line_1594'>      considerable: and Julian must soon have renounced the vain and</a>
<a id='line_1595'>      impracticable attempt of forcing upwards a great fleet against</a>
<a id='line_1596'>      the stream of a rapid river, 80 which in several places was</a>
<a id='line_1597'>      embarrassed by natural or artificial cataracts. 81 The power of</a>
<a id='line_1598'>      sails and oars was insufficient; it became necessary to tow the</a>
<a id='line_1599'>      ships against the current of the river; the strength of twenty</a>
<a id='line_1600'>      thousand soldiers was exhausted in this tedious and servile</a>
<a id='line_1601'>      labor, and if the Romans continued to march along the banks of</a>
<a id='line_1602'>      the Tigris, they could only expect to return home without</a>
<a id='line_1603'>      achieving any enterprise worthy of the genius or fortune of their</a>
<a id='line_1604'>      leader. If, on the contrary, it was advisable to advance into the</a>
<a id='line_1605'>      inland country, the destruction of the fleet and magazines was</a>
<a id='line_1606'>      the only measure which could save that valuable prize from the</a>

<a id='line_1657'>      swarms of innumerable insects. 85 The appearance of the hostile</a>
<a id='line_1658'>      country was far more inviting. The extensive region that lies</a>
<a id='line_1659'>      between the River Tigris and the mountains of Media, was filled</a>
<a id='line_1660'>      with villages and towns; and the fertile soil, for the most part,</a>
<a id='line_1661'>      was in a very improved state of cultivation. Julian might expect,</a>
<a id='line_1662'>      that a conqueror, who possessed the two forcible instruments of</a>
<a id='line_1663'>      persuasion, steel and gold, would easily procure a plentiful</a>
<a id='line_1664'>      subsistence from the fears or avarice of the natives. But, on the</a>
<a id='line_1665'>      approach of the Romans, the rich and smiling prospect was</a>
<a id='line_1666'>      instantly blasted. Wherever they moved, the inhabitants deserted</a>
<a id='line_1667'>      the open villages, and took shelter in the fortified towns; the</a>
<a id='line_1668'>      cattle was driven away; the grass and ripe corn were consumed</a>
<a id='line_1669'>      with fire; and, as soon as the flames had subsided which</a>
<a id='line_1670'>      interrupted the march of Julian, he beheld the melancholy face of</a>
<a id='line_1671'>      a smoking and naked desert. This desperate but effectual method</a>
<a id='line_1672'>      of defence can only be executed by the enthusiasm of a people who</a>
<a id='line_1673'>      prefer their independence to their property; or by the rigor of</a>
<a id='line_1674'>      an arbitrary government, which consults the public safety without</a>
<a id='line_1675'>      submitting to their inclinations the liberty of choice. On the</a>
<a id='line_1676'>      present occasion the zeal and obedience of the Persians seconded</a>
<a id='line_1677'>      the commands of Sapor; and the emperor was soon reduced to the</a>
<a id='line_1678'>      scanty stock of provisions, which continually wasted in his</a>
<a id='line_1679'>      hands. Before they were entirely consumed, he might still have</a>
<a id='line_1680'>      reached the wealthy and unwarlike cities of Ecbatana or Susa, by</a>
<a id='line_1681'>      the effort of a rapid and well-directed march; 86 but he was</a>
<a id='line_1682'>      deprived of this last resource by his ignorance of the roads, and</a>
<a id='line_1683'>      by the perfidy of his guides. The Romans wandered several days in</a>
<a id='line_1684'>      the country to the eastward of Bagdad; the Persian deserter, who</a>
<a id='line_1685'>      had artfully led them into the snare, escaped from their</a>
<a id='line_1686'>      resentment; and his followers, as soon as they were put to the</a>

<a id='line_1691'>      hopes of safety or success, without obtaining a satisfactory</a>

<a id='line_1740'>      safe and speedy retreat, endeavored to persuade themselves, that</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      this formidable appearance was occasioned by a troop of wild</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      asses, or perhaps by the approach of some friendly Arabs. They</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      halted, pitched their tents, fortified their camp, passed the</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      whole night in continual alarms; and discovered at the dawn of</a>

<a id='line_1746'>      which might be considered only as the van of the Barbarians, was</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      soon followed by the main body of cuirassiers, archers, and</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      elephants, commanded by Meranes, a general of rank and</a>
<a id='line_1749'>      reputation. He was accompanied by two of the kingÕs sons, and</a>
<a id='line_1750'>      many of the principal satraps; and fame and expectation</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      exaggerated the strength of the remaining powers, which slowly</a>
<a id='line_1752'>      advanced under the conduct of Sapor himself. As the Romans</a>
<a id='line_1753'>      continued their march, their long array, which was forced to bend</a>
<a id='line_1754'>      or divide, according to the varieties of the ground, afforded</a>
<a id='line_1755'>      frequent and favorable opportunities to their vigilant enemies.</a>
<a id='line_1756'>      The Persians repeatedly charged with fury; they were repeatedly</a>
<a id='line_1757'>      repulsed with firmness; and the action at Maronga, which almost</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      deserved the name of a battle, was marked by a considerable loss</a>
<a id='line_1759'>      of satraps and elephants, perhaps of equal value in the eyes of</a>
<a id='line_1760'>      their monarch. These splendid advantages were not obtained</a>
<a id='line_1761'>      without an adequate slaughter on the side of the Romans: several</a>
<a id='line_1762'>      officers of distinction were either killed or wounded; and the</a>
<a id='line_1763'>      emperor himself, who, on all occasions of danger, inspired and</a>
<a id='line_1764'>      guided the valor of his troops, was obliged to expose his person,</a>
<a id='line_1765'>      and exert his abilities. The weight of offensive and defensive</a>
<a id='line_1766'>      arms, which still constituted the strength and safety of the</a>
<a id='line_1767'>      Romans, disabled them from making any long or effectual pursuit;</a>
<a id='line_1768'>      and as the horsemen of the East were trained to dart their</a>
<a id='line_1769'>      javelins, and shoot their arrows, at full speed, and in every</a>
<a id='line_1770'>      possible direction, 88 the cavalry of Persia was never more</a>
<a id='line_1771'>      formidable than in the moment of a rapid and disorderly flight.</a>
<a id='line_1772'>      But the most certain and irreparable loss of the Romans was that</a>
<a id='line_1773'>      of time. The hardy veterans, accustomed to the cold climate of</a>
<a id='line_1774'>      Gaul and Germany, fainted under the sultry heat of an Assyrian</a>
<a id='line_1775'>      summer; their vigor was exhausted by the incessant repetition of</a>

<a id='line_1785'>      aggravate the sense of the public distress; and the Romans began</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      to entertain the most gloomy apprehensions that, before they</a>

<a id='line_1812'>      in short and interrupted slumbers, his mind was agitated with</a>
<a id='line_1813'>      painful anxiety; nor can it be thought surprising, that the</a>

<a id='line_1819'>      shot athwart the sky, and suddenly vanished. Julian was convinced</a>

<a id='line_1821'>      the council which he summoned, of Tuscan Haruspices, 92</a>
<a id='line_1822'>      unanimously pronounced that he should abstain from action; but on</a>
<a id='line_1823'>      this occasion, necessity and reason were more prevalent than</a>
<a id='line_1824'>      superstition; and the trumpets sounded at the break of day. The</a>
<a id='line_1825'>      army marched through a hilly country; and the hills had been</a>
<a id='line_1826'>      secretly occupied by the Persians. Julian led the van with the</a>
<a id='line_1827'>      skill and attention of a consummate general; he was alarmed by</a>
<a id='line_1828'>      the intelligence that his rear was suddenly attacked. The heat of</a>
<a id='line_1829'>      the weather had tempted him to lay aside his cuirass; but he</a>
<a id='line_1830'>      snatched a shield from one of his attendants, and hastened, with</a>
<a id='line_1831'>      a sufficient reenforcement, to the relief of the rear-guard. A</a>
<a id='line_1832'>      similar danger recalled the intrepid prince to the defence of the</a>
<a id='line_1833'>      front; and, as he galloped through the columns, the centre of the</a>
<a id='line_1834'>      left was attacked, and almost overpowered by the furious charge</a>
<a id='line_1835'>      of the Persian cavalry and elephants. This huge body was soon</a>
<a id='line_1836'>      defeated, by the well-timed evolution of the light infantry, who</a>
<a id='line_1837'>      aimed their weapons, with dexterity and effect, against the backs</a>
<a id='line_1838'>      of the horsemen, and the legs of the elephants. The Barbarians</a>
<a id='line_1839'>      fled; and Julian, who was foremost in every danger, animated the</a>
<a id='line_1840'>      pursuit with his voice and gestures. His trembling guards,</a>
<a id='line_1841'>      scattered and oppressed by the disorderly throng of friends and</a>
<a id='line_1842'>      enemies, reminded their fearless sovereign that he was without</a>
<a id='line_1843'>      armor; and conjured him to decline the fall of the impending</a>
<a id='line_1844'>      ruin. As they exclaimed, 93 a cloud of darts and arrows was</a>
<a id='line_1845'>      discharged from the flying squadrons; and a javelin, after razing</a>
<a id='line_1846'>      the skin of his arm, transpierced the ribs, and fixed in the</a>
<a id='line_1847'>      inferior part of the liver. Julian attempted to draw the deadly</a>
<a id='line_1848'>      weapon from his side; but his fingers were cut by the sharpness</a>
<a id='line_1849'>      of the steel, and he fell senseless from his horse. His guards</a>
<a id='line_1850'>      flew to his relief; and the wounded emperor was gently raised</a>
<a id='line_1851'>      from the ground, and conveyed out of the tumult of the battle</a>
<a id='line_1852'>      into an adjacent tent. The report of the melancholy event passed</a>
<a id='line_1853'>      from rank to rank; but the grief of the Romans inspired them with</a>
<a id='line_1854'>      invincible valor, and the desire of revenge. The bloody and</a>

<a id='line_1939'>      Julian pronounced in a firm and gentle tone of voice, he</a>
<a id='line_1940'>      distributed, by a military testament, 97 the remains of his</a>
<a id='line_1941'>      private fortune; and making some inquiry why Anatolius was not</a>
<a id='line_1942'>      present, he understood, from the answer of Sallust, that</a>
<a id='line_1943'>      Anatolius was killed; and bewailed, with amiable inconsistency,</a>
<a id='line_1944'>      the loss of his friend. At the same time he reproved the</a>
<a id='line_1945'>      immoderate grief of the spectators; and conjured them not to</a>
<a id='line_1946'>      disgrace, by unmanly tears, the fate of a prince, who in a few</a>
<a id='line_1947'>      moments would be united with heaven, and with the stars. 98 The</a>
<a id='line_1948'>      spectators were silent; and Julian entered into a metaphysical</a>
<a id='line_1949'>      argument with the philosophers Priscus and Maximus, on the nature</a>
<a id='line_1950'>      of the soul. The efforts which he made, of mind as well as body,</a>
<a id='line_1951'>      most probably hastened his death. His wound began to bleed with</a>
<a id='line_1952'>      fresh violence; his respiration was embarrassed by the swelling</a>
<a id='line_1953'>      of the veins; he called for a draught of cold water, and, as soon</a>
<a id='line_1954'>      as he had drank it, expired without pain, about the hour of</a>
<a id='line_1955'>      midnight. Such was the end of that extraordinary man, in the</a>
<a id='line_1956'>      thirty-second year of his age, after a reign of one year and</a>
<a id='line_1957'>      about eight months, from the death of Constantius. In his last</a>

<a id='line_2044'>      some disposition to adopt the salutary advice of an inferior</a>

<a id='line_2049'>      should proceed with united and deliberate counsels in the</a>
<a id='line_2050'>      election of a lawful sovereign. While they debated, a few voices</a>
<a id='line_2051'>      saluted Jovian, who was no more than _first_ 101 of the</a>
<a id='line_2052'>      domestics, with the names of Emperor and Augustus. The tumultuary</a>
<a id='line_2053'>      acclamation 10111 was instantly repeated by the guards who</a>
<a id='line_2054'>      surrounded the tent, and passed, in a few minutes, to the</a>
<a id='line_2055'>      extremities of the line. The new prince, astonished with his own</a>

<a id='line_2057'>      received an oath of fidelity from the generals, whose favor and</a>

<a id='line_2059'>      of Jovian was the merit of his father, Count Varronian, who</a>
<a id='line_2060'>      enjoyed, in honorable retirement, the fruit of his long services.</a>
<a id='line_2061'>      In the obscure freedom of a private station, the son indulged his</a>

<a id='line_2395'>      purchased with ten pieces of gold: 117 the beasts of burden were</a>
<a id='line_2396'>      slaughtered and devoured; and the desert was strewed with the</a>

<a id='line_2457'>      emperor, and the conditions of the ignominious treaty. The minds</a>
<a id='line_2458'>      of the people were filled with astonishment and grief, with</a>
<a id='line_2459'>      indignation and terror, when they were informed, that the</a>
<a id='line_2460'>      unworthy successor of Julian relinquished the five provinces</a>

<a id='line_2541'>      passed the cheerful and careless hours of infancy. The highways</a>
<a id='line_2542'>      were crowded with a trembling multitude: the distinctions of</a>
