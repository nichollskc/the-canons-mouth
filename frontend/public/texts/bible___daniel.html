                    <a id='line_0'>The Book of Daniel</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came</a>
<a id='line_4'>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</a>
<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'>1:2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part</a>
<a id='line_7'>of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of</a>
<a id='line_8'>Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the</a>
<a id='line_9'>treasure house of his god.</a>
<a id='line_10'></a>
<a id='line_11'>1:3 And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that</a>
<a id='line_12'>he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king’s</a>
<a id='line_13'>seed, and of the princes; 1:4 Children in whom was no blemish, but</a>
<a id='line_14'>well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge,</a>
<a id='line_15'>and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in</a>
<a id='line_16'>the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the</a>
<a id='line_17'>tongue of the Chaldeans.</a>
<a id='line_18'></a>
<a id='line_19'>1:5 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s meat,</a>
<a id='line_20'>and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that</a>
<a id='line_21'>at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</a>
<a id='line_22'></a>
<a id='line_23'>1:6 Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah,</a>
<a id='line_24'>Mishael, and Azariah: 1:7 Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave</a>
<a id='line_25'>names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to</a>
<a id='line_26'>Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of</a>
<a id='line_27'>Abednego.</a>
<a id='line_28'></a>
<a id='line_29'>1:8 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself</a>
<a id='line_30'>with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank:</a>
<a id='line_31'>therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not</a>
<a id='line_32'>defile himself.</a>
<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'>1:9 Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the</a>
<a id='line_35'>prince of the eunuchs.</a>
<a id='line_36'></a>
<a id='line_37'>1:10 And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord</a>
<a id='line_38'>the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should</a>
<a id='line_39'>he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your</a>
<a id='line_40'>sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.</a>
<a id='line_41'></a>
<a id='line_42'>1:11 Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had</a>
<a id='line_43'>set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 1:12 Prove thy</a>
<a id='line_44'>servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat,</a>
<a id='line_45'>and water to drink.</a>
<a id='line_46'></a>
<a id='line_47'>1:13 Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the</a>
<a id='line_48'>countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s</a>
<a id='line_49'>meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</a>
<a id='line_50'></a>
<a id='line_51'>1:14 So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>1:15 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and</a>
<a id='line_54'>fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the</a>
<a id='line_55'>king’s meat.</a>
<a id='line_56'></a>
<a id='line_57'>1:16 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine</a>
<a id='line_58'>that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</a>
<a id='line_59'></a>
<a id='line_60'>1:17 As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in</a>
<a id='line_61'>all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions</a>
<a id='line_62'>and dreams.</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>1:18 Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring</a>
<a id='line_65'>them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before</a>
<a id='line_66'>Nebuchadnezzar.</a>
<a id='line_67'></a>
<a id='line_68'>1:19 And the king communed with them; and among them all was found</a>
<a id='line_69'>none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they</a>
<a id='line_70'>before the king.</a>
<a id='line_71'></a>
<a id='line_72'>1:20 And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king</a>
<a id='line_73'>enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the</a>
<a id='line_74'>magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>1:21 And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.</a>
<a id='line_77'></a>
<a id='line_78'>2:1 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar</a>
<a id='line_79'>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and</a>
<a id='line_80'>his sleep brake from him.</a>
<a id='line_81'></a>
<a id='line_82'>2:2 Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the</a>
<a id='line_83'>astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the</a>
<a id='line_84'>king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>2:3 And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit</a>
<a id='line_87'>was troubled to know the dream.</a>
<a id='line_88'></a>
<a id='line_89'>2:4 Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for</a>
<a id='line_90'>ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the</a>
<a id='line_91'>interpretation.</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>2:5 The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone</a>
<a id='line_94'>from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the</a>
<a id='line_95'>interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses</a>
<a id='line_96'>shall be made a dunghill.</a>
<a id='line_97'></a>
<a id='line_98'>2:6 But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_99'>receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me</a>
<a id='line_100'>the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>2:7 They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the</a>
<a id='line_103'>dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.</a>
<a id='line_104'></a>
<a id='line_105'>2:8 The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain</a>
<a id='line_106'>the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'>2:9 But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one</a>
<a id='line_109'>decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak</a>
<a id='line_110'>before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and</a>
<a id='line_111'>I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.</a>
<a id='line_112'></a>
<a id='line_113'>2:10 The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a</a>
<a id='line_114'>man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore there is</a>
<a id='line_115'>no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or</a>
<a id='line_116'>astrologer, or Chaldean.</a>
<a id='line_117'></a>
<a id='line_118'>2:11 And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none</a>
<a id='line_119'>other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose</a>
<a id='line_120'>dwelling is not with flesh.</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>2:12 For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded</a>
<a id='line_123'>to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_124'></a>
<a id='line_125'>2:13 And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and</a>
<a id='line_126'>they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>2:14 Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the</a>
<a id='line_129'>captain of the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men</a>
<a id='line_130'>of Babylon: 2:15 He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain,</a>
<a id='line_131'>Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing</a>
<a id='line_132'>known to Daniel.</a>
<a id='line_133'></a>
<a id='line_134'>2:16 Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give</a>
<a id='line_135'>him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.</a>
<a id='line_136'></a>
<a id='line_137'>2:17 Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to</a>
<a id='line_138'>Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: 2:18 That they would</a>
<a id='line_139'>desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that</a>
<a id='line_140'>Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men</a>
<a id='line_141'>of Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_142'></a>
<a id='line_143'>2:19 Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then</a>
<a id='line_144'>Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_145'></a>
<a id='line_146'>2:20 Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and</a>
<a id='line_147'>ever: for wisdom and might are his: 2:21 And he changeth the times and</a>
<a id='line_148'>the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom</a>
<a id='line_149'>unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding: 2:22 He</a>
<a id='line_150'>revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the</a>
<a id='line_151'>darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</a>
<a id='line_152'></a>
<a id='line_153'>2:23 I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast</a>
<a id='line_154'>given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we</a>
<a id='line_155'>desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king’s</a>
<a id='line_156'>matter.</a>
<a id='line_157'></a>
<a id='line_158'>2:24 Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained</a>
<a id='line_159'>to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him;</a>
<a id='line_160'>Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and</a>
<a id='line_161'>I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</a>
<a id='line_162'></a>
<a id='line_163'>2:25 Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said</a>
<a id='line_164'>thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will</a>
<a id='line_165'>make known unto the king the interpretation.</a>
<a id='line_166'></a>
<a id='line_167'>2:26 The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was</a>
<a id='line_168'>Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I</a>
<a id='line_169'>have seen, and the interpretation thereof?  2:27 Daniel answered in</a>
<a id='line_170'>the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath</a>
<a id='line_171'>demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the</a>
<a id='line_172'>soothsayers, shew unto the king; 2:28 But there is a God in heaven</a>
<a id='line_173'>that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar</a>
<a id='line_174'>what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy</a>
<a id='line_175'>head upon thy bed, are these; 2:29 As for thee, O king, thy thoughts</a>
<a id='line_176'>came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter:</a>
<a id='line_177'>and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to</a>
<a id='line_178'>pass.</a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>2:30 But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom</a>
<a id='line_181'>that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make</a>
<a id='line_182'>known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the</a>
<a id='line_183'>thoughts of thy heart.</a>
<a id='line_184'></a>
<a id='line_185'>2:31 Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image,</a>
<a id='line_186'>whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form</a>
<a id='line_187'>thereof was terrible.</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>2:32 This image’s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of</a>
<a id='line_190'>silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, 2:33 His legs of iron, his</a>
<a id='line_191'>feet part of iron and part of clay.</a>
<a id='line_192'></a>
<a id='line_193'>2:34 Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which</a>
<a id='line_194'>smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake</a>
<a id='line_195'>them to pieces.</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>2:35 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold,</a>
<a id='line_198'>broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer</a>
<a id='line_199'>threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was</a>
<a id='line_200'>found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great</a>
<a id='line_201'>mountain, and filled the whole earth.</a>
<a id='line_202'></a>
<a id='line_203'>2:36 This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof</a>
<a id='line_204'>before the king.</a>
<a id='line_205'></a>
<a id='line_206'>2:37 Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath</a>
<a id='line_207'>given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</a>
<a id='line_208'></a>
<a id='line_209'>2:38 And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the</a>
<a id='line_210'>field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and</a>
<a id='line_211'>hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.</a>
<a id='line_212'></a>
<a id='line_213'>2:39 And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and</a>
<a id='line_214'>another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the</a>
<a id='line_215'>earth.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>2:40 And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron</a>
<a id='line_218'>breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh</a>
<a id='line_219'>all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</a>
<a id='line_220'></a>
<a id='line_221'>2:41 And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay,</a>
<a id='line_222'>and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in</a>
<a id='line_223'>it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron</a>
<a id='line_224'>mixed with miry clay.</a>
<a id='line_225'></a>
<a id='line_226'>2:42 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay,</a>
<a id='line_227'>so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</a>
<a id='line_228'></a>
<a id='line_229'>2:43 And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall</a>
<a id='line_230'>mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one</a>
<a id='line_231'>to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</a>
<a id='line_232'></a>
<a id='line_233'>2:44 And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a</a>
<a id='line_234'>kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be</a>
<a id='line_235'>left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all</a>
<a id='line_236'>these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</a>
<a id='line_237'></a>
<a id='line_238'>2:45 Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the</a>
<a id='line_239'>mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the</a>
<a id='line_240'>brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made</a>
<a id='line_241'>known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is</a>
<a id='line_242'>certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</a>
<a id='line_243'></a>
<a id='line_244'>2:46 Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped</a>
<a id='line_245'>Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet</a>
<a id='line_246'>odours unto him.</a>
<a id='line_247'></a>
<a id='line_248'>2:47 The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that</a>
<a id='line_249'>your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of</a>
<a id='line_250'>secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.</a>
<a id='line_251'></a>
<a id='line_252'>2:48 Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great</a>
<a id='line_253'>gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and</a>
<a id='line_254'>chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'>2:49 Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach,</a>
<a id='line_257'>and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel</a>
<a id='line_258'>sat in the gate of the king.</a>
<a id='line_259'></a>
<a id='line_260'>3:1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was</a>
<a id='line_261'>threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in</a>
<a id='line_262'>the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>3:2 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes,</a>
<a id='line_265'>the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the</a>
<a id='line_266'>counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to</a>
<a id='line_267'>come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had</a>
<a id='line_268'>set up.</a>
<a id='line_269'></a>
<a id='line_270'>3:3 Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the</a>
<a id='line_271'>treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the</a>
<a id='line_272'>provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image</a>
<a id='line_273'>that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the</a>
<a id='line_274'>image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</a>
<a id='line_275'></a>
<a id='line_276'>3:4 Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people,</a>
<a id='line_277'>nations, and languages, 3:5 That at what time ye hear the sound of the</a>
<a id='line_278'>cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of</a>
<a id='line_279'>musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar</a>
<a id='line_280'>the king hath set up: 3:6 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth</a>
<a id='line_281'>shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</a>
<a id='line_282'></a>
<a id='line_283'>3:7 Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the</a>
<a id='line_284'>cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all</a>
<a id='line_285'>the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped</a>
<a id='line_286'>the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</a>
<a id='line_287'></a>
<a id='line_288'>3:8 Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused</a>
<a id='line_289'>the Jews.</a>
<a id='line_290'></a>
<a id='line_291'>3:9 They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for</a>
<a id='line_292'>ever.</a>
<a id='line_293'></a>
<a id='line_294'>3:10 Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear</a>
<a id='line_295'>the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer,</a>
<a id='line_296'>and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:</a>
<a id='line_297'>3:11 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be</a>
<a id='line_298'>cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</a>
<a id='line_299'></a>
<a id='line_300'>3:12 There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the</a>
<a id='line_301'>province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O</a>
<a id='line_302'>king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the</a>
<a id='line_303'>golden image which thou hast set up.</a>
<a id='line_304'></a>
<a id='line_305'>3:13 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring</a>
<a id='line_306'>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before</a>
<a id='line_307'>the king.</a>
<a id='line_308'></a>
<a id='line_309'>3:14 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach,</a>
<a id='line_310'>Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden</a>
<a id='line_311'>image which I have set up?  3:15 Now if ye be ready that at what time</a>
<a id='line_312'>ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and</a>
<a id='line_313'>dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image</a>
<a id='line_314'>which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the</a>
<a id='line_315'>same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that</a>
<a id='line_316'>God that shall deliver you out of my hands?  3:16 Shadrach, Meshach,</a>
<a id='line_317'>and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are</a>
<a id='line_318'>not careful to answer thee in this matter.</a>
<a id='line_319'></a>
<a id='line_320'>3:17 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the</a>
<a id='line_321'>burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O</a>
<a id='line_322'>king.</a>
<a id='line_323'></a>
<a id='line_324'>3:18 But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve</a>
<a id='line_325'>thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</a>
<a id='line_326'></a>
<a id='line_327'>3:19 Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage</a>
<a id='line_328'>was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he</a>
<a id='line_329'>spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times</a>
<a id='line_330'>more than it was wont to be heated.</a>
<a id='line_331'></a>
<a id='line_332'>3:20 And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to</a>
<a id='line_333'>bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the</a>
<a id='line_334'>burning fiery furnace.</a>
<a id='line_335'></a>
<a id='line_336'>3:21 Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their</a>
<a id='line_337'>hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_338'>burning fiery furnace.</a>
<a id='line_339'></a>
<a id='line_340'>3:22 Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the</a>
<a id='line_341'>furnace exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men that took</a>
<a id='line_342'>up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</a>
<a id='line_343'></a>
<a id='line_344'>3:23 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down</a>
<a id='line_345'>bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</a>
<a id='line_346'></a>
<a id='line_347'>3:24 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste,</a>
<a id='line_348'>and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men</a>
<a id='line_349'>bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the</a>
<a id='line_350'>king, True, O king.</a>
<a id='line_351'></a>
<a id='line_352'>3:25 He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the</a>
<a id='line_353'>midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth</a>
<a id='line_354'>is like the Son of God.</a>
<a id='line_355'></a>
<a id='line_356'>3:26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery</a>
<a id='line_357'>furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye</a>
<a id='line_358'>servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then</a>
<a id='line_359'>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.</a>
<a id='line_360'></a>
<a id='line_361'>3:27 And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s</a>
<a id='line_362'>counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies</a>
<a id='line_363'>the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither</a>
<a id='line_364'>were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</a>
<a id='line_365'></a>
<a id='line_366'>3:28 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of</a>
<a id='line_367'>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and</a>
<a id='line_368'>delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the</a>
<a id='line_369'>king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor</a>
<a id='line_370'>worship any god, except their own God.</a>
<a id='line_371'></a>
<a id='line_372'>3:29 Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and</a>
<a id='line_373'>language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach,</a>
<a id='line_374'>Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall</a>
<a id='line_375'>be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver</a>
<a id='line_376'>after this sort.</a>
<a id='line_377'></a>
<a id='line_378'>3:30 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the</a>
<a id='line_379'>province of Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_380'></a>
<a id='line_381'>4:1 Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages,</a>
<a id='line_382'>that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</a>
<a id='line_383'></a>
<a id='line_384'>4:2 I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God</a>
<a id='line_385'>hath wrought toward me.</a>
<a id='line_386'></a>
<a id='line_387'>4:3 How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his</a>
<a id='line_388'>kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation</a>
<a id='line_389'>to generation.</a>
<a id='line_390'></a>
<a id='line_391'>4:4 I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my</a>
<a id='line_392'>palace: 4:5 I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon</a>
<a id='line_393'>my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</a>
<a id='line_394'></a>
<a id='line_395'>4:6 Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon</a>
<a id='line_396'>before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of</a>
<a id='line_397'>the dream.</a>
<a id='line_398'></a>
<a id='line_399'>4:7 Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and</a>
<a id='line_400'>the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not</a>
<a id='line_401'>make known unto me the interpretation thereof.</a>
<a id='line_402'></a>
<a id='line_403'>4:8 But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was</a>
<a id='line_404'>Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is the</a>
<a id='line_405'>spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying, 4:9</a>
<a id='line_406'>O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the</a>
<a id='line_407'>spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell</a>
<a id='line_408'>me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation</a>
<a id='line_409'>thereof.</a>
<a id='line_410'></a>
<a id='line_411'>4:10 Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a</a>
<a id='line_412'>tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.</a>
<a id='line_413'></a>
<a id='line_414'>4:11 The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached</a>
<a id='line_415'>unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth: 4:12</a>
<a id='line_416'>The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it</a>
<a id='line_417'>was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the</a>
<a id='line_418'>fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed</a>
<a id='line_419'>of it.</a>
<a id='line_420'></a>
<a id='line_421'>4:13 I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a</a>
<a id='line_422'>watcher and an holy one came down from heaven; 4:14 He cried aloud,</a>
<a id='line_423'>and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off</a>
<a id='line_424'>his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under</a>
<a id='line_425'>it, and the fowls from his branches: 4:15 Nevertheless leave the stump</a>
<a id='line_426'>of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the</a>
<a id='line_427'>tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven,</a>
<a id='line_428'>and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth: 4:16</a>
<a id='line_429'>Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given</a>
<a id='line_430'>unto him; and let seven times pass over him.</a>
<a id='line_431'></a>
<a id='line_432'>4:17 This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by</a>
<a id='line_433'>the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that</a>
<a id='line_434'>the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to</a>
<a id='line_435'>whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.</a>
<a id='line_436'></a>
<a id='line_437'>4:18 This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O</a>
<a id='line_438'>Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the</a>
<a id='line_439'>wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the</a>
<a id='line_440'>interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is</a>
<a id='line_441'>in thee.</a>
<a id='line_442'></a>
<a id='line_443'>4:19 Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one</a>
<a id='line_444'>hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said,</a>
<a id='line_445'>Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof,</a>
<a id='line_446'>trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to</a>
<a id='line_447'>them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.</a>
<a id='line_448'></a>
<a id='line_449'>4:20 The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose</a>
<a id='line_450'>height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the</a>
<a id='line_451'>earth; 4:21 Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in</a>
<a id='line_452'>it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and</a>
<a id='line_453'>upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation: 4:22</a>
<a id='line_454'>It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy</a>
<a id='line_455'>greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the</a>
<a id='line_456'>end of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_457'></a>
<a id='line_458'>4:23 And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down</a>
<a id='line_459'>from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave</a>
<a id='line_460'>the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron</a>
<a id='line_461'>and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with</a>
<a id='line_462'>the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the</a>
<a id='line_463'>field, till seven times pass over him; 4:24 This is the</a>
<a id='line_464'>interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which</a>
<a id='line_465'>is come upon my lord the king: 4:25 That they shall drive thee from</a>
<a id='line_466'>men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they</a>
<a id='line_467'>shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the</a>
<a id='line_468'>dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know</a>
<a id='line_469'>that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to</a>
<a id='line_470'>whomsoever he will.</a>
<a id='line_471'></a>
<a id='line_472'>4:26 And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots;</a>
<a id='line_473'>thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known</a>
<a id='line_474'>that the heavens do rule.</a>
<a id='line_475'></a>
<a id='line_476'>4:27 Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and</a>
<a id='line_477'>break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing</a>
<a id='line_478'>mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.</a>
<a id='line_479'></a>
<a id='line_480'>4:28 All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</a>
<a id='line_481'></a>
<a id='line_482'>4:29 At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the</a>
<a id='line_483'>kingdom of Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_484'></a>
<a id='line_485'>4:30 The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have</a>
<a id='line_486'>built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for</a>
<a id='line_487'>the honour of my majesty?  4:31 While the word was in the king’s</a>
<a id='line_488'>mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar,</a>
<a id='line_489'>to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.</a>
<a id='line_490'></a>
<a id='line_491'>4:32 And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be</a>
<a id='line_492'>with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as</a>
<a id='line_493'>oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the</a>
<a id='line_494'>most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he</a>
<a id='line_495'>will.</a>
<a id='line_496'></a>
<a id='line_497'>4:33 The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he</a>
<a id='line_498'>was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet</a>
<a id='line_499'>with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles’</a>
<a id='line_500'>feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws.</a>
<a id='line_501'></a>
<a id='line_502'>4:34 And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes</a>
<a id='line_503'>unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed</a>
<a id='line_504'>the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever,</a>
<a id='line_505'>whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from</a>
<a id='line_506'>generation to generation: 4:35 And all the inhabitants of the earth</a>
<a id='line_507'>are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army</a>
<a id='line_508'>of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay</a>
<a id='line_509'>his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?  4:36 At the same time my</a>
<a id='line_510'>reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour</a>
<a id='line_511'>and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords</a>
<a id='line_512'>sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent</a>
<a id='line_513'>majesty was added unto me.</a>
<a id='line_514'></a>
<a id='line_515'>4:37 Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of</a>
<a id='line_516'>heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those</a>
<a id='line_517'>that walk in pride he is able to abase.</a>
<a id='line_518'></a>
<a id='line_519'>5:1 Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords,</a>
<a id='line_520'>and drank wine before the thousand.</a>
<a id='line_521'></a>
<a id='line_522'>5:2 Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the</a>
<a id='line_523'>golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken</a>
<a id='line_524'>out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his</a>
<a id='line_525'>princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.</a>
<a id='line_526'></a>
<a id='line_527'>5:3 Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the</a>
<a id='line_528'>temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and</a>
<a id='line_529'>his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.</a>
<a id='line_530'></a>
<a id='line_531'>5:4 They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of</a>
<a id='line_532'>brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</a>
<a id='line_533'></a>
<a id='line_534'>5:5 In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote</a>
<a id='line_535'>over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the</a>
<a id='line_536'>king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.</a>
<a id='line_537'></a>
<a id='line_538'>5:6 Then the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled</a>
<a id='line_539'>him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote</a>
<a id='line_540'>one against another.</a>
<a id='line_541'></a>
<a id='line_542'>5:7 The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans,</a>
<a id='line_543'>and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of</a>
<a id='line_544'>Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the</a>
<a id='line_545'>interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a</a>
<a id='line_546'>chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the</a>
<a id='line_547'>kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_548'></a>
<a id='line_549'>5:8 Then came in all the king’s wise men: but they could not read the</a>
<a id='line_550'>writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.</a>
<a id='line_551'></a>
<a id='line_552'>5:9 Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was</a>
<a id='line_553'>changed in him, and his lords were astonied.</a>
<a id='line_554'></a>
<a id='line_555'>5:10 Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords</a>
<a id='line_556'>came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king,</a>
<a id='line_557'>live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy</a>
<a id='line_558'>countenance be changed: 5:11 There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is</a>
<a id='line_559'>the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and</a>
<a id='line_560'>understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in</a>
<a id='line_561'>him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy</a>
<a id='line_562'>father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and</a>
<a id='line_563'>soothsayers; 5:12 Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and</a>
<a id='line_564'>understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences,</a>
<a id='line_565'>and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king</a>
<a id='line_566'>named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the</a>
<a id='line_567'>interpretation.</a>
<a id='line_568'></a>
<a id='line_569'>5:13 Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake</a>
<a id='line_570'>and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children</a>
<a id='line_571'>of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of</a>
<a id='line_572'>Jewry?  5:14 I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is</a>
<a id='line_573'>in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is</a>
<a id='line_574'>found in thee.</a>
<a id='line_575'></a>
<a id='line_576'>5:15 And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in</a>
<a id='line_577'>before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me</a>
<a id='line_578'>the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation</a>
<a id='line_579'>of the thing: 5:16 And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make</a>
<a id='line_580'>interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the</a>
<a id='line_581'>writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_582'>be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and</a>
<a id='line_583'>shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_584'></a>
<a id='line_585'>5:17 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be</a>
<a id='line_586'>to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the</a>
<a id='line_587'>writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.</a>
<a id='line_588'></a>
<a id='line_589'>5:18 O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a</a>
<a id='line_590'>kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour: 5:19 And for the majesty</a>
<a id='line_591'>that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and</a>
<a id='line_592'>feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept</a>
<a id='line_593'>alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.</a>
<a id='line_594'></a>
<a id='line_595'>5:20 But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride,</a>
<a id='line_596'>he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from</a>
<a id='line_597'>him: 5:21 And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was</a>
<a id='line_598'>made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they</a>
<a id='line_599'>fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of</a>
<a id='line_600'>heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_601'>men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.</a>
<a id='line_602'></a>
<a id='line_603'>5:22 And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart,</a>
<a id='line_604'>though thou knewest all this; 5:23 But hast lifted up thyself against</a>
<a id='line_605'>the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house</a>
<a id='line_606'>before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines,</a>
<a id='line_607'>have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and</a>
<a id='line_608'>gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor</a>
<a id='line_609'>know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy</a>
<a id='line_610'>ways, hast thou not glorified: 5:24 Then was the part of the hand sent</a>
<a id='line_611'>from him; and this writing was written.</a>
<a id='line_612'></a>
<a id='line_613'>5:25 And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,</a>
<a id='line_614'>UPHARSIN.</a>
<a id='line_615'></a>
<a id='line_616'>5:26 This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered</a>
<a id='line_617'>thy kingdom, and finished it.</a>
<a id='line_618'></a>
<a id='line_619'>5:27 TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.</a>
<a id='line_620'></a>
<a id='line_621'>5:28 PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and</a>
<a id='line_622'>Persians.</a>
<a id='line_623'></a>
<a id='line_624'>5:29 Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet,</a>
<a id='line_625'>and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation</a>
<a id='line_626'>concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_627'></a>
<a id='line_628'>5:30 In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.</a>
<a id='line_629'></a>
<a id='line_630'>5:31 And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore</a>
<a id='line_631'>and two years old.</a>
<a id='line_632'></a>
<a id='line_633'>6:1 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty</a>
<a id='line_634'>princes, which should be over the whole kingdom; 6:2 And over these</a>
<a id='line_635'>three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might</a>
<a id='line_636'>give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.</a>
<a id='line_637'></a>
<a id='line_638'>6:3 Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes,</a>
<a id='line_639'>because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set</a>
<a id='line_640'>him over the whole realm.</a>
<a id='line_641'></a>
<a id='line_642'>6:4 Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against</a>
<a id='line_643'>Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor</a>
<a id='line_644'>fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or</a>
<a id='line_645'>fault found in him.</a>
<a id='line_646'></a>
<a id='line_647'>6:5 Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this</a>
<a id='line_648'>Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.</a>
<a id='line_649'></a>
<a id='line_650'>6:6 Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king,</a>
<a id='line_651'>and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.</a>
<a id='line_652'></a>
<a id='line_653'>6:7 All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes,</a>
<a id='line_654'>the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to</a>
<a id='line_655'>establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever</a>
<a id='line_656'>shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee,</a>
<a id='line_657'>O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.</a>
<a id='line_658'></a>
<a id='line_659'>6:8 Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it</a>
<a id='line_660'>be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which</a>
<a id='line_661'>altereth not.</a>
<a id='line_662'></a>
<a id='line_663'>6:9 Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.</a>
<a id='line_664'></a>
<a id='line_665'>6:10 Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into</a>
<a id='line_666'>his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_667'>he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave</a>
<a id='line_668'>thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.</a>
<a id='line_669'></a>
<a id='line_670'>6:11 Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making</a>
<a id='line_671'>supplication before his God.</a>
<a id='line_672'></a>
<a id='line_673'>6:12 Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the</a>
<a id='line_674'>king’s decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that</a>
<a id='line_675'>shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of</a>
<a id='line_676'>thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered</a>
<a id='line_677'>and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and</a>
<a id='line_678'>Persians, which altereth not.</a>
<a id='line_679'></a>
<a id='line_680'>6:13 Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which</a>
<a id='line_681'>is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O</a>
<a id='line_682'>king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition</a>
<a id='line_683'>three times a day.</a>
<a id='line_684'></a>
<a id='line_685'>6:14 Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased</a>
<a id='line_686'>with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he</a>
<a id='line_687'>laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.</a>
<a id='line_688'></a>
<a id='line_689'>6:15 Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king,</a>
<a id='line_690'>Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no</a>
<a id='line_691'>decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.</a>
<a id='line_692'></a>
<a id='line_693'>6:16 Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him</a>
<a id='line_694'>into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy</a>
<a id='line_695'>God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</a>
<a id='line_696'></a>
<a id='line_697'>6:17 And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and</a>
<a id='line_698'>the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his</a>
<a id='line_699'>lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.</a>
<a id='line_700'></a>
<a id='line_701'>6:18 Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting:</a>
<a id='line_702'>neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep</a>
<a id='line_703'>went from him.</a>
<a id='line_704'></a>
<a id='line_705'>6:19 Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste</a>
<a id='line_706'>unto the den of lions.</a>
<a id='line_707'></a>
<a id='line_708'>6:20 And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice</a>
<a id='line_709'>unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant</a>
<a id='line_710'>of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to</a>
<a id='line_711'>deliver thee from the lions?  6:21 Then said Daniel unto the king, O</a>
<a id='line_712'>king, live for ever.</a>
<a id='line_713'></a>
<a id='line_714'>6:22 My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that</a>
<a id='line_715'>they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in</a>
<a id='line_716'>me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.</a>
<a id='line_717'></a>
<a id='line_718'>6:23 Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that</a>
<a id='line_719'>they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out</a>
<a id='line_720'>of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he</a>
<a id='line_721'>believed in his God.</a>
<a id='line_722'></a>
<a id='line_723'>6:24 And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had</a>
<a id='line_724'>accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their</a>
<a id='line_725'>children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and</a>
<a id='line_726'>brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the</a>
<a id='line_727'>den.</a>
<a id='line_728'></a>
<a id='line_729'>6:25 Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages,</a>
<a id='line_730'>that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</a>
<a id='line_731'></a>
<a id='line_732'>6:26 I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble</a>
<a id='line_733'>and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and</a>
<a id='line_734'>stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed,</a>
<a id='line_735'>and his dominion shall be even unto the end.</a>
<a id='line_736'></a>
<a id='line_737'>6:27 He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in</a>
<a id='line_738'>heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the</a>
<a id='line_739'>lions.</a>
<a id='line_740'></a>
<a id='line_741'>6:28 So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign</a>
<a id='line_742'>of Cyrus the Persian.</a>
<a id='line_743'></a>
<a id='line_744'>7:1 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream</a>
<a id='line_745'>and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and</a>
<a id='line_746'>told the sum of the matters.</a>
<a id='line_747'></a>
<a id='line_748'>7:2 Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold,</a>
<a id='line_749'>the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.</a>
<a id='line_750'></a>
<a id='line_751'>7:3 And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from</a>
<a id='line_752'>another.</a>
<a id='line_753'></a>
<a id='line_754'>7:4 The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till</a>
<a id='line_755'>the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth,</a>
<a id='line_756'>and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to</a>
<a id='line_757'>it.</a>
<a id='line_758'></a>
<a id='line_759'>7:5 And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised</a>
<a id='line_760'>up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it</a>
<a id='line_761'>between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour</a>
<a id='line_762'>much flesh.</a>
<a id='line_763'></a>
<a id='line_764'>7:6 After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had</a>
<a id='line_765'>upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four</a>
<a id='line_766'>heads; and dominion was given to it.</a>
<a id='line_767'></a>
<a id='line_768'>7:7 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast,</a>
<a id='line_769'>dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron</a>
<a id='line_770'>teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with</a>
<a id='line_771'>the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were</a>
<a id='line_772'>before it; and it had ten horns.</a>
<a id='line_773'></a>
<a id='line_774'>7:8 I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them</a>
<a id='line_775'>another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns</a>
<a id='line_776'>plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the</a>
<a id='line_777'>eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</a>
<a id='line_778'></a>
<a id='line_779'>7:9 I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days</a>
<a id='line_780'>did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head</a>
<a id='line_781'>like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his</a>
<a id='line_782'>wheels as burning fire.</a>
<a id='line_783'></a>
<a id='line_784'>7:10 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand</a>
<a id='line_785'>thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand</a>
<a id='line_786'>stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</a>
<a id='line_787'></a>
<a id='line_788'>7:11 I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the</a>
<a id='line_789'>horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body</a>
<a id='line_790'>destroyed, and given to the burning flame.</a>
<a id='line_791'></a>
<a id='line_792'>7:12 As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion</a>
<a id='line_793'>taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</a>
<a id='line_794'></a>
<a id='line_795'>7:13 I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man</a>
<a id='line_796'>came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and</a>
<a id='line_797'>they brought him near before him.</a>
<a id='line_798'></a>
<a id='line_799'>7:14 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that</a>
<a id='line_800'>all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is</a>
<a id='line_801'>an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom</a>
<a id='line_802'>that which shall not be destroyed.</a>
<a id='line_803'></a>
<a id='line_804'>7:15 I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and</a>
<a id='line_805'>the visions of my head troubled me.</a>
<a id='line_806'></a>
<a id='line_807'>7:16 I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the</a>
<a id='line_808'>truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation</a>
<a id='line_809'>of the things.</a>
<a id='line_810'></a>
<a id='line_811'>7:17 These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall</a>
<a id='line_812'>arise out of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_813'></a>
<a id='line_814'>7:18 But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and</a>
<a id='line_815'>possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</a>
<a id='line_816'></a>
<a id='line_817'>7:19 Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was</a>
<a id='line_818'>diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of</a>
<a id='line_819'>iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and</a>
<a id='line_820'>stamped the residue with his feet; 7:20 And of the ten horns that were</a>
<a id='line_821'>in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three</a>
<a id='line_822'>fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very</a>
<a id='line_823'>great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.</a>
<a id='line_824'></a>
<a id='line_825'>7:21 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and</a>
<a id='line_826'>prevailed against them; 7:22 Until the Ancient of days came, and</a>
<a id='line_827'>judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came</a>
<a id='line_828'>that the saints possessed the kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_829'></a>
<a id='line_830'>7:23 Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon</a>
<a id='line_831'>earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the</a>
<a id='line_832'>whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</a>
<a id='line_833'></a>
<a id='line_834'>7:24 And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall</a>
<a id='line_835'>arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from</a>
<a id='line_836'>the first, and he shall subdue three kings.</a>
<a id='line_837'></a>
<a id='line_838'>7:25 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall</a>
<a id='line_839'>wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and</a>
<a id='line_840'>laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and</a>
<a id='line_841'>the dividing of time.</a>
<a id='line_842'></a>
<a id='line_843'>7:26 But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his</a>
<a id='line_844'>dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.</a>
<a id='line_845'></a>
<a id='line_846'>7:27 And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom</a>
<a id='line_847'>under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of</a>
<a id='line_848'>the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all</a>
<a id='line_849'>dominions shall serve and obey him.</a>
<a id='line_850'></a>
<a id='line_851'>7:28 Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my</a>
<a id='line_852'>cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I</a>
<a id='line_853'>kept the matter in my heart.</a>
<a id='line_854'></a>
<a id='line_855'>8:1 In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision</a>
<a id='line_856'>appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto</a>
<a id='line_857'>me at the first.</a>
<a id='line_858'></a>
<a id='line_859'>8:2 And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was</a>
<a id='line_860'>at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw</a>
<a id='line_861'>in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.</a>
<a id='line_862'></a>
<a id='line_863'>8:3 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood</a>
<a id='line_864'>before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were</a>
<a id='line_865'>high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</a>
<a id='line_866'></a>
<a id='line_867'>8:4 I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so</a>
<a id='line_868'>that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that</a>
<a id='line_869'>could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and</a>
<a id='line_870'>became great.</a>
<a id='line_871'></a>
<a id='line_872'>8:5 And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on</a>
<a id='line_873'>the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat</a>
<a id='line_874'>had a notable horn between his eyes.</a>
<a id='line_875'></a>
<a id='line_876'>8:6 And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen</a>
<a id='line_877'>standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.</a>
<a id='line_878'></a>
<a id='line_879'>8:7 And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with</a>
<a id='line_880'>choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and</a>
<a id='line_881'>there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him</a>
<a id='line_882'>down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that</a>
<a id='line_883'>could deliver the ram out of his hand.</a>
<a id='line_884'></a>
<a id='line_885'>8:8 Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong,</a>
<a id='line_886'>the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward</a>
<a id='line_887'>the four winds of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_888'></a>
<a id='line_889'>8:9 And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed</a>
<a id='line_890'>exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the</a>
<a id='line_891'>pleasant land.</a>
<a id='line_892'></a>
<a id='line_893'>8:10 And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down</a>
<a id='line_894'>some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon</a>
<a id='line_895'>them.</a>
<a id='line_896'></a>
<a id='line_897'>8:11 Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by</a>
<a id='line_898'>him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary</a>
<a id='line_899'>was cast down.</a>
<a id='line_900'></a>
<a id='line_901'>8:12 And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason</a>
<a id='line_902'>of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it</a>
<a id='line_903'>practised, and prospered.</a>
<a id='line_904'></a>
<a id='line_905'>8:13 Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that</a>
<a id='line_906'>certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the</a>
<a id='line_907'>daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the</a>
<a id='line_908'>sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?  8:14 And he said</a>
<a id='line_909'>unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the</a>
<a id='line_910'>sanctuary be cleansed.</a>
<a id='line_911'></a>
<a id='line_912'>8:15 And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision,</a>
<a id='line_913'>and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the</a>
<a id='line_914'>appearance of a man.</a>
<a id='line_915'></a>
<a id='line_916'>8:16 And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of Ulai, which</a>
<a id='line_917'>called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</a>
<a id='line_918'></a>
<a id='line_919'>8:17 So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid,</a>
<a id='line_920'>and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man:</a>
<a id='line_921'>for at the time of the end shall be the vision.</a>
<a id='line_922'></a>
<a id='line_923'>8:18 Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face</a>
<a id='line_924'>toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.</a>
<a id='line_925'></a>
<a id='line_926'>8:19 And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the</a>
<a id='line_927'>last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall</a>
<a id='line_928'>be.</a>
<a id='line_929'></a>
<a id='line_930'>8:20 The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media</a>
<a id='line_931'>and Persia.</a>
<a id='line_932'></a>
<a id='line_933'>8:21 And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that</a>
<a id='line_934'>is between his eyes is the first king.</a>

<a id='line_936'>8:22 Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four</a>

<a id='line_938'></a>
<a id='line_939'>8:23 And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors</a>
<a id='line_940'>are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding</a>

<a id='line_942'></a>
<a id='line_943'>8:24 And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he</a>

<a id='line_955'></a>
<a id='line_956'>8:27 And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose</a>
<a id='line_957'>up, and did the king’s business; and I was astonished at the vision,</a>
<a id='line_958'>but none understood it.</a>

<a id='line_960'>9:1 In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of</a>
<a id='line_961'>the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans; 9:2 In</a>
<a id='line_962'>the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of</a>
<a id='line_963'>the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet,</a>
<a id='line_964'>that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of</a>

<a id='line_966'></a>
<a id='line_967'>9:3 And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and</a>
<a id='line_968'>supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes: 9:4 And I</a>
<a id='line_969'>prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord,</a>
<a id='line_970'>the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them</a>
<a id='line_971'>that love him, and to them that keep his commandments; 9:5 We have</a>
<a id='line_972'>sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have</a>
<a id='line_973'>rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:</a>
<a id='line_974'>9:6 Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which</a>
<a id='line_975'>spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to</a>
<a id='line_976'>all the people of the land.</a>
<a id='line_977'></a>
<a id='line_978'>9:7 O LORD, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion</a>
<a id='line_979'>of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants</a>
<a id='line_980'>of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far</a>
<a id='line_981'>off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because</a>

<a id='line_983'></a>
<a id='line_984'>9:8 O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our</a>

<a id='line_986'></a>
<a id='line_987'>9:9 To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we</a>

<a id='line_991'></a>
<a id='line_992'>9:11 Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing,</a>

<a id='line_994'>us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of</a>
<a id='line_995'>God, because we have sinned against him.</a>
<a id='line_996'></a>
<a id='line_997'>9:12 And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and</a>
<a id='line_998'>against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil:</a>
<a id='line_999'>for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon</a>

<a id='line_1001'></a>
<a id='line_1002'>9:13 As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon</a>

<a id='line_1005'></a>
<a id='line_1006'>9:14 Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it</a>

<a id='line_1010'>9:15 And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out</a>
<a id='line_1011'>of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown,</a>

<a id='line_1013'></a>
<a id='line_1014'>9:16 O LORD, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let</a>
<a id='line_1015'>thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy</a>
<a id='line_1016'>holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our</a>
<a id='line_1017'>fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that</a>
<a id='line_1018'>are about us.</a>
<a id='line_1019'></a>
<a id='line_1020'>9:17 Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his</a>

<a id='line_1024'>9:18 O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and</a>

<a id='line_1036'>speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the</a>
<a id='line_1037'>vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about</a>

<a id='line_1039'></a>
<a id='line_1040'>9:22 And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am</a>

<a id='line_1043'>9:23 At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth,</a>

<a id='line_1046'></a>
<a id='line_1047'>9:24 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy</a>

<a id='line_1050'>righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint</a>
<a id='line_1051'>the most Holy.</a>
<a id='line_1052'></a>
<a id='line_1053'>9:25 Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the</a>
<a id='line_1054'>commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the</a>
<a id='line_1055'>Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street</a>
<a id='line_1056'>shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.</a>
<a id='line_1057'></a>
<a id='line_1058'>9:26 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but</a>
<a id='line_1059'>not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall</a>
<a id='line_1060'>destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with</a>
<a id='line_1061'>a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.</a>
<a id='line_1062'></a>
<a id='line_1063'>9:27 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in</a>
<a id='line_1064'>the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to</a>
<a id='line_1065'>cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it</a>
<a id='line_1066'>desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be</a>
<a id='line_1067'>poured upon the desolate.</a>
<a id='line_1068'></a>
<a id='line_1069'>10:1 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed</a>
<a id='line_1070'>unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was</a>
<a id='line_1071'>true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing,</a>
<a id='line_1072'>and had understanding of the vision.</a>
<a id='line_1073'></a>
<a id='line_1074'>10:2 In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.</a>
<a id='line_1075'></a>
<a id='line_1076'>10:3 I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth,</a>
<a id='line_1077'>neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were</a>
<a id='line_1078'>fulfilled.</a>
<a id='line_1079'></a>
<a id='line_1080'>10:4 And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by</a>
<a id='line_1081'>the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel; 10:5 Then I lifted up</a>
<a id='line_1082'>mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen,</a>
<a id='line_1083'>whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz: 10:6 His body also</a>
<a id='line_1084'>was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and</a>
<a id='line_1085'>his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to</a>
<a id='line_1086'>polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a</a>
<a id='line_1087'>multitude.</a>
<a id='line_1088'></a>
<a id='line_1089'>10:7 And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me</a>
<a id='line_1090'>saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they</a>
<a id='line_1091'>fled to hide themselves.</a>
<a id='line_1092'></a>
<a id='line_1093'>10:8 Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there</a>
<a id='line_1094'>remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into</a>
<a id='line_1095'>corruption, and I retained no strength.</a>
<a id='line_1096'></a>
<a id='line_1097'>10:9 Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of</a>
<a id='line_1098'>his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward</a>
<a id='line_1099'>the ground.</a>
<a id='line_1100'></a>
<a id='line_1101'>10:10 And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and</a>
<a id='line_1102'>upon the palms of my hands.</a>
<a id='line_1103'></a>
<a id='line_1104'>10:11 And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand</a>
<a id='line_1105'>the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am</a>
<a id='line_1106'>I now sent.</a>
<a id='line_1107'></a>
<a id='line_1108'>And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.</a>
<a id='line_1109'></a>
<a id='line_1110'>10:12 Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day</a>
<a id='line_1111'>that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself</a>
<a id='line_1112'>before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.</a>
<a id='line_1113'></a>
<a id='line_1114'>10:13 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and</a>
<a id='line_1115'>twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help</a>
<a id='line_1116'>me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</a>
<a id='line_1117'></a>
<a id='line_1118'>10:14 Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy</a>
<a id='line_1119'>people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.</a>
<a id='line_1120'></a>
<a id='line_1121'>10:15 And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward</a>
<a id='line_1122'>the ground, and I became dumb.</a>
<a id='line_1123'></a>
<a id='line_1124'>10:16 And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched</a>
<a id='line_1125'>my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that</a>
<a id='line_1126'>stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon</a>
<a id='line_1127'>me, and I have retained no strength.</a>
<a id='line_1128'></a>
<a id='line_1129'>10:17 For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord?</a>
<a id='line_1130'>for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither</a>
<a id='line_1131'>is there breath left in me.</a>
<a id='line_1132'></a>
<a id='line_1133'>10:18 Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of</a>
<a id='line_1134'>a man, and he strengthened me, 10:19 And said, O man greatly beloved,</a>
<a id='line_1135'>fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he</a>
<a id='line_1136'>had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak;</a>
<a id='line_1137'>for thou hast strengthened me.</a>
<a id='line_1138'></a>
<a id='line_1139'>10:20 Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now</a>
<a id='line_1140'>will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone</a>
<a id='line_1141'>forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.</a>
<a id='line_1142'></a>
<a id='line_1143'>10:21 But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of</a>
<a id='line_1144'>truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but</a>
<a id='line_1145'>Michael your prince.</a>
<a id='line_1146'></a>
<a id='line_1147'>11:1 Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to</a>
<a id='line_1148'>confirm and to strengthen him.</a>
<a id='line_1149'></a>
<a id='line_1150'>11:2 And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up</a>
<a id='line_1151'>yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than</a>
<a id='line_1152'>they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all</a>
<a id='line_1153'>against the realm of Grecia.</a>
<a id='line_1154'></a>
<a id='line_1155'>11:3 And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great</a>
<a id='line_1156'>dominion, and do according to his will.</a>
<a id='line_1157'></a>
<a id='line_1158'>11:4 And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and</a>
<a id='line_1159'>shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his</a>
<a id='line_1160'>posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his</a>
<a id='line_1161'>kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.</a>
<a id='line_1162'></a>
<a id='line_1163'>11:5 And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his</a>
<a id='line_1164'>princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his</a>
<a id='line_1165'>dominion shall be a great dominion.</a>
<a id='line_1166'></a>
<a id='line_1167'>11:6 And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for</a>
<a id='line_1168'>the king’s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north</a>
<a id='line_1169'>to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm;</a>
<a id='line_1170'>neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and</a>
<a id='line_1171'>they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened</a>
<a id='line_1172'>her in these times.</a>
<a id='line_1173'></a>
<a id='line_1174'>11:7 But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his</a>
<a id='line_1175'>estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the</a>
<a id='line_1176'>fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and</a>
<a id='line_1177'>shall prevail: 11:8 And shall also carry captives into Egypt their</a>
<a id='line_1178'>gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver</a>
<a id='line_1179'>and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the</a>
<a id='line_1180'>north.</a>
<a id='line_1181'></a>
<a id='line_1182'>11:9 So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall</a>
<a id='line_1183'>return into his own land.</a>
<a id='line_1184'></a>
<a id='line_1185'>11:10 But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude</a>
<a id='line_1186'>of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass</a>
<a id='line_1187'>through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his</a>
<a id='line_1188'>fortress.</a>
<a id='line_1189'></a>
<a id='line_1190'>11:11 And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall</a>
<a id='line_1191'>come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he</a>
<a id='line_1192'>shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given</a>
<a id='line_1193'>into his hand.</a>
<a id='line_1194'></a>
<a id='line_1195'>11:12 And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be</a>
<a id='line_1196'>lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not</a>
<a id='line_1197'>be strengthened by it.</a>
<a id='line_1198'></a>
<a id='line_1199'>11:13 For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a</a>
<a id='line_1200'>multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after</a>
<a id='line_1201'>certain years with a great army and with much riches.</a>
<a id='line_1202'></a>
<a id='line_1203'>11:14 And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of</a>
<a id='line_1204'>the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to</a>
<a id='line_1205'>establish the vision; but they shall fall.</a>
<a id='line_1206'></a>
<a id='line_1207'>11:15 So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and</a>
<a id='line_1208'>take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not</a>
<a id='line_1209'>withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any</a>
<a id='line_1210'>strength to withstand.</a>
<a id='line_1211'></a>
<a id='line_1212'>11:16 But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own</a>
<a id='line_1213'>will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the</a>
<a id='line_1214'>glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.</a>
<a id='line_1215'></a>
<a id='line_1216'>11:17 He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his</a>
<a id='line_1217'>whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he</a>
<a id='line_1218'>shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall</a>
<a id='line_1219'>not stand on his side, neither be for him.</a>
<a id='line_1220'></a>
<a id='line_1221'>11:18 After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take</a>
<a id='line_1222'>many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered</a>
<a id='line_1223'>by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn</a>
<a id='line_1224'>upon him.</a>
<a id='line_1225'></a>
<a id='line_1226'>11:19 Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but</a>
<a id='line_1227'>he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.</a>
<a id='line_1228'></a>
<a id='line_1229'>11:20 Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory</a>
<a id='line_1230'>of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in</a>
<a id='line_1231'>anger, nor in battle.</a>
<a id='line_1232'></a>
<a id='line_1233'>11:21 And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they</a>
<a id='line_1234'>shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in</a>
<a id='line_1235'>peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</a>
<a id='line_1236'></a>
<a id='line_1237'>11:22 And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before</a>

<a id='line_1240'>11:23 And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully:</a>

<a id='line_1242'></a>
<a id='line_1243'>11:24 He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the</a>
<a id='line_1244'>province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor</a>
<a id='line_1245'>his fathers’ fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil,</a>
<a id='line_1246'>and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong</a>
<a id='line_1247'>holds, even for a time.</a>
<a id='line_1248'></a>
<a id='line_1249'>11:25 And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king</a>
<a id='line_1250'>of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be</a>
<a id='line_1251'>stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall</a>
<a id='line_1252'>not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.</a>
<a id='line_1253'></a>
<a id='line_1254'>11:26 Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy</a>
<a id='line_1255'>him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.</a>
<a id='line_1256'></a>
<a id='line_1257'>11:27 And both of these kings’ hearts shall be to do mischief, and</a>
<a id='line_1258'>they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet</a>
<a id='line_1259'>the end shall be at the time appointed.</a>
<a id='line_1260'></a>
<a id='line_1261'>11:28 Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his</a>
<a id='line_1262'>heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits,</a>
<a id='line_1263'>and return to his own land.</a>
<a id='line_1264'></a>
<a id='line_1265'>11:29 At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the</a>
<a id='line_1266'>south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.</a>
<a id='line_1267'></a>
<a id='line_1268'>11:30 For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he</a>
<a id='line_1269'>shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy</a>
<a id='line_1270'>covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence</a>
<a id='line_1271'>with them that forsake the holy covenant.</a>
<a id='line_1272'></a>
<a id='line_1273'>11:31 And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the</a>
<a id='line_1274'>sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and</a>
<a id='line_1275'>they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.</a>
<a id='line_1276'></a>
<a id='line_1277'>11:32 And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by</a>
<a id='line_1278'>flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and</a>
<a id='line_1279'>do exploits.</a>
<a id='line_1280'></a>
<a id='line_1281'>11:33 And they that understand among the people shall instruct many:</a>
<a id='line_1282'>yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by</a>
<a id='line_1283'>spoil, many days.</a>
<a id='line_1284'></a>
<a id='line_1285'>11:34 Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little</a>
<a id='line_1286'>help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.</a>
<a id='line_1287'></a>
<a id='line_1288'>11:35 And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and</a>
<a id='line_1289'>to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because</a>
<a id='line_1290'>it is yet for a time appointed.</a>
<a id='line_1291'></a>
<a id='line_1292'>11:36 And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt</a>
<a id='line_1293'>himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak</a>
<a id='line_1294'>marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the</a>
<a id='line_1295'>indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be</a>
<a id='line_1296'>done.</a>
<a id='line_1297'></a>
<a id='line_1298'>11:37 Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire</a>
<a id='line_1299'>of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.</a>
<a id='line_1300'></a>
<a id='line_1301'>11:38 But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god</a>
<a id='line_1302'>whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and</a>
<a id='line_1303'>with precious stones, and pleasant things.</a>
<a id='line_1304'></a>
<a id='line_1305'>11:39 Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god,</a>
<a id='line_1306'>whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause</a>
<a id='line_1307'>them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.</a>
<a id='line_1308'></a>
<a id='line_1309'>11:40 And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at</a>
<a id='line_1310'>him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a</a>
<a id='line_1311'>whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and</a>
<a id='line_1312'>he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.</a>
<a id='line_1313'></a>
<a id='line_1314'>11:41 He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries</a>
<a id='line_1315'>shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even</a>
<a id='line_1316'>Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.</a>
<a id='line_1317'></a>
<a id='line_1318'>11:42 He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the</a>
<a id='line_1319'>land of Egypt shall not escape.</a>
<a id='line_1320'></a>
<a id='line_1321'>11:43 But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of</a>
<a id='line_1322'>silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and</a>
<a id='line_1323'>the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.</a>
<a id='line_1324'></a>
<a id='line_1325'>11:44 But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble</a>
<a id='line_1326'>him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and</a>
<a id='line_1327'>utterly to make away many.</a>
<a id='line_1328'></a>
<a id='line_1329'>11:45 And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the</a>
<a id='line_1330'>seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and</a>
<a id='line_1331'>none shall help him.</a>
<a id='line_1332'></a>
<a id='line_1333'>12:1 And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which</a>
<a id='line_1334'>standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of</a>
<a id='line_1335'>trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same</a>
<a id='line_1336'>time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that</a>
<a id='line_1337'>shall be found written in the book.</a>
<a id='line_1338'></a>
<a id='line_1339'>12:2 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake,</a>
<a id='line_1340'>some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</a>
<a id='line_1341'></a>
<a id='line_1342'>12:3 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the</a>
<a id='line_1343'>firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for</a>
<a id='line_1344'>ever and ever.</a>
<a id='line_1345'></a>
<a id='line_1346'>12:4 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to</a>
<a id='line_1347'>the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be</a>
<a id='line_1348'>increased.</a>
<a id='line_1349'></a>
<a id='line_1350'>12:5 Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one</a>
<a id='line_1351'>on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of</a>
<a id='line_1352'>the bank of the river.</a>
<a id='line_1353'></a>
<a id='line_1354'>12:6 And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the</a>
<a id='line_1355'>waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?</a>
<a id='line_1356'>12:7 And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters</a>
<a id='line_1357'>of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto</a>
<a id='line_1358'>heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a</a>
<a id='line_1359'>time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to</a>
<a id='line_1360'>scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be</a>
<a id='line_1361'>finished.</a>
<a id='line_1362'></a>
<a id='line_1363'>12:8 And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what</a>
<a id='line_1364'>shall be the end of these things?  12:9 And he said, Go thy way,</a>
<a id='line_1365'>Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the</a>
<a id='line_1366'>end.</a>
<a id='line_1367'></a>
<a id='line_1368'>12:10 Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the</a>
<a id='line_1369'>wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but</a>
<a id='line_1370'>the wise shall understand.</a>
<a id='line_1371'></a>
<a id='line_1372'>12:11 And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away,</a>
<a id='line_1373'>and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a</a>
<a id='line_1374'>thousand two hundred and ninety days.</a>
<a id='line_1375'></a>
<a id='line_1376'>12:12 Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three</a>
<a id='line_1377'>hundred and five and thirty days.</a>
<a id='line_1378'></a>
<a id='line_1379'>12:13 But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest,</a>
<a id='line_1380'>and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.</a>
