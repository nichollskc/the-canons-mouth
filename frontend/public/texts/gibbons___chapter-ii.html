<a id='line_3'>     Of The Union And Internal Prosperity Of The Roman Empire, In The</a>

<a id='line_6'>      It is not alone by the rapidity, or extent of conquest, that we</a>
<a id='line_7'>      should estimate the greatness of Rome. The sovereign of the</a>
<a id='line_8'>      Russian deserts commands a larger portion of the globe. In the</a>
<a id='line_9'>      seventh summer after his passage of the Hellespont, Alexander</a>
<a id='line_10'>      erected the Macedonian trophies on the banks of the Hyphasis. 1</a>
<a id='line_11'>      Within less than a century, the irresistible Zingis, and the</a>
<a id='line_12'>      Mogul princes of his race, spread their cruel devastations and</a>
<a id='line_13'>      transient empire from the Sea of China, to the confines of Egypt</a>
<a id='line_14'>      and Germany. 2 But the firm edifice of Roman power was raised and</a>
<a id='line_15'>      preserved by the wisdom of ages. The obedient provinces of Trajan</a>
<a id='line_16'>      and the Antonines were united by laws, and adorned by arts. They</a>
<a id='line_17'>      might occasionally suffer from the partial abuse of delegated</a>
<a id='line_18'>      authority; but the general principle of government was wise,</a>
<a id='line_19'>      simple, and beneficent. They enjoyed the religion of their</a>
<a id='line_20'>      ancestors, whilst in civil honors and advantages they were</a>
<a id='line_21'>      exalted, by just degrees, to an equality with their conquerors.</a>

<a id='line_45'>      I. The policy of the emperors and the senate, as far as it</a>
<a id='line_46'>      concerned religion, was happily seconded by the reflections of</a>
<a id='line_47'>      the enlightened, and by the habits of the superstitious, part of</a>
<a id='line_48'>      their subjects. The various modes of worship, which prevailed in</a>
<a id='line_49'>      the Roman world, were all considered by the people, as equally</a>
<a id='line_50'>      true; by the philosopher, as equally false; and by the</a>
<a id='line_51'>      magistrate, as equally useful. And thus toleration produced not</a>
<a id='line_52'>      only mutual indulgence, but even religious concord.</a>
<a id='line_53'></a>
<a id='line_54'>      The superstition of the people was not imbittered by any mixture</a>
<a id='line_55'>      of theological rancor; nor was it confined by the chains of any</a>
<a id='line_56'>      speculative system. The devout polytheist, though fondly attached</a>
<a id='line_57'>      to his national rites, admitted with implicit faith the different</a>
<a id='line_58'>      religions of the earth. 3 Fear, gratitude, and curiosity, a dream</a>
<a id='line_59'>      or an omen, a singular disorder, or a distant journey,</a>
<a id='line_60'>      perpetually disposed him to multiply the articles of his belief,</a>
<a id='line_61'>      and to enlarge the list of his protectors. The thin texture of</a>
<a id='line_62'>      the Pagan mythology was interwoven with various but not</a>
<a id='line_63'>      discordant materials. As soon as it was allowed that sages and</a>
<a id='line_64'>      heroes, who had lived or who had died for the benefit of their</a>
<a id='line_65'>      country, were exalted to a state of power and immortality, it was</a>
<a id='line_66'>      universally confessed, that they deserved, if not the adoration,</a>
<a id='line_67'>      at least the reverence, of all mankind. The deities of a thousand</a>
<a id='line_68'>      groves and a thousand streams possessed, in peace, their local</a>
<a id='line_69'>      and respective influence; nor could the Romans who deprecated the</a>
<a id='line_70'>      wrath of the Tiber, deride the Egyptian who presented his</a>
<a id='line_71'>      offering to the beneficent genius of the Nile. The visible powers</a>
<a id='line_72'>      of nature, the planets, and the elements were the same throughout</a>
<a id='line_73'>      the universe. The invisible governors of the moral world were</a>
<a id='line_74'>      inevitably cast in a similar mould of fiction and allegory. Every</a>
<a id='line_75'>      virtue, and even vice, acquired its divine representative; every</a>
<a id='line_76'>      art and profession its patron, whose attributes, in the most</a>
<a id='line_77'>      distant ages and countries, were uniformly derived from the</a>
<a id='line_78'>      character of their peculiar votaries. A republic of gods of such</a>
<a id='line_79'>      opposite tempers and interests required, in every system, the</a>
<a id='line_80'>      moderating hand of a supreme magistrate, who, by the progress of</a>
<a id='line_81'>      knowledge and flattery, was gradually invested with the sublime</a>
<a id='line_82'>      perfections of an Eternal Parent, and an Omnipotent Monarch. 4</a>
<a id='line_83'>      Such was the mild spirit of antiquity, that the nations were less</a>
<a id='line_84'>      attentive to the difference, than to the resemblance, of their</a>
<a id='line_85'>      religious worship. The Greek, the Roman, and the Barbarian, as</a>
<a id='line_86'>      they met before their respective altars, easily persuaded</a>
<a id='line_87'>      themselves, that under various names, and with various</a>
<a id='line_88'>      ceremonies, they adored the same deities. 5 The elegant mythology</a>
<a id='line_89'>      of Homer gave a beautiful, and almost a regular form, to the</a>
<a id='line_90'>      polytheism of the ancient world.</a>

<a id='line_92'>      3 (return) [ There is not any writer who describes in so lively a</a>
<a id='line_93'>      manner as Herodotus the true genius of polytheism. The best</a>
<a id='line_94'>      commentary may be found in Mr. Hume’s Natural History of</a>
<a id='line_95'>      Religion; and the best contrast in Bossuet’s Universal History.</a>
<a id='line_96'>      Some obscure traces of an intolerant spirit appear in the conduct</a>
<a id='line_97'>      of the Egyptians, (see Juvenal, Sat. xv.;) and the Christians, as</a>
<a id='line_98'>      well as Jews, who lived under the Roman empire, formed a very</a>
<a id='line_99'>      important exception; so important indeed, that the discussion</a>
<a id='line_100'>      will require a distinct chapter of this work. * Note: M.</a>

<a id='line_102'>      Religion,” with the two additional volumes, “Du Polytheisme</a>
<a id='line_103'>      Romain,” has considered the whole history of polytheism in a tone</a>
<a id='line_104'>      of philosophy, which, without subscribing to all his opinions, we</a>
<a id='line_105'>      may be permitted to admire. “The boasted tolerance of polytheism</a>
<a id='line_106'>      did not rest upon the respect due from society to the freedom of</a>
<a id='line_107'>      individual opinion. The polytheistic nations, tolerant as they</a>
<a id='line_108'>      were towards each other, as separate states, were not the less</a>
<a id='line_109'>      ignorant of the eternal principle, the only basis of enlightened</a>
<a id='line_110'>      toleration, that every one has a right to worship God in the</a>
<a id='line_111'>      manner which seems to him the best. Citizens, on the contrary,</a>
<a id='line_112'>      were bound to conform to the religion of the state; they had not</a>
<a id='line_113'>      the liberty to adopt a foreign religion, though that religion</a>
<a id='line_114'>      might be legally recognized in their own city, for the strangers</a>

<a id='line_118'>      being strangers, would do no more than protect, not enlist</a>
<a id='line_119'>      themselves in the cause of the local superstitions, had</a>
<a id='line_120'>      introduced great laxity. But intolerance was clearly the theory</a>

<a id='line_139'></a>
<a id='line_140'>      The philosophers of Greece deduced their morals from the nature</a>
<a id='line_141'>      of man, rather than from that of God. They meditated, however, on</a>
<a id='line_142'>      the Divine Nature, as a very curious and important speculation;</a>
<a id='line_143'>      and in the profound inquiry, they displayed the strength and</a>
<a id='line_144'>      weakness of the human understanding. 6 Of the four most</a>
<a id='line_145'>      celebrated schools, the Stoics and the Platonists endeavored to</a>
<a id='line_146'>      reconcile the jaring interests of reason and piety. They have</a>
<a id='line_147'>      left us the most sublime proofs of the existence and perfections</a>
<a id='line_148'>      of the first cause; but, as it was impossible for them to</a>
<a id='line_149'>      conceive the creation of matter, the workman in the Stoic</a>
<a id='line_150'>      philosophy was not sufficiently distinguished from the work;</a>
<a id='line_151'>      whilst, on the contrary, the spiritual God of Plato and his</a>
<a id='line_152'>      disciples resembled an idea, rather than a substance. The</a>
<a id='line_153'>      opinions of the Academics and Epicureans were of a less religious</a>
<a id='line_154'>      cast; but whilst the modest science of the former induced them to</a>
<a id='line_155'>      doubt, the positive ignorance of the latter urged them to deny,</a>
<a id='line_156'>      the providence of a Supreme Ruler. The spirit of inquiry,</a>
<a id='line_157'>      prompted by emulation, and supported by freedom, had divided the</a>
<a id='line_158'>      public teachers of philosophy into a variety of contending sects;</a>
<a id='line_159'>      but the ingenious youth, who, from every part, resorted to</a>
<a id='line_160'>      Athens, and the other seats of learning in the Roman empire, were</a>
<a id='line_161'>      alike instructed in every school to reject and to despise the</a>
<a id='line_162'>      religion of the multitude. How, indeed, was it possible that a</a>
<a id='line_163'>      philosopher should accept, as divine truths, the idle tales of</a>
<a id='line_164'>      the poets, and the incoherent traditions of antiquity; or that he</a>
<a id='line_165'>      should adore, as gods, those imperfect beings whom he must have</a>
<a id='line_166'>      despised, as men? Against such unworthy adversaries, Cicero</a>
<a id='line_167'>      condescended to employ the arms of reason and eloquence; but the</a>
<a id='line_168'>      satire of Lucian was a much more adequate, as well as more</a>
<a id='line_169'>      efficacious, weapon. We may be well assured, that a writer,</a>
<a id='line_170'>      conversant with the world, would never have ventured to expose</a>
<a id='line_171'>      the gods of his country to public ridicule, had they not already</a>
<a id='line_172'>      been the objects of secret contempt among the polished and</a>

<a id='line_187'>      writings and conversation, the philosophers of antiquity asserted</a>
<a id='line_188'>      the independent dignity of reason; but they resigned their</a>
<a id='line_189'>      actions to the commands of law and of custom. Viewing, with a</a>

<a id='line_197'>      was indifferent to them what shape the folly of the multitude</a>

<a id='line_207'>      It is not easy to conceive from what motives a spirit of</a>
<a id='line_208'>      persecution could introduce itself into the Roman councils. The</a>
<a id='line_209'>      magistrates could not be actuated by a blind, though honest</a>
<a id='line_210'>      bigotry, since the magistrates were themselves philosophers; and</a>
<a id='line_211'>      the schools of Athens had given laws to the senate. They could</a>
<a id='line_212'>      not be impelled by ambition or avarice, as the temporal and</a>
<a id='line_213'>      ecclesiastical powers were united in the same hands. The pontiffs</a>
<a id='line_214'>      were chosen among the most illustrious of the senators; and the</a>
<a id='line_215'>      office of Supreme Pontiff was constantly exercised by the</a>
<a id='line_216'>      emperors themselves. They knew and valued the advantages of</a>
<a id='line_217'>      religion, as it is connected with civil government. They</a>
<a id='line_218'>      encouraged the public festivals which humanize the manners of the</a>
<a id='line_219'>      people. They managed the arts of divination as a convenient</a>
<a id='line_220'>      instrument of policy; and they respected, as the firmest bond of</a>
<a id='line_221'>      society, the useful persuasion, that, either in this or in a</a>
<a id='line_222'>      future life, the crime of perjury is most assuredly punished by</a>
<a id='line_223'>      the avenging gods. 9 But whilst they acknowledged the general</a>
<a id='line_224'>      advantages of religion, they were convinced that the various</a>
<a id='line_225'>      modes of worship contributed alike to the same salutary purposes;</a>
<a id='line_226'>      and that, in every country, the form of superstition, which had</a>
<a id='line_227'>      received the sanction of time and experience, was the best</a>
<a id='line_228'>      adapted to the climate, and to its inhabitants. Avarice and taste</a>
<a id='line_229'>      very frequently despoiled the vanquished nations of the elegant</a>
<a id='line_230'>      statues of their gods, and the rich ornaments of their temples;</a>
<a id='line_231'>      10 but, in the exercise of the religion which they derived from</a>
<a id='line_232'>      their ancestors, they uniformly experienced the indulgence, and</a>
<a id='line_233'>      even protection, of the Roman conquerors. The province of Gaul</a>
<a id='line_234'>      seems, and indeed only seems, an exception to this universal</a>
<a id='line_235'>      toleration. Under the specious pretext of abolishing human</a>

<a id='line_514'>      parts, the most fertile districts, and the most convenient</a>
<a id='line_515'>      situations, were reserved for the establishment of colonies; some</a>
<a id='line_516'>      of which were of a civil, and others of a military nature. In</a>
<a id='line_517'>      their manners and internal policy, the colonies formed a perfect</a>
<a id='line_518'>      representation of their great parent; and they were soon endeared</a>
<a id='line_519'>      to the natives by the ties of friendship and alliance, they</a>
<a id='line_520'>      effectually diffused a reverence for the Roman name, and a</a>
<a id='line_521'>      desire, which was seldom disappointed, of sharing, in due time,</a>
<a id='line_522'>      its honors and advantages. 32 The municipal cities insensibly</a>
<a id='line_523'>      equalled the rank and splendor of the colonies; and in the reign</a>
<a id='line_524'>      of Hadrian, it was disputed which was the preferable condition,</a>
<a id='line_525'>      of those societies which had issued from, or those which had been</a>
<a id='line_526'>      received into, the bosom of Rome. 33 The right of Latium, as it</a>
<a id='line_527'>      was called, 331 conferred on the cities to which it had been</a>
<a id='line_528'>      granted, a more partial favor. The magistrates only, at the</a>
<a id='line_529'>      expiration of their office, assumed the quality of Roman</a>
<a id='line_530'>      citizens; but as those offices were annual, in a few years they</a>
<a id='line_531'>      circulated round the principal families. 34 Those of the</a>
<a id='line_532'>      provincials who were permitted to bear arms in the legions; 35</a>
<a id='line_533'>      those who exercised any civil employment; all, in a word, who</a>
<a id='line_534'>      performed any public service, or displayed any personal talents,</a>
<a id='line_535'>      were rewarded with a present, whose value was continually</a>
<a id='line_536'>      diminished by the increasing liberality of the emperors. Yet</a>
<a id='line_537'>      even, in the age of the Antonines, when the freedom of the city</a>
<a id='line_538'>      had been bestowed on the greater number of their subjects, it was</a>
<a id='line_539'>      still accompanied with very solid advantages. The bulk of the</a>
<a id='line_540'>      people acquired, with that title, the benefit of the Roman laws,</a>
<a id='line_541'>      particularly in the interesting articles of marriage, testaments,</a>
<a id='line_542'>      and inheritances; and the road of fortune was open to those whose</a>
<a id='line_543'>      pretensions were seconded by favor or merit. The grandsons of the</a>
<a id='line_544'>      Gauls, who had besieged Julius Cæsar in Alesia, commanded</a>
<a id='line_545'>      legions, governed provinces, and were admitted into the senate of</a>

<a id='line_591'>      became gradually more visible, as the shades of night descended</a>

<a id='line_599'>      were preserved only in the mountains, or among the peasants. 39</a>
<a id='line_600'>      Education and study insensibly inspired the natives of those</a>
<a id='line_601'>      countries with the sentiments of Romans; and Italy gave fashions,</a>
<a id='line_602'>      as well as laws, to her Latin provincials. They solicited with</a>
<a id='line_603'>      more ardor, and obtained with more facility, the freedom and</a>
<a id='line_604'>      honors of the state; supported the national dignity in letters 40</a>
<a id='line_605'>      and in arms; and at length, in the person of Trajan, produced an</a>
<a id='line_606'>      emperor whom the Scipios would not have disowned for their</a>
<a id='line_607'>      countryman. The situation of the Greeks was very different from</a>
<a id='line_608'>      that of the barbarians. The former had been long since civilized</a>
<a id='line_609'>      and corrupted. They had too much taste to relinquish their</a>
<a id='line_610'>      language, and too much vanity to adopt any foreign institutions.</a>
<a id='line_611'>      Still preserving the prejudices, after they had lost the virtues,</a>
<a id='line_612'>      of their ancestors, they affected to despise the unpolished</a>
<a id='line_613'>      manners of the Roman conquerors, whilst they were compelled to</a>
<a id='line_614'>      respect their superior wisdom and power. 41 Nor was the influence</a>
<a id='line_615'>      of the Grecian language and sentiments confined to the narrow</a>
<a id='line_616'>      limits of that once celebrated country. Their empire, by the</a>
<a id='line_617'>      progress of colonies and conquest, had been diffused from the</a>
<a id='line_618'>      Adriatic to the Euphrates and the Nile. Asia was covered with</a>
<a id='line_619'>      Greek cities, and the long reign of the Macedonian kings had</a>
<a id='line_620'>      introduced a silent revolution into Syria and Egypt. In their</a>
<a id='line_621'>      pompous courts, those princes united the elegance of Athens with</a>
<a id='line_622'>      the luxury of the East, and the example of the court was</a>
<a id='line_623'>      imitated, at an humble distance, by the higher ranks of their</a>
<a id='line_624'>      subjects. Such was the general division of the Roman empire into</a>

<a id='line_627'>      in Egypt, the use of their ancient dialects, by secluding them</a>

<a id='line_709'>      antiquity, the domestic slaves were exposed to the wanton rigor</a>
<a id='line_710'>      of despotism. The perfect settlement of the Roman empire was</a>
<a id='line_711'>      preceded by ages of violence and rapine. The slaves consisted,</a>
<a id='line_712'>      for the most part, of barbarian captives, 451 taken in thousands</a>
<a id='line_713'>      by the chance of war, purchased at a vile price, 46 accustomed to</a>
<a id='line_714'>      a life of independence, and impatient to break and to revenge</a>

<a id='line_718'>      the most cruel treatment, seemed almost justified by the great</a>
<a id='line_719'>      law of self-preservation. But when the principal nations of</a>
<a id='line_720'>      Europe, Asia, and Africa were united under the laws of one</a>
<a id='line_721'>      sovereign, the source of foreign supplies flowed with much less</a>
<a id='line_722'>      abundance, and the Romans were reduced to the milder but more</a>
<a id='line_723'>      tedious method of propagation. 481 In their numerous families,</a>
<a id='line_724'>      and particularly in their country estates, they encouraged the</a>
<a id='line_725'>      marriage of their slaves. 482 The sentiments of nature, the</a>
<a id='line_726'>      habits of education, and the possession of a dependent species of</a>
<a id='line_727'>      property, contributed to alleviate the hardships of servitude. 49</a>

<a id='line_731'>      of being restrained by fear, was encouraged by the sense of his</a>

<a id='line_737'>      taken out of private hands, and reserved to the magistrates</a>
<a id='line_738'>      alone. The subterraneous prisons were abolished; and, upon a just</a>

<a id='line_752'>      them to mind here, in order to establish the facts and their</a>
<a id='line_753'>      consequences with accuracy. I shall more than once have occasion</a>
<a id='line_754'>      to employ, for this purpose, the discourse of Robertson.</a>
<a id='line_755'>      “Captives taken in war were, in all probability, the first</a>
<a id='line_756'>      persons subjected to perpetual servitude; and, when the</a>
<a id='line_757'>      necessities or luxury of mankind increased the demand for slaves,</a>
<a id='line_758'>      every new war recruited their number, by reducing the vanquished</a>
<a id='line_759'>      to that wretched condition. Hence proceeded the fierce and</a>
<a id='line_760'>      desperate spirit with which wars were carried on among ancient</a>
<a id='line_761'>      nations. While chains and slavery were the certain lot of the</a>
<a id='line_762'>      conquered, battles were fought, and towns defended with a rage</a>
<a id='line_763'>      and obstinacy which nothing but horror at such a fate could have</a>
<a id='line_764'>      inspired; but, putting an end to the cruel institution of</a>
<a id='line_765'>      slavery, Christianity extended its mild influences to the</a>
<a id='line_766'>      practice of war, and that barbarous art, softened by its humane</a>

<a id='line_819'>      make us consider those cruelties as possibly “justified by</a>

<a id='line_822'>      attributes to the virtue or the policy of the emperors the</a>
<a id='line_823'>      progressive amelioration in the lot of the slaves; and he passes</a>
<a id='line_824'>      over in silence the most influential cause, that which, after</a>
<a id='line_825'>      rendering the slaves less miserable, has contributed at length</a>
<a id='line_826'>      entirely to enfranchise them from their sufferings and their</a>

<a id='line_842'>      great, or oppression engenders in the mean, thrived and grew up</a>
<a id='line_843'>      apace. * * * It is not the authority of any single detached</a>
<a id='line_844'>      precept in the gospel, but the spirit and genius of the Christian</a>
<a id='line_845'>      religion, more powerful than any particular command, which hath</a>
<a id='line_846'>      abolished the practice of slavery throughout the world. The</a>
<a id='line_847'>      temper which Christianity inspired was mild and gentle; and the</a>
<a id='line_848'>      doctrines it taught added such dignity and lustre to human</a>
<a id='line_849'>      nature, as rescued it from the dishonorable servitude into which</a>
<a id='line_850'>      it was sunk.”</a>
<a id='line_851'></a>
<a id='line_852'>      It is in vain, then, that Gibbon pretends to attribute solely to</a>
<a id='line_853'>      the desire of keeping up the number of slaves, the milder conduct</a>
<a id='line_854'>      which the Romans began to adopt in their favor at the time of the</a>
<a id='line_855'>      emperors. This cause had hitherto acted in an opposite direction;</a>
<a id='line_856'>      how came it on a sudden to have a different influence? “The</a>
<a id='line_857'>      masters,” he says, “encouraged the marriage of their slaves; * *</a>
<a id='line_858'>      * the sentiments of nature, the habits of education, contributed</a>
<a id='line_859'>      to alleviate the hardships of servitude.” The children of slaves</a>
<a id='line_860'>      were the property of their master, who could dispose of or</a>
<a id='line_861'>      alienate them like the rest of his property. Is it in such a</a>
<a id='line_862'>      situation, with such notions, that the sentiments of nature</a>
<a id='line_863'>      unfold themselves, or habits of education become mild and</a>
<a id='line_864'>      peaceful? We must not attribute to causes inadequate or</a>
<a id='line_865'>      altogether without force, effects which require to explain them a</a>
<a id='line_866'>      reference to more influential causes; and even if these slighter</a>
<a id='line_867'>      causes had in effect a manifest influence, we must not forget</a>
<a id='line_868'>      that they are themselves the effect of a primary, a higher, and</a>
<a id='line_869'>      more extensive cause, which, in giving to the mind and to the</a>
<a id='line_870'>      character a more disinterested and more humane bias, disposed men</a>
<a id='line_871'>      to second or themselves to advance, by their conduct, and by the</a>

<a id='line_875'>      I have retained the whole of M. Guizot’s note, though, in his</a>
<a id='line_876'>      zeal for the invaluable blessings of freedom and Christianity, he</a>
<a id='line_877'>      has done Gibbon injustice. The condition of the slaves was</a>
<a id='line_878'>      undoubtedly improved under the emperors. What a great authority</a>
<a id='line_879'>      has said, “The condition of a slave is better under an arbitrary</a>
<a id='line_880'>      than under a free government,” (Smith’s Wealth of Nations, iv.</a>
<a id='line_881'>      7,) is, I believe, supported by the history of all ages and</a>
<a id='line_882'>      nations. The protecting edicts of Hadrian and the Antonines are</a>
<a id='line_883'>      historical facts, and can as little be attributed to the</a>
<a id='line_884'>      influence of Christianity, as the milder language of heathen</a>
<a id='line_885'>      writers, of Seneca, (particularly Ep. 47,) of Pliny, and of</a>

<a id='line_940'>      51 It was a maxim of ancient jurisprudence, that a slave had not</a>

<a id='line_1027'>      such a degree of accuracy, as the importance of the object would</a>
<a id='line_1028'>      deserve. We are informed, that when the Emperor Claudius</a>

<a id='line_1031'>      who, with the proportion of women and children, must have</a>
<a id='line_1032'>      amounted to about twenty millions of souls. The multitude of</a>
<a id='line_1033'>      subjects of an inferior rank was uncertain and fluctuating. But,</a>
<a id='line_1034'>      after weighing with attention every circumstance which could</a>
<a id='line_1035'>      influence the balance, it seems probable that there existed, in</a>

<a id='line_1039'>      the Roman world.611 The total amount of this imperfect</a>
<a id='line_1040'>      calculation would rise to about one hundred and twenty millions</a>
<a id='line_1041'>      of persons; a degree of population which possibly exceeds that of</a>
<a id='line_1042'>      modern Europe, 62 and forms the most numerous society that has</a>
<a id='line_1043'>      ever been united under the same system of government.</a>

<a id='line_1049'>      of Alexander Severus, A. D. 222, 235. The proportion was probably</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      larger in Italy than in the provinces.—M. On the other hand,</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      Zumpt, in his Dissertation quoted below, (p. 86,) asserts it to</a>
<a id='line_1052'>      be a gross error in Gibbon to reckon the number of slaves equal</a>
<a id='line_1053'>      to that of the free population. The luxury and magnificence of</a>
<a id='line_1054'>      the great, (he observes,) at the commencement of the empire, must</a>
<a id='line_1055'>      not be taken as the groundwork of calculations for the whole</a>
<a id='line_1056'>      Roman world. “The agricultural laborer, and the artisan, in</a>
<a id='line_1057'>      Spain, Gaul, Britain, Syria, and Egypt, maintained himself, as in</a>
<a id='line_1058'>      the present day, by his own labor and that of his household,</a>
<a id='line_1059'>      without possessing a single slave.” The latter part of my note</a>
<a id='line_1060'>      was intended to suggest this consideration. Yet so completely was</a>
<a id='line_1061'>      slavery rooted in the social system, both in the east and the</a>
<a id='line_1062'>      west, that in the great diffusion of wealth at this time, every</a>
<a id='line_1063'>      one, I doubt not, who could afford a domestic slave, kept one;</a>
<a id='line_1064'>      and generally, the number of slaves was in proportion to the</a>
<a id='line_1065'>      wealth. I do not believe that the cultivation of the soil by</a>
<a id='line_1066'>      slaves was confined to Italy; the holders of large estates in the</a>
<a id='line_1067'>      provinces would probably, either from choice or necessity, adopt</a>
<a id='line_1068'>      the same mode of cultivation. The latifundia, says Pliny, had</a>
<a id='line_1069'>      ruined Italy, and had begun to ruin the provinces. Slaves were no</a>
<a id='line_1070'>      doubt employed in agricultural labor to a great extent in Sicily,</a>
<a id='line_1071'>      and were the estates of those six enormous landholders who were</a>
<a id='line_1072'>      said to have possessed the whole province of Africa, cultivated</a>
<a id='line_1073'>      altogether by free coloni? Whatever may have been the case in the</a>
<a id='line_1074'>      rural districts, in the towns and cities the household duties</a>
<a id='line_1075'>      were almost entirely discharged by slaves, and vast numbers</a>
<a id='line_1076'>      belonged to the public establishments. I do not, however, differ</a>
<a id='line_1077'>      so far from Zumpt, and from M. Dureau de la Malle, as to adopt</a>
<a id='line_1078'>      the higher and bolder estimate of Robertson and Mr. Blair, rather</a>
<a id='line_1079'>      than the more cautious suggestions of Gibbon. I would reduce</a>
<a id='line_1080'>      rather than increase the proportion of the slave population. The</a>
<a id='line_1081'>      very ingenious and elaborate calculations of the French writer,</a>
<a id='line_1082'>      by which he deduces the amount of the population from the produce</a>

<a id='line_1116'>      Dureau de la Malle, in his Economie Politique des Romains, liv.</a>
<a id='line_1117'>      ii. c. 1. to 8, and M. Zumpt, in a dissertation printed in the</a>
<a id='line_1118'>      Transactions of the Berlin Academy, 1840. M. Dureau de la Malle</a>
<a id='line_1119'>      confines his inquiry almost entirely to the city of Rome, and</a>
<a id='line_1120'>      Roman Italy. Zumpt examines at greater length the axiom, which he</a>
<a id='line_1121'>      supposes to have been assumed by Gibbon as unquestionable, “that</a>
<a id='line_1122'>      Italy and the Roman world was never so populous as in the time of</a>
<a id='line_1123'>      the Antonines.” Though this probably was Gibbon’s opinion, he has</a>
<a id='line_1124'>      not stated it so peremptorily as asserted by Mr. Zumpt. It had</a>
<a id='line_1125'>      before been expressly laid down by Hume, and his statement was</a>
<a id='line_1126'>      controverted by Wallace and by Malthus. Gibbon says (p. 84) that</a>
<a id='line_1127'>      there is no reason to believe the country (of Italy) less</a>
<a id='line_1128'>      populous in the age of the Antonines, than in that of Romulus;</a>
<a id='line_1129'>      and Zumpt acknowledges that we have no satisfactory knowledge of</a>
<a id='line_1130'>      the state of Italy at that early age. Zumpt, in my opinion with</a>
<a id='line_1131'>      some reason, takes the period just before the first Punic war, as</a>
<a id='line_1132'>      that in which Roman Italy (all south of the Rubicon) was most</a>
<a id='line_1133'>      populous. From that time, the numbers began to diminish, at first</a>
<a id='line_1134'>      from the enormous waste of life out of the free population in the</a>
<a id='line_1135'>      foreign, and afterwards in the civil wars; from the cultivation</a>
<a id='line_1136'>      of the soil by slaves; towards the close of the republic, from</a>
<a id='line_1137'>      the repugnance to marriage, which resisted alike the dread of</a>
<a id='line_1138'>      legal punishment and the offer of legal immunity and privilege;</a>
<a id='line_1139'>      and from the depravity of manners, which interfered with the</a>
<a id='line_1140'>      procreation, the birth, and the rearing of children. The</a>
<a id='line_1141'>      arguments and the authorities of Zumpt are equally conclusive as</a>
<a id='line_1142'>      to the decline of population in Greece. Still the details, which</a>
<a id='line_1143'>      he himself adduces as to the prosperity and populousness of Asia</a>

<a id='line_1575'>      construction of the Roman highways, whose firmness has not</a>

<a id='line_1665'>      improvements, of social life. In the more remote ages of</a>

<a id='line_1667'>      immemorial possession of arts and luxury; whilst the West was</a>

<a id='line_1680'>      principal heads. 1. Almost all the flowers, the herbs, and the</a>
<a id='line_1681'>      fruits, that grow in our European gardens, are of foreign</a>
<a id='line_1682'>      extraction, which, in many cases, is betrayed even by their</a>
<a id='line_1683'>      names: the apple was a native of Italy, and when the Romans had</a>
<a id='line_1684'>      tasted the richer flavor of the apricot, the peach, the</a>
<a id='line_1685'>      pomegranate, the citron, and the orange, they contented</a>
<a id='line_1686'>      themselves with applying to all these new fruits the common</a>
<a id='line_1687'>      denomination of apple, discriminating them from each other by the</a>
<a id='line_1688'>      additional epithet of their country. 2. In the time of Homer, the</a>
<a id='line_1689'>      vine grew wild in the island of Sicily, and most probably in the</a>
<a id='line_1690'>      adjacent continent; but it was not improved by the skill, nor did</a>
<a id='line_1691'>      it afford a liquor grateful to the taste, of the savage</a>
<a id='line_1692'>      inhabitants. 94 A thousand years afterwards, Italy could boast,</a>
<a id='line_1693'>      that of the fourscore most generous and celebrated wines, more</a>
<a id='line_1694'>      than two thirds were produced from her soil. 95 The blessing was</a>
<a id='line_1695'>      soon communicated to the Narbonnese province of Gaul; but so</a>
<a id='line_1696'>      intense was the cold to the north of the Cevennes, that, in the</a>
<a id='line_1697'>      time of Strabo, it was thought impossible to ripen the grapes in</a>
<a id='line_1698'>      those parts of Gaul. 96 This difficulty, however, was gradually</a>
<a id='line_1699'>      vanquished; and there is some reason to believe, that the</a>
<a id='line_1700'>      vineyards of Burgundy are as old as the age of the Antonines. 97</a>
<a id='line_1701'>      3. The olive, in the western world, followed the progress of</a>
<a id='line_1702'>      peace, of which it was considered as the symbol. Two centuries</a>
<a id='line_1703'>      after the foundation of Rome, both Italy and Africa were</a>
<a id='line_1704'>      strangers to that useful plant: it was naturalized in those</a>
<a id='line_1705'>      countries; and at length carried into the heart of Spain and</a>
<a id='line_1706'>      Gaul. The timid errors of the ancients, that it required a</a>
<a id='line_1707'>      certain degree of heat, and could only flourish in the</a>
<a id='line_1708'>      neighborhood of the sea, were insensibly exploded by industry and</a>
<a id='line_1709'>      experience. 4. The cultivation of flax was transported from Egypt</a>
<a id='line_1710'>      to Gaul, and enriched the whole country, however it might</a>
<a id='line_1711'>      impoverish the particular lands on which it was sown. 99 5. The</a>
<a id='line_1712'>      use of artificial grasses became familiar to the farmers both of</a>
<a id='line_1713'>      Italy and the provinces, particularly the Lucerne, which derived</a>
<a id='line_1714'>      its name and origin from Media. 100 The assured supply of</a>
<a id='line_1715'>      wholesome and plentiful food for the cattle during winter,</a>
<a id='line_1716'>      multiplied the number of the docks and herds, which in their turn</a>
<a id='line_1717'>      contributed to the fertility of the soil. To all these</a>
<a id='line_1718'>      improvements may be added an assiduous attention to mines and</a>
<a id='line_1719'>      fisheries, which, by employing a multitude of laborious hands,</a>
<a id='line_1720'>      serve to increase the pleasures of the rich and the subsistence</a>
<a id='line_1721'>      of the poor. The elegant treatise of Columella describes the</a>
<a id='line_1722'>      advanced state of the Spanish husbandry under the reign of</a>
<a id='line_1723'>      Tiberius; and it may be observed, that those famines, which so</a>

<a id='line_1774'>      Agriculture is the foundation of manufactures; since the</a>
<a id='line_1775'>      productions of nature are the materials of art. Under the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1776'>      empire, the labor of an industrious and ingenious people was</a>
<a id='line_1777'>      variously, but incessantly, employed in the service of the rich.</a>
<a id='line_1778'>      In their dress, their table, their houses, and their furniture,</a>
<a id='line_1779'>      the favorites of fortune united every refinement of conveniency,</a>
<a id='line_1780'>      of elegance, and of splendor, whatever could soothe their pride</a>
<a id='line_1781'>      or gratify their sensuality. Such refinements, under the odious</a>
<a id='line_1782'>      name of luxury, have been severely arraigned by the moralists of</a>
<a id='line_1783'>      every age; and it might perhaps be more conducive to the virtue,</a>
<a id='line_1784'>      as well as happiness, of mankind, if all possessed the</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      necessaries, and none the superfluities, of life. But in the</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      present imperfect condition of society, luxury, though it may</a>
<a id='line_1787'>      proceed from vice or folly, seems to be the only means that can</a>
<a id='line_1788'>      correct the unequal distribution of property. The diligent</a>
<a id='line_1789'>      mechanic, and the skilful artist, who have obtained no share in</a>
<a id='line_1790'>      the division of the earth, receive a voluntary tax from the</a>
<a id='line_1791'>      possessors of land; and the latter are prompted, by a sense of</a>
<a id='line_1792'>      interest, to improve those estates, with whose produce they may</a>
<a id='line_1793'>      purchase additional pleasures. This operation, the particular</a>
<a id='line_1794'>      effects of which are felt in every society, acted with much more</a>
<a id='line_1795'>      diffusive energy in the Roman world. The provinces would soon</a>
<a id='line_1796'>      have been exhausted of their wealth, if the manufactures and</a>
<a id='line_1797'>      commerce of luxury had not insensibly restored to the industrious</a>
<a id='line_1798'>      subjects the sums which were exacted from them by the arms and</a>
<a id='line_1799'>      authority of Rome. As long as the circulation was confined within</a>
<a id='line_1800'>      the bounds of the empire, it impressed the political machine with</a>
<a id='line_1801'>      a new degree of activity, and its consequences, sometimes</a>
<a id='line_1802'>      beneficial, could never become pernicious.</a>
<a id='line_1803'></a>
<a id='line_1804'>      But it is no easy task to confine luxury within the limits of an</a>
<a id='line_1805'>      empire. The most remote countries of the ancient world were</a>
<a id='line_1806'>      ransacked to supply the pomp and delicacy of Rome. The forests of</a>
<a id='line_1807'>      Scythia afforded some valuable furs. Amber was brought over land</a>
<a id='line_1808'>      from the shores of the Baltic to the Danube; and the barbarians</a>
<a id='line_1809'>      were astonished at the price which they received in exchange for</a>
<a id='line_1810'>      so useless a commodity. 101 There was a considerable demand for</a>
<a id='line_1811'>      Babylonian carpets, and other manufactures of the East; but the</a>
<a id='line_1812'>      most important and unpopular branch of foreign trade was carried</a>
<a id='line_1813'>      on with Arabia and India. Every year, about the time of the</a>
<a id='line_1814'>      summer solstice, a fleet of a hundred and twenty vessels sailed</a>
<a id='line_1815'>      from Myos-hormos, a port of Egypt, on the Red Sea. By the</a>
<a id='line_1816'>      periodical assistance of the monsoons, they traversed the ocean</a>
<a id='line_1817'>      in about forty days. The coast of Malabar, or the island of</a>
<a id='line_1818'>      Ceylon, 102 was the usual term of their navigation, and it was in</a>
<a id='line_1819'>      those markets that the merchants from the more remote countries</a>
<a id='line_1820'>      of Asia expected their arrival. The return of the fleet of Egypt</a>
<a id='line_1821'>      was fixed to the months of December or January; and as soon as</a>
<a id='line_1822'>      their rich cargo had been transported on the backs of camels,</a>
<a id='line_1823'>      from the Red Sea to the Nile, and had descended that river as far</a>
<a id='line_1824'>      as Alexandria, it was poured, without delay, into the capital of</a>
<a id='line_1825'>      the empire. 103 The objects of oriental traffic were splendid and</a>
<a id='line_1826'>      trifling; silk, a pound of which was esteemed not inferior in</a>
<a id='line_1827'>      value to a pound of gold; 104 precious stones, among which the</a>
<a id='line_1828'>      pearl claimed the first rank after the diamond; 105 and a variety</a>
<a id='line_1829'>      of aromatics, that were consumed in religious worship and the</a>
<a id='line_1830'>      pomp of funerals. The labor and risk of the voyage was rewarded</a>
<a id='line_1831'>      with almost incredible profit; but the profit was made upon Roman</a>
<a id='line_1832'>      subjects, and a few individuals were enriched at the expense of</a>
<a id='line_1833'>      the public. As the natives of Arabia and India were contented</a>
<a id='line_1834'>      with the productions and manufactures of their own country,</a>
<a id='line_1835'>      silver, on the side of the Romans, was the principal, if not the</a>
<a id='line_1836'>      only 1051 instrument of commerce. It was a complaint worthy of</a>
<a id='line_1837'>      the gravity of the senate, that, in the purchase of female</a>
<a id='line_1838'>      ornaments, the wealth of the state was irrecoverably given away</a>
<a id='line_1839'>      to foreign and hostile nations. 106 The annual loss is computed,</a>
<a id='line_1840'>      by a writer of an inquisitive but censorious temper, at upwards</a>
<a id='line_1841'>      of eight hundred thousand pounds sterling. 107 Such was the style</a>
<a id='line_1842'>      of discontent, brooding over the dark prospect of approaching</a>
<a id='line_1843'>      poverty. And yet, if we compare the proportion between gold and</a>
<a id='line_1844'>      silver, as it stood in the time of Pliny, and as it was fixed in</a>
<a id='line_1845'>      the reign of Constantine, we shall discover within that period a</a>
<a id='line_1846'>      very considerable increase. 108 There is not the least reason to</a>
<a id='line_1847'>      suppose that gold was become more scarce; it is therefore evident</a>
<a id='line_1848'>      that silver was grown more common; that whatever might be the</a>

<a id='line_2012'>      The sublime Longinus, who, in somewhat a later period, and in the</a>
<a id='line_2013'>      court of a Syrian queen, preserved the spirit of ancient Athens,</a>
<a id='line_2014'>      observes and laments this degeneracy of his contemporaries, which</a>
<a id='line_2015'>      debased their sentiments, enervated their courage, and depressed</a>
<a id='line_2016'>      their talents. “In the same manner,” says he, “as some children</a>
<a id='line_2017'>      always remain pygmies, whose infant limbs have been too closely</a>
<a id='line_2018'>      confined, thus our tender minds, fettered by the prejudices and</a>
<a id='line_2019'>      habits of a just servitude, are unable to expand themselves, or</a>
<a id='line_2020'>      to attain that well-proportioned greatness which we admire in the</a>
<a id='line_2021'>      ancients; who, living under a popular government, wrote with the</a>
<a id='line_2022'>      same freedom as they acted.” 111 This diminutive stature of</a>
<a id='line_2023'>      mankind, if we pursue the metaphor, was daily sinking below the</a>
<a id='line_2024'>      old standard, and the Roman world was indeed peopled by a race of</a>
<a id='line_2025'>      pygmies; when the fierce giants of the north broke in, and mended</a>
<a id='line_2026'>      the puny breed. They restored a manly spirit of freedom; and</a>
<a id='line_2027'>      after the revolution of ten centuries, freedom became the happy</a>
