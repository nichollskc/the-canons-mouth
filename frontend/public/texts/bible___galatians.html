                    <a id='line_0'>The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus</a>
<a id='line_4'>Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) 1:2 And all</a>
<a id='line_5'>the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: 1:3</a>
<a id='line_6'>Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus</a>
<a id='line_7'>Christ, 1:4 Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us</a>
<a id='line_8'>from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our</a>
<a id='line_9'>Father: 1:5 To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_10'></a>
<a id='line_11'>1:6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into</a>
<a id='line_12'>the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 1:7 Which is not another; but</a>
<a id='line_13'>there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of</a>
<a id='line_14'>Christ.</a>
<a id='line_15'></a>
<a id='line_16'>1:8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel</a>
<a id='line_17'>unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be</a>
<a id='line_18'>accursed.</a>
<a id='line_19'></a>
<a id='line_20'>1:9 As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other</a>
<a id='line_21'>gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</a>
<a id='line_22'></a>
<a id='line_23'>1:10 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men?</a>
<a id='line_24'>for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'>1:11 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached</a>
<a id='line_27'>of me is not after man.</a>
<a id='line_28'></a>
<a id='line_29'>1:12 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by</a>
<a id='line_30'>the revelation of Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_31'></a>
<a id='line_32'>1:13 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’</a>
<a id='line_33'>religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and</a>
<a id='line_34'>wasted it: 1:14 And profited in the Jews’ religion above many my</a>
<a id='line_35'>equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the</a>
<a id='line_36'>traditions of my fathers.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>1:15 But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb,</a>
<a id='line_39'>and called me by his grace, 1:16 To reveal his Son in me, that I might</a>
<a id='line_40'>preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh</a>
<a id='line_41'>and blood: 1:17 Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were</a>
<a id='line_42'>apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto</a>
<a id='line_43'>Damascus.</a>
<a id='line_44'></a>
<a id='line_45'>1:18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and</a>
<a id='line_46'>abode with him fifteen days.</a>
<a id='line_47'></a>
<a id='line_48'>1:19 But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s</a>
<a id='line_49'>brother.</a>
<a id='line_50'></a>
<a id='line_51'>1:20 Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie</a>
<a id='line_52'>not.</a>
<a id='line_53'></a>
<a id='line_54'>1:21 Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; 1:22 And</a>
<a id='line_55'>was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:</a>
<a id='line_56'>1:23 But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times</a>
<a id='line_57'>past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.</a>
<a id='line_58'></a>
<a id='line_59'>1:24 And they glorified God in me.</a>
<a id='line_60'></a>
<a id='line_61'>2:1 Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with</a>
<a id='line_62'>Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>2:2 And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that</a>
<a id='line_65'>gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which</a>
<a id='line_66'>were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in</a>
<a id='line_67'>vain.</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>2:3 But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled</a>
<a id='line_70'>to be circumcised: 2:4 And that because of false brethren unawares</a>
<a id='line_71'>brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have</a>
<a id='line_72'>in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: 2:5 To whom we</a>
<a id='line_73'>gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the</a>
<a id='line_74'>gospel might continue with you.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>2:6 But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it</a>
<a id='line_77'>maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man’s person:) for they who</a>
<a id='line_78'>seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me: 2:7 But</a>
<a id='line_79'>contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was</a>
<a id='line_80'>committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;</a>
<a id='line_81'>2:8 (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of</a>
<a id='line_82'>the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:) 2:9</a>
<a id='line_83'>And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived</a>
<a id='line_84'>the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the</a>
<a id='line_85'>right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and</a>
<a id='line_86'>they unto the circumcision.</a>
<a id='line_87'></a>
<a id='line_88'>2:10 Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which</a>
<a id='line_89'>I also was forward to do.</a>
<a id='line_90'></a>
<a id='line_91'>2:11 But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face,</a>
<a id='line_92'>because he was to be blamed.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>2:12 For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the</a>
<a id='line_95'>Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself,</a>
<a id='line_96'>fearing them which were of the circumcision.</a>
<a id='line_97'></a>
<a id='line_98'>2:13 And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that</a>
<a id='line_99'>Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>2:14 But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the</a>
<a id='line_102'>truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being</a>
<a id='line_103'>a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews,</a>
<a id='line_104'>why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?  2:15 We who</a>
<a id='line_105'>are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, 2:16 Knowing that</a>
<a id='line_106'>a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of</a>
<a id='line_107'>Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be</a>
<a id='line_108'>justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for</a>
<a id='line_109'>by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</a>
<a id='line_110'></a>
<a id='line_111'>2:17 But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves</a>
<a id='line_112'>also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God</a>
<a id='line_113'>forbid.</a>
<a id='line_114'></a>
<a id='line_115'>2:18 For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself</a>
<a id='line_116'>a transgressor.</a>
<a id='line_117'></a>
<a id='line_118'>2:19 For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto</a>
<a id='line_119'>God.</a>
<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>2:20 I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but</a>
<a id='line_122'>Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live</a>
<a id='line_123'>by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</a>
<a id='line_124'></a>
<a id='line_125'>2:21 I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by</a>
<a id='line_126'>the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>3:1 O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not</a>
<a id='line_129'>obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set</a>
<a id='line_130'>forth, crucified among you?  3:2 This only would I learn of you,</a>
<a id='line_131'>Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of</a>
<a id='line_132'>faith?  3:3 Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now</a>
<a id='line_133'>made perfect by the flesh?  3:4 Have ye suffered so many things in</a>
<a id='line_134'>vain? if it be yet in vain.</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>3:5 He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh</a>
<a id='line_137'>miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the</a>
<a id='line_138'>hearing of faith?  3:6 Even as Abraham believed God, and it was</a>
<a id='line_139'>accounted to him for righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>3:7 Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the</a>
<a id='line_142'>children of Abraham.</a>
<a id='line_143'></a>
<a id='line_144'>3:8 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen</a>
<a id='line_145'>through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In</a>
<a id='line_146'>thee shall all nations be blessed.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>3:9 So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</a>
<a id='line_149'></a>
<a id='line_150'>3:10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse:</a>
<a id='line_151'>for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all</a>
<a id='line_152'>things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>3:11 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it</a>
<a id='line_155'>is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>3:12 And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall</a>
<a id='line_158'>live in them.</a>
<a id='line_159'></a>
<a id='line_160'>3:13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a</a>
<a id='line_161'>curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a</a>
<a id='line_162'>tree: 3:14 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles</a>
<a id='line_163'>through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit</a>
<a id='line_164'>through faith.</a>
<a id='line_165'></a>
<a id='line_166'>3:15 Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a</a>
<a id='line_167'>man’s covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth</a>
<a id='line_168'>thereto.</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>3:16 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not,</a>
<a id='line_171'>And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is</a>
<a id='line_172'>Christ.</a>
<a id='line_173'></a>
<a id='line_174'>3:17 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of</a>
<a id='line_175'>God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after,</a>
<a id='line_176'>cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.</a>
<a id='line_177'></a>
<a id='line_178'>3:18 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise:</a>
<a id='line_179'>but God gave it to Abraham by promise.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>3:19 Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of</a>
<a id='line_182'>transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was</a>
<a id='line_183'>made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</a>
<a id='line_184'></a>
<a id='line_185'>3:20 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.</a>
<a id='line_186'></a>
<a id='line_187'>3:21 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if</a>
<a id='line_188'>there had been a law given which could have given life, verily</a>
<a id='line_189'>righteousness should have been by the law.</a>
<a id='line_190'></a>
<a id='line_191'>3:22 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise</a>
<a id='line_192'>by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</a>
<a id='line_193'></a>
<a id='line_194'>3:23 But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto</a>
<a id='line_195'>the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>3:24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ,</a>
<a id='line_198'>that we might be justified by faith.</a>
<a id='line_199'></a>
<a id='line_200'>3:25 But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a</a>
<a id='line_201'>schoolmaster.</a>
<a id='line_202'></a>
<a id='line_203'>3:26 For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_204'></a>
<a id='line_205'>3:27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on</a>
<a id='line_206'>Christ.</a>
<a id='line_207'></a>
<a id='line_208'>3:28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free,</a>
<a id='line_209'>there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_210'></a>
<a id='line_211'>3:29 And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs</a>
<a id='line_212'>according to the promise.</a>
<a id='line_213'></a>
<a id='line_214'>4:1 Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth</a>
<a id='line_215'>nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; 4:2 But is under</a>
<a id='line_216'>tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.</a>
<a id='line_217'></a>
<a id='line_218'>4:3 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the</a>
<a id='line_219'>elements of the world: 4:4 But when the fulness of the time was come,</a>
<a id='line_220'>God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, 4:5 To</a>
<a id='line_221'>redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the</a>
<a id='line_222'>adoption of sons.</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>4:6 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son</a>
<a id='line_225'>into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>4:7 Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son,</a>
<a id='line_228'>then an heir of God through Christ.</a>
<a id='line_229'></a>
<a id='line_230'>4:8 Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which</a>
<a id='line_231'>by nature are no gods.</a>
<a id='line_232'></a>
<a id='line_233'>4:9 But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God,</a>
<a id='line_234'>how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye</a>
<a id='line_235'>desire again to be in bondage?  4:10 Ye observe days, and months, and</a>
<a id='line_236'>times, and years.</a>
<a id='line_237'></a>
<a id='line_238'>4:11 I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>4:12 Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have</a>
<a id='line_241'>not injured me at all.</a>
<a id='line_242'></a>
<a id='line_243'>4:13 Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel</a>
<a id='line_244'>unto you at the first.</a>
<a id='line_245'></a>
<a id='line_246'>4:14 And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor</a>
<a id='line_247'>rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_248'></a>
<a id='line_249'>4:15 Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record,</a>
<a id='line_250'>that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own</a>
<a id='line_251'>eyes, and have given them to me.</a>
<a id='line_252'></a>
<a id='line_253'>4:16 Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</a>
<a id='line_254'>4:17 They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude</a>
<a id='line_255'>you, that ye might affect them.</a>
<a id='line_256'></a>
<a id='line_257'>4:18 But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing,</a>
<a id='line_258'>and not only when I am present with you.</a>
<a id='line_259'></a>
<a id='line_260'>4:19 My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ</a>
<a id='line_261'>be formed in you, 4:20 I desire to be present with you now, and to</a>
<a id='line_262'>change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>4:21 Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the</a>
<a id='line_265'>law?  4:22 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a</a>
<a id='line_266'>bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>4:23 But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he</a>
<a id='line_269'>of the freewoman was by promise.</a>
<a id='line_270'></a>
<a id='line_271'>4:24 Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants;</a>
<a id='line_272'>the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is</a>
<a id='line_273'>Agar.</a>
<a id='line_274'></a>
<a id='line_275'>4:25 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to</a>
<a id='line_276'>Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</a>
<a id='line_277'></a>
<a id='line_278'>4:26 But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us</a>
<a id='line_279'>all.</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>4:27 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break</a>
<a id='line_282'>forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many</a>
<a id='line_283'>more children than she which hath an husband.</a>
<a id='line_284'></a>
<a id='line_285'>4:28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</a>
<a id='line_286'></a>
<a id='line_287'>4:29 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that</a>
<a id='line_288'>was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.</a>
<a id='line_289'></a>
<a id='line_290'>4:30 Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and</a>
<a id='line_291'>her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son</a>
<a id='line_292'>of the freewoman.</a>
<a id='line_293'></a>
<a id='line_294'>4:31 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of</a>
<a id='line_295'>the free.</a>
<a id='line_296'></a>
<a id='line_297'>5:1 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us</a>
<a id='line_298'>free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</a>
<a id='line_299'></a>
<a id='line_300'>5:2 Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ</a>
<a id='line_301'>shall profit you nothing.</a>
<a id='line_302'></a>
<a id='line_303'>5:3 For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a</a>
<a id='line_304'>debtor to do the whole law.</a>
<a id='line_305'></a>
<a id='line_306'>5:4 Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are</a>
<a id='line_307'>justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.</a>
<a id='line_308'></a>
<a id='line_309'>5:5 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by</a>
<a id='line_310'>faith.</a>
<a id='line_311'></a>
<a id='line_312'>5:6 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor</a>
<a id='line_313'>uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.</a>
<a id='line_314'></a>
<a id='line_315'>5:7 Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the</a>
<a id='line_316'>truth?  5:8 This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.</a>
<a id='line_317'></a>
<a id='line_318'>5:9 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</a>
<a id='line_319'></a>
<a id='line_320'>5:10 I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none</a>
<a id='line_321'>otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment,</a>
<a id='line_322'>whosoever he be.</a>
<a id='line_323'></a>
<a id='line_324'>5:11 And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet</a>
<a id='line_325'>suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.</a>
<a id='line_326'></a>
<a id='line_327'>5:12 I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</a>
<a id='line_328'></a>
<a id='line_329'>5:13 For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not</a>
<a id='line_330'>liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</a>
<a id='line_331'></a>
<a id='line_332'>5:14 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou</a>
<a id='line_333'>shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</a>
<a id='line_334'></a>
<a id='line_335'>5:15 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not</a>
<a id='line_336'>consumed one of another.</a>
<a id='line_337'></a>
<a id='line_338'>5:16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the</a>
<a id='line_339'>lust of the flesh.</a>
<a id='line_340'></a>
<a id='line_341'>5:17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against</a>
<a id='line_342'>the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye</a>
<a id='line_343'>cannot do the things that ye would.</a>
<a id='line_344'></a>
<a id='line_345'>5:18 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</a>
<a id='line_346'></a>
<a id='line_347'>5:19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these;</a>
<a id='line_348'>Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 5:20 Idolatry,</a>
<a id='line_349'>witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions,</a>
<a id='line_350'>heresies, 5:21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such</a>
<a id='line_351'>like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time</a>
<a id='line_352'>past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_353'>God.</a>
<a id='line_354'></a>
<a id='line_355'>5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,</a>
<a id='line_356'>gentleness, goodness, faith, 5:23 Meekness, temperance: against such</a>
<a id='line_357'>there is no law.</a>
<a id='line_358'></a>
<a id='line_359'>5:24 And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the</a>
<a id='line_360'>affections and lusts.</a>
<a id='line_361'></a>
<a id='line_362'>5:25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</a>
<a id='line_363'></a>
<a id='line_364'>5:26 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another,</a>
<a id='line_365'>envying one another.</a>
<a id='line_366'></a>
<a id='line_367'>6:1 Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are</a>
<a id='line_368'>spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering</a>
<a id='line_369'>thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</a>
<a id='line_370'></a>
<a id='line_371'>6:2 Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</a>
<a id='line_372'></a>
<a id='line_373'>6:3 For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he</a>
<a id='line_374'>deceiveth himself.</a>
<a id='line_375'></a>
<a id='line_376'>6:4 But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have</a>
<a id='line_377'>rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</a>
<a id='line_378'></a>
<a id='line_379'>6:5 For every man shall bear his own burden.</a>
<a id='line_380'></a>
<a id='line_381'>6:6 Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that</a>
<a id='line_382'>teacheth in all good things.</a>
<a id='line_383'></a>
<a id='line_384'>6:7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth,</a>
<a id='line_385'>that shall he also reap.</a>
<a id='line_386'></a>
<a id='line_387'>6:8 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap</a>
<a id='line_388'>corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap</a>
<a id='line_389'>life everlasting.</a>
<a id='line_390'></a>
<a id='line_391'>6:9 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall</a>
<a id='line_392'>reap, if we faint not.</a>
<a id='line_393'></a>
<a id='line_394'>6:10 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,</a>
<a id='line_395'>especially unto them who are of the household of faith.</a>
<a id='line_396'></a>
<a id='line_397'>6:11 Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own</a>
<a id='line_398'>hand.</a>
<a id='line_399'></a>
<a id='line_400'>6:12 As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they</a>
<a id='line_401'>constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer</a>
<a id='line_402'>persecution for the cross of Christ.</a>
<a id='line_403'></a>
<a id='line_404'>6:13 For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but</a>
<a id='line_405'>desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</a>
<a id='line_406'></a>
<a id='line_407'>6:14 But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord</a>
<a id='line_408'>Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the</a>
<a id='line_409'>world.</a>
<a id='line_410'></a>
<a id='line_411'>6:15 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor</a>
<a id='line_412'>uncircumcision, but a new creature.</a>
<a id='line_413'></a>
<a id='line_414'>6:16 And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and</a>
<a id='line_415'>mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</a>
<a id='line_416'></a>
<a id='line_417'>6:17 From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the</a>
<a id='line_418'>marks of the Lord Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_419'></a>
<a id='line_420'>6:18 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</a>
<a id='line_421'></a>
<a id='line_422'>Amen.</a>
<a id='line_423'></a>
<a id='line_424'></a>
