                    <a id='line_0'>The First Book of Samuel</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'>Otherwise Called:</a>
<a id='line_3'></a>
<a id='line_4'>The First Book of the Kings</a>
<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>1:1 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim,</a>
<a id='line_8'>and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the</a>
<a id='line_9'>son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: 1:2 And he had two wives;</a>
<a id='line_10'>the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah:</a>
<a id='line_11'>and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</a>
<a id='line_12'></a>
<a id='line_13'>1:3 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to</a>
<a id='line_14'>sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli,</a>
<a id='line_15'>Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.</a>
<a id='line_16'></a>
<a id='line_17'>1:4 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah</a>
<a id='line_18'>his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: 1:5 But</a>
<a id='line_19'>unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the</a>
<a id='line_20'>LORD had shut up her womb.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>1:6 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret,</a>
<a id='line_23'>because the LORD had shut up her womb.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'>1:7 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of</a>
<a id='line_26'>the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</a>
<a id='line_27'></a>
<a id='line_28'>1:8 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou?</a>
<a id='line_29'>and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better</a>
<a id='line_30'>to thee than ten sons?  1:9 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in</a>
<a id='line_31'>Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat</a>
<a id='line_32'>by a post of the temple of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'>1:10 And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_35'>wept sore.</a>
<a id='line_36'></a>
<a id='line_37'>1:11 And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt</a>
<a id='line_38'>indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and</a>
<a id='line_39'>not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man</a>
<a id='line_40'>child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life,</a>
<a id='line_41'>and there shall no razor come upon his head.</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>1:12 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_44'>that Eli marked her mouth.</a>
<a id='line_45'></a>
<a id='line_46'>1:13 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her</a>
<a id='line_47'>voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</a>
<a id='line_48'></a>
<a id='line_49'>1:14 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away</a>
<a id='line_50'>thy wine from thee.</a>
<a id='line_51'></a>
<a id='line_52'>1:15 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a</a>
<a id='line_53'>sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have</a>
<a id='line_54'>poured out my soul before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_55'></a>
<a id='line_56'>1:16 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the</a>
<a id='line_57'>abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.</a>
<a id='line_58'></a>
<a id='line_59'>1:17 Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel</a>
<a id='line_60'>grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>1:18 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the</a>
<a id='line_63'>woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.</a>
<a id='line_64'></a>
<a id='line_65'>1:19 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the</a>
<a id='line_66'>LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew</a>
<a id='line_67'>Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>1:20 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after</a>
<a id='line_70'>Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel,</a>
<a id='line_71'>saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_72'></a>
<a id='line_73'>1:21 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the</a>
<a id='line_74'>LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>1:22 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not</a>
<a id='line_77'>go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he</a>
<a id='line_78'>may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.</a>
<a id='line_79'></a>
<a id='line_80'>1:23 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good;</a>
<a id='line_81'>tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So</a>
<a id='line_82'>the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>1:24 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three</a>
<a id='line_85'>bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought</a>
<a id='line_86'>him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.</a>
<a id='line_87'></a>
<a id='line_88'>1:25 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>1:26 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the</a>
<a id='line_91'>woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>1:27 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition</a>
<a id='line_94'>which I asked of him: 1:28 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD;</a>
<a id='line_95'>as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped</a>
<a id='line_96'>the LORD there.</a>
<a id='line_97'></a>
<a id='line_98'>2:1 And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine</a>
<a id='line_99'>horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;</a>
<a id='line_100'>because I rejoice in thy salvation.</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>2:2 There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee:</a>
<a id='line_103'>neither is there any rock like our God.</a>
<a id='line_104'></a>
<a id='line_105'>2:3 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of</a>
<a id='line_106'>your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are</a>
<a id='line_107'>weighed.</a>
<a id='line_108'></a>
<a id='line_109'>2:4 The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are</a>
<a id='line_110'>girded with strength.</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'>2:5 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they</a>
<a id='line_113'>that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she</a>
<a id='line_114'>that hath many children is waxed feeble.</a>
<a id='line_115'></a>
<a id='line_116'>2:6 The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave,</a>
<a id='line_117'>and bringeth up.</a>
<a id='line_118'></a>
<a id='line_119'>2:7 The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and</a>
<a id='line_120'>lifteth up.</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>2:8 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar</a>
<a id='line_123'>from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit</a>
<a id='line_124'>the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD’s, and</a>
<a id='line_125'>he hath set the world upon them.</a>
<a id='line_126'></a>
<a id='line_127'>2:9 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be</a>
<a id='line_128'>silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</a>
<a id='line_129'></a>
<a id='line_130'>2:10 The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of</a>
<a id='line_131'>heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of</a>
<a id='line_132'>the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the</a>
<a id='line_133'>horn of his anointed.</a>
<a id='line_134'></a>
<a id='line_135'>2:11 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did</a>
<a id='line_136'>minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</a>
<a id='line_137'></a>
<a id='line_138'>2:12 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_139'></a>
<a id='line_140'>2:13 And the priest’s custom with the people was, that, when any man</a>
<a id='line_141'>offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in</a>
<a id='line_142'>seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand; 2:14 And he</a>
<a id='line_143'>struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the</a>
<a id='line_144'>fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in</a>
<a id='line_145'>Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.</a>
<a id='line_146'></a>
<a id='line_147'>2:15 Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and</a>
<a id='line_148'>said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest;</a>
<a id='line_149'>for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.</a>
<a id='line_150'></a>
<a id='line_151'>2:16 And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat</a>
<a id='line_152'>presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would</a>
<a id='line_153'>answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will</a>
<a id='line_154'>take it by force.</a>
<a id='line_155'></a>
<a id='line_156'>2:17 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the</a>
<a id='line_157'>LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_158'></a>
<a id='line_159'>2:18 But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with</a>
<a id='line_160'>a linen ephod.</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>2:19 Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him</a>
<a id='line_163'>from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the</a>
<a id='line_164'>yearly sacrifice.</a>
<a id='line_165'></a>
<a id='line_166'>2:20 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give</a>
<a id='line_167'>thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And</a>
<a id='line_168'>they went unto their own home.</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>2:21 And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare</a>
<a id='line_171'>three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the</a>
<a id='line_172'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_173'></a>
<a id='line_174'>2:22 Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all</a>
<a id='line_175'>Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of</a>
<a id='line_176'>the tabernacle of the congregation.</a>
<a id='line_177'></a>
<a id='line_178'>2:23 And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your</a>
<a id='line_179'>evil dealings by all this people.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>2:24 Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the</a>
<a id='line_182'>LORD’s people to transgress.</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>2:25 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if</a>
<a id='line_185'>a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding</a>
<a id='line_186'>they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD</a>
<a id='line_187'>would slay them.</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>2:26 And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the</a>
<a id='line_190'>LORD, and also with men.</a>
<a id='line_191'></a>
<a id='line_192'>2:27 And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus</a>
<a id='line_193'>saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father,</a>
<a id='line_194'>when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?  2:28 And did I choose him</a>
<a id='line_195'>out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine</a>
<a id='line_196'>altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give</a>
<a id='line_197'>unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the</a>
<a id='line_198'>children of Israel?  2:29 Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at</a>
<a id='line_199'>mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest</a>
<a id='line_200'>thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the</a>
<a id='line_201'>offerings of Israel my people?  2:30 Wherefore the LORD God of Israel</a>
<a id='line_202'>saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father,</a>
<a id='line_203'>should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from</a>
<a id='line_204'>me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me</a>
<a id='line_205'>shall be lightly esteemed.</a>
<a id='line_206'></a>
<a id='line_207'>2:31 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm</a>
<a id='line_208'>of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine</a>
<a id='line_209'>house.</a>
<a id='line_210'></a>
<a id='line_211'>2:32 And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth</a>
<a id='line_212'>which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in</a>
<a id='line_213'>thine house for ever.</a>
<a id='line_214'></a>
<a id='line_215'>2:33 And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar,</a>
<a id='line_216'>shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the</a>
<a id='line_217'>increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.</a>
<a id='line_218'></a>
<a id='line_219'>2:34 And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two</a>
<a id='line_220'>sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.</a>
<a id='line_221'></a>
<a id='line_222'>2:35 And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according</a>
<a id='line_223'>to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a</a>
<a id='line_224'>sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.</a>
<a id='line_225'></a>
<a id='line_226'>2:36 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine</a>
<a id='line_227'>house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel</a>
<a id='line_228'>of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’</a>
<a id='line_229'>offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>3:1 And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the</a>
<a id='line_232'>word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</a>
<a id='line_233'></a>
<a id='line_234'>3:2 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his</a>
<a id='line_235'>place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see; 3:3 And</a>
<a id='line_236'>ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark</a>
<a id='line_237'>of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep; 3:4 That the LORD</a>
<a id='line_238'>called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>3:5 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me.</a>
<a id='line_241'>And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</a>
<a id='line_242'></a>
<a id='line_243'>3:6 And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went</a>
<a id='line_244'>to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered,</a>
<a id='line_245'>I called not, my son; lie down again.</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'>3:7 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the</a>
<a id='line_248'>LORD yet revealed unto him.</a>
<a id='line_249'></a>
<a id='line_250'>3:8 And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and</a>
<a id='line_251'>went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli</a>
<a id='line_252'>perceived that the LORD had called the child.</a>
<a id='line_253'></a>
<a id='line_254'>3:9 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if</a>
<a id='line_255'>he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant</a>
<a id='line_256'>heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</a>
<a id='line_257'></a>
<a id='line_258'>3:10 And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times,</a>
<a id='line_259'>Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</a>
<a id='line_260'></a>
<a id='line_261'>3:11 And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel,</a>
<a id='line_262'>at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>3:12 In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have</a>
<a id='line_265'>spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.</a>
<a id='line_266'></a>
<a id='line_267'>3:13 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the</a>
<a id='line_268'>iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and</a>
<a id='line_269'>he restrained them not.</a>
<a id='line_270'></a>
<a id='line_271'>3:14 And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the</a>
<a id='line_272'>iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor</a>
<a id='line_273'>offering for ever.</a>
<a id='line_274'></a>
<a id='line_275'>3:15 And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the</a>
<a id='line_276'>house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.</a>
<a id='line_277'></a>
<a id='line_278'>3:16 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he</a>
<a id='line_279'>answered, Here am I.</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>3:17 And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee?</a>
<a id='line_282'>I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if</a>
<a id='line_283'>thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_284'></a>
<a id='line_285'>3:18 And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he</a>
<a id='line_286'>said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.</a>
<a id='line_287'></a>
<a id='line_288'>3:19 And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of</a>
<a id='line_289'>his words fall to the ground.</a>
<a id='line_290'></a>
<a id='line_291'>3:20 And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was</a>
<a id='line_292'>established to be a prophet of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_293'></a>
<a id='line_294'>3:21 And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed</a>
<a id='line_295'>himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_296'></a>
<a id='line_297'>4:1 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out</a>
<a id='line_298'>against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and</a>
<a id='line_299'>the Philistines pitched in Aphek.</a>
<a id='line_300'></a>
<a id='line_301'>4:2 And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and</a>
<a id='line_302'>when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines:</a>
<a id='line_303'>and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.</a>
<a id='line_304'></a>
<a id='line_305'>4:3 And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel</a>
<a id='line_306'>said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the</a>
<a id='line_307'>Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of</a>
<a id='line_308'>Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of</a>
<a id='line_309'>the hand of our enemies.</a>
<a id='line_310'></a>
<a id='line_311'>4:4 So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence</a>
<a id='line_312'>the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between</a>
<a id='line_313'>the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were</a>
<a id='line_314'>there with the ark of the covenant of God.</a>
<a id='line_315'></a>
<a id='line_316'>4:5 And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp,</a>
<a id='line_317'>all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.</a>
<a id='line_318'></a>
<a id='line_319'>4:6 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said,</a>
<a id='line_320'>What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?</a>
<a id='line_321'>And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.</a>
<a id='line_322'></a>
<a id='line_323'>4:7 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into</a>
<a id='line_324'>the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a</a>
<a id='line_325'>thing heretofore.</a>
<a id='line_326'></a>
<a id='line_327'>4:8 Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty</a>
<a id='line_328'>Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues</a>
<a id='line_329'>in the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_330'></a>
<a id='line_331'>4:9 Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye</a>
<a id='line_332'>be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit</a>
<a id='line_333'>yourselves like men, and fight.</a>
<a id='line_334'></a>
<a id='line_335'>4:10 And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled</a>
<a id='line_336'>every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for</a>
<a id='line_337'>there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.</a>
<a id='line_338'></a>
<a id='line_339'>4:11 And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and</a>
<a id='line_340'>Phinehas, were slain.</a>
<a id='line_341'></a>
<a id='line_342'>4:12 And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to</a>
<a id='line_343'>Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his</a>
<a id='line_344'>head.</a>
<a id='line_345'></a>
<a id='line_346'>4:13 And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside</a>
<a id='line_347'>watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man</a>
<a id='line_348'>came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.</a>
<a id='line_349'></a>
<a id='line_350'>4:14 And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth</a>
<a id='line_351'>the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.</a>
<a id='line_352'></a>
<a id='line_353'>4:15 Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim,</a>
<a id='line_354'>that he could not see.</a>
<a id='line_355'></a>
<a id='line_356'>4:16 And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and</a>
<a id='line_357'>I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my</a>
<a id='line_358'>son?  4:17 And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before</a>
<a id='line_359'>the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the</a>
<a id='line_360'>people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the</a>
<a id='line_361'>ark of God is taken.</a>
<a id='line_362'></a>
<a id='line_363'>4:18 And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that</a>
<a id='line_364'>he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his</a>
<a id='line_365'>neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had</a>
<a id='line_366'>judged Israel forty years.</a>
<a id='line_367'></a>
<a id='line_368'>4:19 And his daughter in law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to</a>
<a id='line_369'>be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was</a>
<a id='line_370'>taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed</a>
<a id='line_371'>herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.</a>
<a id='line_372'></a>
<a id='line_373'>4:20 And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said</a>
<a id='line_374'>unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not,</a>
<a id='line_375'>neither did she regard it.</a>
<a id='line_376'></a>
<a id='line_377'>4:21 And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed</a>
<a id='line_378'>from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her</a>
<a id='line_379'>father in law and her husband.</a>
<a id='line_380'></a>
<a id='line_381'>4:22 And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of</a>
<a id='line_382'>God is taken.</a>
<a id='line_383'></a>
<a id='line_384'>5:1 And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from</a>
<a id='line_385'>Ebenezer unto Ashdod.</a>
<a id='line_386'></a>
<a id='line_387'>5:2 When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the</a>
<a id='line_388'>house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.</a>
<a id='line_389'></a>
<a id='line_390'>5:3 And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon</a>
<a id='line_391'>was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And</a>
<a id='line_392'>they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.</a>
<a id='line_393'></a>
<a id='line_394'>5:4 And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was</a>
<a id='line_395'>fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the</a>
<a id='line_396'>head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the</a>
<a id='line_397'>threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.</a>
<a id='line_398'></a>
<a id='line_399'>5:5 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into</a>
<a id='line_400'>Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this</a>
<a id='line_401'>day.</a>
<a id='line_402'></a>
<a id='line_403'>5:6 But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he</a>
<a id='line_404'>destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the</a>
<a id='line_405'>coasts thereof.</a>
<a id='line_406'></a>
<a id='line_407'>5:7 And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark</a>
<a id='line_408'>of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore</a>
<a id='line_409'>upon us, and upon Dagon our god.</a>
<a id='line_410'></a>
<a id='line_411'>5:8 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines</a>
<a id='line_412'>unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of</a>
<a id='line_413'>Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried</a>
<a id='line_414'>about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about</a>
<a id='line_415'>thither.</a>
<a id='line_416'></a>
<a id='line_417'>5:9 And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of</a>
<a id='line_418'>the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he</a>
<a id='line_419'>smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods</a>
<a id='line_420'>in their secret parts.</a>
<a id='line_421'></a>
<a id='line_422'>5:10 Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass,</a>
<a id='line_423'>as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying,</a>
<a id='line_424'>They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us</a>
<a id='line_425'>and our people.</a>
<a id='line_426'></a>
<a id='line_427'>5:11 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the</a>
<a id='line_428'>Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let</a>
<a id='line_429'>it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for</a>
<a id='line_430'>there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of</a>
<a id='line_431'>God was very heavy there.</a>
<a id='line_432'></a>
<a id='line_433'>5:12 And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the</a>
<a id='line_434'>cry of the city went up to heaven.</a>
<a id='line_435'></a>
<a id='line_436'>6:1 And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines</a>
<a id='line_437'>seven months.</a>
<a id='line_438'></a>
<a id='line_439'>6:2 And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,</a>
<a id='line_440'>saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we</a>
<a id='line_441'>shall send it to his place.</a>
<a id='line_442'></a>
<a id='line_443'>6:3 And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send</a>
<a id='line_444'>it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye</a>
<a id='line_445'>shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not</a>
<a id='line_446'>removed from you.</a>
<a id='line_447'></a>
<a id='line_448'>6:4 Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall</a>
<a id='line_449'>return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden</a>
<a id='line_450'>mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one</a>
<a id='line_451'>plague was on you all, and on your lords.</a>
<a id='line_452'></a>
<a id='line_453'>6:5 Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your</a>
<a id='line_454'>mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of</a>
<a id='line_455'>Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from</a>
<a id='line_456'>off your gods, and from off your land.</a>
<a id='line_457'></a>
<a id='line_458'>6:6 Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and</a>
<a id='line_459'>Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among</a>
<a id='line_460'>them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?  6:7 Now</a>
<a id='line_461'>therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there</a>
<a id='line_462'>hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their</a>
<a id='line_463'>calves home from them: 6:8 And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it</a>
<a id='line_464'>upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a</a>
<a id='line_465'>trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away,</a>
<a id='line_466'>that it may go.</a>
<a id='line_467'></a>
<a id='line_468'>6:9 And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to</a>
<a id='line_469'>Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we</a>
<a id='line_470'>shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that</a>
<a id='line_471'>happened to us.</a>
<a id='line_472'></a>
<a id='line_473'>6:10 And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the</a>
<a id='line_474'>cart, and shut up their calves at home: 6:11 And they laid the ark of</a>
<a id='line_475'>the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the</a>
<a id='line_476'>images of their emerods.</a>
<a id='line_477'></a>
<a id='line_478'>6:12 And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and</a>
<a id='line_479'>went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to</a>
<a id='line_480'>the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went</a>
<a id='line_481'>after them unto the border of Bethshemesh.</a>
<a id='line_482'></a>
<a id='line_483'>6:13 And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the</a>
<a id='line_484'>valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced</a>
<a id='line_485'>to see it.</a>
<a id='line_486'></a>
<a id='line_487'>6:14 And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and</a>
<a id='line_488'>stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of</a>
<a id='line_489'>the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_490'></a>
<a id='line_491'>6:15 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer</a>
<a id='line_492'>that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the</a>
<a id='line_493'>great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and</a>
<a id='line_494'>sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_495'></a>
<a id='line_496'>6:16 And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they</a>
<a id='line_497'>returned to Ekron the same day.</a>
<a id='line_498'></a>
<a id='line_499'>6:17 And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned</a>
<a id='line_500'>for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one,</a>
<a id='line_501'>for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one; 6:18 And the golden</a>
<a id='line_502'>mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines</a>
<a id='line_503'>belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country</a>
<a id='line_504'>villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the</a>
<a id='line_505'>ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of</a>
<a id='line_506'>Joshua, the Bethshemite.</a>
<a id='line_507'></a>
<a id='line_508'>6:19 And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into</a>
<a id='line_509'>the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and</a>
<a id='line_510'>threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had</a>
<a id='line_511'>smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.</a>
<a id='line_512'></a>
<a id='line_513'>6:20 And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this</a>
<a id='line_514'>holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?  6:21 And they sent</a>
<a id='line_515'>messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The</a>
<a id='line_516'>Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and</a>
<a id='line_517'>fetch it up to you.</a>
<a id='line_518'></a>
<a id='line_519'>7:1 And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the</a>
<a id='line_520'>LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and</a>
<a id='line_521'>sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_522'></a>
<a id='line_523'>7:2 And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that</a>
<a id='line_524'>the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of</a>
<a id='line_525'>Israel lamented after the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_526'></a>
<a id='line_527'>7:3 And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do</a>
<a id='line_528'>return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange</a>
<a id='line_529'>gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the</a>
<a id='line_530'>LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of</a>
<a id='line_531'>the Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_532'></a>
<a id='line_533'>7:4 Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and</a>
<a id='line_534'>served the LORD only.</a>
<a id='line_535'></a>
<a id='line_536'>7:5 And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for</a>
<a id='line_537'>you unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_538'></a>
<a id='line_539'>7:6 And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured</a>
<a id='line_540'>it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We</a>
<a id='line_541'>have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel</a>
<a id='line_542'>in Mizpeh.</a>
<a id='line_543'></a>
<a id='line_544'>7:7 And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were</a>
<a id='line_545'>gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up</a>
<a id='line_546'>against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were</a>
<a id='line_547'>afraid of the Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_548'></a>
<a id='line_549'>7:8 And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto</a>
<a id='line_550'>the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_551'>Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_552'></a>
<a id='line_553'>7:9 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt</a>
<a id='line_554'>offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for</a>
<a id='line_555'>Israel; and the LORD heard him.</a>
<a id='line_556'></a>
<a id='line_557'>7:10 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines</a>
<a id='line_558'>drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a</a>
<a id='line_559'>great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them;</a>
<a id='line_560'>and they were smitten before Israel.</a>
<a id='line_561'></a>
<a id='line_562'>7:11 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the</a>
<a id='line_563'>Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.</a>
<a id='line_564'></a>
<a id='line_565'>7:12 Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and</a>
<a id='line_566'>called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped</a>
<a id='line_567'>us.</a>
<a id='line_568'></a>
<a id='line_569'>7:13 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the</a>
<a id='line_570'>coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines</a>
<a id='line_571'>all the days of Samuel.</a>
<a id='line_572'></a>
<a id='line_573'>7:14 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were</a>
<a id='line_574'>restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof</a>
<a id='line_575'>did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was</a>
<a id='line_576'>peace between Israel and the Amorites.</a>
<a id='line_577'></a>
<a id='line_578'>7:15 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.</a>
<a id='line_579'></a>
<a id='line_580'>7:16 And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal,</a>
<a id='line_581'>and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.</a>
<a id='line_582'></a>
<a id='line_583'>7:17 And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there</a>
<a id='line_584'>he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_585'></a>
<a id='line_586'>8:1 And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons</a>
<a id='line_587'>judges over Israel.</a>
<a id='line_588'></a>
<a id='line_589'>8:2 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his</a>
<a id='line_590'>second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.</a>
<a id='line_591'></a>
<a id='line_592'>8:3 And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre,</a>
<a id='line_593'>and took bribes, and perverted judgment.</a>
<a id='line_594'></a>
<a id='line_595'>8:4 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and</a>
<a id='line_596'>came to Samuel unto Ramah, 8:5 And said unto him, Behold, thou art</a>
<a id='line_597'>old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us</a>
<a id='line_598'>like all the nations.</a>
<a id='line_599'></a>
<a id='line_600'>8:6 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to</a>
<a id='line_601'>judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_602'></a>
<a id='line_603'>8:7 And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the</a>
<a id='line_604'>people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected</a>
<a id='line_605'>thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.</a>
<a id='line_606'></a>
<a id='line_607'>8:8 According to all the works which they have done since the day that</a>
<a id='line_608'>I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have</a>
<a id='line_609'>forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_610'></a>
<a id='line_611'>8:9 Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest</a>
<a id='line_612'>solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall</a>
<a id='line_613'>reign over them.</a>
<a id='line_614'></a>
<a id='line_615'>8:10 And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that</a>
<a id='line_616'>asked of him a king.</a>
<a id='line_617'></a>
<a id='line_618'>8:11 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign</a>
<a id='line_619'>over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for</a>
<a id='line_620'>his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his</a>
<a id='line_621'>chariots.</a>
<a id='line_622'></a>
<a id='line_623'>8:12 And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains</a>
<a id='line_624'>over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his</a>
<a id='line_625'>harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his</a>
<a id='line_626'>chariots.</a>
<a id='line_627'></a>
<a id='line_628'>8:13 And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be</a>
<a id='line_629'>cooks, and to be bakers.</a>
<a id='line_630'></a>
<a id='line_631'>8:14 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your</a>
<a id='line_632'>oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.</a>
<a id='line_633'></a>
<a id='line_634'>8:15 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards,</a>
<a id='line_635'>and give to his officers, and to his servants.</a>
<a id='line_636'></a>
<a id='line_637'>8:16 And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and</a>
<a id='line_638'>your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.</a>
<a id='line_639'></a>
<a id='line_640'>8:17 He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his</a>
<a id='line_641'>servants.</a>
<a id='line_642'></a>
<a id='line_643'>8:18 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye</a>
<a id='line_644'>shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.</a>
<a id='line_645'></a>
<a id='line_646'>8:19 Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and</a>
<a id='line_647'>they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; 8:20 That we also may</a>
<a id='line_648'>be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out</a>
<a id='line_649'>before us, and fight our battles.</a>
<a id='line_650'></a>
<a id='line_651'>8:21 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed</a>
<a id='line_652'>them in the ears of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_653'></a>
<a id='line_654'>8:22 And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make</a>
<a id='line_655'>them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man</a>
<a id='line_656'>unto his city.</a>
<a id='line_657'></a>
<a id='line_658'>9:1 Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of</a>
<a id='line_659'>Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a</a>
<a id='line_660'>Benjamite, a mighty man of power.</a>
<a id='line_661'></a>
<a id='line_662'>9:2 And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a</a>
<a id='line_663'>goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier</a>
<a id='line_664'>person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any</a>
<a id='line_665'>of the people.</a>
<a id='line_666'></a>
<a id='line_667'>9:3 And the asses of Kish Saul’s father were lost. And Kish said to</a>
<a id='line_668'>Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go</a>
<a id='line_669'>seek the asses.</a>
<a id='line_670'></a>
<a id='line_671'>9:4 And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land</a>
<a id='line_672'>of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the</a>
<a id='line_673'>land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the</a>
<a id='line_674'>land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.</a>
<a id='line_675'></a>
<a id='line_676'>9:5 And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his</a>
<a id='line_677'>servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father</a>
<a id='line_678'>leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.</a>
<a id='line_679'></a>
<a id='line_680'>9:6 And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of</a>
<a id='line_681'>God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to</a>
<a id='line_682'>pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that</a>
<a id='line_683'>we should go.</a>
<a id='line_684'></a>
<a id='line_685'>9:7 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall</a>
<a id='line_686'>we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is</a>
<a id='line_687'>not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?  9:8 And the</a>
<a id='line_688'>servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the</a>
<a id='line_689'>fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God,</a>
<a id='line_690'>to tell us our way.</a>
<a id='line_691'></a>
<a id='line_692'>9:9 (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he</a>
<a id='line_693'>spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a</a>
<a id='line_694'>Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)  9:10 Then said Saul to his</a>
<a id='line_695'>servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where</a>
<a id='line_696'>the man of God was.</a>
<a id='line_697'></a>
<a id='line_698'>9:11 And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young</a>
<a id='line_699'>maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?</a>
<a id='line_700'>9:12 And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before</a>
<a id='line_701'>you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a</a>
<a id='line_702'>sacrifice of the people to day in the high place: 9:13 As soon as ye</a>
<a id='line_703'>be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up</a>
<a id='line_704'>to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come,</a>
<a id='line_705'>because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be</a>
<a id='line_706'>bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find</a>
<a id='line_707'>him.</a>
<a id='line_708'></a>
<a id='line_709'>9:14 And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the</a>
<a id='line_710'>city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high</a>
<a id='line_711'>place.</a>
<a id='line_712'></a>
<a id='line_713'>9:15 Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came,</a>
<a id='line_714'>saying, 9:16 To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of</a>
<a id='line_715'>the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my</a>
<a id='line_716'>people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_717'>Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is</a>
<a id='line_718'>come unto me.</a>
<a id='line_719'></a>
<a id='line_720'>9:17 And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man</a>
<a id='line_721'>whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.</a>
<a id='line_722'></a>
<a id='line_723'>9:18 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I</a>
<a id='line_724'>pray thee, where the seer’s house is.</a>
<a id='line_725'></a>
<a id='line_726'>9:19 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before</a>
<a id='line_727'>me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow</a>
<a id='line_728'>I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.</a>
<a id='line_729'></a>
<a id='line_730'>9:20 And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy</a>
<a id='line_731'>mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of</a>
<a id='line_732'>Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father’s house?  9:21 And</a>
<a id='line_733'>Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the</a>
<a id='line_734'>tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the</a>
<a id='line_735'>tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?  9:22 And</a>
<a id='line_736'>Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour,</a>
<a id='line_737'>and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden,</a>
<a id='line_738'>which were about thirty persons.</a>
<a id='line_739'></a>
<a id='line_740'>9:23 And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave</a>
<a id='line_741'>thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.</a>
<a id='line_742'></a>
<a id='line_743'>9:24 And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it,</a>
<a id='line_744'>and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left!</a>
<a id='line_745'>set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for</a>
<a id='line_746'>thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with</a>
<a id='line_747'>Samuel that day.</a>
<a id='line_748'></a>
<a id='line_749'>9:25 And when they were come down from the high place into the city,</a>
<a id='line_750'>Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.</a>
<a id='line_751'></a>
<a id='line_752'>9:26 And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the</a>
<a id='line_753'>day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that</a>
<a id='line_754'>I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them,</a>
<a id='line_755'>he and Samuel, abroad.</a>
<a id='line_756'></a>
<a id='line_757'>9:27 And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said</a>
<a id='line_758'>to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but</a>
<a id='line_759'>stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.</a>
<a id='line_760'></a>
<a id='line_761'>10:1 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and</a>
<a id='line_762'>kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to</a>
<a id='line_763'>be captain over his inheritance?  10:2 When thou art departed from me</a>
<a id='line_764'>to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel’s sepulchre in the</a>
<a id='line_765'>border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses</a>
<a id='line_766'>which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left</a>
<a id='line_767'>the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do</a>
<a id='line_768'>for my son?  10:3 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou</a>
<a id='line_769'>shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men</a>
<a id='line_770'>going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another</a>
<a id='line_771'>carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:</a>
<a id='line_772'>10:4 And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread;</a>
<a id='line_773'>which thou shalt receive of their hands.</a>
<a id='line_774'></a>
<a id='line_775'>10:5 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the</a>
<a id='line_776'>garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art</a>
<a id='line_777'>come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets</a>
<a id='line_778'>coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a</a>
<a id='line_779'>pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy: 10:6 And the</a>
<a id='line_780'>Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with</a>
<a id='line_781'>them, and shalt be turned into another man.</a>
<a id='line_782'></a>
<a id='line_783'>10:7 And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do</a>
<a id='line_784'>as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.</a>
<a id='line_785'></a>
<a id='line_786'>10:8 And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will</a>
<a id='line_787'>come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice</a>
<a id='line_788'>sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I</a>
<a id='line_789'>come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.</a>
<a id='line_790'></a>
<a id='line_791'>10:9 And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from</a>
<a id='line_792'>Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass</a>
<a id='line_793'>that day.</a>
<a id='line_794'></a>
<a id='line_795'>10:10 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of</a>
<a id='line_796'>prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he</a>
<a id='line_797'>prophesied among them.</a>
<a id='line_798'></a>
<a id='line_799'>10:11 And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that,</a>
<a id='line_800'>behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to</a>
<a id='line_801'>another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also</a>
<a id='line_802'>among the prophets?  10:12 And one of the same place answered and</a>
<a id='line_803'>said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul</a>
<a id='line_804'>also among the prophets?  10:13 And when he had made an end of</a>
<a id='line_805'>prophesying, he came to the high place.</a>
<a id='line_806'></a>
<a id='line_807'>10:14 And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went</a>
<a id='line_808'>ye?  And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no</a>
<a id='line_809'>where, we came to Samuel.</a>
<a id='line_810'></a>
<a id='line_811'>10:15 And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said</a>
<a id='line_812'>unto you.</a>
<a id='line_813'></a>
<a id='line_814'>10:16 And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses</a>
<a id='line_815'>were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he</a>
<a id='line_816'>told him not.</a>
<a id='line_817'></a>
<a id='line_818'>10:17 And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;</a>
<a id='line_819'>10:18 And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of</a>
<a id='line_820'>Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the</a>
<a id='line_821'>hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of</a>
<a id='line_822'>them that oppressed you: 10:19 And ye have this day rejected your God,</a>
<a id='line_823'>who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your</a>
<a id='line_824'>tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us.</a>
<a id='line_825'>Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and</a>
<a id='line_826'>by your thousands.</a>
<a id='line_827'></a>
<a id='line_828'>10:20 And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come</a>
<a id='line_829'>near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.</a>
<a id='line_830'></a>
<a id='line_831'>10:21 When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their</a>
<a id='line_832'>families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was</a>
<a id='line_833'>taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.</a>
<a id='line_834'></a>
<a id='line_835'>10:22 Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should</a>
<a id='line_836'>yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he hath hid himself</a>
<a id='line_837'>among the stuff.</a>
<a id='line_838'></a>
<a id='line_839'>10:23 And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the</a>
<a id='line_840'>people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and</a>
<a id='line_841'>upward.</a>
<a id='line_842'></a>
<a id='line_843'>10:24 And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath</a>
<a id='line_844'>chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the</a>
<a id='line_845'>people shouted, and said, God save the king.</a>
<a id='line_846'></a>
<a id='line_847'>10:25 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote</a>
<a id='line_848'>it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the</a>
<a id='line_849'>people away, every man to his house.</a>
<a id='line_850'></a>
<a id='line_851'>10:26 And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a</a>
<a id='line_852'>band of men, whose hearts God had touched.</a>
<a id='line_853'></a>
<a id='line_854'>10:27 But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And</a>
<a id='line_855'>they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace.</a>
<a id='line_856'></a>
<a id='line_857'>11:1 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against</a>
<a id='line_858'>Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a</a>
<a id='line_859'>covenant with us, and we will serve thee.</a>
<a id='line_860'></a>
<a id='line_861'>11:2 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I</a>
<a id='line_862'>make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes,</a>
<a id='line_863'>and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.</a>
<a id='line_864'></a>
<a id='line_865'>11:3 And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days’</a>
<a id='line_866'>respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel:</a>
<a id='line_867'>and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.</a>
<a id='line_868'></a>
<a id='line_869'>11:4 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings</a>
<a id='line_870'>in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices,</a>
<a id='line_871'>and wept.</a>
<a id='line_872'></a>
<a id='line_873'>11:5 And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul</a>
<a id='line_874'>said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the</a>
<a id='line_875'>tidings of the men of Jabesh.</a>
<a id='line_876'></a>
<a id='line_877'>11:6 And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings,</a>
<a id='line_878'>and his anger was kindled greatly.</a>
<a id='line_879'></a>
<a id='line_880'>11:7 And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent</a>
<a id='line_881'>them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers,</a>
<a id='line_882'>saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so</a>
<a id='line_883'>shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the</a>
<a id='line_884'>people, and they came out with one consent.</a>
<a id='line_885'></a>
<a id='line_886'>11:8 And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were</a>
<a id='line_887'>three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</a>
<a id='line_888'></a>
<a id='line_889'>11:9 And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say</a>
<a id='line_890'>unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot,</a>
<a id='line_891'>ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men</a>
<a id='line_892'>of Jabesh; and they were glad.</a>
<a id='line_893'></a>
<a id='line_894'>11:10 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out</a>
<a id='line_895'>unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.</a>
<a id='line_896'></a>
<a id='line_897'>11:11 And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three</a>
<a id='line_898'>companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning</a>
<a id='line_899'>watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came</a>
<a id='line_900'>to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them</a>
<a id='line_901'>were not left together.</a>
<a id='line_902'></a>
<a id='line_903'>11:12 And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul</a>
<a id='line_904'>reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.</a>
<a id='line_905'></a>
<a id='line_906'>11:13 And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day:</a>
<a id='line_907'>for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.</a>
<a id='line_908'></a>
<a id='line_909'>11:14 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,</a>
<a id='line_910'>and renew the kingdom there.</a>
<a id='line_911'></a>
<a id='line_912'>11:15 And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king</a>
<a id='line_913'>before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of</a>
<a id='line_914'>peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of</a>
<a id='line_915'>Israel rejoiced greatly.</a>
<a id='line_916'></a>
<a id='line_917'>12:1 And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto</a>
<a id='line_918'>your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.</a>
<a id='line_919'></a>
<a id='line_920'>12:2 And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and</a>
<a id='line_921'>grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked</a>
<a id='line_922'>before you from my childhood unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_923'></a>
<a id='line_924'>12:3 Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before</a>
<a id='line_925'>his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or</a>
<a id='line_926'>whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I</a>
<a id='line_927'>received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it</a>
<a id='line_928'>you.</a>
<a id='line_929'></a>
<a id='line_930'>12:4 And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,</a>
<a id='line_931'>neither hast thou taken ought of any man’s hand.</a>
<a id='line_932'></a>
<a id='line_933'>12:5 And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his</a>
<a id='line_934'>anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand.</a>
<a id='line_935'>And they answered, He is witness.</a>
<a id='line_936'></a>
<a id='line_937'>12:6 And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced</a>
<a id='line_938'>Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of</a>
<a id='line_939'>Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_940'></a>
<a id='line_941'>12:7 Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the</a>
<a id='line_942'>LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to</a>
<a id='line_943'>your fathers.</a>
<a id='line_944'></a>
<a id='line_945'>12:8 When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the</a>
<a id='line_946'>LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your</a>
<a id='line_947'>fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.</a>
<a id='line_948'></a>
<a id='line_949'>12:9 And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the</a>
<a id='line_950'>hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_951'>Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought</a>
<a id='line_952'>against them.</a>
<a id='line_953'></a>
<a id='line_954'>12:10 And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because</a>
<a id='line_955'>we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but</a>
<a id='line_956'>now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.</a>
<a id='line_957'></a>
<a id='line_958'>12:11 And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and</a>
<a id='line_959'>Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every</a>
<a id='line_960'>side, and ye dwelled safe.</a>
<a id='line_961'></a>
<a id='line_962'>12:12 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon</a>
<a id='line_963'>came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over</a>
<a id='line_964'>us: when the LORD your God was your king.</a>
<a id='line_965'></a>
<a id='line_966'>12:13 Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye</a>
<a id='line_967'>have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.</a>
<a id='line_968'></a>
<a id='line_969'>12:14 If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and</a>
<a id='line_970'>not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and</a>
<a id='line_971'>also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your</a>
<a id='line_972'>God: 12:15 But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel</a>
<a id='line_973'>against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_974'>be against you, as it was against your fathers.</a>
<a id='line_975'></a>
<a id='line_976'>12:16 Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD</a>
<a id='line_977'>will do before your eyes.</a>
<a id='line_978'></a>
<a id='line_979'>12:17 Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_980'>he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your</a>
<a id='line_981'>wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in</a>
<a id='line_982'>asking you a king.</a>
<a id='line_983'></a>
<a id='line_984'>12:18 So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and</a>
<a id='line_985'>rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.</a>
<a id='line_986'></a>
<a id='line_987'>12:19 And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto</a>
<a id='line_988'>the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins</a>
<a id='line_989'>this evil, to ask us a king.</a>
<a id='line_990'></a>
<a id='line_991'>12:20 And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this</a>
<a id='line_992'>wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the</a>
<a id='line_993'>LORD with all your heart; 12:21 And turn ye not aside: for then should</a>
<a id='line_994'>ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are</a>
<a id='line_995'>vain.</a>
<a id='line_996'></a>
<a id='line_997'>12:22 For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name’s</a>
<a id='line_998'>sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.</a>
<a id='line_999'></a>
<a id='line_1000'>12:23 Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the</a>
<a id='line_1001'>LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the</a>
<a id='line_1002'>right way: 12:24 Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all</a>
<a id='line_1003'>your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.</a>
<a id='line_1004'></a>
<a id='line_1005'>12:25 But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye</a>
<a id='line_1006'>and your king.</a>
<a id='line_1007'></a>
<a id='line_1008'>13:1 Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over</a>
<a id='line_1009'>Israel, 13:2 Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two</a>
<a id='line_1010'>thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a</a>
<a id='line_1011'>thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the</a>
<a id='line_1012'>people he sent every man to his tent.</a>
<a id='line_1013'></a>
<a id='line_1014'>13:3 And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in</a>
<a id='line_1015'>Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet</a>
<a id='line_1016'>throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</a>
<a id='line_1017'></a>
<a id='line_1018'>13:4 And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the</a>
<a id='line_1019'>Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the</a>
<a id='line_1020'>Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.</a>
<a id='line_1021'></a>
<a id='line_1022'>13:5 And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with</a>
<a id='line_1023'>Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and</a>
<a id='line_1024'>people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they</a>
<a id='line_1025'>came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.</a>
<a id='line_1026'></a>
<a id='line_1027'>13:6 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the</a>
<a id='line_1028'>people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves,</a>
<a id='line_1029'>and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.</a>
<a id='line_1030'></a>
<a id='line_1031'>13:7 And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and</a>
<a id='line_1032'>Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed</a>
<a id='line_1033'>him trembling.</a>
<a id='line_1034'></a>
<a id='line_1035'>13:8 And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel</a>
<a id='line_1036'>had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were</a>
<a id='line_1037'>scattered from him.</a>
<a id='line_1038'></a>
<a id='line_1039'>13:9 And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace</a>
<a id='line_1040'>offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.</a>
<a id='line_1041'></a>
<a id='line_1042'>13:10 And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of</a>
<a id='line_1043'>offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to</a>
<a id='line_1044'>meet him, that he might salute him.</a>
<a id='line_1045'></a>
<a id='line_1046'>13:11 And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I</a>
<a id='line_1047'>saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not</a>
<a id='line_1048'>within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered</a>
<a id='line_1049'>themselves together at Michmash; 13:12 Therefore said I, The</a>
<a id='line_1050'>Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made</a>
<a id='line_1051'>supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a</a>
<a id='line_1052'>burnt offering.</a>
<a id='line_1053'></a>
<a id='line_1054'>13:13 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not</a>
<a id='line_1055'>kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for</a>
<a id='line_1056'>now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.</a>
<a id='line_1057'></a>
<a id='line_1058'>13:14 But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him</a>
<a id='line_1059'>a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be</a>
<a id='line_1060'>captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the</a>
<a id='line_1061'>LORD commanded thee.</a>
<a id='line_1062'></a>
<a id='line_1063'>13:15 And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of</a>
<a id='line_1064'>Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him,</a>
<a id='line_1065'>about six hundred men.</a>
<a id='line_1066'></a>
<a id='line_1067'>13:16 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present</a>
<a id='line_1068'>with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped</a>
<a id='line_1069'>in Michmash.</a>
<a id='line_1070'></a>
<a id='line_1071'>13:17 And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in</a>
<a id='line_1072'>three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to</a>
<a id='line_1073'>Ophrah, unto the land of Shual: 13:18 And another company turned the</a>
<a id='line_1074'>way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border</a>
<a id='line_1075'>that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_1076'></a>
<a id='line_1077'>13:19 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel:</a>
<a id='line_1078'>for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:</a>
<a id='line_1079'>13:20 But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen</a>
<a id='line_1080'>every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.</a>
<a id='line_1081'></a>
<a id='line_1082'>13:21 Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and</a>
<a id='line_1083'>for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.</a>
<a id='line_1084'></a>
<a id='line_1085'>13:22 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither</a>
<a id='line_1086'>sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with</a>
<a id='line_1087'>Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there</a>
<a id='line_1088'>found.</a>
<a id='line_1089'></a>
<a id='line_1090'>13:23 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of</a>
<a id='line_1091'>Michmash.</a>
<a id='line_1092'></a>
<a id='line_1093'>14:1 Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul</a>
<a id='line_1094'>said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over</a>
<a id='line_1095'>to the Philistines’ garrison, that is on the other side. But he told</a>
<a id='line_1096'>not his father.</a>
<a id='line_1097'></a>
<a id='line_1098'>14:2 And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a</a>
<a id='line_1099'>pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him</a>
<a id='line_1100'>were about six hundred men; 14:3 And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub,</a>
<a id='line_1101'>Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD’s</a>
<a id='line_1102'>priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that</a>
<a id='line_1103'>Jonathan was gone.</a>
<a id='line_1104'></a>
<a id='line_1105'>14:4 And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over</a>
<a id='line_1106'>unto the Philistines’ garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one</a>
<a id='line_1107'>side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was</a>
<a id='line_1108'>Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</a>
<a id='line_1109'></a>
<a id='line_1110'>14:5 The forefront of the one was situate northward over against</a>
<a id='line_1111'>Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.</a>
<a id='line_1112'></a>
<a id='line_1113'>14:6 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come,</a>
<a id='line_1114'>and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be</a>
<a id='line_1115'>that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1116'>to save by many or by few.</a>
<a id='line_1117'></a>
<a id='line_1118'>14:7 And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine</a>
<a id='line_1119'>heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.</a>
<a id='line_1120'></a>
<a id='line_1121'>14:8 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and</a>
<a id='line_1122'>we will discover ourselves unto them.</a>
<a id='line_1123'></a>
<a id='line_1124'>14:9 If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we</a>
<a id='line_1125'>will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.</a>
<a id='line_1126'></a>
<a id='line_1127'>14:10 But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for</a>
<a id='line_1128'>the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign</a>
<a id='line_1129'>unto us.</a>
<a id='line_1130'></a>
<a id='line_1131'>14:11 And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the</a>
<a id='line_1132'>Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth</a>
<a id='line_1133'>out of the holes where they had hid themselves.</a>
<a id='line_1134'></a>
<a id='line_1135'>14:12 And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his</a>
<a id='line_1136'>armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing.</a>
<a id='line_1137'>And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the</a>
<a id='line_1138'>LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1139'></a>
<a id='line_1140'>14:13 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and</a>
<a id='line_1141'>his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his</a>
<a id='line_1142'>armourbearer slew after him.</a>
<a id='line_1143'></a>
<a id='line_1144'>14:14 And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer</a>
<a id='line_1145'>made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land,</a>
<a id='line_1146'>which a yoke of oxen might plow.</a>
<a id='line_1147'></a>
<a id='line_1148'>14:15 And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all</a>
<a id='line_1149'>the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and</a>
<a id='line_1150'>the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.</a>
<a id='line_1151'></a>
<a id='line_1152'>14:16 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,</a>
<a id='line_1153'>behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one</a>
<a id='line_1154'>another.</a>
<a id='line_1155'></a>
<a id='line_1156'>14:17 Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now,</a>
<a id='line_1157'>and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold,</a>
<a id='line_1158'>Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.</a>
<a id='line_1159'></a>
<a id='line_1160'>14:18 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the</a>
<a id='line_1161'>ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1162'></a>
<a id='line_1163'>14:19 And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the</a>
<a id='line_1164'>noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased:</a>
<a id='line_1165'>and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_1166'></a>
<a id='line_1167'>14:20 And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled</a>
<a id='line_1168'>themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man’s</a>
<a id='line_1169'>sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.</a>
<a id='line_1170'></a>
<a id='line_1171'>14:21 Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that</a>
<a id='line_1172'>time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round</a>
<a id='line_1173'>about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with</a>
<a id='line_1174'>Saul and Jonathan.</a>
<a id='line_1175'></a>
<a id='line_1176'>14:22 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount</a>
<a id='line_1177'>Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also</a>
<a id='line_1178'>followed hard after them in the battle.</a>
<a id='line_1179'></a>
<a id='line_1180'>14:23 So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over</a>
<a id='line_1181'>unto Bethaven.</a>
<a id='line_1182'></a>
<a id='line_1183'>14:24 And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had</a>
<a id='line_1184'>adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food</a>
<a id='line_1185'>until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the</a>
<a id='line_1186'>people tasted any food.</a>
<a id='line_1187'></a>
<a id='line_1188'>14:25 And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey</a>
<a id='line_1189'>upon the ground.</a>
<a id='line_1190'></a>
<a id='line_1191'>14:26 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey</a>
<a id='line_1192'>dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared</a>
<a id='line_1193'>the oath.</a>
<a id='line_1194'></a>
<a id='line_1195'>14:27 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with</a>
<a id='line_1196'>the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his</a>
<a id='line_1197'>hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth;</a>
<a id='line_1198'>and his eyes were enlightened.</a>
<a id='line_1199'></a>
<a id='line_1200'>14:28 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly</a>
<a id='line_1201'>charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth</a>
<a id='line_1202'>any food this day. And the people were faint.</a>
<a id='line_1203'></a>
<a id='line_1204'>14:29 Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I</a>
<a id='line_1205'>pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a</a>
<a id='line_1206'>little of this honey.</a>
<a id='line_1207'></a>
<a id='line_1208'>14:30 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of</a>
<a id='line_1209'>the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been</a>
<a id='line_1210'>now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?  14:31 And they</a>
<a id='line_1211'>smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the</a>
<a id='line_1212'>people were very faint.</a>
<a id='line_1213'></a>
<a id='line_1214'>14:32 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,</a>
<a id='line_1215'>and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them</a>
<a id='line_1216'>with the blood.</a>
<a id='line_1217'></a>
<a id='line_1218'>14:33 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the</a>
<a id='line_1219'>LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have</a>
<a id='line_1220'>transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.</a>
<a id='line_1221'></a>
<a id='line_1222'>14:34 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say</a>
<a id='line_1223'>unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep,</a>
<a id='line_1224'>and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating</a>
<a id='line_1225'>with the blood.</a>
<a id='line_1226'></a>
<a id='line_1227'>And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and</a>
<a id='line_1228'>slew them there.</a>
<a id='line_1229'></a>
<a id='line_1230'>14:35 And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first</a>
<a id='line_1231'>altar that he built unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1232'></a>
<a id='line_1233'>14:36 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,</a>
<a id='line_1234'>and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of</a>
<a id='line_1235'>them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said</a>
<a id='line_1236'>the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.</a>
<a id='line_1237'></a>
<a id='line_1238'>14:37 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the</a>
<a id='line_1239'>Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he</a>
<a id='line_1240'>answered him not that day.</a>
<a id='line_1241'></a>
<a id='line_1242'>14:38 And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people:</a>
<a id='line_1243'>and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.</a>
<a id='line_1244'></a>
<a id='line_1245'>14:39 For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in</a>
<a id='line_1246'>Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among</a>
<a id='line_1247'>all the people that answered him.</a>
<a id='line_1248'></a>
<a id='line_1249'>14:40 Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and</a>
<a id='line_1250'>Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto</a>
<a id='line_1251'>Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_1252'></a>
<a id='line_1253'>14:41 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect</a>
<a id='line_1254'>lot.</a>
<a id='line_1255'></a>
<a id='line_1256'>And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.</a>
<a id='line_1257'></a>
<a id='line_1258'>14:42 And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And</a>
<a id='line_1259'>Jonathan was taken.</a>
<a id='line_1260'></a>
<a id='line_1261'>14:43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And</a>
<a id='line_1262'>Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the</a>
<a id='line_1263'>end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.</a>
<a id='line_1264'></a>
<a id='line_1265'>14:44 And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_1266'>surely die, Jonathan.</a>
<a id='line_1267'></a>
<a id='line_1268'>14:45 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath</a>
<a id='line_1269'>wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1270'>liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for</a>
<a id='line_1271'>he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan,</a>
<a id='line_1272'>that he died not.</a>
<a id='line_1273'></a>
<a id='line_1274'>14:46 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the</a>
<a id='line_1275'>Philistines went to their own place.</a>
<a id='line_1276'></a>
<a id='line_1277'>14:47 So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his</a>
<a id='line_1278'>enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of</a>
<a id='line_1279'>Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against</a>
<a id='line_1280'>the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.</a>
<a id='line_1281'></a>
<a id='line_1282'>14:48 And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered</a>
<a id='line_1283'>Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.</a>
<a id='line_1284'></a>
<a id='line_1285'>14:49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua:</a>
<a id='line_1286'>and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the</a>
<a id='line_1287'>firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal: 14:50 And the</a>
<a id='line_1288'>name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name</a>
<a id='line_1289'>of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.</a>
<a id='line_1290'></a>
<a id='line_1291'>14:51 And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was</a>
<a id='line_1292'>the son of Abiel.</a>
<a id='line_1293'></a>
<a id='line_1294'>14:52 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of</a>
<a id='line_1295'>Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took</a>
<a id='line_1296'>him unto him.</a>
<a id='line_1297'></a>
<a id='line_1298'>15:1 Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be</a>
<a id='line_1299'>king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the</a>
<a id='line_1300'>voice of the words of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1301'></a>
<a id='line_1302'>15:2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to</a>
<a id='line_1303'>Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from</a>
<a id='line_1304'>Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1305'></a>
<a id='line_1306'>15:3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have,</a>
<a id='line_1307'>and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling,</a>
<a id='line_1308'>ox and sheep, camel and ass.</a>
<a id='line_1309'></a>
<a id='line_1310'>15:4 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in</a>
<a id='line_1311'>Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_1312'></a>
<a id='line_1313'>15:5 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.</a>
<a id='line_1314'></a>
<a id='line_1315'>15:6 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from</a>
<a id='line_1316'>among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed</a>
<a id='line_1317'>kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of</a>
<a id='line_1318'>Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</a>
<a id='line_1319'></a>
<a id='line_1320'>15:7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to</a>
<a id='line_1321'>Shur, that is over against Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1322'></a>
<a id='line_1323'>15:8 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly</a>
<a id='line_1324'>destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</a>
<a id='line_1325'></a>
<a id='line_1326'>15:9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep,</a>
<a id='line_1327'>and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was</a>
<a id='line_1328'>good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was</a>
<a id='line_1329'>vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.</a>
<a id='line_1330'></a>
<a id='line_1331'>15:10 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying, 15:11 It</a>
<a id='line_1332'>repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back</a>
<a id='line_1333'>from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it</a>
<a id='line_1334'>grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.</a>
<a id='line_1335'></a>
<a id='line_1336'>15:12 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was</a>
<a id='line_1337'>told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a</a>
<a id='line_1338'>place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.</a>
<a id='line_1339'></a>
<a id='line_1340'>15:13 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou</a>
<a id='line_1341'>of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1342'></a>
<a id='line_1343'>15:14 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in</a>
<a id='line_1344'>mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?  15:15 And Saul</a>
<a id='line_1345'>said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people</a>
<a id='line_1346'>spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the</a>
<a id='line_1347'>LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.</a>
<a id='line_1348'></a>
<a id='line_1349'>15:16 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the</a>
<a id='line_1350'>LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.</a>
<a id='line_1351'></a>
<a id='line_1352'>15:17 And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast</a>
<a id='line_1353'>thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed</a>
<a id='line_1354'>thee king over Israel?  15:18 And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and</a>
<a id='line_1355'>said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight</a>
<a id='line_1356'>against them until they be consumed.</a>
<a id='line_1357'></a>
<a id='line_1358'>15:19 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but</a>
<a id='line_1359'>didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?</a>
<a id='line_1360'>15:20 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the</a>
<a id='line_1361'>LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought</a>
<a id='line_1362'>Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</a>
<a id='line_1363'></a>
<a id='line_1364'>15:21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of</a>
<a id='line_1365'>the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto</a>
<a id='line_1366'>the LORD thy God in Gilgal.</a>
<a id='line_1367'></a>
<a id='line_1368'>15:22 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt</a>
<a id='line_1369'>offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold,</a>
<a id='line_1370'>to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</a>
<a id='line_1371'></a>
<a id='line_1372'>15:23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is</a>
<a id='line_1373'>as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the</a>
<a id='line_1374'>LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.</a>
<a id='line_1375'></a>
<a id='line_1376'>15:24 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have</a>
<a id='line_1377'>transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I</a>
<a id='line_1378'>feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</a>
<a id='line_1379'></a>
<a id='line_1380'>15:25 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with</a>
<a id='line_1381'>me, that I may worship the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1382'></a>
<a id='line_1383'>15:26 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou</a>
<a id='line_1384'>hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee</a>
<a id='line_1385'>from being king over Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1386'></a>
<a id='line_1387'>15:27 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the</a>
<a id='line_1388'>skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</a>
<a id='line_1389'></a>
<a id='line_1390'>15:28 And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_1391'>Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine,</a>
<a id='line_1392'>that is better than thou.</a>
<a id='line_1393'></a>
<a id='line_1394'>15:29 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he</a>
<a id='line_1395'>is not a man, that he should repent.</a>
<a id='line_1396'></a>
<a id='line_1397'>15:30 Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee,</a>
<a id='line_1398'>before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with</a>
<a id='line_1399'>me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.</a>
<a id='line_1400'></a>
<a id='line_1401'>15:31 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1402'></a>
<a id='line_1403'>15:32 Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the</a>
<a id='line_1404'>Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely</a>
<a id='line_1405'>the bitterness of death is past.</a>
<a id='line_1406'></a>
<a id='line_1407'>15:33 And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so</a>
<a id='line_1408'>shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in</a>
<a id='line_1409'>pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.</a>
<a id='line_1410'></a>
<a id='line_1411'>15:34 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to</a>
<a id='line_1412'>Gibeah of Saul.</a>
<a id='line_1413'></a>
<a id='line_1414'>15:35 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death:</a>
<a id='line_1415'>nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he</a>
<a id='line_1416'>had made Saul king over Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1417'></a>
<a id='line_1418'>16:1 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,</a>
<a id='line_1419'>seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn</a>
<a id='line_1420'>with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I</a>
<a id='line_1421'>have provided me a king among his sons.</a>
<a id='line_1422'></a>
<a id='line_1423'>16:2 And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.</a>
<a id='line_1424'>And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to</a>
<a id='line_1425'>sacrifice to the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1426'></a>
<a id='line_1427'>16:3 And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou</a>
<a id='line_1428'>shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_1429'></a>
<a id='line_1430'>16:4 And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem.</a>
<a id='line_1431'>And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest</a>
<a id='line_1432'>thou peaceably?  16:5 And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice</a>
<a id='line_1433'>unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.</a>
<a id='line_1434'>And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the</a>
<a id='line_1435'>sacrifice.</a>
<a id='line_1436'></a>
<a id='line_1437'>16:6 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on</a>
<a id='line_1438'>Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD’s anointed is before him.</a>
<a id='line_1439'></a>
<a id='line_1440'>16:7 But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on</a>
<a id='line_1441'>the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1442'>seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but</a>
<a id='line_1443'>the LORD looketh on the heart.</a>
<a id='line_1444'></a>
<a id='line_1445'>16:8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And</a>
<a id='line_1446'>he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</a>
<a id='line_1447'></a>
<a id='line_1448'>16:9 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the</a>
<a id='line_1449'>LORD chosen this.</a>
<a id='line_1450'></a>
<a id='line_1451'>16:10 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And</a>
<a id='line_1452'>Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.</a>
<a id='line_1453'></a>
<a id='line_1454'>16:11 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he</a>
<a id='line_1455'>said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the</a>
<a id='line_1456'>sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not</a>
<a id='line_1457'>sit down till he come hither.</a>
<a id='line_1458'></a>
<a id='line_1459'>16:12 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of</a>
<a id='line_1460'>a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said,</a>
<a id='line_1461'>Arise, anoint him: for this is he.</a>
<a id='line_1462'></a>
<a id='line_1463'>16:13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst</a>
<a id='line_1464'>of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that</a>
<a id='line_1465'>day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</a>
<a id='line_1466'></a>
<a id='line_1467'>16:14 But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil</a>
<a id='line_1468'>spirit from the LORD troubled him.</a>
<a id='line_1469'></a>
<a id='line_1470'>16:15 And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit</a>
<a id='line_1471'>from God troubleth thee.</a>
<a id='line_1472'></a>
<a id='line_1473'>16:16 Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to</a>
<a id='line_1474'>seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come</a>
<a id='line_1475'>to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall</a>
<a id='line_1476'>play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.</a>
<a id='line_1477'></a>
<a id='line_1478'>16:17 And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can</a>
<a id='line_1479'>play well, and bring him to me.</a>
<a id='line_1480'></a>
<a id='line_1481'>16:18 Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen</a>
<a id='line_1482'>a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a</a>
<a id='line_1483'>mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a</a>
<a id='line_1484'>comely person, and the LORD is with him.</a>
<a id='line_1485'></a>
<a id='line_1486'>16:19 Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me</a>
<a id='line_1487'>David thy son, which is with the sheep.</a>
<a id='line_1488'></a>
<a id='line_1489'>16:20 And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine,</a>
<a id='line_1490'>and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.</a>
<a id='line_1491'></a>
<a id='line_1492'>16:21 And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him</a>
<a id='line_1493'>greatly; and he became his armourbearer.</a>
<a id='line_1494'></a>
<a id='line_1495'>16:22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand</a>
<a id='line_1496'>before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.</a>
<a id='line_1497'></a>
<a id='line_1498'>16:23 And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon</a>
<a id='line_1499'>Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was</a>
<a id='line_1500'>refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</a>
<a id='line_1501'></a>
<a id='line_1502'>17:1 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and</a>
<a id='line_1503'>were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and</a>
<a id='line_1504'>pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.</a>
<a id='line_1505'></a>
<a id='line_1506'>17:2 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and</a>
<a id='line_1507'>pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the</a>
<a id='line_1508'>Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_1509'></a>
<a id='line_1510'>17:3 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and</a>
<a id='line_1511'>Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley</a>
<a id='line_1512'>between them.</a>
<a id='line_1513'></a>
<a id='line_1514'>17:4 And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,</a>
<a id='line_1515'>named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.</a>
<a id='line_1516'></a>
<a id='line_1517'>17:5 And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed</a>
<a id='line_1518'>with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand</a>
<a id='line_1519'>shekels of brass.</a>
<a id='line_1520'></a>
<a id='line_1521'>17:6 And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass</a>
<a id='line_1522'>between his shoulders.</a>
<a id='line_1523'></a>
<a id='line_1524'>17:7 And the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his</a>
<a id='line_1525'>spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a</a>
<a id='line_1526'>shield went before him.</a>
<a id='line_1527'></a>
<a id='line_1528'>17:8 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_1529'>them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a</a>
<a id='line_1530'>Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let</a>
<a id='line_1531'>him come down to me.</a>
<a id='line_1532'></a>
<a id='line_1533'>17:9 If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be</a>
<a id='line_1534'>your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall</a>
<a id='line_1535'>ye be our servants, and serve us.</a>
<a id='line_1536'></a>
<a id='line_1537'>17:10 And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;</a>
<a id='line_1538'>give me a man, that we may fight together.</a>
<a id='line_1539'></a>
<a id='line_1540'>17:11 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,</a>
<a id='line_1541'>they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</a>
<a id='line_1542'></a>
<a id='line_1543'>17:12 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah,</a>
<a id='line_1544'>whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among</a>
<a id='line_1545'>men for an old man in the days of Saul.</a>
<a id='line_1546'></a>
<a id='line_1547'>17:13 And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the</a>
<a id='line_1548'>battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were</a>
<a id='line_1549'>Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third</a>
<a id='line_1550'>Shammah.</a>
<a id='line_1551'></a>
<a id='line_1552'>17:14 And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.</a>
<a id='line_1553'></a>
<a id='line_1554'>17:15 But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep</a>
<a id='line_1555'>at Bethlehem.</a>
<a id='line_1556'></a>
<a id='line_1557'>17:16 And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented</a>
<a id='line_1558'>himself forty days.</a>
<a id='line_1559'></a>
<a id='line_1560'>17:17 And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an</a>
<a id='line_1561'>ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp</a>
<a id='line_1562'>of thy brethren; 17:18 And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of</a>
<a id='line_1563'>their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.</a>
<a id='line_1564'></a>
<a id='line_1565'>17:19 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the</a>
<a id='line_1566'>valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_1567'></a>
<a id='line_1568'>17:20 And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with</a>
<a id='line_1569'>a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came</a>
<a id='line_1570'>to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted</a>
<a id='line_1571'>for the battle.</a>
<a id='line_1572'></a>
<a id='line_1573'>17:21 For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army</a>
<a id='line_1574'>against army.</a>
<a id='line_1575'></a>
<a id='line_1576'>17:22 And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the</a>
<a id='line_1577'>carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.</a>
<a id='line_1578'></a>
<a id='line_1579'>17:23 And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion,</a>
<a id='line_1580'>the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the</a>
<a id='line_1581'>Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard</a>
<a id='line_1582'>them.</a>
<a id='line_1583'></a>
<a id='line_1584'>17:24 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him,</a>
<a id='line_1585'>and were sore afraid.</a>
<a id='line_1586'></a>
<a id='line_1587'>17:25 And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come</a>
<a id='line_1588'>up?  surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the</a>
<a id='line_1589'>man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and</a>
<a id='line_1590'>will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in</a>
<a id='line_1591'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1592'></a>
<a id='line_1593'>17:26 And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall</a>
<a id='line_1594'>be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the</a>
<a id='line_1595'>reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that</a>
<a id='line_1596'>he should defy the armies of the living God?  17:27 And the people</a>
<a id='line_1597'>answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man</a>
<a id='line_1598'>that killeth him.</a>
<a id='line_1599'></a>
<a id='line_1600'>17:28 And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men;</a>
<a id='line_1601'>and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest</a>
<a id='line_1602'>thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the</a>
<a id='line_1603'>wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for</a>
<a id='line_1604'>thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.</a>
<a id='line_1605'></a>
<a id='line_1606'>17:29 And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?</a>
<a id='line_1607'>17:30 And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same</a>
<a id='line_1608'>manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.</a>
<a id='line_1609'></a>
<a id='line_1610'>17:31 And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed</a>
<a id='line_1611'>them before Saul: and he sent for him.</a>
<a id='line_1612'></a>
<a id='line_1613'>17:32 And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him;</a>
<a id='line_1614'>thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.</a>
<a id='line_1615'></a>
<a id='line_1616'>17:33 And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this</a>
<a id='line_1617'>Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man</a>
<a id='line_1618'>of war from his youth.</a>
<a id='line_1619'></a>
<a id='line_1620'>17:34 And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father’s sheep,</a>
<a id='line_1621'>and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:</a>
<a id='line_1622'>17:35 And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of</a>
<a id='line_1623'>his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard,</a>
<a id='line_1624'>and smote him, and slew him.</a>
<a id='line_1625'></a>
<a id='line_1626'>17:36 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this</a>
<a id='line_1627'>uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath</a>
<a id='line_1628'>defied the armies of the living God.</a>
<a id='line_1629'></a>
<a id='line_1630'>17:37 David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw</a>
<a id='line_1631'>of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of</a>
<a id='line_1632'>the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the</a>
<a id='line_1633'>LORD be with thee.</a>
<a id='line_1634'></a>
<a id='line_1635'>17:38 And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of</a>
<a id='line_1636'>brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.</a>
<a id='line_1637'></a>
<a id='line_1638'>17:39 And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to</a>
<a id='line_1639'>go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go</a>
<a id='line_1640'>with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.</a>
<a id='line_1641'></a>
<a id='line_1642'>17:40 And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth</a>
<a id='line_1643'>stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag which he</a>
<a id='line_1644'>had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near</a>
<a id='line_1645'>to the Philistine.</a>
<a id='line_1646'></a>
<a id='line_1647'>17:41 And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man</a>
<a id='line_1648'>that bare the shield went before him.</a>
<a id='line_1649'></a>
<a id='line_1650'>17:42 And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he</a>
<a id='line_1651'>disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair</a>
<a id='line_1652'>countenance.</a>
<a id='line_1653'></a>
<a id='line_1654'>17:43 And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest</a>
<a id='line_1655'>to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</a>
<a id='line_1656'></a>
<a id='line_1657'>17:44 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give</a>
<a id='line_1658'>thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.</a>
<a id='line_1659'></a>
<a id='line_1660'>17:45 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a</a>
<a id='line_1661'>sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the</a>
<a id='line_1662'>name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou</a>
<a id='line_1663'>hast defied.</a>
<a id='line_1664'></a>
<a id='line_1665'>17:46 This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will</a>
<a id='line_1666'>smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the</a>
<a id='line_1667'>carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the</a>
<a id='line_1668'>air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know</a>
<a id='line_1669'>that there is a God in Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1670'></a>
<a id='line_1671'>17:47 And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with</a>
<a id='line_1672'>sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD’s, and he will give you</a>
<a id='line_1673'>into our hands.</a>
<a id='line_1674'></a>
<a id='line_1675'>17:48 And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and</a>
<a id='line_1676'>drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army</a>
<a id='line_1677'>to meet the Philistine.</a>
<a id='line_1678'></a>
<a id='line_1679'>17:49 And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and</a>
<a id='line_1680'>slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone</a>
<a id='line_1681'>sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_1682'></a>
<a id='line_1683'>17:50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a</a>
<a id='line_1684'>stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword</a>
<a id='line_1685'>in the hand of David.</a>
<a id='line_1686'></a>
<a id='line_1687'>17:51 Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his</a>
<a id='line_1688'>sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut</a>
<a id='line_1689'>off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion</a>
<a id='line_1690'>was dead, they fled.</a>
<a id='line_1691'></a>
<a id='line_1692'>17:52 And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and</a>
<a id='line_1693'>pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the</a>
<a id='line_1694'>gates of Ekron.</a>
<a id='line_1695'></a>
<a id='line_1696'>And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim,</a>
<a id='line_1697'>even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.</a>
<a id='line_1698'></a>
<a id='line_1699'>17:53 And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the</a>
<a id='line_1700'>Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.</a>
<a id='line_1701'></a>
<a id='line_1702'>17:54 And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to</a>
<a id='line_1703'>Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.</a>
<a id='line_1704'></a>
<a id='line_1705'>17:55 And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said</a>
<a id='line_1706'>unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth?</a>
<a id='line_1707'>And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.</a>
<a id='line_1708'></a>
<a id='line_1709'>17:56 And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.</a>
<a id='line_1710'></a>
<a id='line_1711'>17:57 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,</a>
<a id='line_1712'>Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the</a>
<a id='line_1713'>Philistine in his hand.</a>
<a id='line_1714'></a>
<a id='line_1715'>17:58 And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And</a>
<a id='line_1716'>David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.</a>
<a id='line_1717'></a>
<a id='line_1718'>18:1 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto</a>
<a id='line_1719'>Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and</a>
<a id='line_1720'>Jonathan loved him as his own soul.</a>
<a id='line_1721'></a>
<a id='line_1722'>18:2 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to</a>
<a id='line_1723'>his father’s house.</a>
<a id='line_1724'></a>
<a id='line_1725'>18:3 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as</a>
<a id='line_1726'>his own soul.</a>
<a id='line_1727'></a>
<a id='line_1728'>18:4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and</a>
<a id='line_1729'>gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow,</a>
<a id='line_1730'>and to his girdle.</a>
<a id='line_1731'></a>
<a id='line_1732'>18:5 And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved</a>
<a id='line_1733'>himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was</a>
<a id='line_1734'>accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of</a>
<a id='line_1735'>Saul’s servants.</a>
<a id='line_1736'></a>
<a id='line_1737'>18:6 And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from</a>
<a id='line_1738'>the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities</a>
<a id='line_1739'>of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with</a>
<a id='line_1740'>joy, and with instruments of musick.</a>
<a id='line_1741'></a>
<a id='line_1742'>18:7 And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul</a>
<a id='line_1743'>hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.</a>
<a id='line_1744'></a>
<a id='line_1745'>18:8 And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he</a>
<a id='line_1746'>said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have</a>
<a id='line_1747'>ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?</a>
<a id='line_1748'>18:9 And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.</a>
<a id='line_1749'></a>
<a id='line_1750'>18:10 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God</a>
<a id='line_1751'>came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David</a>
<a id='line_1752'>played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in</a>
<a id='line_1753'>Saul’s hand.</a>
<a id='line_1754'></a>
<a id='line_1755'>18:11 And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even</a>
<a id='line_1756'>to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.</a>
<a id='line_1757'></a>
<a id='line_1758'>18:12 And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and</a>
<a id='line_1759'>was departed from Saul.</a>
<a id='line_1760'></a>
<a id='line_1761'>18:13 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain</a>
<a id='line_1762'>over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.</a>
<a id='line_1763'></a>
<a id='line_1764'>18:14 And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1765'>was with him.</a>
<a id='line_1766'></a>
<a id='line_1767'>18:15 Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he</a>
<a id='line_1768'>was afraid of him.</a>
<a id='line_1769'></a>
<a id='line_1770'>18:16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and</a>
<a id='line_1771'>came in before them.</a>
<a id='line_1772'></a>
<a id='line_1773'>18:17 And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will</a>
<a id='line_1774'>I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD’s</a>
<a id='line_1775'>battles.</a>
<a id='line_1776'></a>
<a id='line_1777'>For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_1778'>Philistines be upon him.</a>
<a id='line_1779'></a>
<a id='line_1780'>18:18 And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my</a>
<a id='line_1781'>father’s family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?</a>
<a id='line_1782'>18:19 But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul’s daughter</a>
<a id='line_1783'>should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the</a>
<a id='line_1784'>Meholathite to wife.</a>
<a id='line_1785'></a>
<a id='line_1786'>18:20 And Michal Saul’s daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and</a>
<a id='line_1787'>the thing pleased him.</a>
<a id='line_1788'></a>
<a id='line_1789'>18:21 And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to</a>
<a id='line_1790'>him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.</a>
<a id='line_1791'>Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in</a>
<a id='line_1792'>the one of the twain.</a>
<a id='line_1793'></a>
<a id='line_1794'>18:22 And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David</a>
<a id='line_1795'>secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his</a>
<a id='line_1796'>servants love thee: now therefore be the king’s son in law.</a>
<a id='line_1797'></a>
<a id='line_1798'>18:23 And Saul’s servants spake those words in the ears of David. And</a>
<a id='line_1799'>David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king’s son in law,</a>
<a id='line_1800'>seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?  18:24 And the</a>
<a id='line_1801'>servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.</a>
<a id='line_1802'></a>
<a id='line_1803'>18:25 And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not</a>
<a id='line_1804'>any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged</a>
<a id='line_1805'>of the king’s enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand</a>
<a id='line_1806'>of the Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_1807'></a>
<a id='line_1808'>18:26 And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David</a>
<a id='line_1809'>well to be the king’s son in law: and the days were not expired.</a>
<a id='line_1810'></a>
<a id='line_1811'>18:27 Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the</a>
<a id='line_1812'>Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and</a>
<a id='line_1813'>they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king’s</a>
<a id='line_1814'>son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.</a>
<a id='line_1815'></a>
<a id='line_1816'>18:28 And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that</a>
<a id='line_1817'>Michal Saul’s daughter loved him.</a>
<a id='line_1818'></a>
<a id='line_1819'>18:29 And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became</a>
<a id='line_1820'>David’s enemy continually.</a>
<a id='line_1821'></a>
<a id='line_1822'>18:30 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to</a>
<a id='line_1823'>pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely</a>
<a id='line_1824'>than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.</a>
<a id='line_1825'></a>
<a id='line_1826'>19:1 And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that</a>
<a id='line_1827'>they should kill David.</a>
<a id='line_1828'></a>
<a id='line_1829'>19:2 But Jonathan Saul’s son delighted much in David: and Jonathan</a>
<a id='line_1830'>told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now</a>
<a id='line_1831'>therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and</a>
<a id='line_1832'>abide in a secret place, and hide thyself: 19:3 And I will go out and</a>
<a id='line_1833'>stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune</a>
<a id='line_1834'>with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.</a>
<a id='line_1835'></a>
<a id='line_1836'>19:4 And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said</a>
<a id='line_1837'>unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David;</a>
<a id='line_1838'>because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have</a>
<a id='line_1839'>been to thee-ward very good: 19:5 For he did put his life in his hand,</a>
<a id='line_1840'>and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for</a>
<a id='line_1841'>all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt</a>
<a id='line_1842'>thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?  19:6</a>
<a id='line_1843'>And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the</a>
<a id='line_1844'>LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.</a>
<a id='line_1845'></a>
<a id='line_1846'>19:7 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those</a>
<a id='line_1847'>things.</a>
<a id='line_1848'></a>
<a id='line_1849'>And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in</a>
<a id='line_1850'>times past.</a>
<a id='line_1851'></a>
<a id='line_1852'>19:8 And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the</a>
<a id='line_1853'>Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from</a>
<a id='line_1854'>him.</a>
<a id='line_1855'></a>
<a id='line_1856'>19:9 And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his</a>
<a id='line_1857'>house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.</a>
<a id='line_1858'></a>
<a id='line_1859'>19:10 And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the</a>
<a id='line_1860'>javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and he smote the</a>
<a id='line_1861'>javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.</a>
<a id='line_1862'></a>
<a id='line_1863'>19:11 Saul also sent messengers unto David’s house, to watch him, and</a>
<a id='line_1864'>to slay him in the morning: and Michal David’s wife told him, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1865'>If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.</a>
<a id='line_1866'></a>
<a id='line_1867'>19:12 So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and</a>
<a id='line_1868'>fled, and escaped.</a>
<a id='line_1869'></a>
<a id='line_1870'>19:13 And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a</a>
<a id='line_1871'>pillow of goats’ hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.</a>
<a id='line_1872'></a>
<a id='line_1873'>19:14 And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is</a>
<a id='line_1874'>sick.</a>
<a id='line_1875'></a>
<a id='line_1876'>19:15 And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring</a>
<a id='line_1877'>him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.</a>
<a id='line_1878'></a>
<a id='line_1879'>19:16 And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image</a>
<a id='line_1880'>in the bed, with a pillow of goats’ hair for his bolster.</a>
<a id='line_1881'></a>
<a id='line_1882'>19:17 And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and</a>
<a id='line_1883'>sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He</a>
<a id='line_1884'>said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?  19:18 So David fled,</a>
<a id='line_1885'>and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul</a>
<a id='line_1886'>had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.</a>
<a id='line_1887'></a>
<a id='line_1888'>19:19 And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in</a>
<a id='line_1889'>Ramah.</a>
<a id='line_1890'></a>
<a id='line_1891'>19:20 And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the</a>
<a id='line_1892'>company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed</a>
<a id='line_1893'>over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they</a>
<a id='line_1894'>also prophesied.</a>
<a id='line_1895'></a>
<a id='line_1896'>19:21 And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they</a>
<a id='line_1897'>prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time,</a>
<a id='line_1898'>and they prophesied also.</a>
<a id='line_1899'></a>
<a id='line_1900'>19:22 Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in</a>
<a id='line_1901'>Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one</a>
<a id='line_1902'>said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.</a>
<a id='line_1903'></a>
<a id='line_1904'>19:23 And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God</a>
<a id='line_1905'>was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to</a>
<a id='line_1906'>Naioth in Ramah.</a>
<a id='line_1907'></a>
<a id='line_1908'>19:24 And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before</a>
<a id='line_1909'>Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that</a>
<a id='line_1910'>night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?  20:1 And</a>
<a id='line_1911'>David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan,</a>
<a id='line_1912'>What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy</a>
<a id='line_1913'>father, that he seeketh my life?  20:2 And he said unto him, God</a>
<a id='line_1914'>forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either</a>
<a id='line_1915'>great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father</a>
<a id='line_1916'>hide this thing from me? it is not so.</a>
<a id='line_1917'></a>
<a id='line_1918'>20:3 And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth</a>
<a id='line_1919'>that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan</a>
<a id='line_1920'>know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as</a>
<a id='line_1921'>thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.</a>
<a id='line_1922'></a>
<a id='line_1923'>20:4 Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I</a>
<a id='line_1924'>will even do it for thee.</a>
<a id='line_1925'></a>
<a id='line_1926'>20:5 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon,</a>
<a id='line_1927'>and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go,</a>
<a id='line_1928'>that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.</a>
<a id='line_1929'></a>
<a id='line_1930'>20:6 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked</a>
<a id='line_1931'>leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a</a>
<a id='line_1932'>yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</a>
<a id='line_1933'></a>
<a id='line_1934'>20:7 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if</a>
<a id='line_1935'>he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.</a>
<a id='line_1936'></a>
<a id='line_1937'>20:8 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast</a>
<a id='line_1938'>brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee:</a>
<a id='line_1939'>notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why</a>
<a id='line_1940'>shouldest thou bring me to thy father?  20:9 And Jonathan said, Far be</a>
<a id='line_1941'>it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my</a>
<a id='line_1942'>father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?  20:10 Then</a>
<a id='line_1943'>said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father</a>
<a id='line_1944'>answer thee roughly?  20:11 And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and</a>
<a id='line_1945'>let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the</a>
<a id='line_1946'>field.</a>
<a id='line_1947'></a>
<a id='line_1948'>20:12 And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have</a>
<a id='line_1949'>sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and,</a>
<a id='line_1950'>behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee,</a>
<a id='line_1951'>and shew it thee; 20:13 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but</a>
<a id='line_1952'>if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and</a>
<a id='line_1953'>send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with</a>
<a id='line_1954'>thee, as he hath been with my father.</a>
<a id='line_1955'></a>
<a id='line_1956'>20:14 And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of</a>
<a id='line_1957'>the LORD, that I die not: 20:15 But also thou shalt not cut off thy</a>
<a id='line_1958'>kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off</a>
<a id='line_1959'>the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_1960'></a>
<a id='line_1961'>20:16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let</a>
<a id='line_1962'>the LORD even require it at the hand of David’s enemies.</a>
<a id='line_1963'></a>
<a id='line_1964'>20:17 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him:</a>
<a id='line_1965'>for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</a>
<a id='line_1966'></a>
<a id='line_1967'>20:18 Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou</a>
<a id='line_1968'>shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.</a>
<a id='line_1969'></a>
<a id='line_1970'>20:19 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down</a>
<a id='line_1971'>quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the</a>
<a id='line_1972'>business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.</a>
<a id='line_1973'></a>
<a id='line_1974'>20:20 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I</a>
<a id='line_1975'>shot at a mark.</a>
<a id='line_1976'></a>
<a id='line_1977'>20:21 And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows.</a>
<a id='line_1978'>If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side</a>
<a id='line_1979'>of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no</a>
<a id='line_1980'>hurt; as the LORD liveth.</a>
<a id='line_1981'></a>
<a id='line_1982'>20:22 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are</a>
<a id='line_1983'>beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.</a>
<a id='line_1984'></a>
<a id='line_1985'>20:23 And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of,</a>
<a id='line_1986'>behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.</a>
<a id='line_1987'></a>
<a id='line_1988'>20:24 So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was</a>
<a id='line_1989'>come, the king sat him down to eat meat.</a>
<a id='line_1990'></a>
<a id='line_1991'>20:25 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a</a>
<a id='line_1992'>seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul’s side,</a>
<a id='line_1993'>and David’s place was empty.</a>
<a id='line_1994'></a>
<a id='line_1995'>20:26 Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought,</a>
<a id='line_1996'>Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.</a>
<a id='line_1997'></a>
<a id='line_1998'>20:27 And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of</a>
<a id='line_1999'>the month, that David’s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan</a>
<a id='line_2000'>his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither</a>
<a id='line_2001'>yesterday, nor to day?  20:28 And Jonathan answered Saul, David</a>
<a id='line_2002'>earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem: 20:29 And he said, Let</a>
<a id='line_2003'>me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and</a>
<a id='line_2004'>my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found</a>
<a id='line_2005'>favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my</a>
<a id='line_2006'>brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king’s table.</a>
<a id='line_2007'></a>
<a id='line_2008'>20:30 Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto</a>
<a id='line_2009'>him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that</a>
<a id='line_2010'>thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the</a>
<a id='line_2011'>confusion of thy mother’s nakedness?  20:31 For as long as the son of</a>
<a id='line_2012'>Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy</a>
<a id='line_2013'>kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely</a>
<a id='line_2014'>die.</a>
<a id='line_2015'></a>
<a id='line_2016'>20:32 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,</a>
<a id='line_2017'>Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?  20:33 And Saul cast a</a>
<a id='line_2018'>javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was</a>
<a id='line_2019'>determined of his father to slay David.</a>
<a id='line_2020'></a>
<a id='line_2021'>20:34 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no</a>
<a id='line_2022'>meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David,</a>
<a id='line_2023'>because his father had done him shame.</a>
<a id='line_2024'></a>
<a id='line_2025'>20:35 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into</a>
<a id='line_2026'>the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</a>
<a id='line_2027'></a>
<a id='line_2028'>20:36 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I</a>
<a id='line_2029'>shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</a>
<a id='line_2030'></a>
<a id='line_2031'>20:37 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which</a>
<a id='line_2032'>Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the</a>
<a id='line_2033'>arrow beyond thee?  20:38 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make</a>
<a id='line_2034'>speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and</a>
<a id='line_2035'>came to his master.</a>
<a id='line_2036'></a>
<a id='line_2037'>20:39 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the</a>
<a id='line_2038'>matter.</a>
<a id='line_2039'></a>
<a id='line_2040'>20:40 And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him,</a>
<a id='line_2041'>Go, carry them to the city.</a>
<a id='line_2042'></a>
<a id='line_2043'>20:41 And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place</a>
<a id='line_2044'>toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed</a>
<a id='line_2045'>himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with</a>
<a id='line_2046'>another, until David exceeded.</a>
<a id='line_2047'></a>
<a id='line_2048'>20:42 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have</a>
<a id='line_2049'>sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between</a>
<a id='line_2050'>me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose</a>
<a id='line_2051'>and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</a>
<a id='line_2052'></a>
<a id='line_2053'>21:1 Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was</a>
<a id='line_2054'>afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone,</a>
<a id='line_2055'>and no man with thee?  21:2 And David said unto Ahimelech the priest,</a>
<a id='line_2056'>The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no</a>
<a id='line_2057'>man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I</a>
<a id='line_2058'>have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such</a>
<a id='line_2059'>a place.</a>
<a id='line_2060'></a>
<a id='line_2061'>21:3 Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of</a>
<a id='line_2062'>bread in mine hand, or what there is present.</a>
<a id='line_2063'></a>
<a id='line_2064'>21:4 And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread</a>
<a id='line_2065'>under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have</a>
<a id='line_2066'>kept themselves at least from women.</a>
<a id='line_2067'></a>
<a id='line_2068'>21:5 And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth</a>
<a id='line_2069'>women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out,</a>
<a id='line_2070'>and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a</a>
<a id='line_2071'>manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.</a>
<a id='line_2072'></a>
<a id='line_2073'>21:6 So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread</a>
<a id='line_2074'>there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put</a>
<a id='line_2075'>hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</a>
<a id='line_2076'></a>
<a id='line_2077'>21:7 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,</a>
<a id='line_2078'>detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the</a>
<a id='line_2079'>chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.</a>
<a id='line_2080'></a>
<a id='line_2081'>21:8 And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine</a>
<a id='line_2082'>hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my</a>
<a id='line_2083'>weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.</a>
<a id='line_2084'></a>
<a id='line_2085'>21:9 And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom</a>
<a id='line_2086'>thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a</a>
<a id='line_2087'>cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is</a>
<a id='line_2088'>no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give</a>
<a id='line_2089'>it me.</a>
<a id='line_2090'></a>
<a id='line_2091'>21:10 And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to</a>
<a id='line_2092'>Achish the king of Gath.</a>
<a id='line_2093'></a>
<a id='line_2094'>21:11 And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the</a>
<a id='line_2095'>king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances,</a>
<a id='line_2096'>saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</a>
<a id='line_2097'>21:12 And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid</a>
<a id='line_2098'>of Achish the king of Gath.</a>
<a id='line_2099'></a>
<a id='line_2100'>21:13 And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself</a>
<a id='line_2101'>mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let</a>
<a id='line_2102'>his spittle fall down upon his beard.</a>
<a id='line_2103'></a>
<a id='line_2104'>21:14 Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad:</a>
<a id='line_2105'>wherefore then have ye brought him to me?  21:15 Have I need of mad</a>
<a id='line_2106'>men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my</a>
<a id='line_2107'>presence? shall this fellow come into my house?  22:1 David therefore</a>
<a id='line_2108'>departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his</a>
<a id='line_2109'>brethren and all his father’s house heard it, they went down thither</a>
<a id='line_2110'>to him.</a>
<a id='line_2111'></a>
<a id='line_2112'>22:2 And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in</a>
<a id='line_2113'>debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto</a>
<a id='line_2114'>him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about</a>
<a id='line_2115'>four hundred men.</a>
<a id='line_2116'></a>
<a id='line_2117'>22:3 And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the</a>
<a id='line_2118'>king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth,</a>
<a id='line_2119'>and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.</a>
<a id='line_2120'></a>
<a id='line_2121'>22:4 And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with</a>
<a id='line_2122'>him all the while that David was in the hold.</a>
<a id='line_2123'></a>
<a id='line_2124'>22:5 And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold;</a>
<a id='line_2125'>depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and</a>
<a id='line_2126'>came into the forest of Hareth.</a>
<a id='line_2127'></a>
<a id='line_2128'>22:6 When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were</a>
<a id='line_2129'>with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his</a>
<a id='line_2130'>spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;) 22:7</a>
<a id='line_2131'>Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye</a>
<a id='line_2132'>Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and</a>
<a id='line_2133'>vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of</a>
<a id='line_2134'>hundreds; 22:8 That all of you have conspired against me, and there is</a>
<a id='line_2135'>none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of</a>
<a id='line_2136'>Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto</a>
<a id='line_2137'>me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait,</a>
<a id='line_2138'>as at this day?  22:9 Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set</a>
<a id='line_2139'>over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to</a>
<a id='line_2140'>Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.</a>
<a id='line_2141'></a>
<a id='line_2142'>22:10 And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and</a>
<a id='line_2143'>gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.</a>
<a id='line_2144'></a>
<a id='line_2145'>22:11 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of</a>
<a id='line_2146'>Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests that were in Nob: and</a>
<a id='line_2147'>they came all of them to the king.</a>
<a id='line_2148'></a>
<a id='line_2149'>22:12 And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered,</a>
<a id='line_2150'>Here I am, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2151'></a>
<a id='line_2152'>22:13 And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou</a>
<a id='line_2153'>and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword,</a>
<a id='line_2154'>and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to</a>
<a id='line_2155'>lie in wait, as at this day?  22:14 Then Ahimelech answered the king,</a>
<a id='line_2156'>and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David,</a>
<a id='line_2157'>which is the king’s son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is</a>
<a id='line_2158'>honourable in thine house?  22:15 Did I then begin to enquire of God</a>
<a id='line_2159'>for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his</a>
<a id='line_2160'>servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew</a>
<a id='line_2161'>nothing of all this, less or more.</a>
<a id='line_2162'></a>
<a id='line_2163'>22:16 And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and</a>
<a id='line_2164'>all thy father’s house.</a>
<a id='line_2165'></a>
<a id='line_2166'>22:17 And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn,</a>
<a id='line_2167'>and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with</a>
<a id='line_2168'>David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me.</a>
<a id='line_2169'>But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall</a>
<a id='line_2170'>upon the priests of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2171'></a>
<a id='line_2172'>22:18 And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.</a>
<a id='line_2173'>And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on</a>
<a id='line_2174'>that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.</a>
<a id='line_2175'></a>
<a id='line_2176'>22:19 And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the</a>
<a id='line_2177'>sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and</a>
<a id='line_2178'>asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.</a>
<a id='line_2179'></a>
<a id='line_2180'>22:20 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named</a>
<a id='line_2181'>Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.</a>
<a id='line_2182'></a>
<a id='line_2183'>22:21 And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD’s</a>
<a id='line_2184'>priests.</a>
<a id='line_2185'></a>
<a id='line_2186'>22:22 And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the</a>
<a id='line_2187'>Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned</a>
<a id='line_2188'>the death of all the persons of thy father’s house.</a>
<a id='line_2189'></a>
<a id='line_2190'>22:23 Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life</a>
<a id='line_2191'>seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.</a>
<a id='line_2192'></a>
<a id='line_2193'>23:1 Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight</a>
<a id='line_2194'>against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.</a>
<a id='line_2195'></a>
<a id='line_2196'>23:2 Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and</a>
<a id='line_2197'>smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite</a>
<a id='line_2198'>the Philistines, and save Keilah.</a>
<a id='line_2199'></a>
<a id='line_2200'>23:3 And David’s men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in</a>
<a id='line_2201'>Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of</a>
<a id='line_2202'>the Philistines?  23:4 Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And</a>
<a id='line_2203'>the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will</a>
<a id='line_2204'>deliver the Philistines into thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_2205'></a>
<a id='line_2206'>23:5 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the</a>
<a id='line_2207'>Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a</a>
<a id='line_2208'>great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</a>
<a id='line_2209'></a>
<a id='line_2210'>23:6 And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to</a>
<a id='line_2211'>David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.</a>
<a id='line_2212'></a>
<a id='line_2213'>23:7 And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul</a>
<a id='line_2214'>said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by</a>
<a id='line_2215'>entering into a town that hath gates and bars.</a>
<a id='line_2216'></a>
<a id='line_2217'>23:8 And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to</a>
<a id='line_2218'>Keilah, to besiege David and his men.</a>
<a id='line_2219'></a>
<a id='line_2220'>23:9 And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him;</a>
<a id='line_2221'>and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.</a>
<a id='line_2222'></a>
<a id='line_2223'>23:10 Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath</a>
<a id='line_2224'>certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the</a>
<a id='line_2225'>city for my sake.</a>
<a id='line_2226'></a>
<a id='line_2227'>23:11 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul</a>
<a id='line_2228'>come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech</a>
<a id='line_2229'>thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.</a>
<a id='line_2230'></a>
<a id='line_2231'>23:12 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men</a>
<a id='line_2232'>into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.</a>
<a id='line_2233'></a>
<a id='line_2234'>23:13 Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and</a>
<a id='line_2235'>departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it</a>
<a id='line_2236'>was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go</a>
<a id='line_2237'>forth.</a>
<a id='line_2238'></a>
<a id='line_2239'>23:14 And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained</a>
<a id='line_2240'>in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every</a>
<a id='line_2241'>day, but God delivered him not into his hand.</a>
<a id='line_2242'></a>
<a id='line_2243'>23:15 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David</a>
<a id='line_2244'>was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.</a>
<a id='line_2245'></a>
<a id='line_2246'>23:16 And Jonathan Saul’s son arose, and went to David into the wood,</a>
<a id='line_2247'>and strengthened his hand in God.</a>
<a id='line_2248'></a>
<a id='line_2249'>23:17 And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father</a>
<a id='line_2250'>shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall</a>
<a id='line_2251'>be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.</a>
<a id='line_2252'></a>
<a id='line_2253'>23:18 And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in</a>
<a id='line_2254'>the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.</a>
<a id='line_2255'></a>
<a id='line_2256'>23:19 Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not</a>
<a id='line_2257'>David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of</a>
<a id='line_2258'>Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?  23:20 Now therefore, O</a>
<a id='line_2259'>king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down;</a>
<a id='line_2260'>and our part shall be to deliver him into the king’s hand.</a>
<a id='line_2261'></a>
<a id='line_2262'>23:21 And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion</a>
<a id='line_2263'>on me.</a>
<a id='line_2264'></a>
<a id='line_2265'>23:22 Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where</a>
<a id='line_2266'>his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he</a>
<a id='line_2267'>dealeth very subtilly.</a>
<a id='line_2268'></a>
<a id='line_2269'>23:23 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places</a>
<a id='line_2270'>where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty,</a>
<a id='line_2271'>and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the</a>
<a id='line_2272'>land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of</a>
<a id='line_2273'>Judah.</a>
<a id='line_2274'></a>
<a id='line_2275'>23:24 And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his</a>
<a id='line_2276'>men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of</a>
<a id='line_2277'>Jeshimon.</a>
<a id='line_2278'></a>
<a id='line_2279'>23:25 Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David;</a>
<a id='line_2280'>wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of</a>
<a id='line_2281'>Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the</a>
<a id='line_2282'>wilderness of Maon.</a>
<a id='line_2283'></a>
<a id='line_2284'>23:26 And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his</a>
<a id='line_2285'>men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for</a>
<a id='line_2286'>fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round</a>
<a id='line_2287'>about to take them.</a>
<a id='line_2288'></a>
<a id='line_2289'>23:27 But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and</a>
<a id='line_2290'>come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.</a>
<a id='line_2291'></a>
<a id='line_2292'>23:28 Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went</a>
<a id='line_2293'>against the Philistines: therefore they called that place</a>
<a id='line_2294'>Selahammahlekoth.</a>
<a id='line_2295'></a>
<a id='line_2296'>23:29 And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at</a>
<a id='line_2297'>Engedi.</a>
<a id='line_2298'></a>
<a id='line_2299'>24:1 And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the</a>
<a id='line_2300'>Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the</a>
<a id='line_2301'>wilderness of Engedi.</a>
<a id='line_2302'></a>
<a id='line_2303'>24:2 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and</a>
<a id='line_2304'>went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.</a>
<a id='line_2305'></a>
<a id='line_2306'>24:3 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and</a>
<a id='line_2307'>Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the</a>
<a id='line_2308'>sides of the cave.</a>
<a id='line_2309'></a>
<a id='line_2310'>24:4 And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the</a>
<a id='line_2311'>LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine</a>
<a id='line_2312'>hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then</a>
<a id='line_2313'>David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe privily.</a>
<a id='line_2314'></a>
<a id='line_2315'>24:5 And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him,</a>
<a id='line_2316'>because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.</a>
<a id='line_2317'></a>
<a id='line_2318'>24:6 And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this</a>
<a id='line_2319'>thing unto my master, the LORD’s anointed, to stretch forth mine hand</a>
<a id='line_2320'>against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2321'></a>
<a id='line_2322'>24:7 So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them</a>
<a id='line_2323'>not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went</a>
<a id='line_2324'>on his way.</a>
<a id='line_2325'></a>
<a id='line_2326'>24:8 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried</a>
<a id='line_2327'>after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him,</a>
<a id='line_2328'>David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.</a>
<a id='line_2329'></a>
<a id='line_2330'>24:9 And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men’s words,</a>
<a id='line_2331'>saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?  24:10 Behold, this day thine</a>
<a id='line_2332'>eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine</a>
<a id='line_2333'>hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared</a>
<a id='line_2334'>thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for</a>
<a id='line_2335'>he is the LORD’s anointed.</a>
<a id='line_2336'></a>
<a id='line_2337'>24:11 Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my</a>
<a id='line_2338'>hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee</a>
<a id='line_2339'>not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in</a>
<a id='line_2340'>mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my</a>
<a id='line_2341'>soul to take it.</a>
<a id='line_2342'></a>
<a id='line_2343'>24:12 The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of</a>
<a id='line_2344'>thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</a>
<a id='line_2345'></a>
<a id='line_2346'>24:13 As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from</a>
<a id='line_2347'>the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</a>
<a id='line_2348'></a>
<a id='line_2349'>24:14 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou</a>
<a id='line_2350'>pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.</a>
<a id='line_2351'></a>
<a id='line_2352'>24:15 The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and</a>
<a id='line_2353'>see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_2354'></a>
<a id='line_2355'>24:16 And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking</a>
<a id='line_2356'>these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son</a>
<a id='line_2357'>David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</a>
<a id='line_2358'></a>
<a id='line_2359'>24:17 And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou</a>
<a id='line_2360'>hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.</a>
<a id='line_2361'></a>
<a id='line_2362'>24:18 And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with</a>
<a id='line_2363'>me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou</a>
<a id='line_2364'>killedst me not.</a>
<a id='line_2365'></a>
<a id='line_2366'>24:19 For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?</a>
<a id='line_2367'>wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me</a>
<a id='line_2368'>this day.</a>
<a id='line_2369'></a>
<a id='line_2370'>24:20 And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and</a>
<a id='line_2371'>that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_2372'></a>
<a id='line_2373'>24:21 Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut</a>
<a id='line_2374'>off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my</a>
<a id='line_2375'>father’s house.</a>
<a id='line_2376'></a>
<a id='line_2377'>24:22 And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his</a>
<a id='line_2378'>men gat them up unto the hold.</a>
<a id='line_2379'></a>
<a id='line_2380'>25:1 And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together,</a>
<a id='line_2381'>and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David</a>
<a id='line_2382'>arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.</a>
<a id='line_2383'></a>
<a id='line_2384'>25:2 And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;</a>
<a id='line_2385'>and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a</a>
<a id='line_2386'>thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</a>
<a id='line_2387'></a>
<a id='line_2388'>25:3 Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife</a>
<a id='line_2389'>Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful</a>
<a id='line_2390'>countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he</a>
<a id='line_2391'>was of the house of Caleb.</a>
<a id='line_2392'></a>
<a id='line_2393'>25:4 And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.</a>
<a id='line_2394'></a>
<a id='line_2395'>25:5 And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young</a>
<a id='line_2396'>men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:</a>
<a id='line_2397'>25:6 And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be</a>
<a id='line_2398'>both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that</a>
<a id='line_2399'>thou hast.</a>
<a id='line_2400'></a>
<a id='line_2401'>25:7 And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds</a>
<a id='line_2402'>which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing</a>
<a id='line_2403'>unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.</a>
<a id='line_2404'></a>
<a id='line_2405'>25:8 Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the</a>
<a id='line_2406'>young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give,</a>
<a id='line_2407'>I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to</a>
<a id='line_2408'>thy son David.</a>
<a id='line_2409'></a>
<a id='line_2410'>25:9 And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to</a>
<a id='line_2411'>all those words in the name of David, and ceased.</a>
<a id='line_2412'></a>
<a id='line_2413'>25:10 And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who is David? and</a>
<a id='line_2414'>who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break</a>
<a id='line_2415'>away every man from his master.</a>
<a id='line_2416'></a>
<a id='line_2417'>25:11 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I</a>
<a id='line_2418'>have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not</a>
<a id='line_2419'>whence they be?  25:12 So David’s young men turned their way, and went</a>
<a id='line_2420'>again, and came and told him all those sayings.</a>
<a id='line_2421'></a>
<a id='line_2422'>25:13 And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And</a>
<a id='line_2423'>they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his</a>
<a id='line_2424'>sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two</a>
<a id='line_2425'>hundred abode by the stuff.</a>
<a id='line_2426'></a>
<a id='line_2427'>25:14 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying,</a>
<a id='line_2428'>Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our</a>
<a id='line_2429'>master; and he railed on them.</a>
<a id='line_2430'></a>
<a id='line_2431'>25:15 But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt,</a>
<a id='line_2432'>neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them,</a>
<a id='line_2433'>when we were in the fields: 25:16 They were a wall unto us both by</a>
<a id='line_2434'>night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.</a>
<a id='line_2435'></a>
<a id='line_2436'>25:17 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is</a>
<a id='line_2437'>determined against our master, and against all his household: for he</a>
<a id='line_2438'>is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.</a>
<a id='line_2439'></a>
<a id='line_2440'>25:18 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two</a>
<a id='line_2441'>bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of</a>
<a id='line_2442'>parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred</a>
<a id='line_2443'>cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.</a>
<a id='line_2444'></a>
<a id='line_2445'>25:19 And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come</a>
<a id='line_2446'>after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.</a>
<a id='line_2447'></a>
<a id='line_2448'>25:20 And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the</a>
<a id='line_2449'>covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against</a>
<a id='line_2450'>her; and she met them.</a>
<a id='line_2451'></a>
<a id='line_2452'>25:21 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this</a>
<a id='line_2453'>fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that</a>
<a id='line_2454'>pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.</a>
<a id='line_2455'></a>
<a id='line_2456'>25:22 So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of</a>
<a id='line_2457'>all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against</a>
<a id='line_2458'>the wall.</a>
<a id='line_2459'></a>
<a id='line_2460'>25:23 And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass,</a>
<a id='line_2461'>and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,</a>
<a id='line_2462'>25:24 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let</a>
<a id='line_2463'>this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine</a>
<a id='line_2464'>audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.</a>
<a id='line_2465'></a>
<a id='line_2466'>25:25 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even</a>
<a id='line_2467'>Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is</a>
<a id='line_2468'>with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom</a>
<a id='line_2469'>thou didst send.</a>
<a id='line_2470'></a>
<a id='line_2471'>25:26 Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul</a>
<a id='line_2472'>liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed</a>
<a id='line_2473'>blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine</a>
<a id='line_2474'>enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</a>
<a id='line_2475'></a>
<a id='line_2476'>25:27 And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my</a>
<a id='line_2477'>lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2478'></a>
<a id='line_2479'>25:28 I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the</a>
<a id='line_2480'>LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord</a>
<a id='line_2481'>fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee</a>
<a id='line_2482'>all thy days.</a>
<a id='line_2483'></a>
<a id='line_2484'>25:29 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the</a>
<a id='line_2485'>soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy</a>
<a id='line_2486'>God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out</a>
<a id='line_2487'>of the middle of a sling.</a>
<a id='line_2488'></a>
<a id='line_2489'>25:30 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my</a>
<a id='line_2490'>lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee,</a>
<a id='line_2491'>and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel; 25:31 That this shall</a>
<a id='line_2492'>be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that</a>
<a id='line_2493'>thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself:</a>
<a id='line_2494'>but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember</a>
<a id='line_2495'>thine handmaid.</a>
<a id='line_2496'></a>
<a id='line_2497'>25:32 And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_2498'>which sent thee this day to meet me: 25:33 And blessed be thy advice,</a>
<a id='line_2499'>and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed</a>
<a id='line_2500'>blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.</a>
<a id='line_2501'></a>
<a id='line_2502'>25:34 For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath</a>
<a id='line_2503'>kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to</a>
<a id='line_2504'>meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning</a>
<a id='line_2505'>light any that pisseth against the wall.</a>
<a id='line_2506'></a>
<a id='line_2507'>25:35 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him,</a>
<a id='line_2508'>and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have</a>
<a id='line_2509'>hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.</a>
<a id='line_2510'></a>
<a id='line_2511'>25:36 And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his</a>
<a id='line_2512'>house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart was merry within</a>
<a id='line_2513'>him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or</a>
<a id='line_2514'>more, until the morning light.</a>
<a id='line_2515'></a>
<a id='line_2516'>25:37 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out</a>
<a id='line_2517'>of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died</a>
<a id='line_2518'>within him, and he became as a stone.</a>
<a id='line_2519'></a>
<a id='line_2520'>25:38 And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote</a>
<a id='line_2521'>Nabal, that he died.</a>
<a id='line_2522'></a>
<a id='line_2523'>25:39 And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be</a>
<a id='line_2524'>the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of</a>
<a id='line_2525'>Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned</a>
<a id='line_2526'>the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed</a>
<a id='line_2527'>with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.</a>
<a id='line_2528'></a>
<a id='line_2529'>25:40 And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,</a>
<a id='line_2530'>they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to</a>
<a id='line_2531'>him to wife.</a>
<a id='line_2532'></a>
<a id='line_2533'>25:41 And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and</a>
<a id='line_2534'>said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the</a>
<a id='line_2535'>servants of my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2536'></a>
<a id='line_2537'>25:42 And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five</a>
<a id='line_2538'>damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers</a>
<a id='line_2539'>of David, and became his wife.</a>
<a id='line_2540'></a>
<a id='line_2541'>25:43 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of</a>
<a id='line_2542'>them his wives.</a>
<a id='line_2543'></a>
<a id='line_2544'>25:44 But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Phalti</a>
<a id='line_2545'>the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.</a>
<a id='line_2546'></a>
<a id='line_2547'>26:1 And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David</a>
<a id='line_2548'>hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?  26:2</a>
<a id='line_2549'>Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three</a>
<a id='line_2550'>thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the</a>
<a id='line_2551'>wilderness of Ziph.</a>
<a id='line_2552'></a>
<a id='line_2553'>26:3 And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before</a>
<a id='line_2554'>Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw</a>
<a id='line_2555'>that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_2556'></a>
<a id='line_2557'>26:4 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come</a>
<a id='line_2558'>in very deed.</a>
<a id='line_2559'></a>
<a id='line_2560'>26:5 And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched:</a>
<a id='line_2561'>and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner,</a>
<a id='line_2562'>the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people</a>
<a id='line_2563'>pitched round about him.</a>
<a id='line_2564'></a>
<a id='line_2565'>26:6 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to</a>
<a id='line_2566'>Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down</a>
<a id='line_2567'>with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with</a>
<a id='line_2568'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_2569'></a>
<a id='line_2570'>26:7 So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold,</a>
<a id='line_2571'>Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground</a>
<a id='line_2572'>at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.</a>
<a id='line_2573'></a>
<a id='line_2574'>26:8 Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into</a>
<a id='line_2575'>thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with</a>
<a id='line_2576'>the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the</a>
<a id='line_2577'>second time.</a>
<a id='line_2578'></a>
<a id='line_2579'>26:9 And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch</a>
<a id='line_2580'>forth his hand against the LORD’s anointed, and be guiltless?  26:10</a>
<a id='line_2581'>David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him;</a>
<a id='line_2582'>or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and</a>
<a id='line_2583'>perish.</a>
<a id='line_2584'></a>
<a id='line_2585'>26:11 The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against</a>
<a id='line_2586'>the LORD’s anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is</a>
<a id='line_2587'>at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.</a>
<a id='line_2588'></a>
<a id='line_2589'>26:12 So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s</a>
<a id='line_2590'>bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it,</a>
<a id='line_2591'>neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from</a>
<a id='line_2592'>the LORD was fallen upon them.</a>
<a id='line_2593'></a>
<a id='line_2594'>26:13 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of</a>
<a id='line_2595'>an hill afar off; a great space being between them: 26:14 And David</a>
<a id='line_2596'>cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest</a>
<a id='line_2597'>thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that</a>
<a id='line_2598'>criest to the king?  26:15 And David said to Abner, Art not thou a</a>
<a id='line_2599'>valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast</a>
<a id='line_2600'>thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in</a>
<a id='line_2601'>to destroy the king thy lord.</a>
<a id='line_2602'></a>
<a id='line_2603'>26:16 This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth,</a>
<a id='line_2604'>ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD’s</a>
<a id='line_2605'>anointed.</a>
<a id='line_2606'></a>
<a id='line_2607'>And now see where the king’s spear is, and the cruse of water that was</a>
<a id='line_2608'>at his bolster.</a>
<a id='line_2609'></a>
<a id='line_2610'>26:17 And Saul knew David’s voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son</a>
<a id='line_2611'>David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</a>
<a id='line_2612'></a>
<a id='line_2613'>26:18 And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his</a>
<a id='line_2614'>servant?  for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?  26:19</a>
<a id='line_2615'>Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his</a>
<a id='line_2616'>servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept</a>
<a id='line_2617'>an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before</a>
<a id='line_2618'>the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the</a>
<a id='line_2619'>inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.</a>
<a id='line_2620'></a>
<a id='line_2621'>26:20 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the</a>
<a id='line_2622'>face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea,</a>
<a id='line_2623'>as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.</a>
<a id='line_2624'></a>
<a id='line_2625'>26:21 Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will</a>
<a id='line_2626'>no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this</a>
<a id='line_2627'>day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.</a>
<a id='line_2628'></a>
<a id='line_2629'>26:22 And David answered and said, Behold the king’s spear! and let</a>
<a id='line_2630'>one of the young men come over and fetch it.</a>
<a id='line_2631'></a>
<a id='line_2632'>26:23 The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his</a>
<a id='line_2633'>faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I</a>
<a id='line_2634'>would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD’s anointed.</a>
<a id='line_2635'></a>
<a id='line_2636'>26:24 And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes,</a>
<a id='line_2637'>so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him</a>
<a id='line_2638'>deliver me out of all tribulation.</a>
<a id='line_2639'></a>
<a id='line_2640'>26:25 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou</a>
<a id='line_2641'>shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David</a>
<a id='line_2642'>went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</a>
<a id='line_2643'></a>
<a id='line_2644'>27:1 And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the</a>
<a id='line_2645'>hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should</a>
<a id='line_2646'>speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall</a>
<a id='line_2647'>despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I</a>
<a id='line_2648'>escape out of his hand.</a>
<a id='line_2649'></a>
<a id='line_2650'>27:2 And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that</a>
<a id='line_2651'>were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.</a>
<a id='line_2652'></a>
<a id='line_2653'>27:3 And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man</a>
<a id='line_2654'>with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the</a>
<a id='line_2655'>Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife.</a>
<a id='line_2656'></a>
<a id='line_2657'>27:4 And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought</a>
<a id='line_2658'>no more again for him.</a>
<a id='line_2659'></a>
<a id='line_2660'>27:5 And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine</a>
<a id='line_2661'>eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may</a>
<a id='line_2662'>dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with</a>
<a id='line_2663'>thee?  27:6 Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag</a>
<a id='line_2664'>pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_2665'></a>
<a id='line_2666'>27:7 And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines</a>
<a id='line_2667'>was a full year and four months.</a>
<a id='line_2668'></a>
<a id='line_2669'>27:8 And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and</a>
<a id='line_2670'>the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the</a>
<a id='line_2671'>inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of</a>
<a id='line_2672'>Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_2673'></a>
<a id='line_2674'>27:9 And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive,</a>
<a id='line_2675'>and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels,</a>
<a id='line_2676'>and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.</a>
<a id='line_2677'></a>
<a id='line_2678'>27:10 And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David</a>
<a id='line_2679'>said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the</a>
<a id='line_2680'>Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.</a>
<a id='line_2681'></a>
<a id='line_2682'>27:11 And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to</a>
<a id='line_2683'>Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and</a>
<a id='line_2684'>so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the</a>
<a id='line_2685'>Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_2686'></a>
<a id='line_2687'>27:12 And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people</a>
<a id='line_2688'>Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for</a>
<a id='line_2689'>ever.</a>
<a id='line_2690'></a>
<a id='line_2691'>28:1 And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered</a>
<a id='line_2692'>their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish</a>
<a id='line_2693'>said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me</a>
<a id='line_2694'>to battle, thou and thy men.</a>
<a id='line_2695'></a>
<a id='line_2696'>28:2 And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant</a>
<a id='line_2697'>can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of</a>
<a id='line_2698'>mine head for ever.</a>
<a id='line_2699'></a>
<a id='line_2700'>28:3 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried</a>
<a id='line_2701'>him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that</a>
<a id='line_2702'>had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.</a>
<a id='line_2703'></a>
<a id='line_2704'>28:4 And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and</a>
<a id='line_2705'>pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they</a>
<a id='line_2706'>pitched in Gilboa.</a>
<a id='line_2707'></a>
<a id='line_2708'>28:5 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and</a>
<a id='line_2709'>his heart greatly trembled.</a>
<a id='line_2710'></a>
<a id='line_2711'>28:6 And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not,</a>
<a id='line_2712'>neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.</a>
<a id='line_2713'></a>
<a id='line_2714'>28:7 Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a</a>
<a id='line_2715'>familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his</a>
<a id='line_2716'>servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar</a>
<a id='line_2717'>spirit at Endor.</a>
<a id='line_2718'></a>
<a id='line_2719'>28:8 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he</a>
<a id='line_2720'>went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and</a>
<a id='line_2721'>he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring</a>
<a id='line_2722'>me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_2723'></a>
<a id='line_2724'>28:9 And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath</a>
<a id='line_2725'>done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the</a>
<a id='line_2726'>wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my</a>
<a id='line_2727'>life, to cause me to die?  28:10 And Saul sware to her by the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_2728'>saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee</a>
<a id='line_2729'>for this thing.</a>
<a id='line_2730'></a>
<a id='line_2731'>28:11 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he</a>
<a id='line_2732'>said, Bring me up Samuel.</a>
<a id='line_2733'></a>
<a id='line_2734'>28:12 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and</a>
<a id='line_2735'>the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou</a>
<a id='line_2736'>art Saul.</a>
<a id='line_2737'></a>
<a id='line_2738'>28:13 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou?</a>
<a id='line_2739'>And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_2740'></a>
<a id='line_2741'>28:14 And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old</a>
<a id='line_2742'>man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived</a>
<a id='line_2743'>that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and</a>
<a id='line_2744'>bowed himself.</a>
<a id='line_2745'></a>
<a id='line_2746'>28:15 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring</a>
<a id='line_2747'>me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines</a>
<a id='line_2748'>make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no</a>
<a id='line_2749'>more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called</a>
<a id='line_2750'>thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.</a>
<a id='line_2751'></a>
<a id='line_2752'>28:16 Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the</a>
<a id='line_2753'>LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?  28:17 And the</a>
<a id='line_2754'>LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the</a>
<a id='line_2755'>kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to</a>
<a id='line_2756'>David: 28:18 Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor</a>
<a id='line_2757'>executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done</a>
<a id='line_2758'>this thing unto thee this day.</a>
<a id='line_2759'></a>
<a id='line_2760'>28:19 Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the</a>
<a id='line_2761'>hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with</a>
<a id='line_2762'>me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of</a>
<a id='line_2763'>the Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_2764'></a>
<a id='line_2765'>28:20 Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore</a>
<a id='line_2766'>afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in</a>
<a id='line_2767'>him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.</a>
<a id='line_2768'></a>
<a id='line_2769'>28:21 And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled,</a>
<a id='line_2770'>and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I</a>
<a id='line_2771'>have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which</a>
<a id='line_2772'>thou spakest unto me.</a>
<a id='line_2773'></a>
<a id='line_2774'>28:22 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of</a>
<a id='line_2775'>thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat,</a>
<a id='line_2776'>that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.</a>
<a id='line_2777'></a>
<a id='line_2778'>28:23 But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants,</a>
<a id='line_2779'>together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their</a>
<a id='line_2780'>voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.</a>
<a id='line_2781'></a>
<a id='line_2782'>28:24 And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and</a>
<a id='line_2783'>killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened</a>
<a id='line_2784'>bread thereof: 28:25 And she brought it before Saul, and before his</a>
<a id='line_2785'>servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that</a>
<a id='line_2786'>night.</a>
<a id='line_2787'></a>
<a id='line_2788'>29:1 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek:</a>
<a id='line_2789'>and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.</a>
<a id='line_2790'></a>
<a id='line_2791'>29:2 And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by</a>
<a id='line_2792'>thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with</a>
<a id='line_2793'>Achish.</a>
<a id='line_2794'></a>
<a id='line_2795'>29:3 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews</a>
<a id='line_2796'>here?  And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not</a>
<a id='line_2797'>this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been</a>
<a id='line_2798'>with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him</a>
<a id='line_2799'>since he fell unto me unto this day?  29:4 And the princes of the</a>
<a id='line_2800'>Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines</a>
<a id='line_2801'>said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his</a>
<a id='line_2802'>place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us</a>
<a id='line_2803'>to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith</a>
<a id='line_2804'>should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the</a>
<a id='line_2805'>heads of these men?  29:5 Is not this David, of whom they sang one to</a>
<a id='line_2806'>another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten</a>
<a id='line_2807'>thousands?  29:6 Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely,</a>
<a id='line_2808'>as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy</a>
<a id='line_2809'>coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not</a>
<a id='line_2810'>found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day:</a>
<a id='line_2811'>nevertheless the lords favour thee not.</a>
<a id='line_2812'></a>
<a id='line_2813'>29:7 Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not</a>
<a id='line_2814'>the lords of the Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_2815'></a>
<a id='line_2816'>29:8 And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast</a>
<a id='line_2817'>thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this</a>
<a id='line_2818'>day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</a>
<a id='line_2819'>29:9 And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good</a>
<a id='line_2820'>in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the</a>
<a id='line_2821'>Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.</a>
<a id='line_2822'></a>
<a id='line_2823'>29:10 Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master’s</a>
<a id='line_2824'>servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the</a>
<a id='line_2825'>morning, and have light, depart.</a>
<a id='line_2826'></a>
<a id='line_2827'>29:11 So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to</a>
<a id='line_2828'>return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up</a>
<a id='line_2829'>to Jezreel.</a>
<a id='line_2830'></a>
<a id='line_2831'>30:1 And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag</a>
<a id='line_2832'>on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and</a>
<a id='line_2833'>Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; 30:2 And had</a>
<a id='line_2834'>taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either</a>
<a id='line_2835'>great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.</a>
<a id='line_2836'></a>
<a id='line_2837'>30:3 So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned</a>
<a id='line_2838'>with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were</a>
<a id='line_2839'>taken captives.</a>
<a id='line_2840'></a>
<a id='line_2841'>30:4 Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their</a>
<a id='line_2842'>voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</a>
<a id='line_2843'></a>
<a id='line_2844'>30:5 And David’s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the</a>
<a id='line_2845'>Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</a>
<a id='line_2846'></a>
<a id='line_2847'>30:6 And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning</a>
<a id='line_2848'>him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his</a>
<a id='line_2849'>sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2850'>his God.</a>
<a id='line_2851'></a>
<a id='line_2852'>30:7 And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, I pray</a>
<a id='line_2853'>thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the</a>
<a id='line_2854'>ephod to David.</a>
<a id='line_2855'></a>
<a id='line_2856'>30:8 And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this</a>
<a id='line_2857'>troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou</a>
<a id='line_2858'>shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.</a>
<a id='line_2859'></a>
<a id='line_2860'>30:9 So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and</a>
<a id='line_2861'>came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.</a>
<a id='line_2862'></a>
<a id='line_2863'>30:10 But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred</a>
<a id='line_2864'>abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the</a>
<a id='line_2865'>brook Besor.</a>
<a id='line_2866'></a>
<a id='line_2867'>30:11 And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to</a>
<a id='line_2868'>David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink</a>
<a id='line_2869'>water; 30:12 And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two</a>
<a id='line_2870'>clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to</a>
<a id='line_2871'>him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and</a>
<a id='line_2872'>three nights.</a>
<a id='line_2873'></a>
<a id='line_2874'>30:13 And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art</a>
<a id='line_2875'>thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite;</a>
<a id='line_2876'>and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.</a>
<a id='line_2877'></a>
<a id='line_2878'>30:14 We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon</a>
<a id='line_2879'>the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and</a>
<a id='line_2880'>we burned Ziklag with fire.</a>
<a id='line_2881'></a>
<a id='line_2882'>30:15 And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company?</a>
<a id='line_2883'>And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor</a>
<a id='line_2884'>deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to</a>
<a id='line_2885'>this company.</a>
<a id='line_2886'></a>
<a id='line_2887'>30:16 And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread</a>
<a id='line_2888'>abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because</a>
<a id='line_2889'>of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the</a>
<a id='line_2890'>Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_2891'></a>
<a id='line_2892'>30:17 And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of</a>
<a id='line_2893'>the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred</a>
<a id='line_2894'>young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.</a>
<a id='line_2895'></a>
<a id='line_2896'>30:18 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away:</a>
<a id='line_2897'>and David rescued his two wives.</a>
<a id='line_2898'></a>
<a id='line_2899'>30:19 And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great,</a>
<a id='line_2900'>neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had</a>
<a id='line_2901'>taken to them: David recovered all.</a>
<a id='line_2902'></a>
<a id='line_2903'>30:20 And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave</a>
<a id='line_2904'>before those other cattle, and said, This is David’s spoil.</a>
<a id='line_2905'></a>
<a id='line_2906'>30:21 And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that</a>
<a id='line_2907'>they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the</a>
<a id='line_2908'>brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people</a>
<a id='line_2909'>that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted</a>
<a id='line_2910'>them.</a>
<a id='line_2911'></a>
<a id='line_2912'>30:22 Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those</a>
<a id='line_2913'>that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will</a>
<a id='line_2914'>not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every</a>
<a id='line_2915'>man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and</a>
<a id='line_2916'>depart.</a>
<a id='line_2917'></a>
<a id='line_2918'>30:23 Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that</a>
<a id='line_2919'>which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the</a>
<a id='line_2920'>company that came against us into our hand.</a>
<a id='line_2921'></a>
<a id='line_2922'>30:24 For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is</a>
<a id='line_2923'>that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by</a>
<a id='line_2924'>the stuff: they shall part alike.</a>
<a id='line_2925'></a>
<a id='line_2926'>30:25 And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute</a>
<a id='line_2927'>and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_2928'></a>
<a id='line_2929'>30:26 And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the</a>
<a id='line_2930'>elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you</a>
<a id='line_2931'>of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD; 30:27 To them which were in</a>
<a id='line_2932'>Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were</a>
<a id='line_2933'>in Jattir, 30:28 And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which</a>
<a id='line_2934'>were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa, 30:29 And to</a>
<a id='line_2935'>them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the</a>
<a id='line_2936'>Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites,</a>
<a id='line_2937'>30:30 And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in</a>
<a id='line_2938'>Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach, 30:31 And to them which</a>
<a id='line_2939'>were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men</a>
<a id='line_2940'>were wont to haunt.</a>
<a id='line_2941'></a>
<a id='line_2942'>31:1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel</a>
<a id='line_2943'>fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.</a>
<a id='line_2944'></a>
<a id='line_2945'>31:2 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;</a>
<a id='line_2946'>and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua,</a>
<a id='line_2947'>Saul’s sons.</a>
<a id='line_2948'></a>
<a id='line_2949'>31:3 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him;</a>
<a id='line_2950'>and he was sore wounded of the archers.</a>
<a id='line_2951'></a>
<a id='line_2952'>31:4 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust</a>
<a id='line_2953'>me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me</a>
<a id='line_2954'>through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore</a>
<a id='line_2955'>afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.</a>
<a id='line_2956'></a>
<a id='line_2957'>31:5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell</a>
<a id='line_2958'>likewise upon his sword, and died with him.</a>
<a id='line_2959'></a>
<a id='line_2960'>31:6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all</a>
<a id='line_2961'>his men, that same day together.</a>
<a id='line_2962'></a>
<a id='line_2963'>31:7 And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the</a>
<a id='line_2964'>valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men</a>
<a id='line_2965'>of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the</a>
<a id='line_2966'>cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</a>
<a id='line_2967'></a>
<a id='line_2968'>31:8 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to</a>
<a id='line_2969'>strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in</a>
<a id='line_2970'>mount Gilboa.</a>
<a id='line_2971'></a>
<a id='line_2972'>31:9 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent</a>
<a id='line_2973'>into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the</a>
<a id='line_2974'>house of their idols, and among the people.</a>
<a id='line_2975'></a>
<a id='line_2976'>31:10 And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they</a>
<a id='line_2977'>fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.</a>
<a id='line_2978'></a>
<a id='line_2979'>31:11 And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the</a>
<a id='line_2980'>Philistines had done to Saul; 31:12 All the valiant men arose, and</a>
<a id='line_2981'>went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons</a>
<a id='line_2982'>from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.</a>
<a id='line_2983'></a>
<a id='line_2984'>31:13 And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at</a>
<a id='line_2985'>Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</a>
<a id='line_2986'></a>

<a id='line_2995'></a>
<a id='line_2996'></a>
<a id='line_2997'>1:1 Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was</a>
<a id='line_2998'>returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two</a>
<a id='line_2999'>days in Ziklag; 1:2 It came even to pass on the third day, that,</a>
<a id='line_3000'>behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent,</a>
<a id='line_3001'>and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he</a>
<a id='line_3002'>fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</a>
<a id='line_3003'></a>
<a id='line_3004'>1:3 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto</a>
<a id='line_3005'>him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</a>
<a id='line_3006'></a>
<a id='line_3007'>1:4 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell</a>
<a id='line_3008'>me.</a>
<a id='line_3009'></a>
<a id='line_3010'>And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of</a>
<a id='line_3011'>the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are</a>
<a id='line_3012'>dead also.</a>
<a id='line_3013'></a>
<a id='line_3014'>1:5 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou</a>
<a id='line_3015'>that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?  1:6 And the young man that</a>
<a id='line_3016'>told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul</a>
<a id='line_3017'>leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed</a>
<a id='line_3018'>hard after him.</a>
<a id='line_3019'></a>
<a id='line_3020'>1:7 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And</a>
<a id='line_3021'>I answered, Here am I.</a>
<a id='line_3022'></a>
<a id='line_3023'>1:8 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an</a>
<a id='line_3024'>Amalekite.</a>
<a id='line_3025'></a>
<a id='line_3026'>1:9 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me:</a>
<a id='line_3027'>for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.</a>
<a id='line_3028'></a>
<a id='line_3029'>1:10 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he</a>
<a id='line_3030'>could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was</a>
<a id='line_3031'>upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought</a>
<a id='line_3032'>them hither unto my lord.</a>
<a id='line_3033'></a>
<a id='line_3034'>1:11 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise</a>
<a id='line_3035'>all the men that were with him: 1:12 And they mourned, and wept, and</a>
<a id='line_3036'>fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the</a>
<a id='line_3037'>people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were</a>
<a id='line_3038'>fallen by the sword.</a>
<a id='line_3039'></a>
<a id='line_3040'>1:13 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou?</a>
<a id='line_3041'>And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</a>
<a id='line_3042'></a>
<a id='line_3043'>1:14 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch</a>
<a id='line_3044'>forth thine hand to destroy the LORD’s anointed?  1:15 And David</a>
<a id='line_3045'>called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And</a>
<a id='line_3046'>he smote him that he died.</a>
<a id='line_3047'></a>
<a id='line_3048'>1:16 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy</a>
<a id='line_3049'>mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD’s</a>
<a id='line_3050'>anointed.</a>
<a id='line_3051'></a>
<a id='line_3052'>1:17 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over</a>
<a id='line_3053'>Jonathan his son: 1:18 (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah</a>
<a id='line_3054'>the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)</a>
<a id='line_3055'>1:19 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the</a>
<a id='line_3056'>mighty fallen!  1:20 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the</a>
<a id='line_3057'>streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,</a>
<a id='line_3058'>lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</a>
<a id='line_3059'></a>
<a id='line_3060'>1:21 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be</a>
<a id='line_3061'>rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the</a>
<a id='line_3062'>mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not</a>
<a id='line_3063'>been anointed with oil.</a>
<a id='line_3064'></a>
<a id='line_3065'>1:22 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow</a>
<a id='line_3066'>of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</a>
<a id='line_3067'></a>
<a id='line_3068'>1:23 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in</a>
<a id='line_3069'>their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they</a>
<a id='line_3070'>were stronger than lions.</a>
<a id='line_3071'></a>
<a id='line_3072'>1:24 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in</a>
<a id='line_3073'>scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your</a>
<a id='line_3074'>apparel.</a>
<a id='line_3075'></a>
<a id='line_3076'>1:25 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan,</a>
<a id='line_3077'>thou wast slain in thine high places.</a>
<a id='line_3078'></a>
<a id='line_3079'>1:26 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast</a>
<a id='line_3080'>thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of</a>
<a id='line_3081'>women.</a>
<a id='line_3082'></a>
<a id='line_3083'>1:27 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!  2:1</a>
<a id='line_3084'>And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_3085'>saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3086'>said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he</a>
<a id='line_3087'>said, Unto Hebron.</a>
<a id='line_3088'></a>
<a id='line_3089'>2:2 So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the</a>
<a id='line_3090'>Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal’s wife the Carmelite.</a>
<a id='line_3091'></a>
<a id='line_3092'>2:3 And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with</a>
<a id='line_3093'>his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</a>
<a id='line_3094'></a>
<a id='line_3095'>2:4 And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over</a>
<a id='line_3096'>the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of</a>
<a id='line_3097'>Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.</a>
<a id='line_3098'></a>
<a id='line_3099'>2:5 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said</a>
<a id='line_3100'>unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this</a>
<a id='line_3101'>kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.</a>
<a id='line_3102'></a>
<a id='line_3103'>2:6 And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will</a>
<a id='line_3104'>requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.</a>
<a id='line_3105'></a>
<a id='line_3106'>2:7 Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant:</a>
<a id='line_3107'>for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have</a>
<a id='line_3108'>anointed me king over them.</a>
<a id='line_3109'></a>
<a id='line_3110'>2:8 But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, took Ishbosheth</a>
<a id='line_3111'>the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; 2:9 And made him</a>
<a id='line_3112'>king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over</a>
<a id='line_3113'>Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3114'></a>
<a id='line_3115'>2:10 Ishbosheth Saul’s son was forty years old when he began to reign</a>
<a id='line_3116'>over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed</a>
<a id='line_3117'>David.</a>
<a id='line_3118'></a>
<a id='line_3119'>2:11 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of</a>
<a id='line_3120'>Judah was seven years and six months.</a>
<a id='line_3121'></a>
<a id='line_3122'>2:12 And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son</a>
<a id='line_3123'>of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</a>
<a id='line_3124'></a>
<a id='line_3125'>2:13 And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out,</a>
<a id='line_3126'>and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on</a>
<a id='line_3127'>the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</a>
<a id='line_3128'></a>
<a id='line_3129'>2:14 And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play</a>
<a id='line_3130'>before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</a>
<a id='line_3131'></a>
<a id='line_3132'>2:15 Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin,</a>
<a id='line_3133'>which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the</a>
<a id='line_3134'>servants of David.</a>
<a id='line_3135'></a>
<a id='line_3136'>2:16 And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his</a>
<a id='line_3137'>sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: wherefore that</a>
<a id='line_3138'>place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.</a>
<a id='line_3139'></a>
<a id='line_3140'>2:17 And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten,</a>
<a id='line_3141'>and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</a>
<a id='line_3142'></a>
<a id='line_3143'>2:18 And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai,</a>
<a id='line_3144'>and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.</a>
<a id='line_3145'></a>
<a id='line_3146'>2:19 And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the</a>
<a id='line_3147'>right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</a>
<a id='line_3148'></a>
<a id='line_3149'>2:20 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he</a>
<a id='line_3150'>answered, I am.</a>
<a id='line_3151'></a>
<a id='line_3152'>2:21 And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to</a>
<a id='line_3153'>thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his</a>
<a id='line_3154'>armour.</a>
<a id='line_3155'></a>
<a id='line_3156'>But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.</a>
<a id='line_3157'></a>
<a id='line_3158'>2:22 And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following</a>
<a id='line_3159'>me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I</a>
<a id='line_3160'>hold up my face to Joab thy brother?  2:23 Howbeit he refused to turn</a>
<a id='line_3161'>aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him</a>
<a id='line_3162'>under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell</a>
<a id='line_3163'>down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as</a>
<a id='line_3164'>many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</a>
<a id='line_3165'></a>
<a id='line_3166'>2:24 Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down</a>
<a id='line_3167'>when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by</a>
<a id='line_3168'>the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</a>
<a id='line_3169'></a>
<a id='line_3170'>2:25 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after</a>
<a id='line_3171'>Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.</a>
<a id='line_3172'></a>
<a id='line_3173'>2:26 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for</a>
<a id='line_3174'>ever?  knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end?</a>
<a id='line_3175'>how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from</a>
<a id='line_3176'>following their brethren?  2:27 And Joab said, As God liveth, unless</a>
<a id='line_3177'>thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up</a>
<a id='line_3178'>every one from following his brother.</a>
<a id='line_3179'></a>
<a id='line_3180'>2:28 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and</a>
<a id='line_3181'>pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</a>
<a id='line_3182'></a>
<a id='line_3183'>2:29 And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain,</a>
<a id='line_3184'>and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to</a>
<a id='line_3185'>Mahanaim.</a>
<a id='line_3186'></a>
<a id='line_3187'>2:30 And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered</a>
<a id='line_3188'>all the people together, there lacked of David’s servants nineteen men</a>
<a id='line_3189'>and Asahel.</a>
<a id='line_3190'></a>
<a id='line_3191'>2:31 But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner’s</a>
<a id='line_3192'>men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.</a>
<a id='line_3193'></a>
<a id='line_3194'>2:32 And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his</a>
<a id='line_3195'>father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night,</a>
<a id='line_3196'>and they came to Hebron at break of day.</a>
<a id='line_3197'></a>
<a id='line_3198'>3:1 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of</a>
<a id='line_3199'>David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul</a>
<a id='line_3200'>waxed weaker and weaker.</a>
<a id='line_3201'></a>
<a id='line_3202'>3:2 And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was</a>
<a id='line_3203'>Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; 3:3 And his second, Chileab, of</a>
<a id='line_3204'>Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the</a>
<a id='line_3205'>son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; 3:4 And the</a>
<a id='line_3206'>fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son</a>
<a id='line_3207'>of Abital; 3:5 And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David’s wife. These</a>
<a id='line_3208'>were born to David in Hebron.</a>
<a id='line_3209'></a>
<a id='line_3210'>3:6 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul</a>
<a id='line_3211'>and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house</a>
<a id='line_3212'>of Saul.</a>
<a id='line_3213'></a>
<a id='line_3214'>3:7 And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of</a>
<a id='line_3215'>Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto</a>
<a id='line_3216'>my father’s concubine?  3:8 Then was Abner very wroth for the words of</a>
<a id='line_3217'>Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog’s head, which against Judah do shew</a>
<a id='line_3218'>kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren,</a>
<a id='line_3219'>and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of</a>
<a id='line_3220'>David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this</a>
<a id='line_3221'>woman?  3:9 So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3222'>hath sworn to David, even so I do to him; 3:10 To translate the</a>
<a id='line_3223'>kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over</a>
<a id='line_3224'>Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.</a>
<a id='line_3225'></a>
<a id='line_3226'>3:11 And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared</a>
<a id='line_3227'>him.</a>
<a id='line_3228'></a>
<a id='line_3229'>3:12 And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose</a>
<a id='line_3230'>is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my</a>
<a id='line_3231'>hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_3232'></a>
<a id='line_3233'>3:13 And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing</a>
<a id='line_3234'>I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou</a>
<a id='line_3235'>first bring Michal Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.</a>
<a id='line_3236'></a>
<a id='line_3237'>3:14 And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul’s son, saying,</a>
<a id='line_3238'>Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred</a>
<a id='line_3239'>foreskins of the Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_3240'></a>
<a id='line_3241'>3:15 And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from</a>
<a id='line_3242'>Phaltiel the son of Laish.</a>
<a id='line_3243'></a>
<a id='line_3244'>3:16 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to</a>
<a id='line_3245'>Bahurim.</a>
<a id='line_3246'></a>
<a id='line_3247'>Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.</a>
<a id='line_3248'></a>
<a id='line_3249'>3:17 And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye</a>
<a id='line_3250'>sought for David in times past to be king over you: 3:18 Now then do</a>
<a id='line_3251'>it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my</a>
<a id='line_3252'>servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_3253'>Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</a>
<a id='line_3254'></a>
<a id='line_3255'>3:19 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also</a>
<a id='line_3256'>to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to</a>
<a id='line_3257'>Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.</a>
<a id='line_3258'></a>
<a id='line_3259'>3:20 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And</a>
<a id='line_3260'>David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.</a>
<a id='line_3261'></a>
<a id='line_3262'>3:21 And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather</a>
<a id='line_3263'>all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with</a>
<a id='line_3264'>thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth.</a>
<a id='line_3265'>And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</a>
<a id='line_3266'></a>
<a id='line_3267'>3:22 And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a</a>
<a id='line_3268'>troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with</a>
<a id='line_3269'>David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</a>
<a id='line_3270'></a>
<a id='line_3271'>3:23 When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told</a>
<a id='line_3272'>Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent</a>
<a id='line_3273'>him away, and he is gone in peace.</a>
<a id='line_3274'></a>
<a id='line_3275'>3:24 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?</a>
<a id='line_3276'>behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away,</a>
<a id='line_3277'>and he is quite gone?  3:25 Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he</a>
<a id='line_3278'>came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and</a>
<a id='line_3279'>to know all that thou doest.</a>
<a id='line_3280'></a>
<a id='line_3281'>3:26 And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after</a>
<a id='line_3282'>Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew</a>
<a id='line_3283'>it not.</a>
<a id='line_3284'></a>
<a id='line_3285'>3:27 And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the</a>
<a id='line_3286'>gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth</a>
<a id='line_3287'>rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</a>
<a id='line_3288'></a>
<a id='line_3289'>3:28 And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are</a>
<a id='line_3290'>guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of</a>
<a id='line_3291'>Ner: 3:29 Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father’s</a>
<a id='line_3292'>house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an</a>
<a id='line_3293'>issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth</a>
<a id='line_3294'>on the sword, or that lacketh bread.</a>
<a id='line_3295'></a>
<a id='line_3296'>3:30 So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain</a>
<a id='line_3297'>their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</a>
<a id='line_3298'></a>
<a id='line_3299'>3:31 And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him,</a>
<a id='line_3300'>Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before</a>
<a id='line_3301'>Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.</a>
<a id='line_3302'></a>
<a id='line_3303'>3:32 And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his</a>
<a id='line_3304'>voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</a>
<a id='line_3305'></a>
<a id='line_3306'>3:33 And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool</a>
<a id='line_3307'>dieth?  3:34 Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters:</a>
<a id='line_3308'>as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the</a>
<a id='line_3309'>people wept again over him.</a>
<a id='line_3310'></a>
<a id='line_3311'>3:35 And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it</a>
<a id='line_3312'>was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I</a>
<a id='line_3313'>taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.</a>
<a id='line_3314'></a>
<a id='line_3315'>3:36 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as</a>
<a id='line_3316'>whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.</a>
<a id='line_3317'></a>
<a id='line_3318'>3:37 For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was</a>
<a id='line_3319'>not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.</a>
<a id='line_3320'></a>
<a id='line_3321'>3:38 And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a</a>
<a id='line_3322'>prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?  3:39 And I am this</a>
<a id='line_3323'>day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be</a>
<a id='line_3324'>too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to</a>
<a id='line_3325'>his wickedness.</a>
<a id='line_3326'></a>
<a id='line_3327'>4:1 And when Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands</a>
<a id='line_3328'>were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.</a>
<a id='line_3329'></a>
<a id='line_3330'>4:2 And Saul’s son had two men that were captains of bands: the name</a>
<a id='line_3331'>of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of</a>
<a id='line_3332'>Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also</a>
<a id='line_3333'>was reckoned to Benjamin.</a>
<a id='line_3334'></a>
<a id='line_3335'>4:3 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there</a>
<a id='line_3336'>until this day.)  4:4 And Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son that was</a>
<a id='line_3337'>lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul</a>
<a id='line_3338'>and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and</a>
<a id='line_3339'>it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became</a>
<a id='line_3340'>lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</a>
<a id='line_3341'></a>
<a id='line_3342'>4:5 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went,</a>
<a id='line_3343'>and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay</a>
<a id='line_3344'>on a bed at noon.</a>
<a id='line_3345'></a>
<a id='line_3346'>4:6 And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they</a>
<a id='line_3347'>would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and</a>
<a id='line_3348'>Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</a>
<a id='line_3349'></a>
<a id='line_3350'>4:7 For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his</a>
<a id='line_3351'>bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and</a>
<a id='line_3352'>took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.</a>
<a id='line_3353'></a>
<a id='line_3354'>4:8 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and</a>
<a id='line_3355'>said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine</a>
<a id='line_3356'>enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the</a>
<a id='line_3357'>king this day of Saul, and of his seed.</a>
<a id='line_3358'></a>
<a id='line_3359'>4:9 And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of</a>
<a id='line_3360'>Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who</a>
<a id='line_3361'>hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, 4:10 When one told me,</a>
<a id='line_3362'>saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I</a>
<a id='line_3363'>took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would</a>
<a id='line_3364'>have given him a reward for his tidings: 4:11 How much more, when</a>
<a id='line_3365'>wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his</a>
<a id='line_3366'>bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and</a>
<a id='line_3367'>take you away from the earth?  4:12 And David commanded his young men,</a>
<a id='line_3368'>and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged</a>
<a id='line_3369'>them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth,</a>
<a id='line_3370'>and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.</a>
<a id='line_3371'></a>
<a id='line_3372'>5:1 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and</a>
<a id='line_3373'>spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</a>
<a id='line_3374'></a>
<a id='line_3375'>5:2 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that</a>
<a id='line_3376'>leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou</a>
<a id='line_3377'>shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3378'></a>
<a id='line_3379'>5:3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king</a>
<a id='line_3380'>David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they</a>
<a id='line_3381'>anointed David king over Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3382'></a>
<a id='line_3383'>5:4 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned</a>
<a id='line_3384'>forty years.</a>
<a id='line_3385'></a>
<a id='line_3386'>5:5 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in</a>
<a id='line_3387'>Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.</a>
<a id='line_3388'></a>
<a id='line_3389'>5:6 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the</a>
<a id='line_3390'>inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou</a>
<a id='line_3391'>take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither:</a>
<a id='line_3392'>thinking, David cannot come in hither.</a>
<a id='line_3393'></a>
<a id='line_3394'>5:7 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the</a>
<a id='line_3395'>city of David.</a>
<a id='line_3396'></a>
<a id='line_3397'>5:8 And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter,</a>
<a id='line_3398'>and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated</a>
<a id='line_3399'>of David’s soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said,</a>
<a id='line_3400'>The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</a>
<a id='line_3401'></a>
<a id='line_3402'>5:9 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And</a>
<a id='line_3403'>David built round about from Millo and inward.</a>
<a id='line_3404'></a>
<a id='line_3405'>5:10 And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was</a>
<a id='line_3406'>with him.</a>
<a id='line_3407'></a>
<a id='line_3408'>5:11 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees,</a>
<a id='line_3409'>and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.</a>
<a id='line_3410'></a>
<a id='line_3411'>5:12 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over</a>
<a id='line_3412'>Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s</a>
<a id='line_3413'>sake.</a>
<a id='line_3414'></a>
<a id='line_3415'>5:13 And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_3416'>after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters</a>
<a id='line_3417'>born to David.</a>
<a id='line_3418'></a>
<a id='line_3419'>5:14 And these be the names of those that were born unto him in</a>
<a id='line_3420'>Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, 5:15 Ibhar</a>
<a id='line_3421'>also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 5:16 And Elishama, and</a>
<a id='line_3422'>Eliada, and Eliphalet.</a>
<a id='line_3423'></a>
<a id='line_3424'>5:17 But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king</a>
<a id='line_3425'>over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David</a>
<a id='line_3426'>heard of it, and went down to the hold.</a>
<a id='line_3427'></a>
<a id='line_3428'>5:18 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of</a>
<a id='line_3429'>Rephaim.</a>
<a id='line_3430'></a>
<a id='line_3431'>5:19 And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the</a>
<a id='line_3432'>Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said</a>
<a id='line_3433'>unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into</a>
<a id='line_3434'>thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_3435'></a>
<a id='line_3436'>5:20 And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and</a>
<a id='line_3437'>said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the</a>
<a id='line_3438'>breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place</a>
<a id='line_3439'>Baalperazim.</a>
<a id='line_3440'></a>
<a id='line_3441'>5:21 And there they left their images, and David and his men burned</a>
<a id='line_3442'>them.</a>
<a id='line_3443'></a>
<a id='line_3444'>5:22 And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in</a>
<a id='line_3445'>the valley of Rephaim.</a>
<a id='line_3446'></a>
<a id='line_3447'>5:23 And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go</a>
<a id='line_3448'>up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against</a>
<a id='line_3449'>the mulberry trees.</a>
<a id='line_3450'></a>
<a id='line_3451'>5:24 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops</a>
<a id='line_3452'>of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then</a>
<a id='line_3453'>shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the</a>
<a id='line_3454'>Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_3455'></a>
<a id='line_3456'>5:25 And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the</a>
<a id='line_3457'>Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.</a>
<a id='line_3458'></a>
<a id='line_3459'>6:1 Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_3460'>thirty thousand.</a>
<a id='line_3461'></a>
<a id='line_3462'>6:2 And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him</a>
<a id='line_3463'>from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose</a>
<a id='line_3464'>name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between</a>
<a id='line_3465'>the cherubims.</a>
<a id='line_3466'></a>
<a id='line_3467'>6:3 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of</a>
<a id='line_3468'>the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons</a>
<a id='line_3469'>of Abinadab, drave the new cart.</a>
<a id='line_3470'></a>
<a id='line_3471'>6:4 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at</a>
<a id='line_3472'>Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.</a>
<a id='line_3473'></a>
<a id='line_3474'>6:5 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on</a>
<a id='line_3475'>all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on</a>
<a id='line_3476'>psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.</a>
<a id='line_3477'></a>
<a id='line_3478'>6:6 And when they came to Nachon’s threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his</a>
<a id='line_3479'>hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.</a>
<a id='line_3480'></a>
<a id='line_3481'>6:7 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote</a>
<a id='line_3482'>him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.</a>
<a id='line_3483'></a>
<a id='line_3484'>6:8 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon</a>
<a id='line_3485'>Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.</a>
<a id='line_3486'></a>
<a id='line_3487'>6:9 And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the</a>
<a id='line_3488'>ark of the LORD come to me?  6:10 So David would not remove the ark of</a>
<a id='line_3489'>the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside</a>
<a id='line_3490'>into the house of Obededom the Gittite.</a>
<a id='line_3491'></a>
<a id='line_3492'>6:11 And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the</a>
<a id='line_3493'>Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his</a>
<a id='line_3494'>household.</a>
<a id='line_3495'></a>
<a id='line_3496'>6:12 And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the</a>
<a id='line_3497'>house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the</a>
<a id='line_3498'>ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house</a>
<a id='line_3499'>of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.</a>
<a id='line_3500'></a>
<a id='line_3501'>6:13 And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had</a>
<a id='line_3502'>gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.</a>
<a id='line_3503'></a>
<a id='line_3504'>6:14 And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David</a>
<a id='line_3505'>was girded with a linen ephod.</a>
<a id='line_3506'></a>
<a id='line_3507'>6:15 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the</a>
<a id='line_3508'>LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.</a>
<a id='line_3509'></a>
<a id='line_3510'>6:16 And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal</a>
<a id='line_3511'>Saul’s daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping</a>
<a id='line_3512'>and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.</a>
<a id='line_3513'></a>
<a id='line_3514'>6:17 And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place,</a>
<a id='line_3515'>in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and</a>
<a id='line_3516'>David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3517'></a>
<a id='line_3518'>6:18 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings</a>
<a id='line_3519'>and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of</a>
<a id='line_3520'>hosts.</a>
<a id='line_3521'></a>
<a id='line_3522'>6:19 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude</a>
<a id='line_3523'>of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread,</a>
<a id='line_3524'>and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people</a>
<a id='line_3525'>departed every one to his house.</a>
<a id='line_3526'></a>
<a id='line_3527'>6:20 Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the</a>
<a id='line_3528'>daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was</a>
<a id='line_3529'>the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of</a>
<a id='line_3530'>the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly</a>
<a id='line_3531'>uncovereth himself!  6:21 And David said unto Michal, It was before</a>
<a id='line_3532'>the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house,</a>
<a id='line_3533'>to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel:</a>
<a id='line_3534'>therefore will I play before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3535'></a>
<a id='line_3536'>6:22 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine</a>
<a id='line_3537'>own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them</a>
<a id='line_3538'>shall I be had in honour.</a>
<a id='line_3539'></a>
<a id='line_3540'>6:23 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day</a>
<a id='line_3541'>of her death.</a>
<a id='line_3542'></a>
<a id='line_3543'>7:1 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3544'>had given him rest round about from all his enemies; 7:2 That the king</a>
<a id='line_3545'>said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar,</a>
<a id='line_3546'>but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.</a>
<a id='line_3547'></a>
<a id='line_3548'>7:3 And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart;</a>
<a id='line_3549'>for the LORD is with thee.</a>
<a id='line_3550'></a>
<a id='line_3551'>7:4 And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came</a>
<a id='line_3552'>unto Nathan, saying, 7:5 Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the</a>
<a id='line_3553'>LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?  7:6 Whereas I</a>
<a id='line_3554'>have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the</a>
<a id='line_3555'>children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in</a>
<a id='line_3556'>a tent and in a tabernacle.</a>
<a id='line_3557'></a>
<a id='line_3558'>7:7 In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of</a>
<a id='line_3559'>Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I</a>
<a id='line_3560'>commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an</a>
<a id='line_3561'>house of cedar?  7:8 Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant</a>
<a id='line_3562'>David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote,</a>
<a id='line_3563'>from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel: 7:9</a>
<a id='line_3564'>And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all</a>
<a id='line_3565'>thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like</a>
<a id='line_3566'>unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.</a>
<a id='line_3567'></a>
<a id='line_3568'>7:10 Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will</a>
<a id='line_3569'>plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no</a>
<a id='line_3570'>more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more,</a>
<a id='line_3571'>as beforetime, 7:11 And as since the time that I commanded judges to</a>
<a id='line_3572'>be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine</a>
<a id='line_3573'>enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.</a>
<a id='line_3574'></a>
<a id='line_3575'>7:12 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy</a>
<a id='line_3576'>fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of</a>
<a id='line_3577'>thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_3578'></a>
<a id='line_3579'>7:13 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the</a>
<a id='line_3580'>throne of his kingdom for ever.</a>
<a id='line_3581'></a>
<a id='line_3582'>7:14 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit</a>
<a id='line_3583'>iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes</a>
<a id='line_3584'>of the children of men: 7:15 But my mercy shall not depart away from</a>
<a id='line_3585'>him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.</a>
<a id='line_3586'></a>
<a id='line_3587'>7:16 And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever</a>
<a id='line_3588'>before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.</a>
<a id='line_3589'></a>
<a id='line_3590'>7:17 According to all these words, and according to all this vision,</a>
<a id='line_3591'>so did Nathan speak unto David.</a>
<a id='line_3592'></a>
<a id='line_3593'>7:18 Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,</a>
<a id='line_3594'>Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me</a>
<a id='line_3595'>hitherto?  7:19 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord</a>
<a id='line_3596'>GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great</a>
<a id='line_3597'>while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?  7:20 And</a>
<a id='line_3598'>what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy</a>
<a id='line_3599'>servant.</a>
<a id='line_3600'></a>
<a id='line_3601'>7:21 For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou</a>
<a id='line_3602'>done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.</a>
<a id='line_3603'></a>
<a id='line_3604'>7:22 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like</a>
<a id='line_3605'>thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we</a>
<a id='line_3606'>have heard with our ears.</a>
<a id='line_3607'></a>
<a id='line_3608'>7:23 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like</a>
<a id='line_3609'>Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make</a>
<a id='line_3610'>him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land,</a>
<a id='line_3611'>before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the</a>
<a id='line_3612'>nations and their gods?  7:24 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy</a>
<a id='line_3613'>people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art</a>
<a id='line_3614'>become their God.</a>
<a id='line_3615'></a>
<a id='line_3616'>7:25 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning</a>
<a id='line_3617'>thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do</a>
<a id='line_3618'>as thou hast said.</a>
<a id='line_3619'></a>
<a id='line_3620'>7:26 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts</a>
<a id='line_3621'>is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be</a>
<a id='line_3622'>established before thee.</a>
<a id='line_3623'></a>
<a id='line_3624'>7:27 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy</a>
<a id='line_3625'>servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy</a>
<a id='line_3626'>servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_3627'></a>
<a id='line_3628'>7:28 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,</a>
<a id='line_3629'>and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: 7:29 Therefore</a>
<a id='line_3630'>now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may</a>
<a id='line_3631'>continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it:</a>
<a id='line_3632'>and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for</a>
<a id='line_3633'>ever.</a>
<a id='line_3634'></a>
<a id='line_3635'>8:1 And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines,</a>
<a id='line_3636'>and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_3637'>Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_3638'></a>
<a id='line_3639'>8:2 And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them</a>
<a id='line_3640'>down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death,</a>
<a id='line_3641'>and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became</a>
<a id='line_3642'>David’s servants, and brought gifts.</a>
<a id='line_3643'></a>
<a id='line_3644'>8:3 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he</a>
<a id='line_3645'>went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.</a>
<a id='line_3646'></a>
<a id='line_3647'>8:4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred</a>
<a id='line_3648'>horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the</a>
<a id='line_3649'>chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.</a>
<a id='line_3650'></a>
<a id='line_3651'>8:5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of</a>
<a id='line_3652'>Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.</a>
<a id='line_3653'></a>
<a id='line_3654'>8:6 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians</a>
<a id='line_3655'>became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved</a>
<a id='line_3656'>David whithersoever he went.</a>
<a id='line_3657'></a>
<a id='line_3658'>8:7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of</a>
<a id='line_3659'>Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_3660'></a>
<a id='line_3661'>8:8 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David</a>
<a id='line_3662'>took exceeding much brass.</a>
<a id='line_3663'></a>
<a id='line_3664'>8:9 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host</a>
<a id='line_3665'>of Hadadezer, 8:10 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to</a>
<a id='line_3666'>salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer,</a>
<a id='line_3667'>and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought</a>
<a id='line_3668'>with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:</a>
<a id='line_3669'>8:11 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver</a>
<a id='line_3670'>and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued; 8:12</a>
<a id='line_3671'>Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the</a>
<a id='line_3672'>Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of</a>
<a id='line_3673'>Rehob, king of Zobah.</a>
<a id='line_3674'></a>
<a id='line_3675'>8:13 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the</a>
<a id='line_3676'>Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.</a>
<a id='line_3677'></a>
<a id='line_3678'>8:14 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he</a>
<a id='line_3679'>garrisons, and all they of Edom became David’s servants. And the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3680'>preserved David whithersoever he went.</a>
<a id='line_3681'></a>
<a id='line_3682'>8:15 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment</a>
<a id='line_3683'>and justice unto all his people.</a>
<a id='line_3684'></a>
<a id='line_3685'>8:16 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat</a>
<a id='line_3686'>the son of Ahilud was recorder; 8:17 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and</a>
<a id='line_3687'>Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the</a>
<a id='line_3688'>scribe; 8:18 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the</a>
<a id='line_3689'>Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief rulers.</a>
<a id='line_3690'></a>
<a id='line_3691'>9:1 And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of</a>
<a id='line_3692'>Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?  9:2 And there</a>
<a id='line_3693'>was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they</a>
<a id='line_3694'>had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba?  And</a>
<a id='line_3695'>he said, Thy servant is he.</a>
<a id='line_3696'></a>
<a id='line_3697'>9:3 And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that</a>
<a id='line_3698'>I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king,</a>
<a id='line_3699'>Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.</a>
<a id='line_3700'></a>
<a id='line_3701'>9:4 And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the</a>
<a id='line_3702'>king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in</a>
<a id='line_3703'>Lodebar.</a>
<a id='line_3704'></a>
<a id='line_3705'>9:5 Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir,</a>
<a id='line_3706'>the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.</a>
<a id='line_3707'></a>
<a id='line_3708'>9:6 Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was</a>
<a id='line_3709'>come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David</a>
<a id='line_3710'>said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!  9:7 And</a>
<a id='line_3711'>David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness</a>
<a id='line_3712'>for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and will restore thee all the land of</a>
<a id='line_3713'>Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.</a>
<a id='line_3714'></a>
<a id='line_3715'>9:8 And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou</a>
<a id='line_3716'>shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?  9:9 Then the king called</a>
<a id='line_3717'>to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy</a>
<a id='line_3718'>master’s son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.</a>
<a id='line_3719'></a>
<a id='line_3720'>9:10 Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the</a>
<a id='line_3721'>land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master’s</a>
<a id='line_3722'>son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master’s son shall eat</a>
<a id='line_3723'>bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty</a>
<a id='line_3724'>servants.</a>
<a id='line_3725'></a>
<a id='line_3726'>9:11 Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the</a>
<a id='line_3727'>king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for</a>
<a id='line_3728'>Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the</a>
<a id='line_3729'>king’s sons.</a>
<a id='line_3730'></a>
<a id='line_3731'>9:12 And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all</a>
<a id='line_3732'>that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.</a>
<a id='line_3733'></a>
<a id='line_3734'>9:13 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at</a>
<a id='line_3735'>the king’s table; and was lame on both his feet.</a>
<a id='line_3736'></a>
<a id='line_3737'>10:1 And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of</a>
<a id='line_3738'>Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_3739'></a>
<a id='line_3740'>10:2 Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of</a>
<a id='line_3741'>Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to</a>
<a id='line_3742'>comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David’s</a>
<a id='line_3743'>servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.</a>
<a id='line_3744'></a>
<a id='line_3745'>10:3 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their</a>
<a id='line_3746'>lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath</a>
<a id='line_3747'>sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants</a>
<a id='line_3748'>unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?</a>
<a id='line_3749'>10:4 Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off the one</a>
<a id='line_3750'>half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even</a>
<a id='line_3751'>to their buttocks, and sent them away.</a>
<a id='line_3752'></a>
<a id='line_3753'>10:5 When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the</a>
<a id='line_3754'>men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until</a>
<a id='line_3755'>your beards be grown, and then return.</a>
<a id='line_3756'></a>
<a id='line_3757'>10:6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David,</a>
<a id='line_3758'>the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the</a>
<a id='line_3759'>Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a</a>
<a id='line_3760'>thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.</a>
<a id='line_3761'></a>
<a id='line_3762'>10:7 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the</a>
<a id='line_3763'>mighty men.</a>
<a id='line_3764'></a>
<a id='line_3765'>10:8 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array</a>
<a id='line_3766'>at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob,</a>
<a id='line_3767'>and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.</a>
<a id='line_3768'></a>
<a id='line_3769'>10:9 When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before</a>
<a id='line_3770'>and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in</a>
<a id='line_3771'>array against the Syrians: 10:10 And the rest of the people he</a>
<a id='line_3772'>delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them</a>
<a id='line_3773'>in array against the children of Ammon.</a>
<a id='line_3774'></a>
<a id='line_3775'>10:11 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou</a>
<a id='line_3776'>shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee,</a>
<a id='line_3777'>then I will come and help thee.</a>
<a id='line_3778'></a>
<a id='line_3779'>10:12 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and</a>
<a id='line_3780'>for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him</a>
<a id='line_3781'>good.</a>
<a id='line_3782'></a>
<a id='line_3783'>10:13 And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the</a>
<a id='line_3784'>battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.</a>
<a id='line_3785'></a>
<a id='line_3786'>10:14 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,</a>
<a id='line_3787'>then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab</a>
<a id='line_3788'>returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_3789'></a>
<a id='line_3790'>10:15 And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel,</a>
<a id='line_3791'>they gathered themselves together.</a>
<a id='line_3792'></a>
<a id='line_3793'>10:16 And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond</a>
<a id='line_3794'>the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host</a>
<a id='line_3795'>of Hadarezer went before them.</a>
<a id='line_3796'></a>
<a id='line_3797'>10:17 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and</a>
<a id='line_3798'>passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves</a>
<a id='line_3799'>in array against David, and fought with him.</a>
<a id='line_3800'></a>
<a id='line_3801'>10:18 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of</a>
<a id='line_3802'>seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen,</a>
<a id='line_3803'>and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.</a>
<a id='line_3804'></a>
<a id='line_3805'>10:19 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that</a>
<a id='line_3806'>they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and</a>
<a id='line_3807'>served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any</a>
<a id='line_3808'>more.</a>
<a id='line_3809'></a>
<a id='line_3810'>11:1 And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when</a>
<a id='line_3811'>kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with</a>
<a id='line_3812'>him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and</a>
<a id='line_3813'>besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_3814'></a>
<a id='line_3815'>11:2 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off</a>
<a id='line_3816'>his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the</a>
<a id='line_3817'>roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful</a>
<a id='line_3818'>to look upon.</a>
<a id='line_3819'></a>
<a id='line_3820'>11:3 And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not</a>
<a id='line_3821'>this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?</a>
<a id='line_3822'>11:4 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto</a>
<a id='line_3823'>him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness:</a>
<a id='line_3824'>and she returned unto her house.</a>
<a id='line_3825'></a>
<a id='line_3826'>11:5 And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am</a>
<a id='line_3827'>with child.</a>
<a id='line_3828'></a>
<a id='line_3829'>11:6 And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And</a>
<a id='line_3830'>Joab sent Uriah to David.</a>
<a id='line_3831'></a>
<a id='line_3832'>11:7 And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab</a>
<a id='line_3833'>did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.</a>
<a id='line_3834'></a>
<a id='line_3835'>11:8 And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.</a>
<a id='line_3836'>And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and there followed him a</a>
<a id='line_3837'>mess of meat from the king.</a>
<a id='line_3838'></a>
<a id='line_3839'>11:9 But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the</a>
<a id='line_3840'>servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.</a>
<a id='line_3841'></a>
<a id='line_3842'>11:10 And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto</a>
<a id='line_3843'>his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey?</a>
<a id='line_3844'>why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?  11:11 And Uriah</a>
<a id='line_3845'>said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and</a>
<a id='line_3846'>my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open</a>
<a id='line_3847'>fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to</a>
<a id='line_3848'>lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not</a>
<a id='line_3849'>do this thing.</a>
<a id='line_3850'></a>
<a id='line_3851'>11:12 And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I</a>
<a id='line_3852'>will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the</a>
<a id='line_3853'>morrow.</a>
<a id='line_3854'></a>
<a id='line_3855'>11:13 And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him;</a>
<a id='line_3856'>and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with</a>
<a id='line_3857'>the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.</a>
<a id='line_3858'></a>
<a id='line_3859'>11:14 And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to</a>
<a id='line_3860'>Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</a>
<a id='line_3861'></a>
<a id='line_3862'>11:15 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the</a>
<a id='line_3863'>forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may</a>
<a id='line_3864'>be smitten, and die.</a>
<a id='line_3865'></a>
<a id='line_3866'>11:16 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he</a>
<a id='line_3867'>assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.</a>
<a id='line_3868'></a>
<a id='line_3869'>11:17 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and</a>
<a id='line_3870'>there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the</a>
<a id='line_3871'>Hittite died also.</a>
<a id='line_3872'></a>
<a id='line_3873'>11:18 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;</a>
<a id='line_3874'>11:19 And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of</a>
<a id='line_3875'>telling the matters of the war unto the king, 11:20 And if so be that</a>
<a id='line_3876'>the king’s wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye</a>
<a id='line_3877'>so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would</a>
<a id='line_3878'>shoot from the wall?  11:21 Who smote Abimelech the son of</a>
<a id='line_3879'>Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him</a>
<a id='line_3880'>from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then</a>
<a id='line_3881'>say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</a>
<a id='line_3882'></a>
<a id='line_3883'>11:22 So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab</a>
<a id='line_3884'>had sent him for.</a>
<a id='line_3885'></a>
<a id='line_3886'>11:23 And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed</a>
<a id='line_3887'>against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them</a>
<a id='line_3888'>even unto the entering of the gate.</a>
<a id='line_3889'></a>
<a id='line_3890'>11:24 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and</a>
<a id='line_3891'>some of the king’s servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite</a>
<a id='line_3892'>is dead also.</a>
<a id='line_3893'></a>
<a id='line_3894'>11:25 Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto</a>
<a id='line_3895'>Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one</a>
<a id='line_3896'>as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and</a>
<a id='line_3897'>overthrow it: and encourage thou him.</a>
<a id='line_3898'></a>
<a id='line_3899'>11:26 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was</a>
<a id='line_3900'>dead, she mourned for her husband.</a>
<a id='line_3901'></a>
<a id='line_3902'>11:27 And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to</a>
<a id='line_3903'>his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing</a>
<a id='line_3904'>that David had done displeased the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3905'></a>
<a id='line_3906'>12:1 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and</a>
<a id='line_3907'>said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the</a>
<a id='line_3908'>other poor.</a>
<a id='line_3909'></a>
<a id='line_3910'>12:2 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds: 12:3 But the</a>
<a id='line_3911'>poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought</a>
<a id='line_3912'>and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his</a>
<a id='line_3913'>children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and</a>
<a id='line_3914'>lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.</a>
<a id='line_3915'></a>
<a id='line_3916'>12:4 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to</a>
<a id='line_3917'>take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring</a>
<a id='line_3918'>man that was come unto him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed</a>
<a id='line_3919'>it for the man that was come to him.</a>
<a id='line_3920'></a>
<a id='line_3921'>12:5 And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he</a>
<a id='line_3922'>said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing</a>
<a id='line_3923'>shall surely die: 12:6 And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because</a>
<a id='line_3924'>he did this thing, and because he had no pity.</a>
<a id='line_3925'></a>
<a id='line_3926'>12:7 And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3927'>God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee</a>
<a id='line_3928'>out of the hand of Saul; 12:8 And I gave thee thy master’s house, and</a>
<a id='line_3929'>thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel</a>
<a id='line_3930'>and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have</a>
<a id='line_3931'>given unto thee such and such things.</a>
<a id='line_3932'></a>
<a id='line_3933'>12:9 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do</a>
<a id='line_3934'>evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword,</a>
<a id='line_3935'>and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the</a>
<a id='line_3936'>sword of the children of Ammon.</a>
<a id='line_3937'></a>
<a id='line_3938'>12:10 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;</a>
<a id='line_3939'>because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the</a>
<a id='line_3940'>Hittite to be thy wife.</a>
<a id='line_3941'></a>
<a id='line_3942'>12:11 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee</a>
<a id='line_3943'>out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes,</a>
<a id='line_3944'>and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in</a>
<a id='line_3945'>the sight of this sun.</a>
<a id='line_3946'></a>
<a id='line_3947'>12:12 For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all</a>
<a id='line_3948'>Israel, and before the sun.</a>
<a id='line_3949'></a>
<a id='line_3950'>12:13 And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And</a>
<a id='line_3951'>Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou</a>
<a id='line_3952'>shalt not die.</a>
<a id='line_3953'></a>
<a id='line_3954'>12:14 Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to</a>
<a id='line_3955'>the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto</a>
<a id='line_3956'>thee shall surely die.</a>
<a id='line_3957'></a>
<a id='line_3958'>12:15 And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the</a>
<a id='line_3959'>child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.</a>
<a id='line_3960'></a>
<a id='line_3961'>12:16 David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted,</a>
<a id='line_3962'>and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_3963'></a>
<a id='line_3964'>12:17 And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him</a>
<a id='line_3965'>up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with</a>
<a id='line_3966'>them.</a>
<a id='line_3967'></a>
<a id='line_3968'>12:18 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And</a>
<a id='line_3969'>the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for</a>
<a id='line_3970'>they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him,</a>
<a id='line_3971'>and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself,</a>
<a id='line_3972'>if we tell him that the child is dead?  12:19 But when David saw that</a>
<a id='line_3973'>his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead:</a>
<a id='line_3974'>therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they</a>
<a id='line_3975'>said, He is dead.</a>
<a id='line_3976'></a>
<a id='line_3977'>12:20 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed</a>
<a id='line_3978'>himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_3979'>and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required,</a>
<a id='line_3980'>they set bread before him, and he did eat.</a>
<a id='line_3981'></a>
<a id='line_3982'>12:21 Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou</a>
<a id='line_3983'>hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive;</a>
<a id='line_3984'>but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.</a>
<a id='line_3985'></a>
<a id='line_3986'>12:22 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:</a>
<a id='line_3987'>for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the</a>
<a id='line_3988'>child may live?  12:23 But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast?</a>
<a id='line_3989'>can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return</a>
<a id='line_3990'>to me.</a>
<a id='line_3991'></a>
<a id='line_3992'>12:24 And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her,</a>
<a id='line_3993'>and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon:</a>
<a id='line_3994'>and the LORD loved him.</a>
<a id='line_3995'></a>
<a id='line_3996'>12:25 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his</a>
<a id='line_3997'>name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3998'></a>
<a id='line_3999'>12:26 And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and</a>
<a id='line_4000'>took the royal city.</a>
<a id='line_4001'></a>
<a id='line_4002'>12:27 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought</a>
<a id='line_4003'>against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.</a>
<a id='line_4004'></a>
<a id='line_4005'>12:28 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp</a>
<a id='line_4006'>against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called</a>
<a id='line_4007'>after my name.</a>
<a id='line_4008'></a>
<a id='line_4009'>12:29 And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah,</a>
<a id='line_4010'>and fought against it, and took it.</a>
<a id='line_4011'></a>
<a id='line_4012'>12:30 And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight</a>
<a id='line_4013'>whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set</a>
<a id='line_4014'>on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great</a>
<a id='line_4015'>abundance.</a>
<a id='line_4016'></a>
<a id='line_4017'>12:31 And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them</a>
<a id='line_4018'>under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and</a>
<a id='line_4019'>made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the</a>
<a id='line_4020'>cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned</a>
<a id='line_4021'>unto Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_4022'></a>
<a id='line_4023'>13:1 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had</a>
<a id='line_4024'>a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved</a>
<a id='line_4025'>her.</a>
<a id='line_4026'></a>
<a id='line_4027'>13:2 And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar;</a>
<a id='line_4028'>for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything</a>
<a id='line_4029'>to her.</a>
<a id='line_4030'></a>
<a id='line_4031'>13:3 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of</a>
<a id='line_4032'>Shimeah David’s brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.</a>
<a id='line_4033'></a>
<a id='line_4034'>13:4 And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king’s son, lean</a>
<a id='line_4035'>from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I</a>
<a id='line_4036'>love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.</a>
<a id='line_4037'></a>
<a id='line_4038'>13:5 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make</a>
<a id='line_4039'>thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I</a>
<a id='line_4040'>pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the</a>
<a id='line_4041'>meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.</a>
<a id='line_4042'></a>
<a id='line_4043'>13:6 So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was</a>
<a id='line_4044'>come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my</a>
<a id='line_4045'>sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat</a>
<a id='line_4046'>at her hand.</a>
<a id='line_4047'></a>
<a id='line_4048'>13:7 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother</a>
<a id='line_4049'>Amnon’s house, and dress him meat.</a>
<a id='line_4050'></a>
<a id='line_4051'>13:8 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down.</a>
<a id='line_4052'>And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and</a>
<a id='line_4053'>did bake the cakes.</a>
<a id='line_4054'></a>
<a id='line_4055'>13:9 And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he</a>
<a id='line_4056'>refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they</a>
<a id='line_4057'>went out every man from him.</a>
<a id='line_4058'></a>
<a id='line_4059'>13:10 And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that</a>
<a id='line_4060'>I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made,</a>
<a id='line_4061'>and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</a>
<a id='line_4062'></a>
<a id='line_4063'>13:11 And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of</a>
<a id='line_4064'>her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.</a>
<a id='line_4065'></a>
<a id='line_4066'>13:12 And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no</a>
<a id='line_4067'>such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.</a>
<a id='line_4068'></a>
<a id='line_4069'>13:13 And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee,</a>
<a id='line_4070'>thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray</a>
<a id='line_4071'>thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.</a>
<a id='line_4072'></a>
<a id='line_4073'>13:14 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger</a>
<a id='line_4074'>than she, forced her, and lay with her.</a>
<a id='line_4075'></a>
<a id='line_4076'>13:15 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith</a>
<a id='line_4077'>he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And</a>
<a id='line_4078'>Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</a>
<a id='line_4079'></a>
<a id='line_4080'>13:16 And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending</a>
<a id='line_4081'>me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he</a>
<a id='line_4082'>would not hearken unto her.</a>
<a id='line_4083'></a>
<a id='line_4084'>13:17 Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said,</a>
<a id='line_4085'>Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.</a>
<a id='line_4086'></a>
<a id='line_4087'>13:18 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such</a>
<a id='line_4088'>robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his</a>
<a id='line_4089'>servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</a>
<a id='line_4090'></a>
<a id='line_4091'>13:19 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers</a>
<a id='line_4092'>colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on</a>
<a id='line_4093'>crying.</a>
<a id='line_4094'></a>
<a id='line_4095'>13:20 And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother</a>
<a id='line_4096'>been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother;</a>
<a id='line_4097'>regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother</a>
<a id='line_4098'>Absalom’s house.</a>
<a id='line_4099'></a>
<a id='line_4100'>13:21 But when king David heard of all these things, he was very</a>
<a id='line_4101'>wroth.</a>
<a id='line_4102'></a>
<a id='line_4103'>13:22 And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad:</a>
<a id='line_4104'>for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</a>
<a id='line_4105'></a>
<a id='line_4106'>13:23 And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had</a>
<a id='line_4107'>sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom</a>
<a id='line_4108'>invited all the king’s sons.</a>
<a id='line_4109'></a>
<a id='line_4110'>13:24 And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant</a>
<a id='line_4111'>hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go</a>
<a id='line_4112'>with thy servant.</a>
<a id='line_4113'></a>
<a id='line_4114'>13:25 And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now</a>
<a id='line_4115'>go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he</a>
<a id='line_4116'>would not go, but blessed him.</a>
<a id='line_4117'></a>
<a id='line_4118'>13:26 Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go</a>
<a id='line_4119'>with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?</a>
<a id='line_4120'>13:27 But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king’s</a>
<a id='line_4121'>sons go with him.</a>
<a id='line_4122'></a>
<a id='line_4123'>13:28 Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when</a>
<a id='line_4124'>Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite</a>
<a id='line_4125'>Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be</a>
<a id='line_4126'>courageous, and be valiant.</a>
<a id='line_4127'></a>
<a id='line_4128'>13:29 And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had</a>
<a id='line_4129'>commanded.</a>
<a id='line_4130'></a>
<a id='line_4131'>Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his</a>
<a id='line_4132'>mule, and fled.</a>
<a id='line_4133'></a>
<a id='line_4134'>13:30 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings</a>
<a id='line_4135'>came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and</a>
<a id='line_4136'>there is not one of them left.</a>
<a id='line_4137'></a>
<a id='line_4138'>13:31 Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the</a>
<a id='line_4139'>earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.</a>
<a id='line_4140'></a>
<a id='line_4141'>13:32 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and</a>
<a id='line_4142'>said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men</a>
<a id='line_4143'>the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of</a>
<a id='line_4144'>Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his</a>
<a id='line_4145'>sister Tamar.</a>
<a id='line_4146'></a>
<a id='line_4147'>13:33 Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his</a>
<a id='line_4148'>heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead: for Amnon only is</a>
<a id='line_4149'>dead.</a>
<a id='line_4150'></a>
<a id='line_4151'>13:34 But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted</a>
<a id='line_4152'>up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the</a>
<a id='line_4153'>way of the hill side behind him.</a>
<a id='line_4154'></a>
<a id='line_4155'>13:35 And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons come: as</a>
<a id='line_4156'>thy servant said, so it is.</a>
<a id='line_4157'></a>
<a id='line_4158'>13:36 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking,</a>
<a id='line_4159'>that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and</a>
<a id='line_4160'>wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</a>
<a id='line_4161'></a>
<a id='line_4162'>13:37 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king</a>
<a id='line_4163'>of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.</a>
<a id='line_4164'></a>
<a id='line_4165'>13:38 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</a>
<a id='line_4166'></a>
<a id='line_4167'>13:39 And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for</a>
<a id='line_4168'>he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</a>
<a id='line_4169'></a>
<a id='line_4170'>14:1 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was</a>
<a id='line_4171'>toward Absalom.</a>
<a id='line_4172'></a>
<a id='line_4173'>14:2 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and</a>
<a id='line_4174'>said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on</a>
<a id='line_4175'>now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a</a>
<a id='line_4176'>woman that had a long time mourned for the dead: 14:3 And come to the</a>
<a id='line_4177'>king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her</a>
<a id='line_4178'>mouth.</a>
<a id='line_4179'></a>
<a id='line_4180'>14:4 And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her</a>
<a id='line_4181'>face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.</a>
<a id='line_4182'></a>
<a id='line_4183'>14:5 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I</a>
<a id='line_4184'>am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.</a>
<a id='line_4185'></a>
<a id='line_4186'>14:6 And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in</a>
<a id='line_4187'>the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the</a>
<a id='line_4188'>other, and slew him.</a>
<a id='line_4189'></a>
<a id='line_4190'>14:7 And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid,</a>
<a id='line_4191'>and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill</a>
<a id='line_4192'>him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the</a>
<a id='line_4193'>heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall</a>
<a id='line_4194'>not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_4195'></a>
<a id='line_4196'>14:8 And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will</a>
<a id='line_4197'>give charge concerning thee.</a>
<a id='line_4198'></a>
<a id='line_4199'>14:9 And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the</a>
<a id='line_4200'>iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house: and the king and his</a>
<a id='line_4201'>throne be guiltless.</a>
<a id='line_4202'></a>
<a id='line_4203'>14:10 And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to</a>
<a id='line_4204'>me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</a>
<a id='line_4205'></a>
<a id='line_4206'>14:11 Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy</a>
<a id='line_4207'>God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy</a>
<a id='line_4208'>any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth,</a>
<a id='line_4209'>there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_4210'></a>
<a id='line_4211'>14:12 Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one</a>
<a id='line_4212'>word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.</a>
<a id='line_4213'></a>
<a id='line_4214'>14:13 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a</a>
<a id='line_4215'>thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as</a>
<a id='line_4216'>one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his</a>
<a id='line_4217'>banished.</a>
<a id='line_4218'></a>
<a id='line_4219'>14:14 For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground,</a>
<a id='line_4220'>which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any</a>
<a id='line_4221'>person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled</a>
<a id='line_4222'>from him.</a>
<a id='line_4223'></a>
<a id='line_4224'>14:15 Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord</a>
<a id='line_4225'>the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy</a>
<a id='line_4226'>handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king</a>
<a id='line_4227'>will perform the request of his handmaid.</a>
<a id='line_4228'></a>
<a id='line_4229'>14:16 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand</a>
<a id='line_4230'>of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the</a>
<a id='line_4231'>inheritance of God.</a>
<a id='line_4232'></a>
<a id='line_4233'>14:17 Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now</a>
<a id='line_4234'>be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to</a>
<a id='line_4235'>discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.</a>
<a id='line_4236'></a>
<a id='line_4237'>14:18 Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from</a>
<a id='line_4238'>me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said,</a>
<a id='line_4239'>Let my lord the king now speak.</a>
<a id='line_4240'></a>
<a id='line_4241'>14:19 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all</a>
<a id='line_4242'>this?  And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord</a>
<a id='line_4243'>the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought</a>
<a id='line_4244'>that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me,</a>
<a id='line_4245'>and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid: 14:20 To</a>
<a id='line_4246'>fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing:</a>
<a id='line_4247'>and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to</a>
<a id='line_4248'>know all things that are in the earth.</a>
<a id='line_4249'></a>
<a id='line_4250'>14:21 And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing:</a>
<a id='line_4251'>go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.</a>
<a id='line_4252'></a>
<a id='line_4253'>14:22 And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and</a>
<a id='line_4254'>thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I</a>
<a id='line_4255'>have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath</a>
<a id='line_4256'>fulfilled the request of his servant.</a>
<a id='line_4257'></a>
<a id='line_4258'>14:23 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to</a>
<a id='line_4259'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_4260'></a>
<a id='line_4261'>14:24 And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him</a>
<a id='line_4262'>not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the</a>
<a id='line_4263'>king’s face.</a>
<a id='line_4264'></a>
<a id='line_4265'>14:25 But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as</a>
<a id='line_4266'>Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of</a>
<a id='line_4267'>his head there was no blemish in him.</a>
<a id='line_4268'></a>
<a id='line_4269'>14:26 And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year’s end</a>
<a id='line_4270'>that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he</a>
<a id='line_4271'>polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels</a>
<a id='line_4272'>after the king’s weight.</a>
<a id='line_4273'></a>
<a id='line_4274'>14:27 And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,</a>
<a id='line_4275'>whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.</a>
<a id='line_4276'></a>
<a id='line_4277'>14:28 So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the</a>
<a id='line_4278'>king’s face.</a>
<a id='line_4279'></a>
<a id='line_4280'>14:29 Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king;</a>
<a id='line_4281'>but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time,</a>
<a id='line_4282'>he would not come.</a>
<a id='line_4283'></a>
<a id='line_4284'>14:30 Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near</a>
<a id='line_4285'>mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s</a>
<a id='line_4286'>servants set the field on fire.</a>
<a id='line_4287'></a>
<a id='line_4288'>14:31 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said</a>
<a id='line_4289'>unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?  14:32 And</a>
<a id='line_4290'>Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither,</a>
<a id='line_4291'>that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from</a>
<a id='line_4292'>Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now</a>
<a id='line_4293'>therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there be any iniquity in</a>
<a id='line_4294'>me, let him kill me.</a>
<a id='line_4295'></a>
<a id='line_4296'>14:33 So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called</a>
<a id='line_4297'>for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the</a>
<a id='line_4298'>ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.</a>
<a id='line_4299'></a>
<a id='line_4300'>15:1 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him</a>
<a id='line_4301'>chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</a>
<a id='line_4302'></a>
<a id='line_4303'>15:2 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate:</a>
<a id='line_4304'>and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the</a>
<a id='line_4305'>king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what</a>
<a id='line_4306'>city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of</a>
<a id='line_4307'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4308'></a>
<a id='line_4309'>15:3 And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right;</a>
<a id='line_4310'>but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.</a>
<a id='line_4311'></a>
<a id='line_4312'>15:4 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,</a>
<a id='line_4313'>that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I</a>
<a id='line_4314'>would do him justice!  15:5 And it was so, that when any man came nigh</a>
<a id='line_4315'>to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and</a>
<a id='line_4316'>kissed him.</a>
<a id='line_4317'></a>
<a id='line_4318'>15:6 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the</a>
<a id='line_4319'>king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4320'></a>
<a id='line_4321'>15:7 And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the</a>
<a id='line_4322'>king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto</a>
<a id='line_4323'>the LORD, in Hebron.</a>
<a id='line_4324'></a>
<a id='line_4325'>15:8 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,</a>
<a id='line_4326'>saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I</a>
<a id='line_4327'>will serve the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4328'></a>
<a id='line_4329'>15:9 And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to</a>
<a id='line_4330'>Hebron.</a>
<a id='line_4331'></a>
<a id='line_4332'>15:10 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_4333'>saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall</a>
<a id='line_4334'>say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</a>
<a id='line_4335'></a>
<a id='line_4336'>15:11 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that</a>
<a id='line_4337'>were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any</a>
<a id='line_4338'>thing.</a>
<a id='line_4339'></a>
<a id='line_4340'>15:12 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s</a>
<a id='line_4341'>counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered</a>
<a id='line_4342'>sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased</a>
<a id='line_4343'>continually with Absalom.</a>
<a id='line_4344'></a>
<a id='line_4345'>15:13 And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the</a>
<a id='line_4346'>men of Israel are after Absalom.</a>
<a id='line_4347'></a>
<a id='line_4348'>15:14 And David said unto all his servants that were with him at</a>
<a id='line_4349'>Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from</a>
<a id='line_4350'>Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring</a>
<a id='line_4351'>evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</a>
<a id='line_4352'></a>
<a id='line_4353'>15:15 And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants</a>
<a id='line_4354'>are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.</a>
<a id='line_4355'></a>
<a id='line_4356'>15:16 And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And</a>
<a id='line_4357'>the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.</a>
<a id='line_4358'></a>
<a id='line_4359'>15:17 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and</a>
<a id='line_4360'>tarried in a place that was far off.</a>
<a id='line_4361'></a>
<a id='line_4362'>15:18 And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the</a>
<a id='line_4363'>Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred</a>
<a id='line_4364'>men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</a>
<a id='line_4365'></a>
<a id='line_4366'>15:19 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou</a>
<a id='line_4367'>also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou</a>
<a id='line_4368'>art a stranger, and also an exile.</a>
<a id='line_4369'></a>
<a id='line_4370'>15:20 Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee</a>
<a id='line_4371'>go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and</a>
<a id='line_4372'>take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.</a>
<a id='line_4373'></a>
<a id='line_4374'>15:21 And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and</a>
<a id='line_4375'>as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king</a>
<a id='line_4376'>shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant</a>
<a id='line_4377'>be.</a>
<a id='line_4378'></a>
<a id='line_4379'>15:22 And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite</a>
<a id='line_4380'>passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with</a>
<a id='line_4381'>him.</a>
<a id='line_4382'></a>
<a id='line_4383'>15:23 And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people</a>
<a id='line_4384'>passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and</a>
<a id='line_4385'>all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_4386'></a>
<a id='line_4387'>15:24 And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing</a>
<a id='line_4388'>the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and</a>
<a id='line_4389'>Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the</a>
<a id='line_4390'>city.</a>
<a id='line_4391'></a>
<a id='line_4392'>15:25 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the</a>
<a id='line_4393'>city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me</a>
<a id='line_4394'>again, and shew me both it, and his habitation: 15:26 But if he thus</a>
<a id='line_4395'>say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as</a>
<a id='line_4396'>seemeth good unto him.</a>
<a id='line_4397'></a>
<a id='line_4398'>15:27 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?</a>
<a id='line_4399'>return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy</a>
<a id='line_4400'>son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</a>
<a id='line_4401'></a>
<a id='line_4402'>15:28 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there</a>
<a id='line_4403'>come word from you to certify me.</a>
<a id='line_4404'></a>
<a id='line_4405'>15:29 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to</a>
<a id='line_4406'>Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</a>
<a id='line_4407'></a>
<a id='line_4408'>15:30 And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he</a>
<a id='line_4409'>went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the</a>
<a id='line_4410'>people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up,</a>
<a id='line_4411'>weeping as they went up.</a>
<a id='line_4412'></a>
<a id='line_4413'>15:31 And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators</a>
<a id='line_4414'>with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of</a>
<a id='line_4415'>Ahithophel into foolishness.</a>
<a id='line_4416'></a>
<a id='line_4417'>15:32 And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the</a>
<a id='line_4418'>mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to</a>
<a id='line_4419'>meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head: 15:33 Unto whom</a>
<a id='line_4420'>David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden</a>
<a id='line_4421'>unto me: 15:34 But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I</a>
<a id='line_4422'>will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father’s servant</a>
<a id='line_4423'>hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me</a>
<a id='line_4424'>defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</a>
<a id='line_4425'></a>
<a id='line_4426'>15:35 And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the</a>
<a id='line_4427'>priests?  therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_4428'>hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar</a>
<a id='line_4429'>the priests.</a>
<a id='line_4430'></a>
<a id='line_4431'>15:36 Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz</a>
<a id='line_4432'>Zadok’s son, and Jonathan Abiathar’s son; and by them ye shall send</a>
<a id='line_4433'>unto me every thing that ye can hear.</a>
<a id='line_4434'></a>
<a id='line_4435'>15:37 So Hushai David’s friend came into the city, and Absalom came</a>
<a id='line_4436'>into Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_4437'></a>
<a id='line_4438'>16:1 And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold,</a>
<a id='line_4439'>Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses</a>
<a id='line_4440'>saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred</a>
<a id='line_4441'>bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of</a>
<a id='line_4442'>wine.</a>
<a id='line_4443'></a>
<a id='line_4444'>16:2 And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba</a>
<a id='line_4445'>said, The asses be for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread</a>
<a id='line_4446'>and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as</a>
<a id='line_4447'>be faint in the wilderness may drink.</a>
<a id='line_4448'></a>
<a id='line_4449'>16:3 And the king said, And where is thy master’s son? And Ziba said</a>
<a id='line_4450'>unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day</a>
<a id='line_4451'>shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</a>
<a id='line_4452'></a>
<a id='line_4453'>16:4 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained</a>
<a id='line_4454'>unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may</a>
<a id='line_4455'>find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.</a>
<a id='line_4456'></a>
<a id='line_4457'>16:5 And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a</a>
<a id='line_4458'>man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son</a>
<a id='line_4459'>of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.</a>
<a id='line_4460'></a>
<a id='line_4461'>16:6 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king</a>
<a id='line_4462'>David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right</a>
<a id='line_4463'>hand and on his left.</a>
<a id='line_4464'></a>
<a id='line_4465'>16:7 And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou</a>
<a id='line_4466'>bloody man, and thou man of Belial: 16:8 The LORD hath returned upon</a>
<a id='line_4467'>thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast</a>
<a id='line_4468'>reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of</a>
<a id='line_4469'>Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because</a>
<a id='line_4470'>thou art a bloody man.</a>
<a id='line_4471'></a>
<a id='line_4472'>16:9 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should</a>
<a id='line_4473'>this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and</a>
<a id='line_4474'>take off his head.</a>
<a id='line_4475'></a>
<a id='line_4476'>16:10 And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of</a>
<a id='line_4477'>Zeruiah?  so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse</a>
<a id='line_4478'>David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?  16:11 And</a>
<a id='line_4479'>David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which</a>
<a id='line_4480'>came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this</a>
<a id='line_4481'>Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath</a>
<a id='line_4482'>bidden him.</a>
<a id='line_4483'></a>
<a id='line_4484'>16:12 It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that</a>
<a id='line_4485'>the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.</a>
<a id='line_4486'></a>
<a id='line_4487'>16:13 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on</a>
<a id='line_4488'>the hill’s side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw</a>
<a id='line_4489'>stones at him, and cast dust.</a>
<a id='line_4490'></a>
<a id='line_4491'>16:14 And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary,</a>
<a id='line_4492'>and refreshed themselves there.</a>
<a id='line_4493'></a>
<a id='line_4494'>16:15 And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to</a>
<a id='line_4495'>Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</a>
<a id='line_4496'></a>
<a id='line_4497'>16:16 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend,</a>
<a id='line_4498'>was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the</a>
<a id='line_4499'>king, God save the king.</a>
<a id='line_4500'></a>
<a id='line_4501'>16:17 And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend?</a>
<a id='line_4502'>why wentest thou not with thy friend?  16:18 And Hushai said unto</a>
<a id='line_4503'>Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of</a>
<a id='line_4504'>Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</a>
<a id='line_4505'></a>
<a id='line_4506'>16:19 And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the</a>
<a id='line_4507'>presence of his son? as I have served in thy father’s presence, so</a>
<a id='line_4508'>will I be in thy presence.</a>
<a id='line_4509'></a>
<a id='line_4510'>16:20 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we</a>
<a id='line_4511'>shall do.</a>
<a id='line_4512'></a>
<a id='line_4513'>16:21 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s</a>
<a id='line_4514'>concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall</a>
<a id='line_4515'>hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all</a>
<a id='line_4516'>that are with thee be strong.</a>
<a id='line_4517'></a>
<a id='line_4518'>16:22 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and</a>
<a id='line_4519'>Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all</a>
<a id='line_4520'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4521'></a>
<a id='line_4522'>16:23 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those</a>
<a id='line_4523'>days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all</a>
<a id='line_4524'>the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</a>
<a id='line_4525'></a>
<a id='line_4526'>17:1 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out</a>
<a id='line_4527'>twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this</a>
<a id='line_4528'>night: 17:2 And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak</a>
<a id='line_4529'>handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him</a>
<a id='line_4530'>shall flee; and I will smite the king only: 17:3 And I will bring back</a>
<a id='line_4531'>all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all</a>
<a id='line_4532'>returned: so all the people shall be in peace.</a>
<a id='line_4533'></a>
<a id='line_4534'>17:4 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of</a>
<a id='line_4535'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4536'></a>
<a id='line_4537'>17:5 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us</a>
<a id='line_4538'>hear likewise what he saith.</a>
<a id='line_4539'></a>
<a id='line_4540'>17:6 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,</a>
<a id='line_4541'>saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after</a>
<a id='line_4542'>his saying? if not; speak thou.</a>
<a id='line_4543'></a>
<a id='line_4544'>17:7 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath</a>
<a id='line_4545'>given is not good at this time.</a>
<a id='line_4546'></a>
<a id='line_4547'>17:8 For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they</a>
<a id='line_4548'>be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of</a>
<a id='line_4549'>her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not</a>
<a id='line_4550'>lodge with the people.</a>
<a id='line_4551'></a>
<a id='line_4552'>17:9 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it</a>
<a id='line_4553'>will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that</a>
<a id='line_4554'>whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people</a>
<a id='line_4555'>that follow Absalom.</a>
<a id='line_4556'></a>
<a id='line_4557'>17:10 And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a</a>
<a id='line_4558'>lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a</a>
<a id='line_4559'>mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.</a>
<a id='line_4560'></a>
<a id='line_4561'>17:11 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto</a>
<a id='line_4562'>thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for</a>
<a id='line_4563'>multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.</a>
<a id='line_4564'></a>
<a id='line_4565'>17:12 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found,</a>
<a id='line_4566'>and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of</a>
<a id='line_4567'>him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so</a>
<a id='line_4568'>much as one.</a>
<a id='line_4569'></a>
<a id='line_4570'>17:13 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel</a>
<a id='line_4571'>bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until</a>
<a id='line_4572'>there be not one small stone found there.</a>
<a id='line_4573'></a>
<a id='line_4574'>17:14 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of</a>
<a id='line_4575'>Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the</a>
<a id='line_4576'>LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the</a>
<a id='line_4577'>intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.</a>
<a id='line_4578'></a>
<a id='line_4579'>17:15 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus</a>
<a id='line_4580'>and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and</a>
<a id='line_4581'>thus and thus have I counselled.</a>
<a id='line_4582'></a>
<a id='line_4583'>17:16 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not</a>
<a id='line_4584'>this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over;</a>
<a id='line_4585'>lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.</a>
<a id='line_4586'></a>
<a id='line_4587'>17:17 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not</a>
<a id='line_4588'>be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and</a>
<a id='line_4589'>they went and told king David.</a>
<a id='line_4590'></a>
<a id='line_4591'>17:18 Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went</a>
<a id='line_4592'>both of them away quickly, and came to a man’s house in Bahurim, which</a>
<a id='line_4593'>had a well in his court; whither they went down.</a>
<a id='line_4594'></a>
<a id='line_4595'>17:19 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth,</a>
<a id='line_4596'>and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.</a>
<a id='line_4597'></a>
<a id='line_4598'>17:20 And when Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house, they</a>
<a id='line_4599'>said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them,</a>
<a id='line_4600'>They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and</a>
<a id='line_4601'>could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_4602'></a>
<a id='line_4603'>17:21 And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up</a>
<a id='line_4604'>out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David,</a>
<a id='line_4605'>Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel</a>
<a id='line_4606'>counselled against you.</a>
<a id='line_4607'></a>
<a id='line_4608'>17:22 Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and</a>
<a id='line_4609'>they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of</a>
<a id='line_4610'>them that was not gone over Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_4611'></a>
<a id='line_4612'>17:23 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he</a>
<a id='line_4613'>saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his</a>
<a id='line_4614'>city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died,</a>
<a id='line_4615'>and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.</a>
<a id='line_4616'></a>
<a id='line_4617'>17:24 Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he</a>
<a id='line_4618'>and all the men of Israel with him.</a>
<a id='line_4619'></a>
<a id='line_4620'>17:25 And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab:</a>
<a id='line_4621'>which Amasa was a man’s son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that</a>
<a id='line_4622'>went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab’s</a>
<a id='line_4623'>mother.</a>
<a id='line_4624'></a>
<a id='line_4625'>17:26 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.</a>
<a id='line_4626'></a>
<a id='line_4627'>17:27 And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi</a>
<a id='line_4628'>the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the</a>
<a id='line_4629'>son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</a>
<a id='line_4630'>17:28 Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and</a>
<a id='line_4631'>barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and</a>
<a id='line_4632'>parched pulse, 17:29 And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of</a>
<a id='line_4633'>kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for</a>
<a id='line_4634'>they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the</a>
<a id='line_4635'>wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_4636'></a>
<a id='line_4637'>18:1 And David numbered the people that were with him, and set</a>
<a id='line_4638'>captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.</a>
<a id='line_4639'></a>
<a id='line_4640'>18:2 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of</a>
<a id='line_4641'>Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah,</a>
<a id='line_4642'>Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite.</a>
<a id='line_4643'>And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you</a>
<a id='line_4644'>myself also.</a>
<a id='line_4645'></a>
<a id='line_4646'>18:3 But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee</a>
<a id='line_4647'>away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they</a>
<a id='line_4648'>care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now</a>
<a id='line_4649'>it is better that thou succour us out of the city.</a>
<a id='line_4650'></a>
<a id='line_4651'>18:4 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And</a>
<a id='line_4652'>the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by</a>
<a id='line_4653'>hundreds and by thousands.</a>
<a id='line_4654'></a>
<a id='line_4655'>18:5 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal</a>
<a id='line_4656'>gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the</a>
<a id='line_4657'>people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning</a>
<a id='line_4658'>Absalom.</a>
<a id='line_4659'></a>
<a id='line_4660'>18:6 So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the</a>
<a id='line_4661'>battle was in the wood of Ephraim; 18:7 Where the people of Israel</a>
<a id='line_4662'>were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great</a>
<a id='line_4663'>slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.</a>
<a id='line_4664'></a>
<a id='line_4665'>18:8 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the</a>
<a id='line_4666'>country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword</a>
<a id='line_4667'>devoured.</a>
<a id='line_4668'></a>
<a id='line_4669'>18:9 And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a</a>
<a id='line_4670'>mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his</a>
<a id='line_4671'>head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven</a>
<a id='line_4672'>and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.</a>
<a id='line_4673'></a>
<a id='line_4674'>18:10 And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw</a>
<a id='line_4675'>Absalom hanged in an oak.</a>
<a id='line_4676'></a>
<a id='line_4677'>18:11 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou</a>
<a id='line_4678'>sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and</a>
<a id='line_4679'>I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.</a>
<a id='line_4680'></a>
<a id='line_4681'>18:12 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand</a>
<a id='line_4682'>shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand</a>
<a id='line_4683'>against the king’s son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and</a>
<a id='line_4684'>Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man</a>
<a id='line_4685'>Absalom.</a>
<a id='line_4686'></a>
<a id='line_4687'>18:13 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life:</a>
<a id='line_4688'>for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest</a>
<a id='line_4689'>have set thyself against me.</a>
<a id='line_4690'></a>
<a id='line_4691'>18:14 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took</a>
<a id='line_4692'>three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom,</a>
<a id='line_4693'>while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.</a>
<a id='line_4694'></a>
<a id='line_4695'>18:15 And ten young men that bare Joab’s armour compassed about and</a>
<a id='line_4696'>smote Absalom, and slew him.</a>
<a id='line_4697'></a>
<a id='line_4698'>18:16 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing</a>
<a id='line_4699'>after Israel: for Joab held back the people.</a>
<a id='line_4700'></a>
<a id='line_4701'>18:17 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the</a>
<a id='line_4702'>wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel</a>
<a id='line_4703'>fled every one to his tent.</a>
<a id='line_4704'></a>
<a id='line_4705'>18:18 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself</a>
<a id='line_4706'>a pillar, which is in the king’s dale: for he said, I have no son to</a>
<a id='line_4707'>keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own</a>
<a id='line_4708'>name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom’s place.</a>
<a id='line_4709'></a>
<a id='line_4710'>18:19 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the</a>
<a id='line_4711'>king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.</a>
<a id='line_4712'></a>
<a id='line_4713'>18:20 And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day,</a>
<a id='line_4714'>but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear</a>
<a id='line_4715'>no tidings, because the king’s son is dead.</a>
<a id='line_4716'></a>
<a id='line_4717'>18:21 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.</a>
<a id='line_4718'>And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.</a>
<a id='line_4719'></a>
<a id='line_4720'>18:22 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But</a>
<a id='line_4721'>howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said,</a>
<a id='line_4722'>Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings</a>
<a id='line_4723'>ready?  18:23 But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto</a>
<a id='line_4724'>him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.</a>
<a id='line_4725'></a>
<a id='line_4726'>18:24 And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to</a>
<a id='line_4727'>the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and</a>
<a id='line_4728'>looked, and behold a man running alone.</a>
<a id='line_4729'></a>
<a id='line_4730'>18:25 And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If</a>
<a id='line_4731'>he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and</a>
<a id='line_4732'>drew near.</a>
<a id='line_4733'></a>
<a id='line_4734'>18:26 And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman</a>
<a id='line_4735'>called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone.</a>
<a id='line_4736'>And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.</a>
<a id='line_4737'></a>
<a id='line_4738'>18:27 And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost</a>
<a id='line_4739'>is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He</a>
<a id='line_4740'>is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.</a>
<a id='line_4741'></a>
<a id='line_4742'>18:28 And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he</a>
<a id='line_4743'>fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said,</a>
<a id='line_4744'>Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that</a>
<a id='line_4745'>lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</a>
<a id='line_4746'></a>
<a id='line_4747'>18:29 And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz</a>
<a id='line_4748'>answered, When Joab sent the king’s servant, and me thy servant, I saw</a>
<a id='line_4749'>a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.</a>
<a id='line_4750'></a>
<a id='line_4751'>18:30 And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he</a>
<a id='line_4752'>turned aside, and stood still.</a>
<a id='line_4753'></a>
<a id='line_4754'>18:31 And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the</a>
<a id='line_4755'>king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up</a>
<a id='line_4756'>against thee.</a>
<a id='line_4757'></a>
<a id='line_4758'>18:32 And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And</a>
<a id='line_4759'>Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise</a>
<a id='line_4760'>against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.</a>
<a id='line_4761'></a>
<a id='line_4762'>18:33 And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the</a>
<a id='line_4763'>gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my</a>
<a id='line_4764'>son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son,</a>
<a id='line_4765'>my son!  19:1 And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and</a>
<a id='line_4766'>mourneth for Absalom.</a>
<a id='line_4767'></a>
<a id='line_4768'>19:2 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the</a>
<a id='line_4769'>people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for</a>
<a id='line_4770'>his son.</a>
<a id='line_4771'></a>
<a id='line_4772'>19:3 And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as</a>
<a id='line_4773'>people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.</a>
<a id='line_4774'></a>
<a id='line_4775'>19:4 But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud</a>
<a id='line_4776'>voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!  19:5 And Joab</a>
<a id='line_4777'>came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day</a>
<a id='line_4778'>the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and</a>
<a id='line_4779'>the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy</a>
<a id='line_4780'>wives, and the lives of thy concubines; 19:6 In that thou lovest thine</a>
<a id='line_4781'>enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that</a>
<a id='line_4782'>thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive,</a>
<a id='line_4783'>that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had</a>
<a id='line_4784'>pleased thee well.</a>
<a id='line_4785'></a>
<a id='line_4786'>19:7 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy</a>
<a id='line_4787'>servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will</a>
<a id='line_4788'>not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee</a>
<a id='line_4789'>than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.</a>
<a id='line_4790'></a>
<a id='line_4791'>19:8 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all</a>
<a id='line_4792'>the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the</a>
<a id='line_4793'>people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his</a>
<a id='line_4794'>tent.</a>
<a id='line_4795'></a>
<a id='line_4796'>19:9 And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of</a>
<a id='line_4797'>Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and</a>
<a id='line_4798'>he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled</a>
<a id='line_4799'>out of the land for Absalom.</a>
<a id='line_4800'></a>
<a id='line_4801'>19:10 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now</a>
<a id='line_4802'>therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?  19:11</a>
<a id='line_4803'>And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying,</a>
<a id='line_4804'>Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring</a>
<a id='line_4805'>the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to</a>
<a id='line_4806'>the king, even to his house.</a>
<a id='line_4807'></a>
<a id='line_4808'>19:12 Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then</a>
<a id='line_4809'>are ye the last to bring back the king?  19:13 And say ye to Amasa,</a>
<a id='line_4810'>Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more</a>
<a id='line_4811'>also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the</a>
<a id='line_4812'>room of Joab.</a>
<a id='line_4813'></a>
<a id='line_4814'>19:14 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the</a>
<a id='line_4815'>heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return</a>
<a id='line_4816'>thou, and all thy servants.</a>
<a id='line_4817'></a>
<a id='line_4818'>19:15 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to</a>
<a id='line_4819'>Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_4820'></a>
<a id='line_4821'>19:16 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,</a>
<a id='line_4822'>hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.</a>
<a id='line_4823'></a>
<a id='line_4824'>19:17 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the</a>
<a id='line_4825'>servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty</a>
<a id='line_4826'>servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.</a>
<a id='line_4827'></a>
<a id='line_4828'>19:18 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king’s</a>
<a id='line_4829'>household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera</a>
<a id='line_4830'>fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan; 19:19 And said</a>
<a id='line_4831'>unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do</a>
<a id='line_4832'>thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my</a>
<a id='line_4833'>lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to</a>
<a id='line_4834'>his heart.</a>
<a id='line_4835'></a>
<a id='line_4836'>19:20 For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold,</a>
<a id='line_4837'>I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to</a>
<a id='line_4838'>meet my lord the king.</a>
<a id='line_4839'></a>
<a id='line_4840'>19:21 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not</a>
<a id='line_4841'>Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’s</a>
<a id='line_4842'>anointed?  19:22 And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons</a>
<a id='line_4843'>of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall</a>
<a id='line_4844'>there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know</a>
<a id='line_4845'>that I am this day king over Israel?  19:23 Therefore the king said</a>
<a id='line_4846'>unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.</a>
<a id='line_4847'></a>
<a id='line_4848'>19:24 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and</a>
<a id='line_4849'>had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his</a>
<a id='line_4850'>clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in</a>
<a id='line_4851'>peace.</a>
<a id='line_4852'></a>
<a id='line_4853'>19:25 And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the</a>
<a id='line_4854'>king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me,</a>
<a id='line_4855'>Mephibosheth?  19:26 And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant</a>
<a id='line_4856'>deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may</a>
<a id='line_4857'>ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.</a>
<a id='line_4858'></a>
<a id='line_4859'>19:27 And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my</a>
<a id='line_4860'>lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in</a>
<a id='line_4861'>thine eyes.</a>
<a id='line_4862'></a>
<a id='line_4863'>19:28 For all of my father’s house were but dead men before my lord</a>
<a id='line_4864'>the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at</a>
<a id='line_4865'>thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto</a>
<a id='line_4866'>the king?  19:29 And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any</a>
<a id='line_4867'>more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.</a>
<a id='line_4868'></a>
<a id='line_4869'>19:30 And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,</a>
<a id='line_4870'>forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own</a>
<a id='line_4871'>house.</a>
<a id='line_4872'></a>
<a id='line_4873'>19:31 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went</a>
<a id='line_4874'>over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_4875'></a>
<a id='line_4876'>19:32 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and</a>
<a id='line_4877'>he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for</a>
<a id='line_4878'>he was a very great man.</a>
<a id='line_4879'></a>
<a id='line_4880'>19:33 And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I</a>
<a id='line_4881'>will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_4882'></a>
<a id='line_4883'>19:34 And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that</a>
<a id='line_4884'>I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?  19:35 I am this day</a>
<a id='line_4885'>fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy</a>
<a id='line_4886'>servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the</a>
<a id='line_4887'>voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy</a>
<a id='line_4888'>servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?  19:36 Thy servant will</a>
<a id='line_4889'>go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king</a>
<a id='line_4890'>recompense it me with such a reward?  19:37 Let thy servant, I pray</a>
<a id='line_4891'>thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried</a>
<a id='line_4892'>by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant</a>
<a id='line_4893'>Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what</a>
<a id='line_4894'>shall seem good unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_4895'></a>
<a id='line_4896'>19:38 And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will</a>
<a id='line_4897'>do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou</a>
<a id='line_4898'>shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.</a>
<a id='line_4899'></a>
<a id='line_4900'>19:39 And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come</a>
<a id='line_4901'>over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto</a>
<a id='line_4902'>his own place.</a>
<a id='line_4903'></a>
<a id='line_4904'>19:40 Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him:</a>
<a id='line_4905'>and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the</a>
<a id='line_4906'>people of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4907'></a>
<a id='line_4908'>19:41 And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said</a>
<a id='line_4909'>unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee</a>
<a id='line_4910'>away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David’s</a>
<a id='line_4911'>men with him, over Jordan?  19:42 And all the men of Judah answered</a>
<a id='line_4912'>the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore</a>
<a id='line_4913'>then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king’s</a>
<a id='line_4914'>cost? or hath he given us any gift?  19:43 And the men of Israel</a>
<a id='line_4915'>answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king,</a>
<a id='line_4916'>and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise</a>
<a id='line_4917'>us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?</a>
<a id='line_4918'>And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the</a>
<a id='line_4919'>men of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4920'></a>
<a id='line_4921'>20:1 And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was</a>
<a id='line_4922'>Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and</a>
<a id='line_4923'>said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son</a>
<a id='line_4924'>of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4925'></a>
<a id='line_4926'>20:2 So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed</a>
<a id='line_4927'>Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king,</a>
<a id='line_4928'>from Jordan even to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_4929'></a>
<a id='line_4930'>20:3 And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the</a>
<a id='line_4931'>ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put</a>
<a id='line_4932'>them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were</a>
<a id='line_4933'>shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.</a>
<a id='line_4934'></a>
<a id='line_4935'>20:4 Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within</a>
<a id='line_4936'>three days, and be thou here present.</a>
<a id='line_4937'></a>
<a id='line_4938'>20:5 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer</a>
<a id='line_4939'>than the set time which he had appointed him.</a>
<a id='line_4940'></a>
<a id='line_4941'>20:6 And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do</a>
<a id='line_4942'>us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord’s servants, and</a>
<a id='line_4943'>pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.</a>
<a id='line_4944'></a>
<a id='line_4945'>20:7 And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites, and</a>
<a id='line_4946'>the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of</a>
<a id='line_4947'>Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</a>
<a id='line_4948'></a>
<a id='line_4949'>20:8 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went</a>
<a id='line_4950'>before them. And Joab’s garment that he had put on was girded unto</a>
<a id='line_4951'>him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the</a>
<a id='line_4952'>sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.</a>
<a id='line_4953'></a>
<a id='line_4954'>20:9 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab</a>
<a id='line_4955'>took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.</a>
<a id='line_4956'></a>
<a id='line_4957'>20:10 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand: so</a>
<a id='line_4958'>he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to</a>
<a id='line_4959'>the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai</a>
<a id='line_4960'>his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.</a>
<a id='line_4961'></a>
<a id='line_4962'>20:11 And one of Joab’s men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth</a>
<a id='line_4963'>Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.</a>
<a id='line_4964'></a>
<a id='line_4965'>20:12 And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And</a>
<a id='line_4966'>when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out</a>
<a id='line_4967'>of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw</a>
<a id='line_4968'>that every one that came by him stood still.</a>
<a id='line_4969'></a>
<a id='line_4970'>20:13 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on</a>
<a id='line_4971'>after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</a>
<a id='line_4972'></a>
<a id='line_4973'>20:14 And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to</a>
<a id='line_4974'>Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and</a>
<a id='line_4975'>went also after him.</a>
<a id='line_4976'></a>
<a id='line_4977'>20:15 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they</a>
<a id='line_4978'>cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all</a>
<a id='line_4979'>the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.</a>
<a id='line_4980'></a>
<a id='line_4981'>20:16 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray</a>
<a id='line_4982'>you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.</a>
<a id='line_4983'></a>
<a id='line_4984'>20:17 And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou</a>
<a id='line_4985'>Joab?  And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the</a>
<a id='line_4986'>words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.</a>
<a id='line_4987'></a>
<a id='line_4988'>20:18 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time,</a>
<a id='line_4989'>saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the</a>
<a id='line_4990'>matter.</a>
<a id='line_4991'></a>
<a id='line_4992'>20:19 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou</a>
<a id='line_4993'>seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou</a>
<a id='line_4994'>swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?  20:20 And Joab answered and</a>
<a id='line_4995'>said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or</a>
<a id='line_4996'>destroy.</a>
<a id='line_4997'></a>
<a id='line_4998'>20:21 The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son</a>
<a id='line_4999'>of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even</a>
<a id='line_5000'>against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And</a>
<a id='line_5001'>the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee</a>
<a id='line_5002'>over the wall.</a>
<a id='line_5003'></a>
<a id='line_5004'>20:22 Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they</a>
<a id='line_5005'>cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab.</a>
<a id='line_5006'>And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to</a>
<a id='line_5007'>his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.</a>
<a id='line_5008'></a>
<a id='line_5009'>20:23 Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of</a>
<a id='line_5010'>Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites: 20:24 And</a>
<a id='line_5011'>Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was</a>
<a id='line_5012'>recorder: 20:25 And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the</a>
<a id='line_5013'>priests: 20:26 And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.</a>
<a id='line_5014'></a>
<a id='line_5015'>21:1 Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year</a>
<a id='line_5016'>after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It</a>
<a id='line_5017'>is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.</a>
<a id='line_5018'></a>
<a id='line_5019'>21:2 And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the</a>
<a id='line_5020'>Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of</a>
<a id='line_5021'>the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul</a>
<a id='line_5022'>sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)</a>
<a id='line_5023'>21:3 Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for</a>
<a id='line_5024'>you?  and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the</a>
<a id='line_5025'>inheritance of the LORD?  21:4 And the Gibeonites said unto him, We</a>
<a id='line_5026'>will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us</a>
<a id='line_5027'>shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say,</a>
<a id='line_5028'>that will I do for you.</a>
<a id='line_5029'></a>
<a id='line_5030'>21:5 And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that</a>
<a id='line_5031'>devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any</a>
<a id='line_5032'>of the coasts of Israel, 21:6 Let seven men of his sons be delivered</a>
<a id='line_5033'>unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul,</a>
<a id='line_5034'>whom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them.</a>
<a id='line_5035'></a>
<a id='line_5036'>21:7 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of</a>
<a id='line_5037'>Saul, because of the LORD’s oath that was between them, between David</a>
<a id='line_5038'>and Jonathan the son of Saul.</a>
<a id='line_5039'></a>
<a id='line_5040'>21:8 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,</a>
<a id='line_5041'>whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of</a>
<a id='line_5042'>Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of</a>
<a id='line_5043'>Barzillai the Meholathite: 21:9 And he delivered them into the hands</a>
<a id='line_5044'>of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD:</a>
<a id='line_5045'>and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of</a>
<a id='line_5046'>harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.</a>
<a id='line_5047'></a>
<a id='line_5048'>21:10 And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it</a>
<a id='line_5049'>for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water</a>
<a id='line_5050'>dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the</a>
<a id='line_5051'>air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.</a>
<a id='line_5052'></a>
<a id='line_5053'>21:11 And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the</a>
<a id='line_5054'>concubine of Saul, had done.</a>
<a id='line_5055'></a>
<a id='line_5056'>21:12 And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of</a>
<a id='line_5057'>Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them</a>
<a id='line_5058'>from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them,</a>
<a id='line_5059'>when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa: 21:13 And he brought up</a>
<a id='line_5060'>from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and</a>
<a id='line_5061'>they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.</a>
<a id='line_5062'></a>
<a id='line_5063'>21:14 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the</a>
<a id='line_5064'>country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and</a>
<a id='line_5065'>they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was</a>
<a id='line_5066'>intreated for the land.</a>
<a id='line_5067'></a>
<a id='line_5068'>21:15 Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and</a>
<a id='line_5069'>David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the</a>
<a id='line_5070'>Philistines: and David waxed faint.</a>
<a id='line_5071'></a>
<a id='line_5072'>21:16 And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight</a>
<a id='line_5073'>of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he</a>
<a id='line_5074'>being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.</a>
<a id='line_5075'></a>
<a id='line_5076'>21:17 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the</a>
<a id='line_5077'>Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him,</a>
<a id='line_5078'>saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench</a>
<a id='line_5079'>not the light of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_5080'></a>
<a id='line_5081'>21:18 And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle</a>
<a id='line_5082'>with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph,</a>
<a id='line_5083'>which was of the sons of the giant.</a>
<a id='line_5084'></a>
<a id='line_5085'>21:19 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where</a>
<a id='line_5086'>Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of</a>
<a id='line_5087'>Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s</a>
<a id='line_5088'>beam.</a>
<a id='line_5089'></a>
<a id='line_5090'>21:20 And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great</a>
<a id='line_5091'>stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six</a>
<a id='line_5092'>toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.</a>
<a id='line_5093'></a>
<a id='line_5094'>21:21 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the</a>
<a id='line_5095'>brother of David slew him.</a>
<a id='line_5096'></a>
<a id='line_5097'>21:22 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand</a>
<a id='line_5098'>of David, and by the hand of his servants.</a>
<a id='line_5099'></a>
<a id='line_5100'>22:1 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day</a>
<a id='line_5101'>that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies,</a>
<a id='line_5102'>and out of the hand of Saul: 22:2 And he said, The LORD is my rock,</a>
<a id='line_5103'>and my fortress, and my deliverer; 22:3 The God of my rock; in him</a>
<a id='line_5104'>will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high</a>
<a id='line_5105'>tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.</a>
<a id='line_5106'></a>
<a id='line_5107'>22:4 I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I</a>
<a id='line_5108'>be saved from mine enemies.</a>
<a id='line_5109'></a>
<a id='line_5110'>22:5 When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men</a>
<a id='line_5111'>made me afraid; 22:6 The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the</a>
<a id='line_5112'>snares of death prevented me; 22:7 In my distress I called upon the</a>
<a id='line_5113'>LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple,</a>
<a id='line_5114'>and my cry did enter into his ears.</a>
<a id='line_5115'></a>
<a id='line_5116'>22:8 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven</a>
<a id='line_5117'>moved and shook, because he was wroth.</a>
<a id='line_5118'></a>
<a id='line_5119'>22:9 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his</a>
<a id='line_5120'>mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</a>
<a id='line_5121'></a>
<a id='line_5122'>22:10 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under</a>
<a id='line_5123'>his feet.</a>
<a id='line_5124'></a>
<a id='line_5125'>22:11 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the</a>
<a id='line_5126'>wings of the wind.</a>
<a id='line_5127'></a>
<a id='line_5128'>22:12 And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and</a>
<a id='line_5129'>thick clouds of the skies.</a>
<a id='line_5130'></a>
<a id='line_5131'>22:13 Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.</a>
<a id='line_5132'></a>
<a id='line_5133'>22:14 The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his</a>
<a id='line_5134'>voice.</a>
<a id='line_5135'></a>
<a id='line_5136'>22:15 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and</a>
<a id='line_5137'>discomfited them.</a>
<a id='line_5138'></a>
<a id='line_5139'>22:16 And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the</a>
<a id='line_5140'>world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of</a>
<a id='line_5141'>the breath of his nostrils.</a>
<a id='line_5142'></a>
<a id='line_5143'>22:17 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;</a>
<a id='line_5144'>22:18 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated</a>
<a id='line_5145'>me: for they were too strong for me.</a>
<a id='line_5146'></a>
<a id='line_5147'>22:19 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my</a>
<a id='line_5148'>stay.</a>
<a id='line_5149'></a>
<a id='line_5150'>22:20 He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me,</a>
<a id='line_5151'>because he delighted in me.</a>
<a id='line_5152'></a>
<a id='line_5153'>22:21 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to</a>
<a id='line_5154'>the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</a>
<a id='line_5155'></a>
<a id='line_5156'>22:22 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly</a>
<a id='line_5157'>departed from my God.</a>
<a id='line_5158'></a>
<a id='line_5159'>22:23 For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I</a>
<a id='line_5160'>did not depart from them.</a>
<a id='line_5161'></a>
<a id='line_5162'>22:24 I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine</a>
<a id='line_5163'>iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_5164'></a>
<a id='line_5165'>22:25 Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my</a>
<a id='line_5166'>righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.</a>
<a id='line_5167'></a>
<a id='line_5168'>22:26 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the</a>
<a id='line_5169'>upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.</a>
<a id='line_5170'></a>
<a id='line_5171'>22:27 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward</a>
<a id='line_5172'>thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.</a>
<a id='line_5173'></a>
<a id='line_5174'>22:28 And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon</a>
<a id='line_5175'>the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.</a>
<a id='line_5176'></a>
<a id='line_5177'>22:29 For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my</a>
<a id='line_5178'>darkness.</a>
<a id='line_5179'></a>
<a id='line_5180'>22:30 For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped</a>
<a id='line_5181'>over a wall.</a>
<a id='line_5182'></a>
<a id='line_5183'>22:31 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried:</a>
<a id='line_5184'>he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.</a>
<a id='line_5185'></a>
<a id='line_5186'>22:32 For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?</a>
<a id='line_5187'>22:33 God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.</a>
<a id='line_5188'></a>
<a id='line_5189'>22:34 He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet: and setteth me upon my high</a>
<a id='line_5190'>places.</a>
<a id='line_5191'></a>
<a id='line_5192'>22:35 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by</a>
<a id='line_5193'>mine arms.</a>
<a id='line_5194'></a>
<a id='line_5195'>22:36 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy</a>
<a id='line_5196'>gentleness hath made me great.</a>
<a id='line_5197'></a>
<a id='line_5198'>22:37 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not</a>
<a id='line_5199'>slip.</a>
<a id='line_5200'></a>
<a id='line_5201'>22:38 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not</a>
<a id='line_5202'>again until I had consumed them.</a>
<a id='line_5203'></a>
<a id='line_5204'>22:39 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not</a>
<a id='line_5205'>arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.</a>
<a id='line_5206'></a>
<a id='line_5207'>22:40 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose</a>
<a id='line_5208'>up against me hast thou subdued under me.</a>
<a id='line_5209'></a>
<a id='line_5210'>22:41 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might</a>
<a id='line_5211'>destroy them that hate me.</a>
<a id='line_5212'></a>
<a id='line_5213'>22:42 They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but</a>
<a id='line_5214'>he answered them not.</a>
<a id='line_5215'></a>
<a id='line_5216'>22:43 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did</a>
<a id='line_5217'>stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.</a>
<a id='line_5218'></a>
<a id='line_5219'>22:44 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,</a>
<a id='line_5220'>thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not</a>
<a id='line_5221'>shall serve me.</a>
<a id='line_5222'></a>
<a id='line_5223'>22:45 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear,</a>
<a id='line_5224'>they shall be obedient unto me.</a>
<a id='line_5225'></a>
<a id='line_5226'>22:46 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their</a>
<a id='line_5227'>close places.</a>
<a id='line_5228'></a>
<a id='line_5229'>22:47 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God</a>
<a id='line_5230'>of the rock of my salvation.</a>
<a id='line_5231'></a>
<a id='line_5232'>22:48 It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people</a>
<a id='line_5233'>under me.</a>
<a id='line_5234'></a>
<a id='line_5235'>22:49 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast</a>
<a id='line_5236'>lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast</a>
<a id='line_5237'>delivered me from the violent man.</a>
<a id='line_5238'></a>
<a id='line_5239'>22:50 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the</a>
<a id='line_5240'>heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.</a>
<a id='line_5241'></a>
<a id='line_5242'>22:51 He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to</a>
<a id='line_5243'>his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.</a>
<a id='line_5244'></a>
<a id='line_5245'>23:1 Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse</a>
<a id='line_5246'>said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God</a>
<a id='line_5247'>of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said, 23:2 The Spirit of</a>
<a id='line_5248'>the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.</a>
<a id='line_5249'></a>
<a id='line_5250'>23:3 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that</a>
<a id='line_5251'>ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.</a>
<a id='line_5252'></a>
<a id='line_5253'>23:4 And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth,</a>
<a id='line_5254'>even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of</a>
<a id='line_5255'>the earth by clear shining after rain.</a>
<a id='line_5256'></a>
<a id='line_5257'>23:5 Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an</a>
<a id='line_5258'>everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all</a>
<a id='line_5259'>my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.</a>
<a id='line_5260'></a>
<a id='line_5261'>23:6 But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust</a>
<a id='line_5262'>away, because they cannot be taken with hands: 23:7 But the man that</a>
<a id='line_5263'>shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear;</a>
<a id='line_5264'>and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.</a>
<a id='line_5265'></a>
<a id='line_5266'>23:8 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The</a>
<a id='line_5267'>Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same</a>
<a id='line_5268'>was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom</a>
<a id='line_5269'>he slew at one time.</a>
<a id='line_5270'></a>
<a id='line_5271'>23:9 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the</a>
<a id='line_5272'>three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that</a>
<a id='line_5273'>were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were</a>
<a id='line_5274'>gone away: 23:10 He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand</a>
<a id='line_5275'>was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a</a>
<a id='line_5276'>great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to</a>
<a id='line_5277'>spoil.</a>
<a id='line_5278'></a>
<a id='line_5279'>23:11 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the</a>
<a id='line_5280'>Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of</a>
<a id='line_5281'>ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_5282'></a>
<a id='line_5283'>23:12 But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and</a>
<a id='line_5284'>slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.</a>
<a id='line_5285'></a>
<a id='line_5286'>23:13 And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in</a>
<a id='line_5287'>the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the</a>
<a id='line_5288'>Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.</a>
<a id='line_5289'></a>
<a id='line_5290'>23:14 And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the</a>
<a id='line_5291'>Philistines was then in Bethlehem.</a>
<a id='line_5292'></a>
<a id='line_5293'>23:15 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of</a>
<a id='line_5294'>the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!  23:16 And</a>
<a id='line_5295'>the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and</a>
<a id='line_5296'>drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and</a>
<a id='line_5297'>took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink</a>
<a id='line_5298'>thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5299'></a>
<a id='line_5300'>23:17 And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this:</a>
<a id='line_5301'>is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?</a>
<a id='line_5302'>therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty</a>
<a id='line_5303'>men.</a>
<a id='line_5304'></a>
<a id='line_5305'>23:18 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief</a>
<a id='line_5306'>among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and</a>
<a id='line_5307'>slew them, and had the name among three.</a>
<a id='line_5308'></a>
<a id='line_5309'>23:19 Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their</a>
<a id='line_5310'>captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.</a>
<a id='line_5311'></a>
<a id='line_5312'>23:20 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of</a>
<a id='line_5313'>Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he</a>
<a id='line_5314'>went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:</a>
<a id='line_5315'>23:21 And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a</a>
<a id='line_5316'>spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked</a>
<a id='line_5317'>the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.</a>
<a id='line_5318'></a>
<a id='line_5319'>23:22 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name</a>
<a id='line_5320'>among three mighty men.</a>
<a id='line_5321'></a>
<a id='line_5322'>23:23 He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to</a>
<a id='line_5323'>the first three. And David set him over his guard.</a>
<a id='line_5324'></a>
<a id='line_5325'>23:24 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the</a>
<a id='line_5326'>son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 23:25 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the</a>
<a id='line_5327'>Harodite, 23:26 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,</a>
<a id='line_5328'>23:27 Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 23:28 Zalmon</a>
<a id='line_5329'>the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, 23:29 Heleb the son of Baanah,</a>
<a id='line_5330'>a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children</a>
<a id='line_5331'>of Benjamin, 23:30 Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of</a>
<a id='line_5332'>Gaash, 23:31 Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, 23:32</a>
<a id='line_5333'>Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, 23:33</a>
<a id='line_5334'>Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite, 23:34</a>
<a id='line_5335'>Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the</a>
<a id='line_5336'>son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, 23:35 Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the</a>
<a id='line_5337'>Arbite, 23:36 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, 23:37</a>
<a id='line_5338'>Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the</a>
<a id='line_5339'>son of Zeruiah, 23:38 Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite, 23:39 Uriah</a>
<a id='line_5340'>the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.</a>
<a id='line_5341'></a>
<a id='line_5342'>24:1 And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and</a>
<a id='line_5343'>he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.</a>
<a id='line_5344'></a>
<a id='line_5345'>24:2 For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with</a>
<a id='line_5346'>him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to</a>
<a id='line_5347'>Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the</a>
<a id='line_5348'>people.</a>
<a id='line_5349'></a>
<a id='line_5350'>24:3 And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the</a>
<a id='line_5351'>people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of</a>
<a id='line_5352'>my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in</a>
<a id='line_5353'>this thing?  24:4 Notwithstanding the king’s word prevailed against</a>
<a id='line_5354'>Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains</a>
<a id='line_5355'>of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the</a>
<a id='line_5356'>people of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_5357'></a>
<a id='line_5358'>24:5 And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right</a>
<a id='line_5359'>side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and</a>
<a id='line_5360'>toward Jazer: 24:6 Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of</a>
<a id='line_5361'>Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon, 24:7 And</a>
<a id='line_5362'>came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites,</a>
<a id='line_5363'>and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even</a>
<a id='line_5364'>to Beersheba.</a>
<a id='line_5365'></a>
<a id='line_5366'>24:8 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to</a>
<a id='line_5367'>Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</a>
<a id='line_5368'></a>
<a id='line_5369'>24:9 And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the</a>
<a id='line_5370'>king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that</a>
<a id='line_5371'>drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</a>
<a id='line_5372'></a>
<a id='line_5373'>24:10 And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the</a>
<a id='line_5374'>people.</a>
<a id='line_5375'></a>
<a id='line_5376'>And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have</a>
<a id='line_5377'>done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy</a>
<a id='line_5378'>servant; for I have done very foolishly.</a>
<a id='line_5379'></a>
<a id='line_5380'>24:11 For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came</a>
<a id='line_5381'>unto the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying, 24:12 Go and say unto</a>
<a id='line_5382'>David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one</a>
<a id='line_5383'>of them, that I may do it unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_5384'></a>
<a id='line_5385'>24:13 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall</a>
<a id='line_5386'>seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee</a>
<a id='line_5387'>three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that</a>
<a id='line_5388'>there be three days’ pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what</a>
<a id='line_5389'>answer I shall return to him that sent me.</a>
<a id='line_5390'></a>
<a id='line_5391'>24:14 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now</a>
<a id='line_5392'>into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not</a>
<a id='line_5393'>fall into the hand of man.</a>
<a id='line_5394'></a>
<a id='line_5395'>24:15 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even</a>
<a id='line_5396'>to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to</a>
<a id='line_5397'>Beersheba seventy thousand men.</a>
<a id='line_5398'></a>
<a id='line_5399'>24:16 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to</a>
<a id='line_5400'>destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel</a>
<a id='line_5401'>that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the</a>
<a id='line_5402'>angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.</a>
<a id='line_5403'></a>
<a id='line_5404'>24:17 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote</a>
<a id='line_5405'>the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but</a>
<a id='line_5406'>these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be</a>
<a id='line_5407'>against me, and against my father’s house.</a>
<a id='line_5408'></a>
<a id='line_5409'>24:18 And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear</a>
<a id='line_5410'>an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.</a>
<a id='line_5411'></a>
<a id='line_5412'>24:19 And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD</a>
<a id='line_5413'>commanded.</a>
<a id='line_5414'></a>
<a id='line_5415'>24:20 And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on</a>
<a id='line_5416'>toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on</a>
<a id='line_5417'>his face upon the ground.</a>
<a id='line_5418'></a>
<a id='line_5419'>24:21 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his</a>
<a id='line_5420'>servant?  And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build</a>
<a id='line_5421'>an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</a>
<a id='line_5422'></a>
<a id='line_5423'>24:22 And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer</a>
<a id='line_5424'>up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt</a>
<a id='line_5425'>sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen</a>
<a id='line_5426'>for wood.</a>
<a id='line_5427'></a>
<a id='line_5428'>24:23 All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And</a>
<a id='line_5429'>Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.</a>
<a id='line_5430'></a>
<a id='line_5431'>24:24 And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of</a>
<a id='line_5432'>thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my</a>
<a id='line_5433'>God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the</a>
<a id='line_5434'>threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</a>
<a id='line_5435'></a>
<a id='line_5436'>24:25 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt</a>
<a id='line_5437'>offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land,</a>
<a id='line_5438'>and the plague was stayed from Israel.</a>
