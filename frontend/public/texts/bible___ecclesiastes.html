                    <a id='line_0'>Ecclesiastes</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'>or</a>
<a id='line_3'></a>
<a id='line_4'>The Preacher</a>
<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>1:1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>1:2 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is</a>
<a id='line_10'>vanity.</a>
<a id='line_11'></a>
<a id='line_12'>1:3 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the</a>
<a id='line_13'>sun?  1:4 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh:</a>
<a id='line_14'>but the earth abideth for ever.</a>
<a id='line_15'></a>
<a id='line_16'>1:5 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his</a>
<a id='line_17'>place where he arose.</a>
<a id='line_18'></a>
<a id='line_19'>1:6 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north;</a>
<a id='line_20'>it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according</a>
<a id='line_21'>to his circuits.</a>
<a id='line_22'></a>
<a id='line_23'>1:7 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the</a>
<a id='line_24'>place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'>1:8 All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not</a>
<a id='line_27'>satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</a>
<a id='line_28'></a>
<a id='line_29'>1:9 The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that</a>
<a id='line_30'>which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing</a>
<a id='line_31'>under the sun.</a>
<a id='line_32'></a>
<a id='line_33'>1:10 Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it</a>
<a id='line_34'>hath been already of old time, which was before us.</a>
<a id='line_35'></a>
<a id='line_36'>1:11 There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be</a>
<a id='line_37'>any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come</a>
<a id='line_38'>after.</a>
<a id='line_39'></a>
<a id='line_40'>1:12 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_41'></a>
<a id='line_42'>1:13 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning</a>
<a id='line_43'>all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God</a>
<a id='line_44'>given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</a>
<a id='line_45'></a>
<a id='line_46'>1:14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and,</a>
<a id='line_47'>behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</a>
<a id='line_48'></a>
<a id='line_49'>1:15 That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is</a>
<a id='line_50'>wanting cannot be numbered.</a>
<a id='line_51'></a>
<a id='line_52'>1:16 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great</a>
<a id='line_53'>estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been</a>
<a id='line_54'>before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom</a>
<a id='line_55'>and knowledge.</a>
<a id='line_56'></a>
<a id='line_57'>1:17 And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and</a>
<a id='line_58'>folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</a>
<a id='line_59'></a>
<a id='line_60'>1:18 For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth</a>
<a id='line_61'>knowledge increaseth sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_62'></a>
<a id='line_63'>2:1 I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth,</a>
<a id='line_64'>therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.</a>
<a id='line_65'></a>
<a id='line_66'>2:2 I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?  2:3 I</a>
<a id='line_67'>sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine</a>
<a id='line_68'>heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was</a>
<a id='line_69'>that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven</a>
<a id='line_70'>all the days of their life.</a>
<a id='line_71'></a>
<a id='line_72'>2:4 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me</a>
<a id='line_73'>vineyards: 2:5 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in</a>
<a id='line_74'>them of all kind of fruits: 2:6 I made me pools of water, to water</a>
<a id='line_75'>therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: 2:7 I got me servants</a>
<a id='line_76'>and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great</a>
<a id='line_77'>possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem</a>
<a id='line_78'>before me: 2:8 I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar</a>
<a id='line_79'>treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women</a>
<a id='line_80'>singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments,</a>
<a id='line_81'>and that of all sorts.</a>
<a id='line_82'></a>
<a id='line_83'>2:9 So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in</a>
<a id='line_84'>Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>2:10 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld</a>
<a id='line_87'>not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and</a>
<a id='line_88'>this was my portion of all my labour.</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>2:11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on</a>
<a id='line_91'>the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and</a>
<a id='line_92'>vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>2:12 And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for</a>
<a id='line_95'>what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath</a>
<a id='line_96'>been already done.</a>
<a id='line_97'></a>
<a id='line_98'>2:13 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth</a>
<a id='line_99'>darkness.</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>2:14 The wise man’s eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in</a>
<a id='line_102'>darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them</a>
<a id='line_103'>all.</a>
<a id='line_104'></a>
<a id='line_105'>2:15 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it</a>
<a id='line_106'>happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my</a>
<a id='line_107'>heart, that this also is vanity.</a>
<a id='line_108'></a>
<a id='line_109'>2:16 For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for</a>
<a id='line_110'>ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be</a>
<a id='line_111'>forgotten.</a>
<a id='line_112'></a>
<a id='line_113'>And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.</a>
<a id='line_114'></a>
<a id='line_115'>2:17 Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under</a>
<a id='line_116'>the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</a>
<a id='line_117'></a>
<a id='line_118'>2:18 Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun:</a>
<a id='line_119'>because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</a>
<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>2:19 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet</a>
<a id='line_122'>shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and</a>
<a id='line_123'>wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.</a>
<a id='line_124'></a>
<a id='line_125'>2:20 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the</a>
<a id='line_126'>labour which I took under the sun.</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>2:21 For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge,</a>
<a id='line_129'>and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he</a>
<a id='line_130'>leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'>2:22 For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his</a>
<a id='line_133'>heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?  2:23 For all his days</a>
<a id='line_134'>are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in</a>
<a id='line_135'>the night. This is also vanity.</a>
<a id='line_136'></a>
<a id='line_137'>2:24 There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and</a>
<a id='line_138'>drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This</a>
<a id='line_139'>also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>2:25 For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?</a>
<a id='line_142'>2:26 For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and</a>
<a id='line_143'>knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and</a>
<a id='line_144'>to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also</a>
<a id='line_145'>is vanity and vexation of spirit.</a>
<a id='line_146'></a>
<a id='line_147'>3:1 To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose</a>
<a id='line_148'>under the heaven: 3:2 A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to</a>
<a id='line_149'>plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; 3:3 A time to</a>
<a id='line_150'>kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build</a>
<a id='line_151'>up; 3:4 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a</a>
<a id='line_152'>time to dance; 3:5 A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather</a>
<a id='line_153'>stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from</a>
<a id='line_154'>embracing; 3:6 A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and</a>
<a id='line_155'>a time to cast away; 3:7 A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to</a>
<a id='line_156'>keep silence, and a time to speak; 3:8 A time to love, and a time to</a>
<a id='line_157'>hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</a>
<a id='line_158'></a>
<a id='line_159'>3:9 What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?</a>
<a id='line_160'>3:10 I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men</a>
<a id='line_161'>to be exercised in it.</a>
<a id='line_162'></a>
<a id='line_163'>3:11 He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set</a>
<a id='line_164'>the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that</a>
<a id='line_165'>God maketh from the beginning to the end.</a>
<a id='line_166'></a>
<a id='line_167'>3:12 I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice,</a>
<a id='line_168'>and to do good in his life.</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>3:13 And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good</a>
<a id='line_171'>of all his labour, it is the gift of God.</a>
<a id='line_172'></a>
<a id='line_173'>3:14 I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing</a>
<a id='line_174'>can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that</a>
<a id='line_175'>men should fear before him.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>3:15 That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already</a>
<a id='line_178'>been; and God requireth that which is past.</a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>3:16 And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that</a>
<a id='line_181'>wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity</a>
<a id='line_182'>was there.</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>3:17 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the</a>
<a id='line_185'>wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every</a>
<a id='line_186'>work.</a>
<a id='line_187'></a>
<a id='line_188'>3:18 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men,</a>
<a id='line_189'>that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they</a>
<a id='line_190'>themselves are beasts.</a>
<a id='line_191'></a>
<a id='line_192'>3:19 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even</a>
<a id='line_193'>one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea,</a>
<a id='line_194'>they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a</a>
<a id='line_195'>beast: for all is vanity.</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>3:20 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust</a>
<a id='line_198'>again.</a>
<a id='line_199'></a>
<a id='line_200'>3:21 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit</a>
<a id='line_201'>of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?  3:22 Wherefore I</a>
<a id='line_202'>perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice</a>
<a id='line_203'>in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to</a>
<a id='line_204'>see what shall be after him?  4:1 So I returned, and considered all</a>
<a id='line_205'>the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of</a>
<a id='line_206'>such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of</a>
<a id='line_207'>their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.</a>
<a id='line_208'></a>
<a id='line_209'>4:2 Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the</a>
<a id='line_210'>living which are yet alive.</a>
<a id='line_211'></a>
<a id='line_212'>4:3 Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who</a>
<a id='line_213'>hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</a>
<a id='line_214'></a>
<a id='line_215'>4:4 Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for</a>
<a id='line_216'>this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and</a>
<a id='line_217'>vexation of spirit.</a>
<a id='line_218'></a>
<a id='line_219'>4:5 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</a>
<a id='line_220'></a>
<a id='line_221'>4:6 Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with</a>
<a id='line_222'>travail and vexation of spirit.</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>4:7 Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</a>
<a id='line_225'></a>
<a id='line_226'>4:8 There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath</a>
<a id='line_227'>neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour;</a>
<a id='line_228'>neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom</a>
<a id='line_229'>do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it</a>
<a id='line_230'>is a sore travail.</a>
<a id='line_231'></a>
<a id='line_232'>4:9 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their</a>
<a id='line_233'>labour.</a>
<a id='line_234'></a>
<a id='line_235'>4:10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him</a>
<a id='line_236'>that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.</a>
<a id='line_237'></a>
<a id='line_238'>4:11 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one</a>
<a id='line_239'>be warm alone?  4:12 And if one prevail against him, two shall</a>
<a id='line_240'>withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</a>
<a id='line_241'></a>
<a id='line_242'>4:13 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king,</a>
<a id='line_243'>who will no more be admonished.</a>
<a id='line_244'></a>
<a id='line_245'>4:14 For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is</a>
<a id='line_246'>born in his kingdom becometh poor.</a>
<a id='line_247'></a>
<a id='line_248'>4:15 I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the</a>
<a id='line_249'>second child that shall stand up in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_250'></a>
<a id='line_251'>4:16 There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been</a>
<a id='line_252'>before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him.</a>
<a id='line_253'>Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</a>
<a id='line_254'></a>
<a id='line_255'>5:1 Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more</a>
<a id='line_256'>ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider</a>
<a id='line_257'>not that they do evil.</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>5:2 Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to</a>
<a id='line_260'>utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth:</a>
<a id='line_261'>therefore let thy words be few.</a>
<a id='line_262'></a>
<a id='line_263'>5:3 For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool’s</a>
<a id='line_264'>voice is known by multitude of words.</a>
<a id='line_265'></a>
<a id='line_266'>5:4 When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath</a>
<a id='line_267'>no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.</a>
<a id='line_268'></a>
<a id='line_269'>5:5 Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest</a>
<a id='line_270'>vow and not pay.</a>
<a id='line_271'></a>
<a id='line_272'>5:6 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou</a>
<a id='line_273'>before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry</a>
<a id='line_274'>at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?  5:7 For in the</a>
<a id='line_275'>multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but</a>
<a id='line_276'>fear thou God.</a>
<a id='line_277'></a>
<a id='line_278'>5:8 If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting</a>
<a id='line_279'>of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for</a>
<a id='line_280'>he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than</a>
<a id='line_281'>they.</a>
<a id='line_282'></a>
<a id='line_283'>5:9 Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is</a>
<a id='line_284'>served by the field.</a>
<a id='line_285'></a>
<a id='line_286'>5:10 He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he</a>
<a id='line_287'>that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.</a>
<a id='line_288'></a>
<a id='line_289'>5:11 When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what</a>
<a id='line_290'>good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with</a>
<a id='line_291'>their eyes?  5:12 The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he</a>
<a id='line_292'>eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him</a>
<a id='line_293'>to sleep.</a>
<a id='line_294'></a>
<a id='line_295'>5:13 There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely,</a>
<a id='line_296'>riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.</a>
<a id='line_297'></a>
<a id='line_298'>5:14 But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son,</a>
<a id='line_299'>and there is nothing in his hand.</a>
<a id='line_300'></a>
<a id='line_301'>5:15 As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to</a>
<a id='line_302'>go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may</a>
<a id='line_303'>carry away in his hand.</a>
<a id='line_304'></a>
<a id='line_305'>5:16 And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so</a>
<a id='line_306'>shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?</a>
<a id='line_307'>5:17 All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow</a>
<a id='line_308'>and wrath with his sickness.</a>
<a id='line_309'></a>
<a id='line_310'>5:18 Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to</a>
<a id='line_311'>eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he</a>
<a id='line_312'>taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him:</a>
<a id='line_313'>for it is his portion.</a>
<a id='line_314'></a>
<a id='line_315'>5:19 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath</a>
<a id='line_316'>given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to</a>
<a id='line_317'>rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.</a>
<a id='line_318'></a>
<a id='line_319'>5:20 For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God</a>
<a id='line_320'>answereth him in the joy of his heart.</a>
<a id='line_321'></a>
<a id='line_322'>6:1 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common</a>
<a id='line_323'>among men: 6:2 A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and</a>
<a id='line_324'>honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he</a>
<a id='line_325'>desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger</a>
<a id='line_326'>eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.</a>
<a id='line_327'></a>
<a id='line_328'>6:3 If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that</a>
<a id='line_329'>the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good,</a>
<a id='line_330'>and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is</a>
<a id='line_331'>better than he.</a>
<a id='line_332'></a>
<a id='line_333'>6:4 For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his</a>
<a id='line_334'>name shall be covered with darkness.</a>
<a id='line_335'></a>
<a id='line_336'>6:5 Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath</a>
<a id='line_337'>more rest than the other.</a>
<a id='line_338'></a>
<a id='line_339'>6:6 Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen</a>
<a id='line_340'>no good: do not all go to one place?  6:7 All the labour of man is for</a>
<a id='line_341'>his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.</a>
<a id='line_342'></a>
<a id='line_343'>6:8 For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor,</a>
<a id='line_344'>that knoweth to walk before the living?  6:9 Better is the sight of</a>
<a id='line_345'>the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and</a>
<a id='line_346'>vexation of spirit.</a>
<a id='line_347'></a>
<a id='line_348'>6:10 That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is</a>
<a id='line_349'>man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.</a>
<a id='line_350'></a>
<a id='line_351'>6:11 Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the</a>
<a id='line_352'>better?  6:12 For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all</a>
<a id='line_353'>the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can</a>
<a id='line_354'>tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?  7:1 A good name is</a>
<a id='line_355'>better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of</a>
<a id='line_356'>one’s birth.</a>
<a id='line_357'></a>
<a id='line_358'>7:2 It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the</a>
<a id='line_359'>house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will</a>
<a id='line_360'>lay it to his heart.</a>
<a id='line_361'></a>
<a id='line_362'>7:3 Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the</a>
<a id='line_363'>countenance the heart is made better.</a>
<a id='line_364'></a>
<a id='line_365'>7:4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart</a>
<a id='line_366'>of fools is in the house of mirth.</a>
<a id='line_367'></a>
<a id='line_368'>7:5 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to</a>
<a id='line_369'>hear the song of fools.</a>
<a id='line_370'></a>
<a id='line_371'>7:6 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of</a>
<a id='line_372'>the fool: this also is vanity.</a>
<a id='line_373'></a>
<a id='line_374'>7:7 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the</a>
<a id='line_375'>heart.</a>
<a id='line_376'></a>
<a id='line_377'>7:8 Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the</a>
<a id='line_378'>patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</a>
<a id='line_379'></a>
<a id='line_380'>7:9 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the</a>
<a id='line_381'>bosom of fools.</a>
<a id='line_382'></a>
<a id='line_383'>7:10 Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better</a>
<a id='line_384'>than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.</a>
<a id='line_385'></a>
<a id='line_386'>7:11 Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to</a>
<a id='line_387'>them that see the sun.</a>
<a id='line_388'></a>
<a id='line_389'>7:12 For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the</a>
<a id='line_390'>excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have</a>
<a id='line_391'>it.</a>
<a id='line_392'></a>
<a id='line_393'>7:13 Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which</a>
<a id='line_394'>he hath made crooked?  7:14 In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in</a>
<a id='line_395'>the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against</a>
<a id='line_396'>the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</a>
<a id='line_397'></a>
<a id='line_398'>7:15 All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just</a>
<a id='line_399'>man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man</a>
<a id='line_400'>that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.</a>
<a id='line_401'></a>
<a id='line_402'>7:16 Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why</a>
<a id='line_403'>shouldest thou destroy thyself ?  7:17 Be not over much wicked,</a>
<a id='line_404'>neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?  7:18</a>
<a id='line_405'>It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this</a>
<a id='line_406'>withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of</a>
<a id='line_407'>them all.</a>
<a id='line_408'></a>
<a id='line_409'>7:19 Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are</a>
<a id='line_410'>in the city.</a>
<a id='line_411'></a>
<a id='line_412'>7:20 For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and</a>
<a id='line_413'>sinneth not.</a>
<a id='line_414'></a>
<a id='line_415'>7:21 Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear</a>
<a id='line_416'>thy servant curse thee: 7:22 For oftentimes also thine own heart</a>
<a id='line_417'>knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</a>
<a id='line_418'></a>
<a id='line_419'>7:23 All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it</a>
<a id='line_420'>was far from me.</a>
<a id='line_421'></a>
<a id='line_422'>7:24 That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?</a>
<a id='line_423'>7:25 I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out</a>
<a id='line_424'>wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly,</a>
<a id='line_425'>even of foolishness and madness: 7:26 And I find more bitter than</a>
<a id='line_426'>death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as</a>
<a id='line_427'>bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall</a>
<a id='line_428'>be taken by her.</a>
<a id='line_429'></a>
<a id='line_430'>7:27 Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by</a>
<a id='line_431'>one, to find out the account: 7:28 Which yet my soul seeketh, but I</a>
<a id='line_432'>find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all</a>
<a id='line_433'>those have I not found.</a>
<a id='line_434'></a>
<a id='line_435'>7:29 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but</a>
<a id='line_436'>they have sought out many inventions.</a>
<a id='line_437'></a>
<a id='line_438'>8:1 Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a</a>
<a id='line_439'>thing?  a man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of</a>
<a id='line_440'>his face shall be changed.</a>
<a id='line_441'></a>
<a id='line_442'>8:2 I counsel thee to keep the king’s commandment, and that in regard</a>
<a id='line_443'>of the oath of God.</a>
<a id='line_444'></a>
<a id='line_445'>8:3 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing;</a>
<a id='line_446'>for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</a>
<a id='line_447'></a>
<a id='line_448'>8:4 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto</a>
<a id='line_449'>him, What doest thou?  8:5 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no</a>
<a id='line_450'>evil thing: and a wise man’s heart discerneth both time and judgment.</a>
<a id='line_451'></a>
<a id='line_452'>8:6 Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the</a>
<a id='line_453'>misery of man is great upon him.</a>
<a id='line_454'></a>
<a id='line_455'>8:7 For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when</a>
<a id='line_456'>it shall be?  8:8 There is no man that hath power over the spirit to</a>
<a id='line_457'>retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and</a>
<a id='line_458'>there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver</a>
<a id='line_459'>those that are given to it.</a>
<a id='line_460'></a>
<a id='line_461'>8:9 All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is</a>
<a id='line_462'>done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over</a>
<a id='line_463'>another to his own hurt.</a>
<a id='line_464'></a>
<a id='line_465'>8:10 And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the</a>
<a id='line_466'>place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had</a>
<a id='line_467'>so done: this is also vanity.</a>
<a id='line_468'></a>
<a id='line_469'>8:11 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,</a>
<a id='line_470'>therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do</a>
<a id='line_471'>evil.</a>
<a id='line_472'></a>
<a id='line_473'>8:12 Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be</a>
<a id='line_474'>prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear</a>
<a id='line_475'>God, which fear before him: 8:13 But it shall not be well with the</a>
<a id='line_476'>wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow;</a>
<a id='line_477'>because he feareth not before God.</a>
<a id='line_478'></a>
<a id='line_479'>8:14 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be</a>
<a id='line_480'>just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked;</a>
<a id='line_481'>again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work</a>
<a id='line_482'>of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.</a>
<a id='line_483'></a>
<a id='line_484'>8:15 Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under</a>
<a id='line_485'>the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall</a>
<a id='line_486'>abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth</a>
<a id='line_487'>him under the sun.</a>
<a id='line_488'></a>
<a id='line_489'>8:16 When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business</a>
<a id='line_490'>that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor</a>
<a id='line_491'>night seeth sleep with his eyes:) 8:17 Then I beheld all the work of</a>
<a id='line_492'>God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun:</a>
<a id='line_493'>because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it;</a>
<a id='line_494'>yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be</a>
<a id='line_495'>able to find it.</a>
<a id='line_496'></a>
<a id='line_497'>9:1 For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this,</a>
<a id='line_498'>that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of</a>
<a id='line_499'>God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them.</a>
<a id='line_500'></a>
<a id='line_501'>9:2 All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous,</a>
<a id='line_502'>and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean;</a>
<a id='line_503'>to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the</a>
<a id='line_504'>good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an</a>
<a id='line_505'>oath.</a>
<a id='line_506'></a>
<a id='line_507'>9:3 This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that</a>
<a id='line_508'>there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is</a>
<a id='line_509'>full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after</a>
<a id='line_510'>that they go to the dead.</a>
<a id='line_511'></a>
<a id='line_512'>9:4 For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a</a>
<a id='line_513'>living dog is better than a dead lion.</a>
<a id='line_514'></a>
<a id='line_515'>9:5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any</a>
<a id='line_516'>thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is</a>
<a id='line_517'>forgotten.</a>
<a id='line_518'></a>
<a id='line_519'>9:6 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now</a>
<a id='line_520'>perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing</a>
<a id='line_521'>that is done under the sun.</a>
<a id='line_522'></a>
<a id='line_523'>9:7 Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a</a>
<a id='line_524'>merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.</a>
<a id='line_525'></a>
<a id='line_526'>9:8 Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no</a>
<a id='line_527'>ointment.</a>
<a id='line_528'></a>
<a id='line_529'>9:9 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the</a>
<a id='line_530'>life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the</a>
<a id='line_531'>days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy</a>
<a id='line_532'>labour which thou takest under the sun.</a>
<a id='line_533'></a>
<a id='line_534'>9:10 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for</a>
<a id='line_535'>there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave,</a>
<a id='line_536'>whither thou goest.</a>
<a id='line_537'></a>
<a id='line_538'>9:11 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the</a>
<a id='line_539'>swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise,</a>
<a id='line_540'>nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of</a>
<a id='line_541'>skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</a>
<a id='line_542'></a>
<a id='line_543'>9:12 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken</a>
<a id='line_544'>in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are</a>
<a id='line_545'>the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon</a>
<a id='line_546'>them.</a>
<a id='line_547'></a>
<a id='line_548'>9:13 This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great</a>
<a id='line_549'>unto me: 9:14 There was a little city, and few men within it; and</a>
<a id='line_550'>there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great</a>
<a id='line_551'>bulwarks against it: 9:15 Now there was found in it a poor wise man,</a>
<a id='line_552'>and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that</a>
<a id='line_553'>same poor man.</a>
<a id='line_554'></a>
<a id='line_555'>9:16 Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the</a>
<a id='line_556'>poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.</a>
<a id='line_557'></a>
<a id='line_558'>9:17 The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him</a>
<a id='line_559'>that ruleth among fools.</a>
<a id='line_560'></a>
<a id='line_561'>9:18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth</a>
<a id='line_562'>much good.</a>
<a id='line_563'></a>
<a id='line_564'>10:1 Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a</a>
<a id='line_565'>stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for</a>
<a id='line_566'>wisdom and honour.</a>
<a id='line_567'></a>
<a id='line_568'>10:2 A wise man’s heart is at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at</a>
<a id='line_569'>his left.</a>
<a id='line_570'></a>
<a id='line_571'>10:3 Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom</a>
<a id='line_572'>faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.</a>
<a id='line_573'></a>
<a id='line_574'>10:4 If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy</a>
<a id='line_575'>place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.</a>
<a id='line_576'></a>
<a id='line_577'>10:5 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error</a>
<a id='line_578'>which proceedeth from the ruler: 10:6 Folly is set in great dignity,</a>
<a id='line_579'>and the rich sit in low place.</a>
<a id='line_580'></a>
<a id='line_581'>10:7 I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants</a>
<a id='line_582'>upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_583'></a>
<a id='line_584'>10:8 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an</a>
<a id='line_585'>hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</a>
<a id='line_586'></a>
<a id='line_587'>10:9 Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that</a>
<a id='line_588'>cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.</a>
<a id='line_589'></a>
<a id='line_590'>10:10 If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he</a>
<a id='line_591'>put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.</a>
<a id='line_592'></a>
<a id='line_593'>10:11 Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler</a>
<a id='line_594'>is no better.</a>
<a id='line_595'></a>
<a id='line_596'>10:12 The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a</a>
<a id='line_597'>fool will swallow up himself.</a>
<a id='line_598'></a>
<a id='line_599'>10:13 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the</a>
<a id='line_600'>end of his talk is mischievous madness.</a>
<a id='line_601'></a>
<a id='line_602'>10:14 A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be;</a>
<a id='line_603'>and what shall be after him, who can tell him?  10:15 The labour of</a>
<a id='line_604'>the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to</a>
<a id='line_605'>go to the city.</a>
<a id='line_606'></a>
<a id='line_607'>10:16 Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes</a>
<a id='line_608'>eat in the morning!  10:17 Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is</a>
<a id='line_609'>the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength,</a>
<a id='line_610'>and not for drunkenness!  10:18 By much slothfulness the building</a>
<a id='line_611'>decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth</a>
<a id='line_612'>through.</a>
<a id='line_613'></a>
<a id='line_614'>10:19 A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money</a>
<a id='line_615'>answereth all things.</a>
<a id='line_616'></a>
<a id='line_617'>10:20 Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the</a>
<a id='line_618'>rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice,</a>
<a id='line_619'>and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</a>

<a id='line_621'>11:1 Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many</a>
<a id='line_622'>days.</a>
<a id='line_623'></a>
<a id='line_624'>11:2 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not</a>

<a id='line_630'></a>
<a id='line_631'>11:4 He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth</a>

<a id='line_637'></a>
<a id='line_638'>11:6 In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not</a>

<a id='line_641'></a>
<a id='line_642'>11:7 Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes</a>
<a id='line_643'>to behold the sun: 11:8 But if a man live many years, and rejoice in</a>
<a id='line_644'>them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be</a>
<a id='line_645'>many. All that cometh is vanity.</a>
<a id='line_646'></a>
<a id='line_647'>11:9 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee</a>
<a id='line_648'>in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in</a>
<a id='line_649'>the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God</a>
<a id='line_650'>will bring thee into judgment.</a>
<a id='line_651'></a>
<a id='line_652'>11:10 Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from</a>
<a id='line_653'>thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.</a>
<a id='line_654'></a>
<a id='line_655'>12:1 Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil</a>
<a id='line_656'>days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no</a>
<a id='line_657'>pleasure in them; 12:2 While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or</a>
<a id='line_658'>the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: 12:3</a>
<a id='line_659'>In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong</a>
<a id='line_660'>men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few,</a>
<a id='line_661'>and those that look out of the windows be darkened, 12:4 And the doors</a>
<a id='line_662'>shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low,</a>
<a id='line_663'>and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters</a>
<a id='line_664'>of musick shall be brought low; 12:5 Also when they shall be afraid of</a>
<a id='line_665'>that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree</a>
<a id='line_666'>shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire</a>
<a id='line_667'>shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go</a>
<a id='line_668'>about the streets: 12:6 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the</a>
<a id='line_669'>golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or</a>
<a id='line_670'>the wheel broken at the cistern.</a>
<a id='line_671'></a>
<a id='line_672'>12:7 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit</a>
<a id='line_673'>shall return unto God who gave it.</a>

<a id='line_675'>12:8 Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.</a>
<a id='line_676'></a>
<a id='line_677'>12:9 And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the</a>
<a id='line_678'>people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in</a>
<a id='line_679'>order many proverbs.</a>
<a id='line_680'></a>
<a id='line_681'>12:10 The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which</a>
<a id='line_682'>was written was upright, even words of truth.</a>
<a id='line_683'></a>
<a id='line_684'>12:11 The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the</a>
<a id='line_685'>masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.</a>
<a id='line_686'></a>
<a id='line_687'>12:12 And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many</a>
<a id='line_688'>books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.</a>
<a id='line_689'></a>
<a id='line_690'>12:13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and</a>
<a id='line_691'>keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.</a>
<a id='line_692'></a>
<a id='line_693'>12:14 For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret</a>
<a id='line_694'>thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</a>
