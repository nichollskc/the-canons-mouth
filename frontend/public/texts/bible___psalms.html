<a id='line_3'>1:1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,</a>
<a id='line_4'>nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the</a>
<a id='line_5'>scornful.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>1:2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he</a>
<a id='line_8'>meditate day and night.</a>
<a id='line_9'></a>
<a id='line_10'>1:3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that</a>
<a id='line_11'>bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not</a>
<a id='line_12'>wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</a>
<a id='line_13'></a>
<a id='line_14'>1:4 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind</a>
<a id='line_15'>driveth away.</a>
<a id='line_16'></a>
<a id='line_17'>1:5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners</a>
<a id='line_18'>in the congregation of the righteous.</a>
<a id='line_19'></a>
<a id='line_20'>1:6 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the</a>
<a id='line_21'>ungodly shall perish.</a>

<a id='line_23'></a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'>2:1 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</a>
<a id='line_26'></a>
<a id='line_27'>2:2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel</a>
<a id='line_28'>together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>2:3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from</a>
<a id='line_31'>us.</a>
<a id='line_32'></a>
<a id='line_33'>2:4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have</a>
<a id='line_34'>them in derision.</a>
<a id='line_35'></a>
<a id='line_36'>2:5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his</a>
<a id='line_37'>sore displeasure.</a>
<a id='line_38'></a>
<a id='line_39'>2:6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</a>
<a id='line_40'></a>
<a id='line_41'>2:7 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my</a>
<a id='line_42'>Son; this day have I begotten thee.</a>
<a id='line_43'></a>
<a id='line_44'>2:8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine</a>
<a id='line_45'>inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.</a>
<a id='line_46'></a>
<a id='line_47'>2:9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in</a>
<a id='line_48'>pieces like a potter’s vessel.</a>
<a id='line_49'></a>
<a id='line_50'>2:10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of</a>
<a id='line_51'>the earth.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>2:11 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</a>
<a id='line_54'></a>
<a id='line_55'>2:12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when</a>
<a id='line_56'>his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their</a>

<a id='line_73'>holy hill. Selah.</a>
<a id='line_74'></a>
<a id='line_75'>3:5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.</a>
<a id='line_76'></a>
<a id='line_77'>3:6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set</a>
<a id='line_78'>themselves against me round about.</a>
<a id='line_79'></a>
<a id='line_80'>3:7 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine</a>
<a id='line_81'>enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the</a>
<a id='line_82'>ungodly.</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>3:8 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy</a>

<a id='line_88'></a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'></a>
<a id='line_91'>4:1 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged</a>
<a id='line_92'>me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>4:2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how</a>
<a id='line_95'>long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.</a>
<a id='line_96'></a>
<a id='line_97'>4:3 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for</a>
<a id='line_98'>himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.</a>
<a id='line_99'></a>
<a id='line_100'>4:4 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your</a>
<a id='line_101'>bed, and be still. Selah.</a>
<a id='line_102'></a>
<a id='line_103'>4:5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the</a>
<a id='line_104'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>4:6 There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou</a>
<a id='line_107'>up the light of thy countenance upon us.</a>
<a id='line_108'></a>
<a id='line_109'>4:7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that</a>
<a id='line_110'>their corn and their wine increased.</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'>4:8 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only</a>
<a id='line_113'>makest me dwell in safety.</a>
<a id='line_114'></a>
<a id='line_115'></a>
<a id='line_116'></a>
<a id='line_117'>5:1 Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.</a>
<a id='line_118'></a>
<a id='line_119'>5:2 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto</a>
<a id='line_120'>thee will I pray.</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>5:3 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning</a>
<a id='line_123'>will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</a>
<a id='line_124'></a>
<a id='line_125'>5:4 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither</a>
<a id='line_126'>shall evil dwell with thee.</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>5:5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers</a>
<a id='line_129'>of iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_130'></a>
<a id='line_131'>5:6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor</a>
<a id='line_132'>the bloody and deceitful man.</a>
<a id='line_133'></a>
<a id='line_134'>5:7 But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy</a>
<a id='line_135'>mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.</a>
<a id='line_136'></a>
<a id='line_137'>5:8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;</a>
<a id='line_138'>make thy way straight before my face.</a>
<a id='line_139'></a>
<a id='line_140'>5:9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is</a>
<a id='line_141'>very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with</a>
<a id='line_142'>their tongue.</a>
<a id='line_143'></a>
<a id='line_144'>5:10 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels;</a>
<a id='line_145'>cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have</a>
<a id='line_146'>rebelled against thee.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>5:11 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them</a>
<a id='line_149'>ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that</a>
<a id='line_150'>love thy name be joyful in thee.</a>
<a id='line_151'></a>
<a id='line_152'>5:12 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou</a>
<a id='line_153'>compass him as with a shield.</a>

<a id='line_159'></a>
<a id='line_160'>6:2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my</a>

<a id='line_162'></a>
<a id='line_163'>6:3 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?</a>

<a id='line_165'>6:4 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies’ sake.</a>
<a id='line_166'></a>
<a id='line_167'>6:5 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who</a>
<a id='line_168'>shall give thee thanks?</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>6:6 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim;</a>
<a id='line_171'>I water my couch with my tears.</a>
<a id='line_172'></a>
<a id='line_173'>6:7 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of</a>

<a id='line_176'>6:8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath</a>

<a id='line_180'>prayer.</a>
<a id='line_181'></a>
<a id='line_182'>6:10 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return</a>

<a id='line_196'>7:4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea,</a>

<a id='line_200'>down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>7:6 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage</a>
<a id='line_203'>of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast</a>
<a id='line_204'>commanded.</a>
<a id='line_205'></a>
<a id='line_206'>7:7 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for</a>

<a id='line_212'>7:9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish</a>

<a id='line_214'></a>
<a id='line_215'>7:10 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.</a>

<a id='line_221'>made it ready.</a>

<a id='line_225'></a>
<a id='line_226'>7:14 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief,</a>
<a id='line_227'>and brought forth falsehood.</a>
<a id='line_228'></a>
<a id='line_229'>7:15 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which</a>

<a id='line_256'>8:6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou</a>

<a id='line_601'></a>
<a id='line_602'>18:7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the</a>

<a id='line_606'>mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</a>
<a id='line_607'></a>
<a id='line_608'>18:9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under</a>

<a id='line_610'></a>
<a id='line_611'>18:10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the</a>

<a id='line_613'></a>
<a id='line_614'>18:11 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him</a>

<a id='line_616'></a>
<a id='line_617'>18:12 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed,</a>
<a id='line_618'>hail stones and coals of fire.</a>
<a id='line_619'></a>
<a id='line_620'>18:13 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his</a>

<a id='line_625'></a>
<a id='line_626'>18:15 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of</a>

<a id='line_629'></a>
<a id='line_630'>18:16 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</a>
<a id='line_631'></a>
<a id='line_632'>18:17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated</a>

<a id='line_637'></a>
<a id='line_638'>18:19 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,</a>

<a id='line_640'></a>
<a id='line_641'>18:20 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to</a>
<a id='line_642'>the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</a>
<a id='line_643'></a>
<a id='line_644'>18:21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly</a>
<a id='line_645'>departed from my God.</a>
<a id='line_646'></a>

<a id='line_649'></a>
<a id='line_650'>18:23 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine</a>

<a id='line_655'></a>
<a id='line_656'>18:25 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an</a>
<a id='line_657'>upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;</a>
<a id='line_658'></a>
<a id='line_659'>18:26 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward</a>

<a id='line_667'></a>
<a id='line_668'>18:29 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I</a>

<a id='line_670'></a>
<a id='line_671'>18:30 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried:</a>

<a id='line_674'>18:31 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?</a>

<a id='line_676'>18:32 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way</a>

<a id='line_678'></a>
<a id='line_679'>18:33 He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, and setteth me upon my high</a>

<a id='line_683'>mine arms.</a>
<a id='line_684'></a>
<a id='line_685'>18:35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy</a>
<a id='line_686'>right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</a>
<a id='line_687'></a>
<a id='line_688'>18:36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</a>
<a id='line_689'></a>
<a id='line_690'>18:37 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I</a>
<a id='line_691'>turn again till they were consumed.</a>
<a id='line_692'></a>
<a id='line_693'>18:38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are</a>
<a id='line_694'>fallen under my feet.</a>
<a id='line_695'></a>
<a id='line_696'>18:39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast</a>
<a id='line_697'>subdued under me those that rose up against me.</a>
<a id='line_698'></a>
<a id='line_699'>18:40 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might</a>
<a id='line_700'>destroy them that hate me.</a>
<a id='line_701'></a>
<a id='line_702'>18:41 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_703'>but he answered them not.</a>
<a id='line_704'></a>
<a id='line_705'>18:42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did</a>
<a id='line_706'>cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</a>
<a id='line_707'></a>
<a id='line_708'>18:43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and</a>

<a id='line_711'></a>
<a id='line_712'>18:44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers</a>

<a id='line_1748'>38:5 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.</a>
<a id='line_1749'></a>
<a id='line_1750'>38:6 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day</a>
<a id='line_1751'>long.</a>
<a id='line_1752'></a>
<a id='line_1753'>38:7 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no</a>
<a id='line_1754'>soundness in my flesh.</a>
<a id='line_1755'></a>
<a id='line_1756'>38:8 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the</a>
<a id='line_1757'>disquietness of my heart.</a>
<a id='line_1758'></a>
<a id='line_1759'>38:9 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid</a>
<a id='line_1760'>from thee.</a>
<a id='line_1761'></a>
<a id='line_1762'>38:10 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of</a>
<a id='line_1763'>mine eyes, it also is gone from me.</a>
<a id='line_1764'></a>
<a id='line_1765'>38:11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my</a>
<a id='line_1766'>kinsmen stand afar off.</a>
<a id='line_1767'></a>
<a id='line_1768'>38:12 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they</a>
<a id='line_1769'>that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all</a>
<a id='line_1770'>the day long.</a>
<a id='line_1771'></a>
<a id='line_1772'>38:13 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that</a>
<a id='line_1773'>openeth not his mouth.</a>
<a id='line_1774'></a>
<a id='line_1775'>38:14 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no</a>
<a id='line_1776'>reproofs.</a>
<a id='line_1777'></a>
<a id='line_1778'>38:15 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.</a>
<a id='line_1779'></a>
<a id='line_1780'>38:16 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me:</a>
<a id='line_1781'>when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.</a>
<a id='line_1782'></a>
<a id='line_1783'>38:17 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.</a>
<a id='line_1784'></a>
<a id='line_1785'>38:18 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.</a>
<a id='line_1786'></a>
<a id='line_1787'>38:19 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that</a>
<a id='line_1788'>hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</a>
<a id='line_1789'></a>
<a id='line_1790'>38:20 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries;</a>
<a id='line_1791'>because I follow the thing that good is.</a>
<a id='line_1792'></a>
<a id='line_1793'>38:21 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.</a>
<a id='line_1794'></a>
<a id='line_1795'>38:22 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.</a>
<a id='line_1796'></a>
<a id='line_1797'></a>
<a id='line_1798'></a>
<a id='line_1799'>39:1 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my</a>
<a id='line_1800'>tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before</a>
<a id='line_1801'>me.</a>
<a id='line_1802'></a>
<a id='line_1803'>39:2 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my</a>
<a id='line_1804'>sorrow was stirred.</a>
<a id='line_1805'></a>
<a id='line_1806'>39:3 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned:</a>
<a id='line_1807'>then spake I with my tongue,</a>
<a id='line_1808'></a>
<a id='line_1809'>39:4 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what</a>
<a id='line_1810'>it is: that I may know how frail I am.</a>
<a id='line_1811'></a>
<a id='line_1812'>39:5 Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is</a>
<a id='line_1813'>as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is</a>

<a id='line_1816'>Selah.</a>
<a id='line_1817'></a>
<a id='line_1818'>39:6 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are</a>

<a id='line_1821'></a>
<a id='line_1822'>39:7 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.</a>
<a id='line_1823'></a>
<a id='line_1824'>39:8 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach</a>

<a id='line_1826'></a>
<a id='line_1827'>39:9 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.</a>
<a id='line_1828'></a>
<a id='line_1829'>39:10 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of</a>
<a id='line_1830'>thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_1831'></a>
<a id='line_1832'>39:11 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou</a>
<a id='line_1833'>makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is</a>

<a id='line_1835'></a>
<a id='line_1836'>39:12 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy</a>
<a id='line_1837'>peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as</a>
<a id='line_1838'>all my fathers were.</a>
<a id='line_1839'></a>
<a id='line_1840'>39:13 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and</a>

<a id='line_1842'></a>
<a id='line_1843'></a>
<a id='line_1844'></a>
<a id='line_1845'>40:1 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and</a>
<a id='line_1846'>heard my cry.</a>
<a id='line_1847'></a>
<a id='line_1848'>40:2 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry</a>
<a id='line_1849'>clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.</a>
<a id='line_1850'></a>
<a id='line_1851'>40:3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God:</a>
<a id='line_1852'>many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1853'></a>
<a id='line_1854'>40:4 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and</a>
<a id='line_1855'>respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.</a>
<a id='line_1856'></a>
<a id='line_1857'>40:5 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast</a>
<a id='line_1858'>done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned</a>
<a id='line_1859'>up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are</a>
<a id='line_1860'>more than can be numbered.</a>
<a id='line_1861'></a>
<a id='line_1862'>40:6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou</a>
<a id='line_1863'>opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.</a>
<a id='line_1864'></a>
<a id='line_1865'>40:7 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written</a>
<a id='line_1866'>of me,</a>
<a id='line_1867'></a>
<a id='line_1868'>40:8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my</a>

<a id='line_1870'></a>
<a id='line_1871'>40:9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I</a>
<a id='line_1872'>have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.</a>
<a id='line_1873'></a>
<a id='line_1874'>40:10 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have</a>
<a id='line_1875'>declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy</a>

<a id='line_1877'></a>
<a id='line_1878'>40:11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy</a>
<a id='line_1879'>lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.</a>
<a id='line_1880'></a>
<a id='line_1881'>40:12 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities</a>
<a id='line_1882'>have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are</a>

<a id='line_1884'></a>
<a id='line_1885'>40:13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help</a>

<a id='line_1891'></a>
<a id='line_1892'>40:15 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto</a>

<a id='line_1894'></a>
<a id='line_1895'>40:16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let</a>

<a id='line_1897'></a>
<a id='line_1898'>40:17 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art</a>

<a id='line_1909'></a>
<a id='line_1910'>41:3 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou</a>

<a id='line_1912'></a>
<a id='line_1913'>41:4 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have</a>

<a id='line_1915'></a>
<a id='line_1916'>41:5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name</a>

<a id='line_1918'></a>
<a id='line_1919'>41:6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth</a>
<a id='line_1920'>iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.</a>
<a id='line_1921'></a>
<a id='line_1922'>41:7 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they</a>
<a id='line_1923'>devise my hurt.</a>
<a id='line_1924'></a>
<a id='line_1925'>41:8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that</a>

<a id='line_1927'></a>
<a id='line_1928'>41:9 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat</a>

<a id='line_1930'></a>
<a id='line_1931'>41:10 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I</a>

<a id='line_1933'></a>

<a id='line_1936'></a>
<a id='line_1937'>41:12 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest</a>
<a id='line_1938'>me before thy face for ever.</a>
<a id='line_1939'></a>
<a id='line_1940'>41:13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to</a>

<a id='line_1976'>42:10 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while</a>

<a id='line_2009'>44:3 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,</a>

<a id='line_3452'>walketh through the earth.</a>
<a id='line_3453'></a>
<a id='line_3454'>73:10 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are</a>
<a id='line_3455'>wrung out to them.</a>
<a id='line_3456'></a>
<a id='line_3457'>73:11 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the</a>

<a id='line_3459'></a>
<a id='line_3460'>73:12 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they</a>
<a id='line_3461'>increase in riches.</a>
<a id='line_3462'></a>
<a id='line_3463'>73:13 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in</a>
<a id='line_3464'>innocency.</a>
<a id='line_3465'></a>
<a id='line_3466'>73:14 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every</a>
<a id='line_3467'>morning.</a>
<a id='line_3468'></a>
<a id='line_3469'>73:15 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the</a>
<a id='line_3470'>generation of thy children.</a>
<a id='line_3471'></a>
<a id='line_3472'>73:16 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;</a>
<a id='line_3473'></a>
<a id='line_3474'>73:17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their</a>
<a id='line_3475'>end.</a>
<a id='line_3476'></a>
<a id='line_3477'>73:18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst</a>
<a id='line_3478'>them down into destruction.</a>
<a id='line_3479'></a>
<a id='line_3480'>73:19 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are</a>
<a id='line_3481'>utterly consumed with terrors.</a>
<a id='line_3482'></a>
<a id='line_3483'>73:20 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou</a>
<a id='line_3484'>shalt despise their image.</a>
<a id='line_3485'></a>
<a id='line_3486'>73:21 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.</a>
<a id='line_3487'></a>
<a id='line_3488'>73:22 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.</a>
<a id='line_3489'></a>
<a id='line_3490'>73:23 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by</a>
<a id='line_3491'>my right hand.</a>
<a id='line_3492'></a>
<a id='line_3493'>73:24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me</a>
<a id='line_3494'>to glory.</a>
<a id='line_3495'></a>
<a id='line_3496'>73:25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth</a>
<a id='line_3497'>that I desire beside thee.</a>
<a id='line_3498'></a>
<a id='line_3499'>73:26 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my</a>
<a id='line_3500'>heart, and my portion for ever.</a>
<a id='line_3501'></a>
<a id='line_3502'>73:27 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast</a>
<a id='line_3503'>destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</a>
<a id='line_3504'></a>
<a id='line_3505'>73:28 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust</a>
<a id='line_3506'>in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.</a>
<a id='line_3507'></a>
<a id='line_3508'></a>
<a id='line_3509'></a>
<a id='line_3510'>74:1 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger</a>
<a id='line_3511'>smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?</a>
<a id='line_3512'></a>
<a id='line_3513'>74:2 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the</a>
<a id='line_3514'>rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion,</a>
<a id='line_3515'>wherein thou hast dwelt.</a>
<a id='line_3516'></a>
<a id='line_3517'>74:3 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that</a>
<a id='line_3518'>the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.</a>
<a id='line_3519'></a>
<a id='line_3520'>74:4 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up</a>
<a id='line_3521'>their ensigns for signs.</a>
<a id='line_3522'></a>
<a id='line_3523'>74:5 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the</a>
<a id='line_3524'>thick trees.</a>
<a id='line_3525'></a>
<a id='line_3526'>74:6 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes</a>
<a id='line_3527'>and hammers.</a>
<a id='line_3528'></a>
<a id='line_3529'>74:7 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by</a>
<a id='line_3530'>casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.</a>
<a id='line_3531'></a>
<a id='line_3532'>74:8 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they</a>
<a id='line_3533'>have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.</a>
<a id='line_3534'></a>
<a id='line_3535'>74:9 We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is</a>
<a id='line_3536'>there among us any that knoweth how long.</a>
<a id='line_3537'></a>
<a id='line_3538'>74:10 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy</a>
<a id='line_3539'>blaspheme thy name for ever?</a>
<a id='line_3540'></a>
<a id='line_3541'>74:11 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out</a>
<a id='line_3542'>of thy bosom.</a>
<a id='line_3543'></a>
<a id='line_3544'>74:12 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_3545'>earth.</a>
<a id='line_3546'></a>
<a id='line_3547'>74:13 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the</a>
<a id='line_3548'>heads of the dragons in the waters.</a>
<a id='line_3549'></a>
<a id='line_3550'>74:14 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to</a>
<a id='line_3551'>be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_3552'></a>
<a id='line_3553'>74:15 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up</a>
<a id='line_3554'>mighty rivers.</a>
<a id='line_3555'></a>
<a id='line_3556'>74:16 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared</a>
<a id='line_3557'>the light and the sun.</a>
<a id='line_3558'></a>
<a id='line_3559'>74:17 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made</a>
<a id='line_3560'>summer and winter.</a>
<a id='line_3561'></a>
<a id='line_3562'>74:18 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that</a>
<a id='line_3563'>the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.</a>
<a id='line_3564'></a>
<a id='line_3565'>74:19 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of</a>
<a id='line_3566'>the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.</a>
<a id='line_3567'></a>
<a id='line_3568'>74:20 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth</a>

<a id='line_3574'>74:22 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish</a>
<a id='line_3575'>man reproacheth thee daily.</a>
<a id='line_3576'></a>
<a id='line_3577'>74:23 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that</a>
<a id='line_3578'>rise up against thee increaseth continually.</a>

<a id='line_3581'></a>
<a id='line_3582'>75:1 Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks:</a>

<a id='line_3589'></a>
<a id='line_3590'>75:4 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked,</a>
<a id='line_3591'>Lift not up the horn:</a>

<a id='line_3604'>them.</a>
<a id='line_3605'></a>
<a id='line_3606'>75:9 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of</a>

<a id='line_3631'></a>
<a id='line_3632'>76:8 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth</a>

<a id='line_3655'>77:3 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit</a>

<a id='line_3663'>77:6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine</a>

<a id='line_3678'>77:11 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember</a>

<a id='line_3683'>77:13 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as</a>

<a id='line_3691'></a>
<a id='line_3692'>77:16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were</a>

<a id='line_3694'></a>
<a id='line_3695'>77:17 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine</a>

<a id='line_3709'>78:1 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words</a>
<a id='line_3710'>of my mouth.</a>
<a id='line_3711'></a>
<a id='line_3712'>78:2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of</a>
<a id='line_3713'>old:</a>
<a id='line_3714'></a>
<a id='line_3715'>78:3 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</a>
<a id='line_3716'></a>
<a id='line_3717'>78:4 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the</a>
<a id='line_3718'>generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his</a>
<a id='line_3719'>wonderful works that he hath done.</a>
<a id='line_3720'></a>
<a id='line_3721'>78:5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in</a>
<a id='line_3722'>Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them</a>
<a id='line_3723'>known to their children:</a>
<a id='line_3724'></a>
<a id='line_3725'>78:6 That the generation to come might know them, even the children</a>
<a id='line_3726'>which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their</a>
<a id='line_3727'>children:</a>
<a id='line_3728'></a>
<a id='line_3729'>78:7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works</a>
<a id='line_3730'>of God, but keep his commandments:</a>
<a id='line_3731'></a>
<a id='line_3732'>78:8 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious</a>
<a id='line_3733'>generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose</a>
<a id='line_3734'>spirit was not stedfast with God.</a>
<a id='line_3735'></a>
<a id='line_3736'>78:9 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned</a>
<a id='line_3737'>back in the day of battle.</a>
<a id='line_3738'></a>
<a id='line_3739'>78:10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his</a>
<a id='line_3740'>law;</a>
<a id='line_3741'></a>
<a id='line_3742'>78:11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</a>
<a id='line_3743'></a>
<a id='line_3744'>78:12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the</a>
<a id='line_3745'>land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</a>
<a id='line_3746'></a>
<a id='line_3747'>78:13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made</a>
<a id='line_3748'>the waters to stand as an heap.</a>
<a id='line_3749'></a>
<a id='line_3750'>78:14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night</a>
<a id='line_3751'>with a light of fire.</a>
<a id='line_3752'></a>
<a id='line_3753'>78:15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out</a>
<a id='line_3754'>of the great depths.</a>
<a id='line_3755'></a>
<a id='line_3756'>78:16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to</a>
<a id='line_3757'>run down like rivers.</a>
<a id='line_3758'></a>
<a id='line_3759'>78:17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High</a>
<a id='line_3760'>in the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_3761'></a>
<a id='line_3762'>78:18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their</a>
<a id='line_3763'>lust.</a>
<a id='line_3764'></a>
<a id='line_3765'>78:19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table</a>
<a id='line_3766'>in the wilderness?</a>
<a id='line_3767'></a>
<a id='line_3768'>78:20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the</a>
<a id='line_3769'>streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for</a>
<a id='line_3770'>his people?</a>
<a id='line_3771'></a>
<a id='line_3772'>78:21 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was</a>
<a id='line_3773'>kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</a>
<a id='line_3774'></a>
<a id='line_3775'>78:22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his</a>
<a id='line_3776'>salvation:</a>
<a id='line_3777'></a>
<a id='line_3778'>78:23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the</a>
<a id='line_3779'>doors of heaven,</a>
<a id='line_3780'></a>
<a id='line_3781'>78:24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them</a>
<a id='line_3782'>of the corn of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_3783'></a>
<a id='line_3784'>78:25 Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.</a>
<a id='line_3785'></a>
<a id='line_3786'>78:26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power</a>
<a id='line_3787'>he brought in the south wind.</a>
<a id='line_3788'></a>
<a id='line_3789'>78:27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like</a>
<a id='line_3790'>as the sand of the sea:</a>
<a id='line_3791'></a>
<a id='line_3792'>78:28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their</a>
<a id='line_3793'>habitations.</a>
<a id='line_3794'></a>
<a id='line_3795'>78:29 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their</a>
<a id='line_3796'>own desire;</a>
<a id='line_3797'></a>
<a id='line_3798'>78:30 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat</a>
<a id='line_3799'>was yet in their mouths,</a>
<a id='line_3800'></a>
<a id='line_3801'>78:31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,</a>
<a id='line_3802'>and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3803'></a>
<a id='line_3804'>78:32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his</a>
<a id='line_3805'>wondrous works.</a>
<a id='line_3806'></a>
<a id='line_3807'>78:33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years</a>
<a id='line_3808'>in trouble.</a>
<a id='line_3809'></a>
<a id='line_3810'>78:34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and</a>
<a id='line_3811'>enquired early after God.</a>
<a id='line_3812'></a>
<a id='line_3813'>78:35 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God</a>
<a id='line_3814'>their redeemer.</a>
<a id='line_3815'></a>
<a id='line_3816'>78:36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they</a>
<a id='line_3817'>lied unto him with their tongues.</a>
<a id='line_3818'></a>
<a id='line_3819'>78:37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they</a>
<a id='line_3820'>stedfast in his covenant.</a>
<a id='line_3821'></a>
<a id='line_3822'>78:38 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and</a>
<a id='line_3823'>destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did</a>
<a id='line_3824'>not stir up all his wrath.</a>
<a id='line_3825'></a>
<a id='line_3826'>78:39 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth</a>
<a id='line_3827'>away, and cometh not again.</a>
<a id='line_3828'></a>
<a id='line_3829'>78:40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him</a>
<a id='line_3830'>in the desert!</a>
<a id='line_3831'></a>
<a id='line_3832'>78:41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One</a>
<a id='line_3833'>of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3834'></a>
<a id='line_3835'>78:42 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them</a>
<a id='line_3836'>from the enemy.</a>
<a id='line_3837'></a>
<a id='line_3838'>78:43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the</a>
<a id='line_3839'>field of Zoan.</a>
<a id='line_3840'></a>
<a id='line_3841'>78:44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that</a>
<a id='line_3842'>they could not drink.</a>
<a id='line_3843'></a>
<a id='line_3844'>78:45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them;</a>
<a id='line_3845'>and frogs, which destroyed them.</a>
<a id='line_3846'></a>
<a id='line_3847'>78:46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their</a>
<a id='line_3848'>labour unto the locust.</a>
<a id='line_3849'></a>
<a id='line_3850'>78:47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees</a>
<a id='line_3851'>with frost.</a>
<a id='line_3852'></a>
<a id='line_3853'>78:48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to</a>
<a id='line_3854'>hot thunderbolts.</a>
<a id='line_3855'></a>
<a id='line_3856'>78:49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and</a>
<a id='line_3857'>indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</a>
<a id='line_3858'></a>
<a id='line_3859'>78:50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death,</a>
<a id='line_3860'>but gave their life over to the pestilence;</a>
<a id='line_3861'></a>
<a id='line_3862'>78:51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their</a>
<a id='line_3863'>strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</a>
<a id='line_3864'></a>
<a id='line_3865'>78:52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them</a>
<a id='line_3866'>in the wilderness like a flock.</a>
<a id='line_3867'></a>
<a id='line_3868'>78:53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea</a>
<a id='line_3869'>overwhelmed their enemies.</a>
<a id='line_3870'></a>
<a id='line_3871'>78:54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this</a>
<a id='line_3872'>mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</a>
<a id='line_3873'></a>
<a id='line_3874'>78:55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an</a>
<a id='line_3875'>inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their</a>
<a id='line_3876'>tents.</a>
<a id='line_3877'></a>
<a id='line_3878'>78:56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not</a>
<a id='line_3879'>his testimonies:</a>
<a id='line_3880'></a>
<a id='line_3881'>78:57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they</a>
<a id='line_3882'>were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</a>
<a id='line_3883'></a>
<a id='line_3884'>78:58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved</a>
<a id='line_3885'>him to jealousy with their graven images.</a>
<a id='line_3886'></a>
<a id='line_3887'>78:59 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</a>
<a id='line_3888'></a>
<a id='line_3889'>78:60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he</a>
<a id='line_3890'>placed among men;</a>
<a id='line_3891'></a>
<a id='line_3892'>78:61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into</a>
<a id='line_3893'>the enemy’s hand.</a>
<a id='line_3894'></a>
<a id='line_3895'>78:62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with</a>
<a id='line_3896'>his inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_3897'></a>
<a id='line_3898'>78:63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not</a>
<a id='line_3899'>given to marriage.</a>
<a id='line_3900'></a>
<a id='line_3901'>78:64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no</a>
<a id='line_3902'>lamentation.</a>
<a id='line_3903'></a>
<a id='line_3904'>78:65 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man</a>
<a id='line_3905'>that shouteth by reason of wine.</a>
<a id='line_3906'></a>
<a id='line_3907'>78:66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a</a>
<a id='line_3908'>perpetual reproach.</a>
<a id='line_3909'></a>
<a id='line_3910'>78:67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the</a>
<a id='line_3911'>tribe of Ephraim:</a>
<a id='line_3912'></a>
<a id='line_3913'>78:68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</a>
<a id='line_3914'></a>
<a id='line_3915'>78:69 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth</a>
<a id='line_3916'>which he hath established for ever.</a>
<a id='line_3917'></a>
<a id='line_3918'>78:70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the</a>
<a id='line_3919'>sheepfolds:</a>
<a id='line_3920'></a>
<a id='line_3921'>78:71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed</a>
<a id='line_3922'>Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_3923'></a>
<a id='line_3924'>78:72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and</a>
<a id='line_3925'>guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</a>
<a id='line_3926'></a>
<a id='line_3927'></a>
<a id='line_3928'></a>
<a id='line_3929'>79:1 O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy</a>
<a id='line_3930'>temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.</a>
<a id='line_3931'></a>
<a id='line_3932'>79:2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto</a>
<a id='line_3933'>the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of</a>
<a id='line_3934'>the earth.</a>
<a id='line_3935'></a>
<a id='line_3936'>79:3 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and</a>
<a id='line_3937'>there was none to bury them.</a>
<a id='line_3938'></a>
<a id='line_3939'>79:4 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision</a>
<a id='line_3940'>to them that are round about us.</a>
<a id='line_3941'></a>
<a id='line_3942'>79:5 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy</a>
<a id='line_3943'>burn like fire?</a>
<a id='line_3944'></a>
<a id='line_3945'>79:6 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and</a>
<a id='line_3946'>upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.</a>
<a id='line_3947'></a>
<a id='line_3948'>79:7 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.</a>
<a id='line_3949'></a>
<a id='line_3950'>79:8 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender</a>
<a id='line_3951'>mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.</a>
<a id='line_3952'></a>
<a id='line_3953'>79:9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and</a>
<a id='line_3954'>deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_3955'></a>
<a id='line_3956'>79:10 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be</a>
<a id='line_3957'>known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of</a>
<a id='line_3958'>thy servants which is shed.</a>
<a id='line_3959'></a>
<a id='line_3960'>79:11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to</a>
<a id='line_3961'>the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to</a>
<a id='line_3962'>die;</a>
<a id='line_3963'></a>
<a id='line_3964'>79:12 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their</a>
<a id='line_3965'>reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.</a>
<a id='line_3966'></a>
<a id='line_3967'>79:13 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks</a>
<a id='line_3968'>for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.</a>
<a id='line_3969'></a>
<a id='line_3970'></a>
<a id='line_3971'></a>
<a id='line_3972'>80:1 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a</a>
<a id='line_3973'>flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.</a>
<a id='line_3974'></a>
<a id='line_3975'>80:2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength,</a>
<a id='line_3976'>and come and save us.</a>
<a id='line_3977'></a>
<a id='line_3978'>80:3 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall</a>
<a id='line_3979'>be saved.</a>
<a id='line_3980'></a>
<a id='line_3981'>80:4 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the</a>
<a id='line_3982'>prayer of thy people?</a>
<a id='line_3983'></a>
<a id='line_3984'>80:5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears</a>
<a id='line_3985'>to drink in great measure.</a>
<a id='line_3986'></a>
<a id='line_3987'>80:6 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies</a>
<a id='line_3988'>laugh among themselves.</a>
<a id='line_3989'></a>
<a id='line_3990'>80:7 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and</a>
<a id='line_3991'>we shall be saved.</a>
<a id='line_3992'></a>
<a id='line_3993'>80:8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the</a>
<a id='line_3994'>heathen, and planted it.</a>
<a id='line_3995'></a>
<a id='line_3996'>80:9 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep</a>
<a id='line_3997'>root, and it filled the land.</a>
<a id='line_3998'></a>
<a id='line_3999'>80:10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs</a>
<a id='line_4000'>thereof were like the goodly cedars.</a>
<a id='line_4001'></a>
<a id='line_4002'>80:11 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the</a>
<a id='line_4003'>river.</a>
<a id='line_4004'></a>
<a id='line_4005'>80:12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they</a>
<a id='line_4006'>which pass by the way do pluck her?</a>
<a id='line_4007'></a>
<a id='line_4008'>80:13 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of</a>
<a id='line_4009'>the field doth devour it.</a>
<a id='line_4010'></a>
<a id='line_4011'>80:14 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven,</a>
<a id='line_4012'>and behold, and visit this vine;</a>
<a id='line_4013'></a>
<a id='line_4014'>80:15 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the</a>
<a id='line_4015'>branch that thou madest strong for thyself.</a>
<a id='line_4016'></a>
<a id='line_4017'>80:16 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the</a>
<a id='line_4018'>rebuke of thy countenance.</a>
<a id='line_4019'></a>
<a id='line_4020'>80:17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of</a>
<a id='line_4021'>man whom thou madest strong for thyself.</a>
<a id='line_4022'></a>
<a id='line_4023'>80:18 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call</a>
<a id='line_4024'>upon thy name.</a>
<a id='line_4025'></a>
<a id='line_4026'>80:19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and</a>
<a id='line_4027'>we shall be saved.</a>
<a id='line_4028'></a>
<a id='line_4029'></a>
<a id='line_4030'></a>
<a id='line_4031'>81:1 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the</a>
<a id='line_4032'>God of Jacob.</a>
<a id='line_4033'></a>
<a id='line_4034'>81:2 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp</a>
<a id='line_4035'>with the psaltery.</a>
<a id='line_4036'></a>
<a id='line_4037'>81:3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on</a>
<a id='line_4038'>our solemn feast day.</a>
<a id='line_4039'></a>
<a id='line_4040'>81:4 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.</a>
<a id='line_4041'></a>
<a id='line_4042'>81:5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out</a>
<a id='line_4043'>through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood</a>
<a id='line_4044'>not.</a>
<a id='line_4045'></a>
<a id='line_4046'>81:6 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered</a>
<a id='line_4047'>from the pots.</a>
<a id='line_4048'></a>
<a id='line_4049'>81:7 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee</a>
<a id='line_4050'>in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of</a>
<a id='line_4051'>Meribah.</a>
<a id='line_4052'></a>
<a id='line_4053'>Selah.</a>
<a id='line_4054'></a>
<a id='line_4055'>81:8 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if</a>
<a id='line_4056'>thou wilt hearken unto me;</a>
<a id='line_4057'></a>
<a id='line_4058'>81:9 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship</a>
<a id='line_4059'>any strange god.</a>
<a id='line_4060'></a>
<a id='line_4061'>81:10 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of</a>
<a id='line_4062'>Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</a>
<a id='line_4063'></a>
<a id='line_4064'>81:11 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would</a>
<a id='line_4065'>none of me.</a>
<a id='line_4066'></a>
<a id='line_4067'>81:12 So I gave them up unto their own hearts’ lust: and they walked</a>
<a id='line_4068'>in their own counsels.</a>
<a id='line_4069'></a>
<a id='line_4070'>81:13 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked</a>
<a id='line_4071'>in my ways!</a>
<a id='line_4072'></a>
<a id='line_4073'>81:14 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand</a>

<a id='line_4075'></a>
<a id='line_4076'>81:15 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto</a>
<a id='line_4077'>him: but their time should have endured for ever.</a>
<a id='line_4078'></a>
<a id='line_4079'>81:16 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and</a>
<a id='line_4080'>with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.</a>

<a id='line_4082'></a>
<a id='line_4083'></a>
<a id='line_4084'>82:1 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among</a>

<a id='line_4098'></a>
<a id='line_4099'>82:6 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most</a>

<a id='line_4121'>83:5 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are</a>

<a id='line_4134'></a>
<a id='line_4135'>83:9 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin,</a>

<a id='line_4332'></a>
<a id='line_4333'>88:6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.</a>

<a id='line_4429'></a>
<a id='line_4430'>89:20 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed</a>

<a id='line_4444'></a>
<a id='line_4445'>89:25 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the</a>
<a id='line_4446'>rivers.</a>
<a id='line_4447'></a>
<a id='line_4448'>89:26 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock</a>
<a id='line_4449'>of my salvation.</a>
<a id='line_4450'></a>
<a id='line_4451'>89:27 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the</a>

<a id='line_4453'></a>
<a id='line_4454'>89:28 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall</a>

<a id='line_4463'></a>
<a id='line_4464'>89:32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their</a>
<a id='line_4465'>iniquity with stripes.</a>
<a id='line_4466'></a>
<a id='line_4467'>89:33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him,</a>
<a id='line_4468'>nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.</a>
<a id='line_4469'></a>
<a id='line_4470'>89:34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone</a>

<a id='line_5251'>105:10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for</a>

<a id='line_5253'></a>
<a id='line_5254'>105:11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of</a>

<a id='line_5286'></a>
<a id='line_5287'>105:23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of</a>

<a id='line_5299'>Ham.</a>
<a id='line_5300'></a>
<a id='line_5301'>105:28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not</a>

<a id='line_5303'></a>
<a id='line_5304'>105:29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</a>
<a id='line_5305'></a>
<a id='line_5306'>105:30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of</a>
<a id='line_5307'>their kings.</a>
<a id='line_5308'></a>
<a id='line_5309'>105:31 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all</a>
<a id='line_5310'>their coasts.</a>
<a id='line_5311'></a>
<a id='line_5312'>105:32 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.</a>
<a id='line_5313'></a>
<a id='line_5314'>105:33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the</a>
<a id='line_5315'>trees of their coasts.</a>
<a id='line_5316'></a>
<a id='line_5317'>105:34 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that</a>
<a id='line_5318'>without number,</a>
<a id='line_5319'></a>
<a id='line_5320'>105:35 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the</a>
<a id='line_5321'>fruit of their ground.</a>
<a id='line_5322'></a>
<a id='line_5323'>105:36 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all</a>
<a id='line_5324'>their strength.</a>
<a id='line_5325'></a>
<a id='line_5326'>105:37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was</a>
<a id='line_5327'>not one feeble person among their tribes.</a>
<a id='line_5328'></a>
<a id='line_5329'>105:38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell</a>
<a id='line_5330'>upon them.</a>
<a id='line_5331'></a>
<a id='line_5332'>105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the</a>
<a id='line_5333'>night.</a>
<a id='line_5334'></a>
<a id='line_5335'>105:40 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them</a>
<a id='line_5336'>with the bread of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_5337'></a>
<a id='line_5338'>105:41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the</a>
<a id='line_5339'>dry places like a river.</a>
<a id='line_5340'></a>
<a id='line_5341'>105:42 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.</a>
<a id='line_5342'></a>
<a id='line_5343'>105:43 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with</a>
<a id='line_5344'>gladness:</a>
<a id='line_5345'></a>
<a id='line_5346'>105:44 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the</a>
<a id='line_5347'>labour of the people;</a>
<a id='line_5348'></a>
<a id='line_5349'>105:45 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise</a>

<a id='line_5351'></a>
<a id='line_5352'></a>
<a id='line_5353'></a>
<a id='line_5354'>106:1 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:</a>

<a id='line_5362'></a>
<a id='line_5363'>106:4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy</a>
<a id='line_5364'>people: O visit me with thy salvation;</a>
<a id='line_5365'></a>
<a id='line_5366'>106:5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the</a>
<a id='line_5367'>gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_5368'></a>
<a id='line_5369'>106:6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we</a>
<a id='line_5370'>have done wickedly.</a>
<a id='line_5371'></a>
<a id='line_5372'>106:7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered</a>
<a id='line_5373'>not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at</a>
<a id='line_5374'>the Red sea.</a>
<a id='line_5375'></a>
<a id='line_5376'>106:8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might</a>
<a id='line_5377'>make his mighty power to be known.</a>
<a id='line_5378'></a>
<a id='line_5379'>106:9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them</a>
<a id='line_5380'>through the depths, as through the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_5381'></a>
<a id='line_5382'>106:10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and</a>
<a id='line_5383'>redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</a>
<a id='line_5384'></a>
<a id='line_5385'>106:11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them</a>
<a id='line_5386'>left.</a>
<a id='line_5387'></a>
<a id='line_5388'>106:12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</a>
<a id='line_5389'></a>
<a id='line_5390'>106:13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</a>
<a id='line_5391'></a>
<a id='line_5392'>106:14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in</a>
<a id='line_5393'>the desert.</a>
<a id='line_5394'></a>
<a id='line_5395'>106:15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their</a>
<a id='line_5396'>soul.</a>
<a id='line_5397'></a>
<a id='line_5398'>106:16 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the</a>
<a id='line_5399'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5400'></a>
<a id='line_5401'>106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the</a>
<a id='line_5402'>company of Abiram.</a>
<a id='line_5403'></a>
<a id='line_5404'>106:18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up</a>
<a id='line_5405'>the wicked.</a>
<a id='line_5406'></a>
<a id='line_5407'>106:19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</a>
<a id='line_5408'></a>
<a id='line_5409'>106:20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that</a>
<a id='line_5410'>eateth grass.</a>
<a id='line_5411'></a>
<a id='line_5412'>106:21 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in</a>
<a id='line_5413'>Egypt;</a>
<a id='line_5414'></a>
<a id='line_5415'>106:22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the</a>
<a id='line_5416'>Red sea.</a>
<a id='line_5417'></a>
<a id='line_5418'>106:23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his</a>
<a id='line_5419'>chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he</a>
<a id='line_5420'>should destroy them.</a>
<a id='line_5421'></a>
<a id='line_5422'>106:24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his</a>
<a id='line_5423'>word:</a>
<a id='line_5424'></a>
<a id='line_5425'>106:25 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice</a>
<a id='line_5426'>of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5427'></a>
<a id='line_5428'>106:26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them</a>
<a id='line_5429'>in the wilderness:</a>
<a id='line_5430'></a>
<a id='line_5431'>106:27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter</a>
<a id='line_5432'>them in the lands.</a>
<a id='line_5433'></a>
<a id='line_5434'>106:28 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the</a>
<a id='line_5435'>sacrifices of the dead.</a>
<a id='line_5436'></a>
<a id='line_5437'>106:29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the</a>
<a id='line_5438'>plague brake in upon them.</a>
<a id='line_5439'></a>
<a id='line_5440'>106:30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the</a>
<a id='line_5441'>plague was stayed.</a>
<a id='line_5442'></a>
<a id='line_5443'>106:31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all</a>
<a id='line_5444'>generations for evermore.</a>
<a id='line_5445'></a>
<a id='line_5446'>106:32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went</a>
<a id='line_5447'>ill with Moses for their sakes:</a>
<a id='line_5448'></a>
<a id='line_5449'>106:33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly</a>
<a id='line_5450'>with his lips.</a>
<a id='line_5451'></a>
<a id='line_5452'>106:34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD</a>
<a id='line_5453'>commanded them:</a>
<a id='line_5454'></a>
<a id='line_5455'>106:35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</a>
<a id='line_5456'></a>
<a id='line_5457'>106:36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</a>
<a id='line_5458'></a>
<a id='line_5459'>106:37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto</a>
<a id='line_5460'>devils,</a>
<a id='line_5461'></a>
<a id='line_5462'>106:38 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of</a>
<a id='line_5463'>their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and</a>
<a id='line_5464'>the land was polluted with blood.</a>
<a id='line_5465'></a>
<a id='line_5466'>106:39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring</a>
<a id='line_5467'>with their own inventions.</a>
<a id='line_5468'></a>
<a id='line_5469'>106:40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people,</a>
<a id='line_5470'>insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_5471'></a>
<a id='line_5472'>106:41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that</a>
<a id='line_5473'>hated them ruled over them.</a>
<a id='line_5474'></a>
<a id='line_5475'>106:42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into</a>
<a id='line_5476'>subjection under their hand.</a>
<a id='line_5477'></a>
<a id='line_5478'>106:43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with</a>
<a id='line_5479'>their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_5480'></a>
<a id='line_5481'>106:44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their</a>
<a id='line_5482'>cry:</a>
<a id='line_5483'></a>
<a id='line_5484'>106:45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according</a>
<a id='line_5485'>to the multitude of his mercies.</a>
<a id='line_5486'></a>
<a id='line_5487'>106:46 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them</a>
<a id='line_5488'>captives.</a>
<a id='line_5489'></a>
<a id='line_5490'>106:47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen,</a>
<a id='line_5491'>to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.</a>
<a id='line_5492'></a>
<a id='line_5493'>106:48 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to</a>
<a id='line_5494'>everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5495'></a>
<a id='line_5496'></a>
<a id='line_5497'></a>
<a id='line_5498'>107:1 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy</a>

<a id='line_5500'></a>
<a id='line_5501'>107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from</a>
<a id='line_5502'>the hand of the enemy;</a>
<a id='line_5503'></a>
<a id='line_5504'>107:3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the</a>
<a id='line_5505'>west, from the north, and from the south.</a>
<a id='line_5506'></a>
<a id='line_5507'>107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no</a>
<a id='line_5508'>city to dwell in.</a>
<a id='line_5509'></a>
<a id='line_5510'>107:5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</a>
<a id='line_5511'></a>
<a id='line_5512'>107:6 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered</a>
<a id='line_5513'>them out of their distresses.</a>
<a id='line_5514'></a>
<a id='line_5515'>107:7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a</a>
<a id='line_5516'>city of habitation.</a>
<a id='line_5517'></a>
<a id='line_5518'>107:8 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his</a>
<a id='line_5519'>wonderful works to the children of men!</a>
