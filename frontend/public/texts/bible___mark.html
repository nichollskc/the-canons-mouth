                    <a id='line_0'>The Gospel According to Saint Mark</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; 1:2</a>
<a id='line_4'>As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before</a>
<a id='line_5'>thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>1:3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of</a>
<a id='line_8'>the Lord, make his paths straight.</a>
<a id='line_9'></a>
<a id='line_10'>1:4 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of</a>
<a id='line_11'>repentance for the remission of sins.</a>
<a id='line_12'></a>
<a id='line_13'>1:5 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of</a>
<a id='line_14'>Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan,</a>
<a id='line_15'>confessing their sins.</a>
<a id='line_16'></a>
<a id='line_17'>1:6 And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a</a>
<a id='line_18'>skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; 1:7 And</a>
<a id='line_19'>preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the</a>
<a id='line_20'>latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>1:8 I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you</a>
<a id='line_23'>with the Holy Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'>1:9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth</a>
<a id='line_26'>of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_27'></a>
<a id='line_28'>1:10 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens</a>
<a id='line_29'>opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: 1:11 And there</a>
<a id='line_30'>came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I</a>
<a id='line_31'>am well pleased.</a>
<a id='line_32'></a>
<a id='line_33'>1:12 And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_34'></a>
<a id='line_35'>1:13 And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan;</a>
<a id='line_36'>and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>1:14 Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee,</a>
<a id='line_39'>preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, 1:15 And saying, The time</a>
<a id='line_40'>is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and</a>
<a id='line_41'>believe the gospel.</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>1:16 Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew</a>
<a id='line_44'>his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</a>
<a id='line_45'></a>
<a id='line_46'>1:17 And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you</a>
<a id='line_47'>to become fishers of men.</a>
<a id='line_48'></a>
<a id='line_49'>1:18 And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</a>
<a id='line_50'></a>
<a id='line_51'>1:19 And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the</a>
<a id='line_52'>son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship</a>
<a id='line_53'>mending their nets.</a>
<a id='line_54'></a>
<a id='line_55'>1:20 And straightway he called them: and they left their father</a>
<a id='line_56'>Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</a>
<a id='line_57'></a>
<a id='line_58'>1:21 And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day</a>
<a id='line_59'>he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</a>
<a id='line_60'></a>
<a id='line_61'>1:22 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as</a>
<a id='line_62'>one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>1:23 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit;</a>
<a id='line_65'>and he cried out, 1:24 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with</a>
<a id='line_66'>thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee</a>
<a id='line_67'>who thou art, the Holy One of God.</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>1:25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of</a>
<a id='line_70'>him.</a>
<a id='line_71'></a>
<a id='line_72'>1:26 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud</a>
<a id='line_73'>voice, he came out of him.</a>
<a id='line_74'></a>
<a id='line_75'>1:27 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among</a>
<a id='line_76'>themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for</a>
<a id='line_77'>with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do</a>
<a id='line_78'>obey him.</a>
<a id='line_79'></a>
<a id='line_80'>1:28 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region</a>
<a id='line_81'>round about Galilee.</a>
<a id='line_82'></a>
<a id='line_83'>1:29 And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they</a>
<a id='line_84'>entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>1:30 But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell</a>
<a id='line_87'>him of her.</a>
<a id='line_88'></a>
<a id='line_89'>1:31 And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and</a>
<a id='line_90'>immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>1:32 And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that</a>
<a id='line_93'>were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</a>
<a id='line_94'></a>
<a id='line_95'>1:33 And all the city was gathered together at the door.</a>
<a id='line_96'></a>
<a id='line_97'>1:34 And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast</a>
<a id='line_98'>out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they</a>
<a id='line_99'>knew him.</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>1:35 And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went</a>
<a id='line_102'>out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</a>
<a id='line_103'></a>
<a id='line_104'>1:36 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>1:37 And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for</a>
<a id='line_107'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_108'></a>
<a id='line_109'>1:38 And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may</a>
<a id='line_110'>preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'>1:39 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and</a>
<a id='line_113'>cast out devils.</a>
<a id='line_114'></a>
<a id='line_115'>1:40 And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down</a>
<a id='line_116'>to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</a>
<a id='line_117'></a>
<a id='line_118'>1:41 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched</a>
<a id='line_119'>him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.</a>
<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>1:42 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed</a>
<a id='line_122'>from him, and he was cleansed.</a>
<a id='line_123'></a>
<a id='line_124'>1:43 And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; 1:44</a>
<a id='line_125'>And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way,</a>
<a id='line_126'>shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things</a>
<a id='line_127'>which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</a>
<a id='line_128'></a>
<a id='line_129'>1:45 But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze</a>
<a id='line_130'>abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into</a>
<a id='line_131'>the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from</a>
<a id='line_132'>every quarter.</a>
<a id='line_133'></a>
<a id='line_134'>2:1 And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was</a>
<a id='line_135'>noised that he was in the house.</a>
<a id='line_136'></a>
<a id='line_137'>2:2 And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there</a>
<a id='line_138'>was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he</a>
<a id='line_139'>preached the word unto them.</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>2:3 And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was</a>
<a id='line_142'>borne of four.</a>
<a id='line_143'></a>
<a id='line_144'>2:4 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they</a>
<a id='line_145'>uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they</a>
<a id='line_146'>let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>2:5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy,</a>
<a id='line_149'>Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.</a>
<a id='line_150'></a>
<a id='line_151'>2:6 But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning</a>
<a id='line_152'>in their hearts, 2:7 Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can</a>
<a id='line_153'>forgive sins but God only?  2:8 And immediately when Jesus perceived</a>
<a id='line_154'>in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto</a>
<a id='line_155'>them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?  2:9 Whether is it</a>
<a id='line_156'>easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or</a>
<a id='line_157'>to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?  2:10 But that ye may</a>
<a id='line_158'>know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he</a>
<a id='line_159'>saith to the sick of the palsy,) 2:11 I say unto thee, Arise, and take</a>
<a id='line_160'>up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>2:12 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before</a>
<a id='line_163'>them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God,</a>
<a id='line_164'>saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</a>
<a id='line_165'></a>
<a id='line_166'>2:13 And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude</a>
<a id='line_167'>resorted unto him, and he taught them.</a>
<a id='line_168'></a>
<a id='line_169'>2:14 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at</a>
<a id='line_170'>the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and</a>
<a id='line_171'>followed him.</a>
<a id='line_172'></a>
<a id='line_173'>2:15 And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house,</a>
<a id='line_174'>many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his</a>
<a id='line_175'>disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>2:16 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and</a>
<a id='line_178'>sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and</a>
<a id='line_179'>drinketh with publicans and sinners?  2:17 When Jesus heard it, he</a>
<a id='line_180'>saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician,</a>
<a id='line_181'>but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners</a>
<a id='line_182'>to repentance.</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>2:18 And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and</a>
<a id='line_185'>they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the</a>
<a id='line_186'>Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?  2:19 And Jesus said unto</a>
<a id='line_187'>them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom</a>
<a id='line_188'>is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they</a>
<a id='line_189'>cannot fast.</a>
<a id='line_190'></a>
<a id='line_191'>2:20 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away</a>
<a id='line_192'>from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</a>
<a id='line_193'></a>
<a id='line_194'>2:21 No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else</a>
<a id='line_195'>the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent</a>
<a id='line_196'>is made worse.</a>
<a id='line_197'></a>
<a id='line_198'>2:22 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine</a>
<a id='line_199'>doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will</a>
<a id='line_200'>be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>2:23 And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the</a>
<a id='line_203'>sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears</a>
<a id='line_204'>of corn.</a>
<a id='line_205'></a>
<a id='line_206'>2:24 And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the</a>
<a id='line_207'>sabbath day that which is not lawful?  2:25 And he said unto them,</a>
<a id='line_208'>Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an</a>
<a id='line_209'>hungred, he, and they that were with him?  2:26 How he went into the</a>
<a id='line_210'>house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the</a>
<a id='line_211'>shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave</a>
<a id='line_212'>also to them which were with him?  2:27 And he said unto them, The</a>
<a id='line_213'>sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: 2:28 Therefore</a>
<a id='line_214'>the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</a>
<a id='line_215'></a>
<a id='line_216'>3:1 And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there</a>
<a id='line_217'>which had a withered hand.</a>
<a id='line_218'></a>
<a id='line_219'>3:2 And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath</a>
<a id='line_220'>day; that they might accuse him.</a>
<a id='line_221'></a>
<a id='line_222'>3:3 And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand</a>
<a id='line_223'>forth.</a>
<a id='line_224'></a>
<a id='line_225'>3:4 And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath</a>
<a id='line_226'>days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their</a>
<a id='line_227'>peace.</a>
<a id='line_228'></a>
<a id='line_229'>3:5 And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being</a>
<a id='line_230'>grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man,</a>
<a id='line_231'>Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was</a>
<a id='line_232'>restored whole as the other.</a>
<a id='line_233'></a>
<a id='line_234'>3:6 And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with</a>
<a id='line_235'>the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>3:7 But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a</a>
<a id='line_238'>great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea, 3:8 And</a>
<a id='line_239'>from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they</a>
<a id='line_240'>about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what</a>
<a id='line_241'>great things he did, came unto him.</a>
<a id='line_242'></a>
<a id='line_243'>3:9 And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on</a>
<a id='line_244'>him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</a>
<a id='line_245'></a>
<a id='line_246'>3:10 For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for</a>
<a id='line_247'>to touch him, as many as had plagues.</a>
<a id='line_248'></a>
<a id='line_249'>3:11 And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and</a>
<a id='line_250'>cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</a>
<a id='line_251'></a>
<a id='line_252'>3:12 And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.</a>
<a id='line_253'></a>
<a id='line_254'>3:13 And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he</a>
<a id='line_255'>would: and they came unto him.</a>
<a id='line_256'></a>
<a id='line_257'>3:14 And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he</a>
<a id='line_258'>might send them forth to preach, 3:15 And to have power to heal</a>
<a id='line_259'>sicknesses, and to cast out devils: 3:16 And Simon he surnamed Peter;</a>
<a id='line_260'>3:17 And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and</a>
<a id='line_261'>he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder: 3:18 And</a>
<a id='line_262'>Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and</a>
<a id='line_263'>James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,</a>
<a id='line_264'>3:19 And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into</a>
<a id='line_265'>an house.</a>
<a id='line_266'></a>
<a id='line_267'>3:20 And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not</a>
<a id='line_268'>so much as eat bread.</a>
<a id='line_269'></a>
<a id='line_270'>3:21 And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on</a>
<a id='line_271'>him: for they said, He is beside himself.</a>
<a id='line_272'></a>
<a id='line_273'>3:22 And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath</a>
<a id='line_274'>Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.</a>
<a id='line_275'></a>
<a id='line_276'>3:23 And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How</a>
<a id='line_277'>can Satan cast out Satan?  3:24 And if a kingdom be divided against</a>
<a id='line_278'>itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</a>
<a id='line_279'></a>
<a id='line_280'>3:25 And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot</a>
<a id='line_281'>stand.</a>
<a id='line_282'></a>
<a id='line_283'>3:26 And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot</a>
<a id='line_284'>stand, but hath an end.</a>
<a id='line_285'></a>
<a id='line_286'>3:27 No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods,</a>
<a id='line_287'>except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his</a>
<a id='line_288'>house.</a>
<a id='line_289'></a>
<a id='line_290'>3:28 Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons</a>
<a id='line_291'>of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: 3:29</a>
<a id='line_292'>But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never</a>
<a id='line_293'>forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.</a>
<a id='line_294'></a>
<a id='line_295'>3:30 Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.</a>
<a id='line_296'></a>
<a id='line_297'>3:31 There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing</a>
<a id='line_298'>without, sent unto him, calling him.</a>
<a id='line_299'></a>
<a id='line_300'>3:32 And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold,</a>
<a id='line_301'>thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.</a>
<a id='line_302'></a>
<a id='line_303'>3:33 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?</a>
<a id='line_304'>3:34 And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said,</a>
<a id='line_305'>Behold my mother and my brethren!  3:35 For whosoever shall do the</a>
<a id='line_306'>will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</a>
<a id='line_307'></a>
<a id='line_308'>4:1 And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was</a>
<a id='line_309'>gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship,</a>
<a id='line_310'>and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the</a>
<a id='line_311'>land.</a>
<a id='line_312'></a>
<a id='line_313'>4:2 And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in</a>
<a id='line_314'>his doctrine, 4:3 Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow: 4:4</a>
<a id='line_315'>And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the</a>
<a id='line_316'>fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</a>
<a id='line_317'></a>
<a id='line_318'>4:5 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and</a>
<a id='line_319'>immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth: 4:6 But</a>
<a id='line_320'>when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it</a>
<a id='line_321'>withered away.</a>
<a id='line_322'></a>
<a id='line_323'>4:7 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it,</a>
<a id='line_324'>and it yielded no fruit.</a>
<a id='line_325'></a>
<a id='line_326'>4:8 And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up</a>
<a id='line_327'>and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and</a>
<a id='line_328'>some an hundred.</a>
<a id='line_329'></a>
<a id='line_330'>4:9 And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</a>
<a id='line_331'></a>
<a id='line_332'>4:10 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve</a>
<a id='line_333'>asked of him the parable.</a>
<a id='line_334'></a>
<a id='line_335'>4:11 And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery</a>
<a id='line_336'>of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these</a>
<a id='line_337'>things are done in parables: 4:12 That seeing they may see, and not</a>
<a id='line_338'>perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any</a>
<a id='line_339'>time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</a>
<a id='line_340'></a>
<a id='line_341'>4:13 And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then</a>
<a id='line_342'>will ye know all parables?  4:14 The sower soweth the word.</a>
<a id='line_343'></a>
<a id='line_344'>4:15 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but</a>
<a id='line_345'>when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the</a>
<a id='line_346'>word that was sown in their hearts.</a>
<a id='line_347'></a>
<a id='line_348'>4:16 And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who,</a>
<a id='line_349'>when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</a>
<a id='line_350'>4:17 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time:</a>
<a id='line_351'>afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word’s sake,</a>
<a id='line_352'>immediately they are offended.</a>
<a id='line_353'></a>
<a id='line_354'>4:18 And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the</a>
<a id='line_355'>word, 4:19 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of</a>
<a id='line_356'>riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and</a>
<a id='line_357'>it becometh unfruitful.</a>
<a id='line_358'></a>
<a id='line_359'>4:20 And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear</a>
<a id='line_360'>the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some</a>
<a id='line_361'>sixty, and some an hundred.</a>
<a id='line_362'></a>
<a id='line_363'>4:21 And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a</a>
<a id='line_364'>bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?  4:22 For</a>
<a id='line_365'>there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any</a>
<a id='line_366'>thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</a>
<a id='line_367'></a>
<a id='line_368'>4:23 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</a>
<a id='line_369'></a>
<a id='line_370'>4:24 And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure</a>
<a id='line_371'>ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall</a>
<a id='line_372'>more be given.</a>
<a id='line_373'></a>
<a id='line_374'>4:25 For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not,</a>
<a id='line_375'>from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</a>
<a id='line_376'></a>
<a id='line_377'>4:26 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast</a>
<a id='line_378'>seed into the ground; 4:27 And should sleep, and rise night and day,</a>
<a id='line_379'>and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</a>
<a id='line_380'></a>
<a id='line_381'>4:28 For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade,</a>
<a id='line_382'>then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</a>
<a id='line_383'></a>
<a id='line_384'>4:29 But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in</a>
<a id='line_385'>the sickle, because the harvest is come.</a>
<a id='line_386'></a>
<a id='line_387'>4:30 And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with</a>
<a id='line_388'>what comparison shall we compare it?  4:31 It is like a grain of</a>
<a id='line_389'>mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all</a>
<a id='line_390'>the seeds that be in the earth: 4:32 But when it is sown, it groweth</a>
<a id='line_391'>up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great</a>
<a id='line_392'>branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of</a>
<a id='line_393'>it.</a>
<a id='line_394'></a>
<a id='line_395'>4:33 And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they</a>
<a id='line_396'>were able to hear it.</a>
<a id='line_397'></a>
<a id='line_398'>4:34 But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were</a>
<a id='line_399'>alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</a>
<a id='line_400'></a>
<a id='line_401'>4:35 And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let</a>
<a id='line_402'>us pass over unto the other side.</a>
<a id='line_403'></a>
<a id='line_404'>4:36 And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as</a>
<a id='line_405'>he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</a>
<a id='line_406'></a>
<a id='line_407'>4:37 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into</a>
<a id='line_408'>the ship, so that it was now full.</a>
<a id='line_409'></a>
<a id='line_410'>4:38 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow:</a>
<a id='line_411'>and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we</a>
<a id='line_412'>perish?  4:39 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the</a>
<a id='line_413'>sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</a>
<a id='line_414'></a>
<a id='line_415'>4:40 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye</a>
<a id='line_416'>have no faith?  4:41 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to</a>
<a id='line_417'>another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea</a>
<a id='line_418'>obey him?  5:1 And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into</a>
<a id='line_419'>the country of the Gadarenes.</a>
<a id='line_420'></a>
<a id='line_421'>5:2 And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him</a>
<a id='line_422'>out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, 5:3 Who had his</a>
<a id='line_423'>dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with</a>
<a id='line_424'>chains: 5:4 Because that he had been often bound with fetters and</a>
<a id='line_425'>chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the</a>
<a id='line_426'>fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.</a>
<a id='line_427'></a>
<a id='line_428'>5:5 And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the</a>
<a id='line_429'>tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.</a>
<a id='line_430'></a>
<a id='line_431'>5:6 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, 5:7 And</a>
<a id='line_432'>cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus,</a>
<a id='line_433'>thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment</a>
<a id='line_434'>me not.</a>
<a id='line_435'></a>
<a id='line_436'>5:8 For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.</a>
<a id='line_437'></a>
<a id='line_438'>5:9 And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My</a>
<a id='line_439'>name is Legion: for we are many.</a>
<a id='line_440'></a>
<a id='line_441'>5:10 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of</a>
<a id='line_442'>the country.</a>
<a id='line_443'></a>
<a id='line_444'>5:11 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine</a>
<a id='line_445'>feeding.</a>
<a id='line_446'></a>
<a id='line_447'>5:12 And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine,</a>
<a id='line_448'>that we may enter into them.</a>
<a id='line_449'></a>
<a id='line_450'>5:13 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went</a>
<a id='line_451'>out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a</a>
<a id='line_452'>steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were</a>
<a id='line_453'>choked in the sea.</a>
<a id='line_454'></a>
<a id='line_455'>5:14 And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in</a>
<a id='line_456'>the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.</a>
<a id='line_457'></a>
<a id='line_458'>5:15 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the</a>
<a id='line_459'>devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right</a>
<a id='line_460'>mind: and they were afraid.</a>
<a id='line_461'></a>
<a id='line_462'>5:16 And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was</a>
<a id='line_463'>possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.</a>
<a id='line_464'></a>
<a id='line_465'>5:17 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.</a>
<a id='line_466'></a>
<a id='line_467'>5:18 And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed</a>
<a id='line_468'>with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.</a>
<a id='line_469'></a>
<a id='line_470'>5:19 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to</a>
<a id='line_471'>thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for</a>
<a id='line_472'>thee, and hath had compassion on thee.</a>
<a id='line_473'></a>
<a id='line_474'>5:20 And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great</a>
<a id='line_475'>things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.</a>
<a id='line_476'></a>
<a id='line_477'>5:21 And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side,</a>
<a id='line_478'>much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.</a>
<a id='line_479'></a>
<a id='line_480'>5:22 And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue,</a>
<a id='line_481'>Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet, 5:23 And</a>
<a id='line_482'>besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of</a>
<a id='line_483'>death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be</a>
<a id='line_484'>healed; and she shall live.</a>
<a id='line_485'></a>
<a id='line_486'>5:24 And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and</a>
<a id='line_487'>thronged him.</a>
<a id='line_488'></a>
<a id='line_489'>5:25 And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,</a>
<a id='line_490'>5:26 And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent</a>
<a id='line_491'>all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,</a>
<a id='line_492'>5:27 When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and</a>
<a id='line_493'>touched his garment.</a>
<a id='line_494'></a>
<a id='line_495'>5:28 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.</a>
<a id='line_496'></a>
<a id='line_497'>5:29 And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she</a>
<a id='line_498'>felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.</a>
<a id='line_499'></a>
<a id='line_500'>5:30 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone</a>
<a id='line_501'>out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my</a>
<a id='line_502'>clothes?  5:31 And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the</a>
<a id='line_503'>multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?  5:32 And</a>
<a id='line_504'>he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.</a>
<a id='line_505'></a>
<a id='line_506'>5:33 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in</a>
<a id='line_507'>her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</a>
<a id='line_508'></a>
<a id='line_509'>5:34 And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole;</a>
<a id='line_510'>go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.</a>
<a id='line_511'></a>
<a id='line_512'>5:35 While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s</a>
<a id='line_513'>house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the</a>
<a id='line_514'>Master any further?  5:36 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was</a>
<a id='line_515'>spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only</a>
<a id='line_516'>believe.</a>
<a id='line_517'></a>
<a id='line_518'>5:37 And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and</a>
<a id='line_519'>John the brother of James.</a>
<a id='line_520'></a>
<a id='line_521'>5:38 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and</a>
<a id='line_522'>seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.</a>
<a id='line_523'></a>
<a id='line_524'>5:39 And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this</a>
<a id='line_525'>ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.</a>
<a id='line_526'></a>
<a id='line_527'>5:40 And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out,</a>
<a id='line_528'>he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were</a>
<a id='line_529'>with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.</a>
<a id='line_530'></a>
<a id='line_531'>5:41 And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha</a>
<a id='line_532'>cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.</a>
<a id='line_533'></a>
<a id='line_534'>5:42 And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the</a>
<a id='line_535'>age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great</a>
<a id='line_536'>astonishment.</a>
<a id='line_537'></a>
<a id='line_538'>5:43 And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and</a>
<a id='line_539'>commanded that something should be given her to eat.</a>
<a id='line_540'></a>
<a id='line_541'>6:1 And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and</a>
<a id='line_542'>his disciples follow him.</a>
<a id='line_543'></a>
<a id='line_544'>6:2 And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the</a>
<a id='line_545'>synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence</a>
<a id='line_546'>hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given</a>
<a id='line_547'>unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?  6:3</a>
<a id='line_548'>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and</a>
<a id='line_549'>Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us?</a>
<a id='line_550'>And they were offended at him.</a>
<a id='line_551'></a>
<a id='line_552'>6:4 But Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in</a>
<a id='line_553'>his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.</a>
<a id='line_554'></a>
<a id='line_555'>6:5 And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands</a>
<a id='line_556'>upon a few sick folk, and healed them.</a>
<a id='line_557'></a>
<a id='line_558'>6:6 And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round</a>
<a id='line_559'>about the villages, teaching.</a>
<a id='line_560'></a>
<a id='line_561'>6:7 And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by</a>
<a id='line_562'>two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits; 6:8 And</a>
<a id='line_563'>commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a</a>
<a id='line_564'>staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse: 6:9 But be</a>
<a id='line_565'>shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.</a>
<a id='line_566'></a>
<a id='line_567'>6:10 And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an</a>
<a id='line_568'>house, there abide till ye depart from that place.</a>
<a id='line_569'></a>
<a id='line_570'>6:11 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart</a>
<a id='line_571'>thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against</a>
<a id='line_572'>them.</a>
<a id='line_573'></a>
<a id='line_574'>Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and</a>
<a id='line_575'>Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</a>
<a id='line_576'></a>
<a id='line_577'>6:12 And they went out, and preached that men should repent.</a>
<a id='line_578'></a>
<a id='line_579'>6:13 And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that</a>
<a id='line_580'>were sick, and healed them.</a>
<a id='line_581'></a>
<a id='line_582'>6:14 And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:)</a>
<a id='line_583'>and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and</a>
<a id='line_584'>therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.</a>
<a id='line_585'></a>
<a id='line_586'>6:15 Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a</a>
<a id='line_587'>prophet, or as one of the prophets.</a>
<a id='line_588'></a>
<a id='line_589'>6:16 But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I</a>
<a id='line_590'>beheaded: he is risen from the dead.</a>
<a id='line_591'></a>
<a id='line_592'>6:17 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and</a>
<a id='line_593'>bound him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife: for</a>
<a id='line_594'>he had married her.</a>
<a id='line_595'></a>
<a id='line_596'>6:18 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have</a>
<a id='line_597'>thy brother’s wife.</a>
<a id='line_598'></a>
<a id='line_599'>6:19 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have</a>
<a id='line_600'>killed him; but she could not: 6:20 For Herod feared John, knowing</a>
<a id='line_601'>that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he</a>
<a id='line_602'>heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.</a>
<a id='line_603'></a>
<a id='line_604'>6:21 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday</a>
<a id='line_605'>made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of</a>
<a id='line_606'>Galilee; 6:22 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and</a>
<a id='line_607'>danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said</a>
<a id='line_608'>unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it</a>
<a id='line_609'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_610'></a>
<a id='line_611'>6:23 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will</a>
<a id='line_612'>give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_613'></a>
<a id='line_614'>6:24 And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask?</a>
<a id='line_615'>And she said, The head of John the Baptist.</a>
<a id='line_616'></a>
<a id='line_617'>6:25 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked,</a>
<a id='line_618'>saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of</a>
<a id='line_619'>John the Baptist.</a>
<a id='line_620'></a>
<a id='line_621'>6:26 And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath’s sake, and</a>
<a id='line_622'>for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.</a>
<a id='line_623'></a>
<a id='line_624'>6:27 And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his</a>
<a id='line_625'>head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, 6:28</a>
<a id='line_626'>And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the</a>
<a id='line_627'>damsel gave it to her mother.</a>
<a id='line_628'></a>
<a id='line_629'>6:29 And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his</a>
<a id='line_630'>corpse, and laid it in a tomb.</a>
<a id='line_631'></a>
<a id='line_632'>6:30 And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and</a>
<a id='line_633'>told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had</a>
<a id='line_634'>taught.</a>
<a id='line_635'></a>
<a id='line_636'>6:31 And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert</a>
<a id='line_637'>place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and</a>
<a id='line_638'>they had no leisure so much as to eat.</a>
<a id='line_639'></a>
<a id='line_640'>6:32 And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.</a>
<a id='line_641'></a>
<a id='line_642'>6:33 And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran</a>
<a id='line_643'>afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together</a>
<a id='line_644'>unto him.</a>
<a id='line_645'></a>
<a id='line_646'>6:34 And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with</a>
<a id='line_647'>compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a</a>
<a id='line_648'>shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.</a>
<a id='line_649'></a>
<a id='line_650'>6:35 And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him,</a>
<a id='line_651'>and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed: 6:36</a>
<a id='line_652'>Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and</a>
<a id='line_653'>into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to</a>
<a id='line_654'>eat.</a>
<a id='line_655'></a>
<a id='line_656'>6:37 He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say</a>
<a id='line_657'>unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and</a>
<a id='line_658'>give them to eat?  6:38 He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye?</a>
<a id='line_659'>go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.</a>
<a id='line_660'></a>
<a id='line_661'>6:39 And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the</a>
<a id='line_662'>green grass.</a>
<a id='line_663'></a>
<a id='line_664'>6:40 And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.</a>
<a id='line_665'></a>
<a id='line_666'>6:41 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he</a>
<a id='line_667'>looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them</a>
<a id='line_668'>to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he</a>
<a id='line_669'>among them all.</a>
<a id='line_670'></a>
<a id='line_671'>6:42 And they did all eat, and were filled.</a>
<a id='line_672'></a>
<a id='line_673'>6:43 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the</a>
<a id='line_674'>fishes.</a>
<a id='line_675'></a>
<a id='line_676'>6:44 And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.</a>
<a id='line_677'></a>
<a id='line_678'>6:45 And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the</a>
<a id='line_679'>ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent</a>
<a id='line_680'>away the people.</a>
<a id='line_681'></a>
<a id='line_682'>6:46 And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to</a>
<a id='line_683'>pray.</a>
<a id='line_684'></a>
<a id='line_685'>6:47 And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and</a>
<a id='line_686'>he alone on the land.</a>
<a id='line_687'></a>
<a id='line_688'>6:48 And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto</a>
<a id='line_689'>them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them,</a>
<a id='line_690'>walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.</a>
<a id='line_691'></a>
<a id='line_692'>6:49 But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had</a>
<a id='line_693'>been a spirit, and cried out: 6:50 For they all saw him, and were</a>
<a id='line_694'>troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be</a>
<a id='line_695'>of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.</a>
<a id='line_696'></a>
<a id='line_697'>6:51 And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and</a>
<a id='line_698'>they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.</a>
<a id='line_699'></a>
<a id='line_700'>6:52 For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their</a>
<a id='line_701'>heart was hardened.</a>
<a id='line_702'></a>
<a id='line_703'>6:53 And when they had passed over, they came into the land of</a>
<a id='line_704'>Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.</a>
<a id='line_705'></a>
<a id='line_706'>6:54 And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew</a>
<a id='line_707'>him, 6:55 And ran through that whole region round about, and began to</a>
<a id='line_708'>carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.</a>
<a id='line_709'></a>
<a id='line_710'>6:56 And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or</a>
<a id='line_711'>country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they</a>
<a id='line_712'>might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as</a>
<a id='line_713'>touched him were made whole.</a>
<a id='line_714'></a>
<a id='line_715'>7:1 Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the</a>
<a id='line_716'>scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_717'></a>
<a id='line_718'>7:2 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled,</a>
<a id='line_719'>that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</a>
<a id='line_720'></a>
<a id='line_721'>7:3 For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands</a>
<a id='line_722'>oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</a>
<a id='line_723'></a>
<a id='line_724'>7:4 And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat</a>
<a id='line_725'>not.</a>
<a id='line_726'></a>
<a id='line_727'>And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as</a>
<a id='line_728'>the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</a>
<a id='line_729'></a>
<a id='line_730'>7:5 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy</a>
<a id='line_731'>disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with</a>
<a id='line_732'>unwashen hands?  7:6 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias</a>
<a id='line_733'>prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth</a>
<a id='line_734'>me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</a>
<a id='line_735'></a>
<a id='line_736'>7:7 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the</a>
<a id='line_737'>commandments of men.</a>
<a id='line_738'></a>
<a id='line_739'>7:8 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of</a>
<a id='line_740'>men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things</a>
<a id='line_741'>ye do.</a>
<a id='line_742'></a>
<a id='line_743'>7:9 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God,</a>
<a id='line_744'>that ye may keep your own tradition.</a>
<a id='line_745'></a>
<a id='line_746'>7:10 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso</a>
<a id='line_747'>curseth father or mother, let him die the death: 7:11 But ye say, If a</a>
<a id='line_748'>man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a</a>
<a id='line_749'>gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.</a>
<a id='line_750'></a>
<a id='line_751'>7:12 And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his</a>
<a id='line_752'>mother; 7:13 Making the word of God of none effect through your</a>
<a id='line_753'>tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.</a>
<a id='line_754'></a>
<a id='line_755'>7:14 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto</a>
<a id='line_756'>them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand: 7:15 There is</a>
<a id='line_757'>nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but</a>
<a id='line_758'>the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.</a>
<a id='line_759'></a>
<a id='line_760'>7:16 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</a>
<a id='line_761'></a>
<a id='line_762'>7:17 And when he was entered into the house from the people, his</a>
<a id='line_763'>disciples asked him concerning the parable.</a>
<a id='line_764'></a>
<a id='line_765'>7:18 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do</a>
<a id='line_766'>ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the</a>
<a id='line_767'>man, it cannot defile him; 7:19 Because it entereth not into his</a>
<a id='line_768'>heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all</a>
<a id='line_769'>meats?  7:20 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that</a>
<a id='line_770'>defileth the man.</a>
<a id='line_771'></a>
<a id='line_772'>7:21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts,</a>
<a id='line_773'>adulteries, fornications, murders, 7:22 Thefts, covetousness,</a>
<a id='line_774'>wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride,</a>
<a id='line_775'>foolishness: 7:23 All these evil things come from within, and defile</a>
<a id='line_776'>the man.</a>
<a id='line_777'></a>
<a id='line_778'>7:24 And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and</a>
<a id='line_779'>Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but</a>
<a id='line_780'>he could not be hid.</a>
<a id='line_781'></a>
<a id='line_782'>7:25 For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit,</a>
<a id='line_783'>heard of him, and came and fell at his feet: 7:26 The woman was a</a>
<a id='line_784'>Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would</a>
<a id='line_785'>cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</a>
<a id='line_786'></a>
<a id='line_787'>7:27 But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it</a>
<a id='line_788'>is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it unto the</a>
<a id='line_789'>dogs.</a>
<a id='line_790'></a>
<a id='line_791'>7:28 And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under</a>
<a id='line_792'>the table eat of the children’s crumbs.</a>
<a id='line_793'></a>
<a id='line_794'>7:29 And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is</a>
<a id='line_795'>gone out of thy daughter.</a>
<a id='line_796'></a>
<a id='line_797'>7:30 And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out,</a>
<a id='line_798'>and her daughter laid upon the bed.</a>
<a id='line_799'></a>
<a id='line_800'>7:31 And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came</a>
<a id='line_801'>unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</a>
<a id='line_802'></a>
<a id='line_803'>7:32 And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment</a>
<a id='line_804'>in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.</a>
<a id='line_805'></a>
<a id='line_806'>7:33 And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers</a>
<a id='line_807'>into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue; 7:34 And looking</a>
<a id='line_808'>up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be</a>
<a id='line_809'>opened.</a>
<a id='line_810'></a>
<a id='line_811'>7:35 And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his</a>
<a id='line_812'>tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</a>
<a id='line_813'></a>
<a id='line_814'>7:36 And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he</a>
<a id='line_815'>charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it; 7:37</a>
<a id='line_816'>And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things</a>
<a id='line_817'>well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</a>
<a id='line_818'></a>
<a id='line_819'>8:1 In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing</a>
<a id='line_820'>to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them, 8:2</a>
<a id='line_821'>I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me</a>
<a id='line_822'>three days, and have nothing to eat: 8:3 And if I send them away</a>
<a id='line_823'>fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of</a>
<a id='line_824'>them came from far.</a>
<a id='line_825'></a>
<a id='line_826'>8:4 And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy</a>
<a id='line_827'>these men with bread here in the wilderness?  8:5 And he asked them,</a>
<a id='line_828'>How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.</a>
<a id='line_829'></a>
<a id='line_830'>8:6 And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took</a>
<a id='line_831'>the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his</a>
<a id='line_832'>disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.</a>
<a id='line_833'></a>
<a id='line_834'>8:7 And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to</a>
<a id='line_835'>set them also before them.</a>
<a id='line_836'></a>
<a id='line_837'>8:8 So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken</a>
<a id='line_838'>meat that was left seven baskets.</a>
<a id='line_839'></a>
<a id='line_840'>8:9 And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them</a>
<a id='line_841'>away.</a>
<a id='line_842'></a>
<a id='line_843'>8:10 And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and</a>
<a id='line_844'>came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</a>
<a id='line_845'></a>
<a id='line_846'>8:11 And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him,</a>
<a id='line_847'>seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</a>
<a id='line_848'></a>
<a id='line_849'>8:12 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this</a>
<a id='line_850'>generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no</a>
<a id='line_851'>sign be given unto this generation.</a>
<a id='line_852'></a>
<a id='line_853'>8:13 And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to</a>
<a id='line_854'>the other side.</a>
<a id='line_855'></a>
<a id='line_856'>8:14 Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they</a>
<a id='line_857'>in the ship with them more than one loaf.</a>
<a id='line_858'></a>
<a id='line_859'>8:15 And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of</a>
<a id='line_860'>the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.</a>
<a id='line_861'></a>
<a id='line_862'>8:16 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have</a>
<a id='line_863'>no bread.</a>
<a id='line_864'></a>
<a id='line_865'>8:17 And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye,</a>
<a id='line_866'>because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand?</a>
<a id='line_867'>have ye your heart yet hardened?  8:18 Having eyes, see ye not? and</a>
<a id='line_868'>having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?  8:19 When I brake</a>
<a id='line_869'>the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of</a>
<a id='line_870'>fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.</a>
<a id='line_871'></a>
<a id='line_872'>8:20 And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of</a>
<a id='line_873'>fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.</a>
<a id='line_874'></a>
<a id='line_875'>8:21 And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?  8:22</a>
<a id='line_876'>And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and</a>
<a id='line_877'>besought him to touch him.</a>
<a id='line_878'></a>
<a id='line_879'>8:23 And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the</a>
<a id='line_880'>town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he</a>
<a id='line_881'>asked him if he saw ought.</a>
<a id='line_882'></a>
<a id='line_883'>8:24 And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.</a>
<a id='line_884'></a>
<a id='line_885'>8:25 After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him</a>
<a id='line_886'>look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.</a>
<a id='line_887'></a>
<a id='line_888'>8:26 And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the</a>
<a id='line_889'>town, nor tell it to any in the town.</a>
<a id='line_890'></a>
<a id='line_891'>8:27 And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea</a>
<a id='line_892'>Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them,</a>
<a id='line_893'>Whom do men say that I am?  8:28 And they answered, John the Baptist;</a>
<a id='line_894'>but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.</a>
<a id='line_895'></a>
<a id='line_896'>8:29 And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter</a>
<a id='line_897'>answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.</a>
<a id='line_898'></a>
<a id='line_899'>8:30 And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</a>
<a id='line_900'></a>
<a id='line_901'>8:31 And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many</a>
<a id='line_902'>things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and</a>
<a id='line_903'>scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</a>
<a id='line_904'></a>
<a id='line_905'>8:32 And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to</a>
<a id='line_906'>rebuke him.</a>
<a id='line_907'></a>
<a id='line_908'>8:33 But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he</a>
<a id='line_909'>rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest</a>
<a id='line_910'>not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</a>
<a id='line_911'></a>
<a id='line_912'>8:34 And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples</a>
<a id='line_913'>also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny</a>
<a id='line_914'>himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</a>
<a id='line_915'></a>
<a id='line_916'>8:35 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever</a>
<a id='line_917'>shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save</a>
<a id='line_918'>it.</a>
<a id='line_919'></a>
<a id='line_920'>8:36 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world,</a>
<a id='line_921'>and lose his own soul?  8:37 Or what shall a man give in exchange for</a>
<a id='line_922'>his soul?  8:38 Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my</a>
<a id='line_923'>words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the</a>
<a id='line_924'>Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with</a>
<a id='line_925'>the holy angels.</a>
<a id='line_926'></a>
<a id='line_927'>9:1 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some</a>
<a id='line_928'>of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they</a>
<a id='line_929'>have seen the kingdom of God come with power.</a>
<a id='line_930'></a>
<a id='line_931'>9:2 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and</a>
<a id='line_932'>John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves:</a>
<a id='line_933'>and he was transfigured before them.</a>
<a id='line_934'></a>
<a id='line_935'>9:3 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no</a>
<a id='line_936'>fuller on earth can white them.</a>
<a id='line_937'></a>
<a id='line_938'>9:4 And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were</a>
<a id='line_939'>talking with Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_940'></a>
<a id='line_941'>9:5 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to</a>
<a id='line_942'>be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for</a>
<a id='line_943'>Moses, and one for Elias.</a>
<a id='line_944'></a>
<a id='line_945'>9:6 For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.</a>
<a id='line_946'></a>
<a id='line_947'>9:7 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out</a>
<a id='line_948'>of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</a>
<a id='line_949'></a>
<a id='line_950'>9:8 And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man</a>
<a id='line_951'>any more, save Jesus only with themselves.</a>
<a id='line_952'></a>
<a id='line_953'>9:9 And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they</a>
<a id='line_954'>should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were</a>
<a id='line_955'>risen from the dead.</a>
<a id='line_956'></a>
<a id='line_957'>9:10 And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with</a>
<a id='line_958'>another what the rising from the dead should mean.</a>
<a id='line_959'></a>
<a id='line_960'>9:11 And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must</a>
<a id='line_961'>first come?  9:12 And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh</a>
<a id='line_962'>first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of</a>
<a id='line_963'>man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.</a>
<a id='line_964'></a>
<a id='line_965'>9:13 But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done</a>
<a id='line_966'>unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.</a>
<a id='line_967'></a>
<a id='line_968'>9:14 And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about</a>
<a id='line_969'>them, and the scribes questioning with them.</a>
<a id='line_970'></a>
<a id='line_971'>9:15 And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were</a>
<a id='line_972'>greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.</a>
<a id='line_973'></a>
<a id='line_974'>9:16 And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?  9:17 And</a>
<a id='line_975'>one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto</a>
<a id='line_976'>thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit; 9:18 And wheresoever he taketh</a>
<a id='line_977'>him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and</a>
<a id='line_978'>pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him</a>
<a id='line_979'>out; and they could not.</a>
<a id='line_980'></a>
<a id='line_981'>9:19 He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long</a>
<a id='line_982'>shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.</a>
<a id='line_983'></a>
<a id='line_984'>9:20 And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway</a>
<a id='line_985'>the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.</a>
<a id='line_986'></a>
<a id='line_987'>9:21 And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto</a>
<a id='line_988'>him?  And he said, Of a child.</a>
<a id='line_989'></a>
<a id='line_990'>9:22 And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters,</a>
<a id='line_991'>to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us,</a>
<a id='line_992'>and help us.</a>
<a id='line_993'></a>
<a id='line_994'>9:23 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are</a>
<a id='line_995'>possible to him that believeth.</a>
<a id='line_996'></a>
<a id='line_997'>9:24 And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with</a>
<a id='line_998'>tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.</a>
<a id='line_999'></a>
<a id='line_1000'>9:25 When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked</a>
<a id='line_1001'>the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge</a>
<a id='line_1002'>thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.</a>
<a id='line_1003'></a>
<a id='line_1004'>9:26 And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and</a>
<a id='line_1005'>he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.</a>
<a id='line_1006'></a>
<a id='line_1007'>9:27 But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.</a>
<a id='line_1008'></a>
<a id='line_1009'>9:28 And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him</a>
<a id='line_1010'>privately, Why could not we cast him out?  9:29 And he said unto them,</a>
<a id='line_1011'>This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.</a>
<a id='line_1012'></a>
<a id='line_1013'>9:30 And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he</a>
<a id='line_1014'>would not that any man should know it.</a>
<a id='line_1015'></a>
<a id='line_1016'>9:31 For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man</a>
<a id='line_1017'>is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after</a>
<a id='line_1018'>that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.</a>
<a id='line_1019'></a>
<a id='line_1020'>9:32 But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.</a>
<a id='line_1021'></a>
<a id='line_1022'>9:33 And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them,</a>
<a id='line_1023'>What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?  9:34 But</a>
<a id='line_1024'>they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among</a>
<a id='line_1025'>themselves, who should be the greatest.</a>
<a id='line_1026'></a>
<a id='line_1027'>9:35 And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If</a>
<a id='line_1028'>any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant</a>
<a id='line_1029'>of all.</a>
<a id='line_1030'></a>
<a id='line_1031'>9:36 And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when</a>
<a id='line_1032'>he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them, 9:37 Whosoever shall</a>
<a id='line_1033'>receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever</a>
<a id='line_1034'>shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.</a>
<a id='line_1035'></a>
<a id='line_1036'>9:38 And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out</a>
<a id='line_1037'>devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him,</a>
<a id='line_1038'>because he followeth not us.</a>
<a id='line_1039'></a>
<a id='line_1040'>9:39 But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall</a>
<a id='line_1041'>do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.</a>
<a id='line_1042'></a>
<a id='line_1043'>9:40 For he that is not against us is on our part.</a>
<a id='line_1044'></a>
<a id='line_1045'>9:41 For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name,</a>
<a id='line_1046'>because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose</a>
<a id='line_1047'>his reward.</a>
<a id='line_1048'></a>
<a id='line_1049'>9:42 And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe</a>
<a id='line_1050'>in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his</a>
<a id='line_1051'>neck, and he were cast into the sea.</a>
<a id='line_1052'></a>
<a id='line_1053'>9:43 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to</a>
<a id='line_1054'>enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into</a>
<a id='line_1055'>the fire that never shall be quenched: 9:44 Where their worm dieth</a>
<a id='line_1056'>not, and the fire is not quenched.</a>
<a id='line_1057'></a>
<a id='line_1058'>9:45 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to</a>
<a id='line_1059'>enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into</a>
<a id='line_1060'>the fire that never shall be quenched: 9:46 Where their worm dieth</a>
<a id='line_1061'>not, and the fire is not quenched.</a>
<a id='line_1062'></a>
<a id='line_1063'>9:47 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee</a>
<a id='line_1064'>to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to</a>
<a id='line_1065'>be cast into hell fire: 9:48 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire</a>
<a id='line_1066'>is not quenched.</a>
<a id='line_1067'></a>
<a id='line_1068'>9:49 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice</a>
<a id='line_1069'>shall be salted with salt.</a>
<a id='line_1070'></a>
<a id='line_1071'>9:50 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith</a>
<a id='line_1072'>will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with</a>
<a id='line_1073'>another.</a>
<a id='line_1074'></a>
<a id='line_1075'>10:1 And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by</a>
<a id='line_1076'>the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and,</a>
<a id='line_1077'>as he was wont, he taught them again.</a>
<a id='line_1078'></a>
<a id='line_1079'>10:2 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a</a>
<a id='line_1080'>man to put away his wife? tempting him.</a>
<a id='line_1081'></a>
<a id='line_1082'>10:3 And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?</a>
<a id='line_1083'>10:4 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and</a>
<a id='line_1084'>to put her away.</a>
<a id='line_1085'></a>
<a id='line_1086'>10:5 And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your</a>
<a id='line_1087'>heart he wrote you this precept.</a>
<a id='line_1088'></a>
<a id='line_1089'>10:6 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and</a>
<a id='line_1090'>female.</a>
<a id='line_1091'></a>
<a id='line_1092'>10:7 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and</a>
<a id='line_1093'>cleave to his wife; 10:8 And they twain shall be one flesh: so then</a>
<a id='line_1094'>they are no more twain, but one flesh.</a>
<a id='line_1095'></a>
<a id='line_1096'>10:9 What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</a>
<a id='line_1097'></a>
<a id='line_1098'>10:10 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same</a>
<a id='line_1099'>matter.</a>
<a id='line_1100'></a>
<a id='line_1101'>10:11 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and</a>
<a id='line_1102'>marry another, committeth adultery against her.</a>
<a id='line_1103'></a>
<a id='line_1104'>10:12 And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to</a>
<a id='line_1105'>another, she committeth adultery.</a>
<a id='line_1106'></a>
<a id='line_1107'>10:13 And they brought young children to him, that he should touch</a>
<a id='line_1108'>them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.</a>
<a id='line_1109'></a>
<a id='line_1110'>10:14 But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_1111'>them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not:</a>
<a id='line_1112'>for of such is the kingdom of God.</a>
<a id='line_1113'></a>
<a id='line_1114'>10:15 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom</a>
<a id='line_1115'>of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.</a>
<a id='line_1116'></a>
<a id='line_1117'>10:16 And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and</a>
<a id='line_1118'>blessed them.</a>
<a id='line_1119'></a>
<a id='line_1120'>10:17 And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running,</a>
<a id='line_1121'>and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I</a>
<a id='line_1122'>may inherit eternal life?  10:18 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest</a>
<a id='line_1123'>thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.</a>
<a id='line_1124'></a>
<a id='line_1125'>10:19 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not</a>
<a id='line_1126'>kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy</a>
<a id='line_1127'>father and mother.  10:20 And he answered and said unto him, Master,</a>
<a id='line_1128'>all these have I observed from my youth.</a>
<a id='line_1129'></a>
<a id='line_1130'>10:21 Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing</a>
<a id='line_1131'>thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the</a>
<a id='line_1132'>poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the</a>
<a id='line_1133'>cross, and follow me.</a>
<a id='line_1134'></a>
<a id='line_1135'>10:22 And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had</a>
<a id='line_1136'>great possessions.</a>
<a id='line_1137'></a>
<a id='line_1138'>10:23 And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How</a>
<a id='line_1139'>hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</a>
<a id='line_1140'>10:24 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus</a>
<a id='line_1141'>answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for</a>
<a id='line_1142'>them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!  10:25 It</a>
<a id='line_1143'>is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a</a>
<a id='line_1144'>rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</a>
<a id='line_1145'></a>
<a id='line_1146'>10:26 And they were astonished out of measure, saying among</a>
<a id='line_1147'>themselves, Who then can be saved?  10:27 And Jesus looking upon them</a>
<a id='line_1148'>saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all</a>
<a id='line_1149'>things are possible.</a>
<a id='line_1150'></a>
<a id='line_1151'>10:28 Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have</a>
<a id='line_1152'>followed thee.</a>
<a id='line_1153'></a>
<a id='line_1154'>10:29 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no</a>
<a id='line_1155'>man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or</a>
<a id='line_1156'>mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,</a>
<a id='line_1157'>10:30 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses,</a>
<a id='line_1158'>and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with</a>
<a id='line_1159'>persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.</a>
<a id='line_1160'></a>
<a id='line_1161'>10:31 But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.</a>
<a id='line_1162'></a>
<a id='line_1163'>10:32 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went</a>
<a id='line_1164'>before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were</a>
<a id='line_1165'>afraid.</a>
<a id='line_1166'></a>
<a id='line_1167'>And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things</a>
<a id='line_1168'>should happen unto him, 10:33 Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem;</a>
<a id='line_1169'>and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto</a>
<a id='line_1170'>the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver</a>
<a id='line_1171'>him to the Gentiles: 10:34 And they shall mock him, and shall scourge</a>
<a id='line_1172'>him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he</a>
<a id='line_1173'>shall rise again.</a>
<a id='line_1174'></a>
<a id='line_1175'>10:35 And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1176'>Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall</a>
<a id='line_1177'>desire.</a>
<a id='line_1178'></a>
<a id='line_1179'>10:36 And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?</a>
<a id='line_1180'>10:37 They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy</a>
<a id='line_1181'>right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.</a>
<a id='line_1182'></a>
<a id='line_1183'>10:38 But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink</a>
<a id='line_1184'>of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am</a>
<a id='line_1185'>baptized with?  10:39 And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said</a>
<a id='line_1186'>unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with</a>
<a id='line_1187'>the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized: 10:40 But</a>
<a id='line_1188'>to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but</a>
<a id='line_1189'>it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.</a>
<a id='line_1190'></a>
<a id='line_1191'>10:41 And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with</a>
<a id='line_1192'>James and John.</a>
<a id='line_1193'></a>
<a id='line_1194'>10:42 But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that</a>
<a id='line_1195'>they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship</a>
<a id='line_1196'>over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.</a>
<a id='line_1197'></a>
<a id='line_1198'>10:43 But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great</a>
<a id='line_1199'>among you, shall be your minister: 10:44 And whosoever of you will be</a>
<a id='line_1200'>the chiefest, shall be servant of all.</a>
<a id='line_1201'></a>
<a id='line_1202'>10:45 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to</a>
<a id='line_1203'>minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</a>
<a id='line_1204'></a>
<a id='line_1205'>10:46 And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his</a>
<a id='line_1206'>disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of</a>
<a id='line_1207'>Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.</a>
<a id='line_1208'></a>
<a id='line_1209'>10:47 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry</a>
<a id='line_1210'>out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.</a>
<a id='line_1211'></a>
<a id='line_1212'>10:48 And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried</a>
<a id='line_1213'>the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.</a>
<a id='line_1214'></a>
<a id='line_1215'>10:49 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they</a>
<a id='line_1216'>call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he</a>
<a id='line_1217'>calleth thee.</a>
<a id='line_1218'></a>
<a id='line_1219'>10:50 And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_1220'></a>
<a id='line_1221'>10:51 And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I</a>
<a id='line_1222'>should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might</a>
<a id='line_1223'>receive my sight.</a>
<a id='line_1224'></a>
<a id='line_1225'>10:52 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee</a>
<a id='line_1226'>whole.</a>
<a id='line_1227'></a>
<a id='line_1228'>And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.</a>
<a id='line_1229'></a>
<a id='line_1230'>11:1 And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany,</a>
<a id='line_1231'>at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples, 11:2</a>
<a id='line_1232'>And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you:</a>
<a id='line_1233'>and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied,</a>
<a id='line_1234'>whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.</a>
<a id='line_1235'></a>
<a id='line_1236'>11:3 And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord</a>
<a id='line_1237'>hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.</a>
<a id='line_1238'></a>
<a id='line_1239'>11:4 And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door</a>
<a id='line_1240'>without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.</a>
<a id='line_1241'></a>
<a id='line_1242'>11:5 And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye,</a>
<a id='line_1243'>loosing the colt?  11:6 And they said unto them even as Jesus had</a>
<a id='line_1244'>commanded: and they let them go.</a>
<a id='line_1245'></a>
<a id='line_1246'>11:7 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on</a>
<a id='line_1247'>him; and he sat upon him.</a>
<a id='line_1248'></a>
<a id='line_1249'>11:8 And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down</a>
<a id='line_1250'>branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.</a>
<a id='line_1251'></a>
<a id='line_1252'>11:9 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1253'>Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: 11:10</a>
<a id='line_1254'>Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of</a>
<a id='line_1255'>the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.</a>
<a id='line_1256'></a>
<a id='line_1257'>11:11 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when</a>
<a id='line_1258'>he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was</a>
<a id='line_1259'>come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.</a>
<a id='line_1260'></a>
<a id='line_1261'>11:12 And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was</a>
<a id='line_1262'>hungry: 11:13 And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came,</a>
<a id='line_1263'>if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he</a>
<a id='line_1264'>found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.</a>
<a id='line_1265'></a>
<a id='line_1266'>11:14 And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee</a>
<a id='line_1267'>hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.</a>
<a id='line_1268'></a>
<a id='line_1269'>11:15 And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and</a>
<a id='line_1270'>began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and</a>
<a id='line_1271'>overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that</a>
<a id='line_1272'>sold doves; 11:16 And would not suffer that any man should carry any</a>
<a id='line_1273'>vessel through the temple.</a>
<a id='line_1274'></a>
<a id='line_1275'>11:17 And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house</a>
<a id='line_1276'>shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made</a>
<a id='line_1277'>it a den of thieves.</a>
<a id='line_1278'></a>
<a id='line_1279'>11:18 And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they</a>
<a id='line_1280'>might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was</a>
<a id='line_1281'>astonished at his doctrine.</a>
<a id='line_1282'></a>
<a id='line_1283'>11:19 And when even was come, he went out of the city.</a>
<a id='line_1284'></a>
<a id='line_1285'>11:20 And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree</a>
<a id='line_1286'>dried up from the roots.</a>
<a id='line_1287'></a>
<a id='line_1288'>11:21 And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold,</a>
<a id='line_1289'>the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.</a>
<a id='line_1290'></a>
<a id='line_1291'>11:22 And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.</a>
<a id='line_1292'></a>
<a id='line_1293'>11:23 For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this</a>
<a id='line_1294'>mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall</a>
<a id='line_1295'>not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he</a>
<a id='line_1296'>saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.</a>
<a id='line_1297'></a>
<a id='line_1298'>11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye</a>
<a id='line_1299'>pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</a>
<a id='line_1300'></a>
<a id='line_1301'>11:25 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against</a>
<a id='line_1302'>any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your</a>
<a id='line_1303'>trespasses.</a>
<a id='line_1304'></a>
<a id='line_1305'>11:26 But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in</a>
<a id='line_1306'>heaven forgive your trespasses.</a>
<a id='line_1307'></a>
<a id='line_1308'>11:27 And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the</a>
<a id='line_1309'>temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the</a>
<a id='line_1310'>elders, 11:28 And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these</a>
<a id='line_1311'>things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?  11:29</a>
<a id='line_1312'>And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one</a>
<a id='line_1313'>question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do</a>
<a id='line_1314'>these things.</a>
<a id='line_1315'></a>
<a id='line_1316'>11:30 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.</a>
<a id='line_1317'></a>
<a id='line_1318'>11:31 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From</a>
<a id='line_1319'>heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?  11:32 But if we</a>
<a id='line_1320'>shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John,</a>
<a id='line_1321'>that he was a prophet indeed.</a>
<a id='line_1322'></a>
<a id='line_1323'>11:33 And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus</a>
<a id='line_1324'>answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I</a>
<a id='line_1325'>do these things.</a>
<a id='line_1326'></a>
<a id='line_1327'>12:1 And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man</a>
<a id='line_1328'>planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for</a>
<a id='line_1329'>the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went</a>
<a id='line_1330'>into a far country.</a>
<a id='line_1331'></a>
<a id='line_1332'>12:2 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he</a>
<a id='line_1333'>might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.</a>
<a id='line_1334'></a>
<a id='line_1335'>12:3 And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.</a>
<a id='line_1336'></a>
<a id='line_1337'>12:4 And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast</a>
<a id='line_1338'>stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully</a>
<a id='line_1339'>handled.</a>
<a id='line_1340'></a>
<a id='line_1341'>12:5 And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others;</a>
<a id='line_1342'>beating some, and killing some.</a>
<a id='line_1343'></a>
<a id='line_1344'>12:6 Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also</a>
<a id='line_1345'>last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.</a>
<a id='line_1346'></a>
<a id='line_1347'>12:7 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir;</a>
<a id='line_1348'>come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.</a>
<a id='line_1349'></a>
<a id='line_1350'>12:8 And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the</a>
<a id='line_1351'>vineyard.</a>
<a id='line_1352'></a>
<a id='line_1353'>12:9 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come</a>
<a id='line_1354'>and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.</a>
<a id='line_1355'></a>
<a id='line_1356'>12:10 And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the</a>
<a id='line_1357'>builders rejected is become the head of the corner: 12:11 This was the</a>
<a id='line_1358'>Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?  12:12 And they sought</a>
<a id='line_1359'>to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had</a>
<a id='line_1360'>spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their</a>
<a id='line_1361'>way.</a>
<a id='line_1362'></a>
<a id='line_1363'>12:13 And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the</a>
<a id='line_1364'>Herodians, to catch him in his words.</a>
<a id='line_1365'></a>
<a id='line_1366'>12:14 And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that</a>
<a id='line_1367'>thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the</a>
<a id='line_1368'>person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to</a>
<a id='line_1369'>give tribute to Caesar, or not?  12:15 Shall we give, or shall we not</a>
<a id='line_1370'>give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye</a>
<a id='line_1371'>me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.</a>
<a id='line_1372'></a>
<a id='line_1373'>12:16 And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image</a>
<a id='line_1374'>and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar’s.</a>
<a id='line_1375'></a>
<a id='line_1376'>12:17 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things</a>
<a id='line_1377'>that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they</a>
<a id='line_1378'>marvelled at him.</a>
<a id='line_1379'></a>
<a id='line_1380'>12:18 Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no</a>
<a id='line_1381'>resurrection; and they asked him, saying, 12:19 Master, Moses wrote</a>
<a id='line_1382'>unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and</a>
<a id='line_1383'>leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up</a>
<a id='line_1384'>seed unto his brother.</a>
<a id='line_1385'></a>
<a id='line_1386'>12:20 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and</a>
<a id='line_1387'>dying left no seed.</a>
<a id='line_1388'></a>
<a id='line_1389'>12:21 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and</a>
<a id='line_1390'>the third likewise.</a>
<a id='line_1391'></a>
<a id='line_1392'>12:22 And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman</a>
<a id='line_1393'>died also.</a>
<a id='line_1394'></a>
<a id='line_1395'>12:23 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife</a>
<a id='line_1396'>shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</a>
<a id='line_1397'></a>
<a id='line_1398'>12:24 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err,</a>
<a id='line_1399'>because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?  12:25</a>
<a id='line_1400'>For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are</a>
<a id='line_1401'>given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1402'></a>
<a id='line_1403'>12:26 And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in</a>
<a id='line_1404'>the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am</a>
<a id='line_1405'>the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  12:27</a>
<a id='line_1406'>He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore</a>
<a id='line_1407'>do greatly err.</a>
<a id='line_1408'></a>
<a id='line_1409'>12:28 And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning</a>
<a id='line_1410'>together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him,</a>
<a id='line_1411'>Which is the first commandment of all?  12:29 And Jesus answered him,</a>
<a id='line_1412'>The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God</a>
<a id='line_1413'>is one Lord: 12:30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy</a>
<a id='line_1414'>heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy</a>
<a id='line_1415'>strength: this is the first commandment.</a>
<a id='line_1416'></a>
<a id='line_1417'>12:31 And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy</a>
<a id='line_1418'>neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than</a>
<a id='line_1419'>these.</a>
<a id='line_1420'></a>
<a id='line_1421'>12:32 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the</a>
<a id='line_1422'>truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he: 12:33 And</a>
<a id='line_1423'>to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and</a>
<a id='line_1424'>with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his</a>
<a id='line_1425'>neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and</a>
<a id='line_1426'>sacrifices.</a>
<a id='line_1427'></a>
<a id='line_1428'>12:34 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto</a>
<a id='line_1429'>him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that</a>
<a id='line_1430'>durst ask him any question.</a>
<a id='line_1431'></a>
<a id='line_1432'>12:35 And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How</a>
<a id='line_1433'>say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?  12:36 For David</a>
<a id='line_1434'>himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on</a>
<a id='line_1435'>my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</a>
<a id='line_1436'></a>
<a id='line_1437'>12:37 David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then</a>
<a id='line_1438'>his son? And the common people heard him gladly.</a>
<a id='line_1439'></a>
<a id='line_1440'>12:38 And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes,</a>
<a id='line_1441'>which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the</a>
<a id='line_1442'>marketplaces, 12:39 And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the</a>
<a id='line_1443'>uppermost rooms at feasts: 12:40 Which devour widows’ houses, and for</a>
<a id='line_1444'>a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.</a>
<a id='line_1445'></a>
<a id='line_1446'>12:41 And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the</a>
<a id='line_1447'>people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in</a>
<a id='line_1448'>much.</a>
<a id='line_1449'></a>
<a id='line_1450'>12:42 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites,</a>
<a id='line_1451'>which make a farthing.</a>
<a id='line_1452'></a>
<a id='line_1453'>12:43 And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,</a>
<a id='line_1454'>Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than</a>
<a id='line_1455'>all they which have cast into the treasury: 12:44 For all they did</a>
<a id='line_1456'>cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that</a>
<a id='line_1457'>she had, even all her living.</a>
<a id='line_1458'></a>
<a id='line_1459'>13:1 And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto</a>
<a id='line_1460'>him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!</a>
<a id='line_1461'>13:2 And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great</a>
<a id='line_1462'>buildings?  there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall</a>
<a id='line_1463'>not be thrown down.</a>
<a id='line_1464'></a>
<a id='line_1465'>13:3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple,</a>
<a id='line_1466'>Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, 13:4 Tell us,</a>
<a id='line_1467'>when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these</a>
<a id='line_1468'>things shall be fulfilled?  13:5 And Jesus answering them began to</a>
<a id='line_1469'>say, Take heed lest any man deceive you: 13:6 For many shall come in</a>
<a id='line_1470'>my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.</a>
<a id='line_1471'></a>
<a id='line_1472'>13:7 And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not</a>
<a id='line_1473'>troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.</a>
<a id='line_1474'></a>
<a id='line_1475'>13:8 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against</a>
<a id='line_1476'>kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there</a>
<a id='line_1477'>shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.</a>
<a id='line_1478'></a>
<a id='line_1479'>13:9 But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to</a>
<a id='line_1480'>councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be</a>
<a id='line_1481'>brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against</a>
<a id='line_1482'>them.</a>
<a id='line_1483'></a>
<a id='line_1484'>13:10 And the gospel must first be published among all nations.</a>
<a id='line_1485'></a>
<a id='line_1486'>13:11 But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no</a>
<a id='line_1487'>thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but</a>
<a id='line_1488'>whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is</a>
<a id='line_1489'>not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_1490'></a>
<a id='line_1491'>13:12 Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the</a>
<a id='line_1492'>father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and</a>
<a id='line_1493'>shall cause them to be put to death.</a>
<a id='line_1494'></a>
<a id='line_1495'>13:13 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that</a>
<a id='line_1496'>shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</a>
<a id='line_1497'></a>
<a id='line_1498'>13:14 But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of</a>
<a id='line_1499'>by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that</a>
<a id='line_1500'>readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the</a>
<a id='line_1501'>mountains: 13:15 And let him that is on the housetop not go down into</a>
<a id='line_1502'>the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:</a>
<a id='line_1503'>13:16 And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take</a>
<a id='line_1504'>up his garment.</a>
<a id='line_1505'></a>
<a id='line_1506'>13:17 But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck</a>
<a id='line_1507'>in those days!  13:18 And pray ye that your flight be not in the</a>
<a id='line_1508'>winter.</a>
<a id='line_1509'></a>
<a id='line_1510'>13:19 For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the</a>
<a id='line_1511'>beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither</a>
<a id='line_1512'>shall be.</a>
<a id='line_1513'></a>
<a id='line_1514'>13:20 And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh</a>
<a id='line_1515'>should be saved: but for the elect’s sake, whom he hath chosen, he</a>
<a id='line_1516'>hath shortened the days.</a>
<a id='line_1517'></a>
<a id='line_1518'>13:21 And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or,</a>
<a id='line_1519'>lo, he is there; believe him not: 13:22 For false Christs and false</a>
<a id='line_1520'>prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if</a>
<a id='line_1521'>it were possible, even the elect.</a>
<a id='line_1522'></a>
<a id='line_1523'>13:23 But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.</a>
<a id='line_1524'></a>
<a id='line_1525'>13:24 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be</a>
<a id='line_1526'>darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, 13:25 And the stars</a>
<a id='line_1527'>of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be</a>
<a id='line_1528'>shaken.</a>
<a id='line_1529'></a>
<a id='line_1530'>13:26 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with</a>
<a id='line_1531'>great power and glory.</a>
<a id='line_1532'></a>
<a id='line_1533'>13:27 And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his</a>
<a id='line_1534'>elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the</a>
<a id='line_1535'>uttermost part of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1536'></a>
<a id='line_1537'>13:28 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet</a>
<a id='line_1538'>tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near: 13:29</a>
<a id='line_1539'>So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass,</a>
<a id='line_1540'>know that it is nigh, even at the doors.</a>
<a id='line_1541'></a>
<a id='line_1542'>13:30 Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till</a>
<a id='line_1543'>all these things be done.</a>

<a id='line_1550'></a>
<a id='line_1551'>13:33 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.</a>
<a id='line_1552'></a>
<a id='line_1553'>13:34 For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left</a>
<a id='line_1554'>his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his</a>

<a id='line_1556'></a>
<a id='line_1557'>13:35 Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house</a>
<a id='line_1558'>cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the</a>

<a id='line_1560'></a>
<a id='line_1561'>13:37 And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.</a>

<a id='line_1563'>14:1 After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened</a>
<a id='line_1564'>bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might</a>
<a id='line_1565'>take him by craft, and put him to death.</a>
<a id='line_1566'></a>
<a id='line_1567'>14:2 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of</a>
<a id='line_1568'>the people.</a>

<a id='line_1570'>14:3 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat</a>
<a id='line_1571'>at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of</a>
<a id='line_1572'>spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his</a>
<a id='line_1573'>head.</a>
<a id='line_1574'></a>
<a id='line_1575'>14:4 And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and</a>
<a id='line_1576'>said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?  14:5 For it might have</a>
<a id='line_1577'>been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to</a>
<a id='line_1578'>the poor. And they murmured against her.</a>
<a id='line_1579'></a>
<a id='line_1580'>14:6 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath</a>
<a id='line_1581'>wrought a good work on me.</a>
<a id='line_1582'></a>
<a id='line_1583'>14:7 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye</a>
<a id='line_1584'>may do them good: but me ye have not always.</a>
<a id='line_1585'></a>
<a id='line_1586'>14:8 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my</a>
<a id='line_1587'>body to the burying.</a>
<a id='line_1588'></a>
<a id='line_1589'>14:9 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached</a>
<a id='line_1590'>throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be</a>
<a id='line_1591'>spoken of for a memorial of her.</a>
<a id='line_1592'></a>
<a id='line_1593'>14:10 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief</a>
<a id='line_1594'>priests, to betray him unto them.</a>
<a id='line_1595'></a>
<a id='line_1596'>14:11 And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him</a>
<a id='line_1597'>money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</a>
<a id='line_1598'></a>
<a id='line_1599'>14:12 And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the</a>
<a id='line_1600'>passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and</a>
<a id='line_1601'>prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?  14:13 And he sendeth forth</a>
<a id='line_1602'>two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and</a>
<a id='line_1603'>there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.</a>
<a id='line_1604'></a>
<a id='line_1605'>14:14 And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the</a>
<a id='line_1606'>house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat</a>
<a id='line_1607'>the passover with my disciples?  14:15 And he will shew you a large</a>
<a id='line_1608'>upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.</a>
<a id='line_1609'></a>
<a id='line_1610'>14:16 And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found</a>
<a id='line_1611'>as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.</a>
<a id='line_1612'></a>
<a id='line_1613'>14:17 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.</a>
<a id='line_1614'></a>
<a id='line_1615'>14:18 And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you,</a>
<a id='line_1616'>One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.</a>
<a id='line_1617'></a>
<a id='line_1618'>14:19 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one,</a>
<a id='line_1619'>Is it I? and another said, Is it I?  14:20 And he answered and said</a>
<a id='line_1620'>unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.</a>
<a id='line_1621'></a>
<a id='line_1622'>14:21 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to</a>
<a id='line_1623'>that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man</a>
<a id='line_1624'>if he had never been born.</a>
<a id='line_1625'></a>
<a id='line_1626'>14:22 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake</a>
<a id='line_1627'>it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</a>
<a id='line_1628'></a>
<a id='line_1629'>14:23 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to</a>
<a id='line_1630'>them: and they all drank of it.</a>
<a id='line_1631'></a>
<a id='line_1632'>14:24 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament,</a>
<a id='line_1633'>which is shed for many.</a>
<a id='line_1634'></a>
<a id='line_1635'>14:25 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the</a>
<a id='line_1636'>vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.</a>
<a id='line_1637'></a>
<a id='line_1638'>14:26 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of</a>
<a id='line_1639'>Olives.</a>
<a id='line_1640'></a>
<a id='line_1641'>14:27 And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of</a>
<a id='line_1642'>me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the</a>
<a id='line_1643'>sheep shall be scattered.</a>
<a id='line_1644'></a>
<a id='line_1645'>14:28 But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.</a>
<a id='line_1646'></a>
<a id='line_1647'>14:29 But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet</a>
<a id='line_1648'>will not I.</a>
<a id='line_1649'></a>
<a id='line_1650'>14:30 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day,</a>
<a id='line_1651'>even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me</a>
<a id='line_1652'>thrice.</a>
<a id='line_1653'></a>
<a id='line_1654'>14:31 But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I</a>
<a id='line_1655'>will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.</a>
<a id='line_1656'></a>
<a id='line_1657'>14:32 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he</a>
<a id='line_1658'>saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</a>
<a id='line_1659'></a>
<a id='line_1660'>14:33 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be</a>
<a id='line_1661'>sore amazed, and to be very heavy; 14:34 And saith unto them, My soul</a>
<a id='line_1662'>is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.</a>
<a id='line_1663'></a>
<a id='line_1664'>14:35 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed</a>
<a id='line_1665'>that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</a>
<a id='line_1666'></a>
<a id='line_1667'>14:36 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee;</a>
<a id='line_1668'>take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what</a>
<a id='line_1669'>thou wilt.</a>
<a id='line_1670'></a>
<a id='line_1671'>14:37 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter,</a>
<a id='line_1672'>Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?  14:38 Watch</a>
<a id='line_1673'>ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready,</a>
<a id='line_1674'>but the flesh is weak.</a>
<a id='line_1675'></a>
<a id='line_1676'>14:39 And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.</a>
<a id='line_1677'></a>
<a id='line_1678'>14:40 And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their</a>
<a id='line_1679'>eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.</a>
<a id='line_1680'></a>
<a id='line_1681'>14:41 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now,</a>
<a id='line_1682'>and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of</a>
<a id='line_1683'>man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</a>
<a id='line_1684'></a>
<a id='line_1685'>14:42 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.</a>
<a id='line_1686'></a>
<a id='line_1687'>14:43 And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the</a>
<a id='line_1688'>twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from</a>
<a id='line_1689'>the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</a>
<a id='line_1690'></a>
<a id='line_1691'>14:44 And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1692'>Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away</a>
<a id='line_1693'>safely.</a>
<a id='line_1694'></a>
<a id='line_1695'>14:45 And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and</a>
<a id='line_1696'>saith, Master, master; and kissed him.</a>
<a id='line_1697'></a>
<a id='line_1698'>14:46 And they laid their hands on him, and took him.</a>
<a id='line_1699'></a>
<a id='line_1700'>14:47 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant</a>
<a id='line_1701'>of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</a>
<a id='line_1702'></a>
<a id='line_1703'>14:48 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as</a>
<a id='line_1704'>against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?  14:49 I was</a>
<a id='line_1705'>daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the</a>
<a id='line_1706'>scriptures must be fulfilled.</a>
<a id='line_1707'></a>
<a id='line_1708'>14:50 And they all forsook him, and fled.</a>
<a id='line_1709'></a>
<a id='line_1710'>14:51 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth</a>
<a id='line_1711'>cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him: 14:52</a>
<a id='line_1712'>And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</a>
<a id='line_1713'></a>
<a id='line_1714'>14:53 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were</a>
<a id='line_1715'>assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</a>
<a id='line_1716'></a>
<a id='line_1717'>14:54 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the</a>
<a id='line_1718'>high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the</a>
<a id='line_1719'>fire.</a>
<a id='line_1720'></a>
<a id='line_1721'>14:55 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness</a>
<a id='line_1722'>against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.</a>
<a id='line_1723'></a>
<a id='line_1724'>14:56 For many bare false witness against him, but their witness</a>
<a id='line_1725'>agreed not together.</a>
<a id='line_1726'></a>
<a id='line_1727'>14:57 And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him,</a>
<a id='line_1728'>saying, 14:58 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is</a>
<a id='line_1729'>made with hands, and within three days I will build another made</a>
<a id='line_1730'>without hands.</a>
<a id='line_1731'></a>
<a id='line_1732'>14:59 But neither so did their witness agree together.</a>
<a id='line_1733'></a>
<a id='line_1734'>14:60 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus,</a>
<a id='line_1735'>saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against</a>
<a id='line_1736'>thee?  14:61 But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the</a>
<a id='line_1737'>high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son</a>
<a id='line_1738'>of the Blessed?  14:62 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son</a>
<a id='line_1739'>of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of</a>
<a id='line_1740'>heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1741'></a>
<a id='line_1742'>14:63 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we</a>
<a id='line_1743'>any further witnesses?  14:64 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think</a>
<a id='line_1744'>ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</a>
<a id='line_1745'></a>
<a id='line_1746'>14:65 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to</a>
<a id='line_1747'>buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike</a>
<a id='line_1748'>him with the palms of their hands.</a>
<a id='line_1749'></a>
<a id='line_1750'>14:66 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the</a>
<a id='line_1751'>maids of the high priest: 14:67 And when she saw Peter warming</a>
<a id='line_1752'>himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus</a>
<a id='line_1753'>of Nazareth.</a>
<a id='line_1754'></a>
<a id='line_1755'>14:68 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what</a>
<a id='line_1756'>thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.</a>
<a id='line_1757'></a>
<a id='line_1758'>14:69 And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood</a>
<a id='line_1759'>by, This is one of them.</a>
<a id='line_1760'></a>
<a id='line_1761'>14:70 And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by</a>
<a id='line_1762'>said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a</a>
<a id='line_1763'>Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.</a>
<a id='line_1764'></a>
<a id='line_1765'>14:71 But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man</a>
<a id='line_1766'>of whom ye speak.</a>
<a id='line_1767'></a>
<a id='line_1768'>14:72 And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the</a>
<a id='line_1769'>word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_1770'>deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.</a>
<a id='line_1771'></a>
<a id='line_1772'>15:1 And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a</a>
<a id='line_1773'>consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and</a>
<a id='line_1774'>bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</a>
<a id='line_1775'></a>
<a id='line_1776'>15:2 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he</a>
<a id='line_1777'>answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.</a>
<a id='line_1778'></a>
<a id='line_1779'>15:3 And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered</a>
<a id='line_1780'>nothing.</a>
<a id='line_1781'></a>
<a id='line_1782'>15:4 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?</a>
<a id='line_1783'>behold how many things they witness against thee.</a>
<a id='line_1784'></a>
<a id='line_1785'>15:5 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</a>
<a id='line_1786'></a>
<a id='line_1787'>15:6 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever</a>
<a id='line_1788'>they desired.</a>
<a id='line_1789'></a>
<a id='line_1790'>15:7 And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that</a>
<a id='line_1791'>had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the</a>
<a id='line_1792'>insurrection.</a>
<a id='line_1793'></a>
<a id='line_1794'>15:8 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he</a>
<a id='line_1795'>had ever done unto them.</a>
<a id='line_1796'></a>
<a id='line_1797'>15:9 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you</a>
<a id='line_1798'>the King of the Jews?  15:10 For he knew that the chief priests had</a>
<a id='line_1799'>delivered him for envy.</a>
<a id='line_1800'></a>
<a id='line_1801'>15:11 But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather</a>
<a id='line_1802'>release Barabbas unto them.</a>
<a id='line_1803'></a>
<a id='line_1804'>15:12 And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then</a>
<a id='line_1805'>that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?  15:13 And</a>
<a id='line_1806'>they cried out again, Crucify him.</a>
<a id='line_1807'></a>
<a id='line_1808'>15:14 Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And</a>
<a id='line_1809'>they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</a>
<a id='line_1810'></a>
<a id='line_1811'>15:15 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas</a>
<a id='line_1812'>unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be</a>
<a id='line_1813'>crucified.</a>
<a id='line_1814'></a>
<a id='line_1815'>15:16 And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium;</a>
<a id='line_1816'>and they call together the whole band.</a>
<a id='line_1817'></a>
<a id='line_1818'>15:17 And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns,</a>
<a id='line_1819'>and put it about his head, 15:18 And began to salute him, Hail, King</a>
<a id='line_1820'>of the Jews!  15:19 And they smote him on the head with a reed, and</a>
<a id='line_1821'>did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</a>
<a id='line_1822'></a>
<a id='line_1823'>15:20 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him,</a>
<a id='line_1824'>and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</a>
<a id='line_1825'></a>
<a id='line_1826'>15:21 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out</a>
<a id='line_1827'>of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</a>
<a id='line_1828'></a>
<a id='line_1829'>15:22 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being</a>
<a id='line_1830'>interpreted, The place of a skull.</a>
<a id='line_1831'></a>
<a id='line_1832'>15:23 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he</a>
<a id='line_1833'>received it not.</a>
<a id='line_1834'></a>
<a id='line_1835'>15:24 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments,</a>
<a id='line_1836'>casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</a>
<a id='line_1837'></a>
<a id='line_1838'>15:25 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</a>
<a id='line_1839'></a>
<a id='line_1840'>15:26 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE</a>
<a id='line_1841'>KING OF THE JEWS.</a>
<a id='line_1842'></a>
<a id='line_1843'>15:27 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right</a>
<a id='line_1844'>hand, and the other on his left.</a>
<a id='line_1845'></a>
<a id='line_1846'>15:28 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was</a>
<a id='line_1847'>numbered with the transgressors.</a>
<a id='line_1848'></a>
<a id='line_1849'>15:29 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and</a>
<a id='line_1850'>saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three</a>
<a id='line_1851'>days, 15:30 Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</a>
<a id='line_1852'></a>
<a id='line_1853'>15:31 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves</a>
<a id='line_1854'>with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</a>
<a id='line_1855'></a>
<a id='line_1856'>15:32 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that</a>
<a id='line_1857'>we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled</a>
<a id='line_1858'>him.</a>
<a id='line_1859'></a>
<a id='line_1860'>15:33 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the</a>
<a id='line_1861'>whole land until the ninth hour.</a>
<a id='line_1862'></a>
<a id='line_1863'>15:34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1864'>Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my</a>
<a id='line_1865'>God, why hast thou forsaken me?  15:35 And some of them that stood by,</a>
<a id='line_1866'>when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.</a>
<a id='line_1867'></a>
<a id='line_1868'>15:36 And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a</a>
<a id='line_1869'>reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether</a>
<a id='line_1870'>Elias will come to take him down.</a>
<a id='line_1871'></a>
<a id='line_1872'>15:37 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</a>
<a id='line_1873'></a>
<a id='line_1874'>15:38 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the</a>
<a id='line_1875'>bottom.</a>
<a id='line_1876'></a>
<a id='line_1877'>15:39 And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that</a>
<a id='line_1878'>he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was</a>
<a id='line_1879'>the Son of God.</a>
<a id='line_1880'></a>
<a id='line_1881'>15:40 There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary</a>
<a id='line_1882'>Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and</a>
<a id='line_1883'>Salome; 15:41 (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and</a>
<a id='line_1884'>ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto</a>
<a id='line_1885'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1886'></a>
<a id='line_1887'>15:42 And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation,</a>
<a id='line_1888'>that is, the day before the sabbath, 15:43 Joseph of Arimathaea, an</a>
<a id='line_1889'>honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came,</a>
<a id='line_1890'>and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_1891'></a>
<a id='line_1892'>15:44 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto</a>
<a id='line_1893'>him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</a>
<a id='line_1894'></a>
<a id='line_1895'>15:45 And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to</a>
<a id='line_1896'>Joseph.</a>
<a id='line_1897'></a>
<a id='line_1898'>15:46 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in</a>
<a id='line_1899'>the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock,</a>
<a id='line_1900'>and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.</a>
<a id='line_1901'></a>
<a id='line_1902'>15:47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he</a>
<a id='line_1903'>was laid.</a>
<a id='line_1904'></a>
<a id='line_1905'>16:1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the</a>
<a id='line_1906'>mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might</a>
<a id='line_1907'>come and anoint him.</a>
<a id='line_1908'></a>
<a id='line_1909'>16:2 And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they</a>
<a id='line_1910'>came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.</a>
<a id='line_1911'></a>
<a id='line_1912'>16:3 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone</a>
<a id='line_1913'>from the door of the sepulchre?  16:4 And when they looked, they saw</a>
<a id='line_1914'>that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.</a>
<a id='line_1915'></a>
<a id='line_1916'>16:5 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on</a>
<a id='line_1917'>the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were</a>
<a id='line_1918'>affrighted.</a>
<a id='line_1919'></a>
<a id='line_1920'>16:6 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of</a>
<a id='line_1921'>Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the</a>
<a id='line_1922'>place where they laid him.</a>
<a id='line_1923'></a>
<a id='line_1924'>16:7 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth</a>
<a id='line_1925'>before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.</a>
<a id='line_1926'></a>
<a id='line_1927'>16:8 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they</a>
<a id='line_1928'>trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for</a>
<a id='line_1929'>they were afraid.</a>
<a id='line_1930'></a>
<a id='line_1931'>16:9 Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he</a>
<a id='line_1932'>appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven</a>
<a id='line_1933'>devils.</a>
<a id='line_1934'></a>
<a id='line_1935'>16:10 And she went and told them that had been with him, as they</a>
<a id='line_1936'>mourned and wept.</a>
<a id='line_1937'></a>
<a id='line_1938'>16:11 And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been</a>
<a id='line_1939'>seen of her, believed not.</a>
<a id='line_1940'></a>
<a id='line_1941'>16:12 After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they</a>
<a id='line_1942'>walked, and went into the country.</a>
<a id='line_1943'></a>
<a id='line_1944'>16:13 And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed</a>
<a id='line_1945'>they them.</a>
<a id='line_1946'></a>
<a id='line_1947'>16:14 Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and</a>
<a id='line_1948'>upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they</a>
<a id='line_1949'>believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.</a>
<a id='line_1950'></a>
<a id='line_1951'>16:15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the</a>
<a id='line_1952'>gospel to every creature.</a>
<a id='line_1953'></a>
<a id='line_1954'>16:16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that</a>
<a id='line_1955'>believeth not shall be damned.</a>
<a id='line_1956'></a>
<a id='line_1957'>16:17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall</a>
<a id='line_1958'>they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; 16:18 They</a>
<a id='line_1959'>shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall</a>
<a id='line_1960'>not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall</a>
<a id='line_1961'>recover.</a>
<a id='line_1962'></a>
<a id='line_1963'>16:19 So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up</a>
<a id='line_1964'>into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.</a>
<a id='line_1965'></a>
<a id='line_1966'>16:20 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working</a>
<a id='line_1967'>with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_1968'></a>
