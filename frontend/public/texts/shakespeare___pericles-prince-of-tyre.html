<a id='line_386'>[_To Lords without._] Let none disturb us. — Why should this change of</a>
<a id='line_387'>thoughts,</a>
<a id='line_388'>The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,</a>
<a id='line_389'>Be my so used a guest as not an hour</a>

<a id='line_399'>Have after-nourishment and life by care;</a>

<a id='line_2991'></a>
<a id='line_2992'>FIRST GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_2993'>But to have divinity preached there! did you ever dream of such a</a>
<a id='line_2994'>thing?</a>
<a id='line_2995'></a>
<a id='line_2996'>SECOND GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_2997'>No, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy houses: shall’s go hear the</a>
<a id='line_2998'>vestals sing?</a>
<a id='line_2999'></a>
<a id='line_3000'>FIRST GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_3001'>I’ll do anything now that is virtuous; but I am out of the road of</a>

<a id='line_3013'>Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she had ne’er come here.</a>
<a id='line_3014'></a>
<a id='line_3015'>BAWD.</a>
<a id='line_3016'>Fie, fie upon her! She’s able to freeze the god Priapus, and undo a</a>
<a id='line_3017'>whole generation. We must either get her ravished, or be rid of her.</a>
<a id='line_3018'>When she should do for clients her fitment, and do me the kindness of</a>
<a id='line_3019'>our profession, she has me her quirks, her reasons, her master reasons,</a>
<a id='line_3020'>her prayers, her knees; that she would make a puritan of the devil, if</a>
<a id='line_3021'>he should cheapen a kiss of her.</a>
<a id='line_3022'></a>
<a id='line_3023'>BOULT.</a>
<a id='line_3024'>Faith, I must ravish her, or she’ll disfurnish us of all our cavaliers,</a>

<a id='line_3052'>withal, and defy the surgeon?</a>
<a id='line_3053'></a>
<a id='line_3054'>BAWD.</a>
<a id='line_3055'>We have here one, sir, if she would — but there never came her like in</a>

<a id='line_3057'></a>
<a id='line_3058'>LYSIMACHUS.</a>

<a id='line_3076'></a>

<a id='line_4117'>Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:</a>
<a id='line_4118'>In Pericles, his queen and daughter seen,</a>
<a id='line_4119'>Although assail’d with Fortune fierce and keen,</a>
<a id='line_4120'>Virtue preserved from fell destruction’s blast,</a>
<a id='line_4121'>Led on by heaven, and crown’d with joy at last.</a>
<a id='line_4122'>In Helicanus may you well descry</a>
<a id='line_4123'>A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:</a>
<a id='line_4124'>In reverend Cerimon there well appears</a>
<a id='line_4125'>The worth that learned charity aye wears:</a>
<a id='line_4126'>For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame</a>
<a id='line_4127'>Had spread their cursed deed, the honour’d name</a>
<a id='line_4128'>Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,</a>
<a id='line_4129'>That him and his they in his palace burn.</a>
<a id='line_4130'>The gods for murder seemed so content</a>
<a id='line_4131'>To punish, although not done, but meant.</a>
<a id='line_4132'>So on your patience evermore attending,</a>
<a id='line_4133'>New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.</a>
