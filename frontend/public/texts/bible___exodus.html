                    <a id='line_0'>The Second Book of Moses:  Called Exodus</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came</a>
<a id='line_4'>into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.</a>
<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'>1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, and</a>
<a id='line_7'>Benjamin, 1:4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>1:5 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy</a>
<a id='line_10'>souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.</a>
<a id='line_11'></a>
<a id='line_12'>1:6 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.</a>
<a id='line_13'></a>
<a id='line_14'>1:7 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased</a>
<a id='line_15'>abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land</a>
<a id='line_16'>was filled with them.</a>
<a id='line_17'></a>
<a id='line_18'>1:8 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.</a>
<a id='line_19'></a>
<a id='line_20'>1:9 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of</a>
<a id='line_21'>Israel are more and mightier than we: 1:10 Come on, let us deal wisely</a>
<a id='line_22'>with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there</a>
<a id='line_23'>falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight</a>
<a id='line_24'>against us, and so get them up out of the land.</a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'>1:11 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with</a>
<a id='line_27'>their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and</a>
<a id='line_28'>Raamses.</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and</a>
<a id='line_31'>grew.</a>
<a id='line_32'></a>
<a id='line_33'>And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_34'></a>
<a id='line_35'>1:13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with</a>
<a id='line_36'>rigour: 1:14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in</a>
<a id='line_37'>morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all</a>
<a id='line_38'>their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.</a>
<a id='line_39'></a>
<a id='line_40'>1:15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the</a>
<a id='line_41'>name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 1:16 And</a>
<a id='line_42'>he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and</a>
<a id='line_43'>see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but</a>
<a id='line_44'>if it be a daughter, then she shall live.</a>
<a id='line_45'></a>
<a id='line_46'>1:17 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt</a>
<a id='line_47'>commanded them, but saved the men children alive.</a>
<a id='line_48'></a>
<a id='line_49'>1:18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_50'>them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children</a>
<a id='line_51'>alive?  1:19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew</a>
<a id='line_52'>women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are</a>
<a id='line_53'>delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.</a>
<a id='line_54'></a>
<a id='line_55'>1:20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people</a>
<a id='line_56'>multiplied, and waxed very mighty.</a>
<a id='line_57'></a>
<a id='line_58'>1:21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he</a>
<a id='line_59'>made them houses.</a>
<a id='line_60'></a>
<a id='line_61'>1:22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is</a>
<a id='line_62'>born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save</a>
<a id='line_63'>alive.</a>
<a id='line_64'></a>
<a id='line_65'>2:1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a</a>
<a id='line_66'>daughter of Levi.</a>
<a id='line_67'></a>
<a id='line_68'>2:2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that</a>
<a id='line_69'>he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.</a>
<a id='line_70'></a>
<a id='line_71'>2:3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of</a>
<a id='line_72'>bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child</a>
<a id='line_73'>therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river’s brink.</a>
<a id='line_74'></a>
<a id='line_75'>2:4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.</a>
<a id='line_76'></a>
<a id='line_77'>2:5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the</a>
<a id='line_78'>river; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when she</a>
<a id='line_79'>saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.</a>
<a id='line_80'></a>
<a id='line_81'>2:6 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the</a>
<a id='line_82'>babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the</a>
<a id='line_83'>Hebrews’ children.</a>
<a id='line_84'></a>
<a id='line_85'>2:7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to</a>
<a id='line_86'>thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for</a>
<a id='line_87'>thee?  2:8 And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went</a>
<a id='line_88'>and called the child’s mother.</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>2:9 And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and</a>
<a id='line_91'>nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took</a>
<a id='line_92'>the child, and nursed it.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>2:10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter,</a>
<a id='line_95'>and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said,</a>
<a id='line_96'>Because I drew him out of the water.</a>
<a id='line_97'></a>
<a id='line_98'>2:11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he</a>
<a id='line_99'>went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied</a>
<a id='line_100'>an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>2:12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there</a>
<a id='line_103'>was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</a>
<a id='line_104'></a>
<a id='line_105'>2:13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the</a>
<a id='line_106'>Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong,</a>
<a id='line_107'>Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  2:14 And he said, Who made thee a</a>
<a id='line_108'>prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou</a>
<a id='line_109'>killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing</a>
<a id='line_110'>is known.</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'>2:15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But</a>
<a id='line_113'>Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:</a>
<a id='line_114'>and he sat down by a well.</a>
<a id='line_115'></a>
<a id='line_116'>2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and</a>
<a id='line_117'>drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.</a>
<a id='line_118'></a>
<a id='line_119'>2:17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up</a>
<a id='line_120'>and helped them, and watered their flock.</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>2:18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that</a>
<a id='line_123'>ye are come so soon to day?  2:19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered</a>
<a id='line_124'>us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for</a>
<a id='line_125'>us, and watered the flock.</a>
<a id='line_126'></a>
<a id='line_127'>2:20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that</a>
<a id='line_128'>ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.</a>
<a id='line_129'></a>
<a id='line_130'>2:21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses</a>
<a id='line_131'>Zipporah his daughter.</a>
<a id='line_132'></a>
<a id='line_133'>2:22 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he</a>
<a id='line_134'>said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>2:23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt</a>
<a id='line_137'>died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and</a>
<a id='line_138'>they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</a>
<a id='line_139'></a>
<a id='line_140'>2:24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant</a>
<a id='line_141'>with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</a>
<a id='line_142'></a>
<a id='line_143'>2:25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect</a>
<a id='line_144'>unto them.</a>
<a id='line_145'></a>
<a id='line_146'>3:1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest</a>
<a id='line_147'>of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and</a>
<a id='line_148'>came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.</a>
<a id='line_149'></a>
<a id='line_150'>3:2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out</a>
<a id='line_151'>of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned</a>
<a id='line_152'>with fire, and the bush was not consumed.</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>3:3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight,</a>
<a id='line_155'>why the bush is not burnt.</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>3:4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto</a>
<a id='line_158'>him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said,</a>
<a id='line_159'>Here am I.</a>
<a id='line_160'></a>
<a id='line_161'>3:5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy</a>
<a id='line_162'>feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>3:6 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,</a>
<a id='line_165'>the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he</a>
<a id='line_166'>was afraid to look upon God.</a>
<a id='line_167'></a>
<a id='line_168'>3:7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people</a>
<a id='line_169'>which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their</a>
<a id='line_170'>taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 3:8 And I am come down to</a>
<a id='line_171'>deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up</a>
<a id='line_172'>out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing</a>
<a id='line_173'>with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the</a>
<a id='line_174'>Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and</a>
<a id='line_175'>the Jebusites.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>3:9 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come</a>
<a id='line_178'>unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians</a>
<a id='line_179'>oppress them.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>3:10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou</a>
<a id='line_182'>mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>3:11 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,</a>
<a id='line_185'>and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?</a>
<a id='line_186'>3:12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a</a>
<a id='line_187'>token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth</a>
<a id='line_188'>the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.</a>
<a id='line_189'></a>
<a id='line_190'>3:13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of</a>
<a id='line_191'>Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me</a>
<a id='line_192'>unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say</a>
<a id='line_193'>unto them?  3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said,</a>
<a id='line_194'>Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me</a>
<a id='line_195'>unto you.</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>3:15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the</a>
<a id='line_198'>children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,</a>
<a id='line_199'>the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is</a>
<a id='line_200'>my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>3:16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them,</a>
<a id='line_203'>The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of</a>
<a id='line_204'>Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen</a>
<a id='line_205'>that which is done to you in Egypt: 3:17 And I have said, I will bring</a>
<a id='line_206'>you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites,</a>
<a id='line_207'>and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the</a>
<a id='line_208'>Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.</a>
<a id='line_209'></a>
<a id='line_210'>3:18 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou</a>
<a id='line_211'>and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say</a>
<a id='line_212'>unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us</a>
<a id='line_213'>go, we beseech thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we</a>
<a id='line_214'>may sacrifice to the LORD our God.</a>
<a id='line_215'></a>
<a id='line_216'>3:19 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not</a>
<a id='line_217'>by a mighty hand.</a>
<a id='line_218'></a>
<a id='line_219'>3:20 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my</a>
<a id='line_220'>wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will</a>
<a id='line_221'>let you go.</a>
<a id='line_222'></a>
<a id='line_223'>3:21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:</a>
<a id='line_224'>and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.</a>
<a id='line_225'></a>
<a id='line_226'>3:22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that</a>
<a id='line_227'>sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and</a>
<a id='line_228'>raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your</a>
<a id='line_229'>daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>4:1 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe</a>
<a id='line_232'>me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not</a>
<a id='line_233'>appeared unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_234'></a>
<a id='line_235'>4:2 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he</a>
<a id='line_236'>said, A rod.</a>
<a id='line_237'></a>
<a id='line_238'>4:3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground,</a>
<a id='line_239'>and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.</a>
<a id='line_240'></a>
<a id='line_241'>4:4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by</a>
<a id='line_242'>the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a</a>
<a id='line_243'>rod in his hand: 4:5 That they may believe that the LORD God of their</a>
<a id='line_244'>fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,</a>
<a id='line_245'>hath appeared unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'>4:6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into</a>
<a id='line_248'>thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it</a>
<a id='line_249'>out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.</a>
<a id='line_250'></a>
<a id='line_251'>4:7 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his</a>
<a id='line_252'>hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and,</a>
<a id='line_253'>behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.</a>
<a id='line_254'></a>
<a id='line_255'>4:8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither</a>
<a id='line_256'>hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the</a>
<a id='line_257'>voice of the latter sign.</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>4:9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two</a>
<a id='line_260'>signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the</a>
<a id='line_261'>water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which</a>
<a id='line_262'>thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>4:10 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,</a>
<a id='line_265'>neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I</a>
<a id='line_266'>am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>4:11 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man’s mouth? or who</a>
<a id='line_269'>maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the</a>
<a id='line_270'>LORD?  4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach</a>
<a id='line_271'>thee what thou shalt say.</a>
<a id='line_272'></a>
<a id='line_273'>4:13 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him</a>
<a id='line_274'>whom thou wilt send.</a>
<a id='line_275'></a>
<a id='line_276'>4:14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said,</a>
<a id='line_277'>Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well.</a>
<a id='line_278'>And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth</a>
<a id='line_279'>thee, he will be glad in his heart.</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>4:15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I</a>
<a id='line_282'>will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye</a>
<a id='line_283'>shall do.</a>
<a id='line_284'></a>
<a id='line_285'>4:16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be,</a>
<a id='line_286'>even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him</a>
<a id='line_287'>instead of God.</a>
<a id='line_288'></a>
<a id='line_289'>4:17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_290'>do signs.</a>
<a id='line_291'></a>
<a id='line_292'>4:18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said</a>
<a id='line_293'>unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which</a>
<a id='line_294'>are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to</a>
<a id='line_295'>Moses, Go in peace.</a>
<a id='line_296'></a>
<a id='line_297'>4:19 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt:</a>
<a id='line_298'>for all the men are dead which sought thy life.</a>
<a id='line_299'></a>
<a id='line_300'>4:20 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass,</a>
<a id='line_301'>and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in</a>
<a id='line_302'>his hand.</a>
<a id='line_303'></a>
<a id='line_304'>4:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into</a>
<a id='line_305'>Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have</a>
<a id='line_306'>put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let</a>
<a id='line_307'>the people go.</a>
<a id='line_308'></a>
<a id='line_309'>4:22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is</a>
<a id='line_310'>my son, even my firstborn: 4:23 And I say unto thee, Let my son go,</a>
<a id='line_311'>that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will</a>
<a id='line_312'>slay thy son, even thy firstborn.</a>
<a id='line_313'></a>
<a id='line_314'>4:24 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him,</a>
<a id='line_315'>and sought to kill him.</a>
<a id='line_316'></a>
<a id='line_317'>4:25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her</a>
<a id='line_318'>son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art</a>
<a id='line_319'>thou to me.</a>
<a id='line_320'></a>
<a id='line_321'>4:26 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art,</a>
<a id='line_322'>because of the circumcision.</a>
<a id='line_323'></a>
<a id='line_324'>4:27 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.</a>
<a id='line_325'>And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.</a>
<a id='line_326'></a>
<a id='line_327'>4:28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him,</a>
<a id='line_328'>and all the signs which he had commanded him.</a>
<a id='line_329'></a>
<a id='line_330'>4:29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of</a>
<a id='line_331'>the children of Israel: 4:30 And Aaron spake all the words which the</a>
<a id='line_332'>LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the</a>
<a id='line_333'>people.</a>
<a id='line_334'></a>
<a id='line_335'>4:31 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had</a>
<a id='line_336'>visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their</a>
<a id='line_337'>affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.</a>
<a id='line_338'></a>
<a id='line_339'>5:1 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus</a>
<a id='line_340'>saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a</a>
<a id='line_341'>feast unto me in the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_342'></a>
<a id='line_343'>5:2 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to</a>
<a id='line_344'>let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.</a>
<a id='line_345'></a>
<a id='line_346'>5:3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go,</a>
<a id='line_347'>we pray thee, three days’ journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto</a>
<a id='line_348'>the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the</a>
<a id='line_349'>sword.</a>
<a id='line_350'></a>
<a id='line_351'>5:4 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and</a>
<a id='line_352'>Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.</a>
<a id='line_353'></a>
<a id='line_354'>5:5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and</a>
<a id='line_355'>ye make them rest from their burdens.</a>
<a id='line_356'></a>
<a id='line_357'>5:6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people,</a>
<a id='line_358'>and their officers, saying, 5:7 Ye shall no more give the people straw</a>
<a id='line_359'>to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for</a>
<a id='line_360'>themselves.</a>
<a id='line_361'></a>
<a id='line_362'>5:8 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye</a>
<a id='line_363'>shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be</a>
<a id='line_364'>idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.</a>
<a id='line_365'></a>
<a id='line_366'>5:9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour</a>
<a id='line_367'>therein; and let them not regard vain words.</a>
<a id='line_368'></a>
<a id='line_369'>5:10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers,</a>
<a id='line_370'>and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not</a>
<a id='line_371'>give you straw.</a>
<a id='line_372'></a>
<a id='line_373'>5:11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your</a>
<a id='line_374'>work shall be diminished.</a>
<a id='line_375'></a>
<a id='line_376'>5:12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of</a>
<a id='line_377'>Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.</a>
<a id='line_378'></a>
<a id='line_379'>5:13 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your</a>
<a id='line_380'>daily tasks, as when there was straw.</a>
<a id='line_381'></a>
<a id='line_382'>5:14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh’s</a>
<a id='line_383'>taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore</a>
<a id='line_384'>have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to</a>
<a id='line_385'>day, as heretofore?  5:15 Then the officers of the children of Israel</a>
<a id='line_386'>came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with</a>
<a id='line_387'>thy servants?  5:16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and</a>
<a id='line_388'>they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but</a>
<a id='line_389'>the fault is in thine own people.</a>
<a id='line_390'></a>
<a id='line_391'>5:17 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us</a>
<a id='line_392'>go and do sacrifice to the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_393'></a>
<a id='line_394'>5:18 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given</a>
<a id='line_395'>you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.</a>
<a id='line_396'></a>
<a id='line_397'>5:19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were</a>
<a id='line_398'>in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your</a>
<a id='line_399'>bricks of your daily task.</a>
<a id='line_400'></a>
<a id='line_401'>5:20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came</a>
<a id='line_402'>forth from Pharaoh: 5:21 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon</a>
<a id='line_403'>you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the</a>
<a id='line_404'>eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in</a>
<a id='line_405'>their hand to slay us.</a>
<a id='line_406'></a>
<a id='line_407'>5:22 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast</a>
<a id='line_408'>thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?</a>
<a id='line_409'>5:23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done</a>
<a id='line_410'>evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.</a>
<a id='line_411'></a>
<a id='line_412'>6:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do</a>
<a id='line_413'>to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a</a>
<a id='line_414'>strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.</a>
<a id='line_415'></a>
<a id='line_416'>6:2 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD: 6:3</a>
<a id='line_417'>And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name</a>
<a id='line_418'>of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.</a>
<a id='line_419'></a>
<a id='line_420'>6:4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them</a>
<a id='line_421'>the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were</a>
<a id='line_422'>strangers.</a>
<a id='line_423'></a>
<a id='line_424'>6:5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom</a>
<a id='line_425'>the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.</a>
<a id='line_426'></a>
<a id='line_427'>6:6 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I</a>
<a id='line_428'>will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will</a>
<a id='line_429'>rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched</a>
<a id='line_430'>out arm, and with great judgments: 6:7 And I will take you to me for a</a>
<a id='line_431'>people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the</a>
<a id='line_432'>LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the</a>
<a id='line_433'>Egyptians.</a>
<a id='line_434'></a>
<a id='line_435'>6:8 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did</a>
<a id='line_436'>swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give</a>
<a id='line_437'>it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_438'></a>
<a id='line_439'>6:9 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened</a>
<a id='line_440'>not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.</a>
<a id='line_441'></a>
<a id='line_442'>6:10 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:11 Go in, speak unto</a>
<a id='line_443'>Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of</a>
<a id='line_444'>his land.</a>
<a id='line_445'></a>
<a id='line_446'>6:12 And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of</a>
<a id='line_447'>Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who</a>
<a id='line_448'>am of uncircumcised lips?  6:13 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto</a>
<a id='line_449'>Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto</a>
<a id='line_450'>Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land</a>
<a id='line_451'>of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_452'></a>
<a id='line_453'>6:14 These be the heads of their fathers’ houses: The sons of Reuben</a>

<a id='line_456'></a>
<a id='line_457'>6:15 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,</a>
<a id='line_458'>and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the</a>
<a id='line_459'>families of Simeon.</a>
<a id='line_460'></a>
<a id='line_461'>6:16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their</a>
<a id='line_462'>generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the</a>
<a id='line_463'>life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.</a>
<a id='line_464'></a>
<a id='line_465'>6:17 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their</a>
<a id='line_466'>families.</a>
<a id='line_467'></a>
<a id='line_468'>6:18 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel:</a>
<a id='line_469'>and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three</a>

<a id='line_471'></a>
<a id='line_472'>6:19 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families</a>
<a id='line_473'>of Levi according to their generations.</a>
<a id='line_474'></a>
<a id='line_475'>6:20 And Amram took him Jochebed his father’s sister to wife; and she</a>
<a id='line_476'>bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an</a>
<a id='line_477'>hundred and thirty and seven years.</a>
<a id='line_478'></a>
<a id='line_479'>6:21 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.</a>

<a id='line_482'></a>
<a id='line_483'>6:23 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of</a>

<a id='line_493'></a>
<a id='line_494'>6:26 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out</a>

<a id='line_496'>armies.</a>
<a id='line_497'></a>
<a id='line_498'>6:27 These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out</a>
<a id='line_499'>the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.</a>
<a id='line_500'></a>
<a id='line_501'>6:28 And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in</a>
<a id='line_502'>the land of Egypt, 6:29 That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am</a>
<a id='line_503'>the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto</a>
<a id='line_504'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_505'></a>
<a id='line_506'>6:30 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised</a>
<a id='line_507'>lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?  7:1 And the LORD said</a>
<a id='line_508'>unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy</a>
<a id='line_509'>brother shall be thy prophet.</a>
<a id='line_510'></a>
<a id='line_511'>7:2 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother</a>
<a id='line_512'>shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of</a>
<a id='line_513'>his land.</a>
<a id='line_514'></a>
<a id='line_515'>7:3 And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my</a>
<a id='line_516'>wonders in the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_517'></a>
<a id='line_518'>7:4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand</a>
<a id='line_519'>upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of</a>
<a id='line_520'>Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.</a>
<a id='line_521'></a>
<a id='line_522'>7:5 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch</a>
<a id='line_523'>forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from</a>
<a id='line_524'>among them.</a>
<a id='line_525'></a>
<a id='line_526'>7:6 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.</a>
<a id='line_527'></a>
<a id='line_528'>7:7 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three</a>
<a id='line_529'>years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.</a>
<a id='line_530'></a>
<a id='line_531'>7:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 7:9 When</a>
<a id='line_532'>Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then</a>
<a id='line_533'>thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh,</a>
<a id='line_534'>and it shall become a serpent.</a>
<a id='line_535'></a>
<a id='line_536'>7:10 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the</a>
<a id='line_537'>LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and</a>
<a id='line_538'>before his servants, and it became a serpent.</a>
<a id='line_539'></a>
<a id='line_540'>7:11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the</a>
<a id='line_541'>magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their</a>
<a id='line_542'>enchantments.</a>
<a id='line_543'></a>
<a id='line_544'>7:12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents:</a>
<a id='line_545'>but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods.</a>
<a id='line_546'></a>
<a id='line_547'>7:13 And he hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he hearkened not unto them;</a>
<a id='line_548'>as the LORD had said.</a>
<a id='line_549'></a>
<a id='line_550'>7:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh’s heart is hardened, he</a>
<a id='line_551'>refuseth to let the people go.</a>
<a id='line_552'></a>
<a id='line_553'>7:15 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the</a>
<a id='line_554'>water; and thou shalt stand by the river’s brink against he come; and</a>
<a id='line_555'>the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_556'></a>
<a id='line_557'>7:16 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath</a>
<a id='line_558'>sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in</a>
<a id='line_559'>the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.</a>
<a id='line_560'></a>
<a id='line_561'>7:17 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD:</a>
<a id='line_562'>behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters</a>
<a id='line_563'>which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.</a>
<a id='line_564'></a>
<a id='line_565'>7:18 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall</a>
<a id='line_566'>stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the</a>
<a id='line_567'>river.</a>
<a id='line_568'></a>
<a id='line_569'>7:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and</a>
<a id='line_570'>stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams,</a>
<a id='line_571'>upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of</a>
<a id='line_572'>water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood</a>
<a id='line_573'>throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in</a>
<a id='line_574'>vessels of stone.</a>
<a id='line_575'></a>
<a id='line_576'>7:20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted</a>
<a id='line_577'>up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight</a>
<a id='line_578'>of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that</a>
<a id='line_579'>were in the river were turned to blood.</a>
<a id='line_580'></a>
<a id='line_581'>7:21 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and</a>
<a id='line_582'>the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was</a>
<a id='line_583'>blood throughout all the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_584'></a>
<a id='line_585'>7:22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and</a>
<a id='line_586'>Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the</a>
<a id='line_587'>LORD had said.</a>
<a id='line_588'></a>
<a id='line_589'>7:23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set</a>
<a id='line_590'>his heart to this also.</a>
<a id='line_591'></a>
<a id='line_592'>7:24 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to</a>
<a id='line_593'>drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.</a>
<a id='line_594'></a>
<a id='line_595'>7:25 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten</a>
<a id='line_596'>the river.</a>
<a id='line_597'></a>
<a id='line_598'>8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,</a>
<a id='line_599'>Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</a>
<a id='line_600'></a>
<a id='line_601'>8:2 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy</a>
<a id='line_602'>borders with frogs: 8:3 And the river shall bring forth frogs</a>
<a id='line_603'>abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy</a>
<a id='line_604'>bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and</a>
<a id='line_605'>upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:</a>
<a id='line_606'>8:4 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and</a>
<a id='line_607'>upon all thy servants.</a>
<a id='line_608'></a>
<a id='line_609'>8:5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine</a>
<a id='line_610'>hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the</a>
<a id='line_611'>ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_612'></a>
<a id='line_613'>8:6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the</a>
<a id='line_614'>frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_615'></a>
<a id='line_616'>8:7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up</a>
<a id='line_617'>frogs upon the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_618'></a>
<a id='line_619'>8:8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the</a>
<a id='line_620'>LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and</a>
<a id='line_621'>I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_622'></a>
<a id='line_623'>8:9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat</a>
<a id='line_624'>for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the</a>
<a id='line_625'>frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river</a>
<a id='line_626'>only?  8:10 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to</a>
<a id='line_627'>thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD</a>
<a id='line_628'>our God.</a>
<a id='line_629'></a>
<a id='line_630'>8:11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and</a>
<a id='line_631'>from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river</a>
<a id='line_632'>only.</a>
<a id='line_633'></a>
<a id='line_634'>8:12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto</a>
<a id='line_635'>the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.</a>
<a id='line_636'></a>
<a id='line_637'>8:13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs</a>
<a id='line_638'>died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.</a>
<a id='line_639'></a>
<a id='line_640'>8:14 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.</a>
<a id='line_641'></a>
<a id='line_642'>8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his</a>
<a id='line_643'>heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</a>
<a id='line_644'></a>
<a id='line_645'>8:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy</a>
<a id='line_646'>rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice</a>
<a id='line_647'>throughout all the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_648'></a>
<a id='line_649'>8:17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod,</a>
<a id='line_650'>and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in</a>
<a id='line_651'>beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of</a>
<a id='line_652'>Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_653'></a>
<a id='line_654'>8:18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth</a>
<a id='line_655'>lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.</a>
<a id='line_656'></a>
<a id='line_657'>8:19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God:</a>
<a id='line_658'>and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as</a>
<a id='line_659'>the LORD had said.</a>
<a id='line_660'></a>
<a id='line_661'>8:20 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and</a>
<a id='line_662'>stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto</a>
<a id='line_663'>him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</a>
<a id='line_664'></a>
<a id='line_665'>8:21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send</a>
<a id='line_666'>swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people,</a>
<a id='line_667'>and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of</a>
<a id='line_668'>swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.</a>
<a id='line_669'></a>
<a id='line_670'>8:22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my</a>
<a id='line_671'>people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou</a>
<a id='line_672'>mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_673'></a>
<a id='line_674'>8:23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to</a>
<a id='line_675'>morrow shall this sign be.</a>
<a id='line_676'></a>
<a id='line_677'>8:24 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies</a>
<a id='line_678'>into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants’ houses, and into all</a>
<a id='line_679'>the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of</a>
<a id='line_680'>flies.</a>
<a id='line_681'></a>
<a id='line_682'>8:25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,</a>
<a id='line_683'>sacrifice to your God in the land.</a>
<a id='line_684'></a>
<a id='line_685'>8:26 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice</a>
<a id='line_686'>the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we</a>
<a id='line_687'>sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will</a>
<a id='line_688'>they not stone us?  8:27 We will go three days’ journey into the</a>
<a id='line_689'>wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.</a>
<a id='line_690'></a>
<a id='line_691'>8:28 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the</a>
<a id='line_692'>LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away:</a>
<a id='line_693'>intreat for me.</a>
<a id='line_694'></a>
<a id='line_695'>8:29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat</a>
<a id='line_696'>the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his</a>
<a id='line_697'>servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal</a>
<a id='line_698'>deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the</a>
<a id='line_699'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_700'></a>
<a id='line_701'>8:30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_702'></a>
<a id='line_703'>8:31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed</a>
<a id='line_704'>the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his</a>
<a id='line_705'>people; there remained not one.</a>
<a id='line_706'></a>
<a id='line_707'>8:32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would</a>
<a id='line_708'>he let the people go.</a>
<a id='line_709'></a>
<a id='line_710'>9:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,</a>
<a id='line_711'>Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they</a>
<a id='line_712'>may serve me.</a>
<a id='line_713'></a>
<a id='line_714'>9:2 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 9:3</a>
<a id='line_715'>Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field,</a>
<a id='line_716'>upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and</a>
<a id='line_717'>upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.</a>
<a id='line_718'></a>
<a id='line_719'>9:4 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the</a>
<a id='line_720'>cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the</a>
<a id='line_721'>children’s of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_722'></a>
<a id='line_723'>9:5 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD</a>
<a id='line_724'>shall do this thing in the land.</a>
<a id='line_725'></a>
<a id='line_726'>9:6 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of</a>
<a id='line_727'>Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.</a>
<a id='line_728'></a>
<a id='line_729'>9:7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of</a>
<a id='line_730'>the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did</a>
<a id='line_731'>not let the people go.</a>
<a id='line_732'></a>
<a id='line_733'>9:8 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls</a>
<a id='line_734'>of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven</a>
<a id='line_735'>in the sight of Pharaoh.</a>
<a id='line_736'></a>
<a id='line_737'>9:9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall</a>
<a id='line_738'>be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast,</a>
<a id='line_739'>throughout all the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_740'></a>
<a id='line_741'>9:10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and</a>
<a id='line_742'>Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking</a>
<a id='line_743'>forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.</a>
<a id='line_744'></a>
<a id='line_745'>9:11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the</a>
<a id='line_746'>boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the</a>
<a id='line_747'>Egyptians.</a>
<a id='line_748'></a>
<a id='line_749'>9:12 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not</a>
<a id='line_750'>unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.</a>
<a id='line_751'></a>
<a id='line_752'>9:13 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and</a>
<a id='line_753'>stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the</a>
<a id='line_754'>Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</a>
<a id='line_755'></a>
<a id='line_756'>9:14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and</a>
<a id='line_757'>upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that</a>
<a id='line_758'>there is none like me in all the earth.</a>
<a id='line_759'></a>
<a id='line_760'>9:15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy</a>
<a id='line_761'>people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.</a>
<a id='line_762'></a>
<a id='line_763'>9:16 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to</a>
<a id='line_764'>shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all</a>
<a id='line_765'>the earth.</a>
<a id='line_766'></a>
<a id='line_767'>9:17 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt</a>
<a id='line_768'>not let them go?  9:18 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause</a>
<a id='line_769'>it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since</a>
<a id='line_770'>the foundation thereof even until now.</a>
<a id='line_771'></a>
<a id='line_772'>9:19 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast</a>
<a id='line_773'>in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the</a>
<a id='line_774'>field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon</a>
<a id='line_775'>them, and they shall die.</a>
<a id='line_776'></a>
<a id='line_777'>9:20 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh</a>
<a id='line_778'>made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 9:21 And he</a>
<a id='line_779'>that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his</a>
<a id='line_780'>cattle in the field.</a>
<a id='line_781'></a>
<a id='line_782'>9:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward</a>
<a id='line_783'>heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and</a>
<a id='line_784'>upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of</a>
<a id='line_785'>Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_786'></a>
<a id='line_787'>9:23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD</a>
<a id='line_788'>sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the</a>
<a id='line_789'>LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_790'></a>
<a id='line_791'>9:24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,</a>
<a id='line_792'>such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it</a>
<a id='line_793'>became a nation.</a>
<a id='line_794'></a>
<a id='line_795'>9:25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was</a>
<a id='line_796'>in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the</a>
<a id='line_797'>field, and brake every tree of the field.</a>
<a id='line_798'></a>
<a id='line_799'>9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,</a>
<a id='line_800'>was there no hail.</a>
<a id='line_801'></a>
<a id='line_802'>9:27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_803'>them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my</a>
<a id='line_804'>people are wicked.</a>
<a id='line_805'></a>
<a id='line_806'>9:28 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty</a>
<a id='line_807'>thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no</a>
<a id='line_808'>longer.</a>
<a id='line_809'></a>
<a id='line_810'>9:29 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I</a>
<a id='line_811'>will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall</a>
<a id='line_812'>cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how</a>
<a id='line_813'>that the earth is the LORD’s.</a>
<a id='line_814'></a>
<a id='line_815'>9:30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet</a>
<a id='line_816'>fear the LORD God.</a>
<a id='line_817'></a>
<a id='line_818'>9:31 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in</a>
<a id='line_819'>the ear, and the flax was bolled.</a>
<a id='line_820'></a>
<a id='line_821'>9:32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not</a>
<a id='line_822'>grown up.</a>
<a id='line_823'></a>
<a id='line_824'>9:33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad</a>
<a id='line_825'>his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the</a>
<a id='line_826'>rain was not poured upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_827'></a>
<a id='line_828'>9:34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders</a>
<a id='line_829'>were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his</a>
<a id='line_830'>servants.</a>
<a id='line_831'></a>
<a id='line_832'>9:35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the</a>
<a id='line_833'>children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.</a>
<a id='line_834'></a>
<a id='line_835'>10:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have</a>
<a id='line_836'>hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew</a>
<a id='line_837'>these my signs before him: 10:2 And that thou mayest tell in the ears</a>
<a id='line_838'>of thy son, and of thy son’s son, what things I have wrought in Egypt,</a>
<a id='line_839'>and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I</a>
<a id='line_840'>am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_841'></a>
<a id='line_842'>10:3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus</a>
<a id='line_843'>saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble</a>
<a id='line_844'>thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.</a>
<a id='line_845'></a>
<a id='line_846'>10:4 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will</a>
<a id='line_847'>I bring the locusts into thy coast: 10:5 And they shall cover the face</a>
<a id='line_848'>of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall</a>
<a id='line_849'>eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you</a>
<a id='line_850'>from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of</a>
<a id='line_851'>the field: 10:6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all</a>
<a id='line_852'>thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy</a>
<a id='line_853'>fathers, nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they</a>
<a id='line_854'>were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out</a>
<a id='line_855'>from Pharaoh.</a>
<a id='line_856'></a>
<a id='line_857'>10:7 And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be</a>
<a id='line_858'>a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their</a>
<a id='line_859'>God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?  10:8 And Moses and</a>
<a id='line_860'>Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go,</a>
<a id='line_861'>serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?  10:9 And</a>
<a id='line_862'>Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons</a>
<a id='line_863'>and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go;</a>
<a id='line_864'>for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_865'></a>
<a id='line_866'>10:10 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will</a>
<a id='line_867'>let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.</a>
<a id='line_868'></a>
<a id='line_869'>10:11 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye</a>
<a id='line_870'>did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.</a>
<a id='line_871'></a>
<a id='line_872'>10:12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the</a>
<a id='line_873'>land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of</a>
<a id='line_874'>Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath</a>
<a id='line_875'>left.</a>
<a id='line_876'></a>
<a id='line_877'>10:13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and</a>
<a id='line_878'>the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that</a>
<a id='line_879'>night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.</a>
<a id='line_880'></a>
<a id='line_881'>10:14 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in</a>
<a id='line_882'>all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there</a>
<a id='line_883'>were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.</a>
<a id='line_884'></a>
<a id='line_885'>10:15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land</a>
<a id='line_886'>was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the</a>
<a id='line_887'>fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any</a>
<a id='line_888'>green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all</a>
<a id='line_889'>the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_890'></a>
<a id='line_891'>10:16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I</a>
<a id='line_892'>have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.</a>
<a id='line_893'></a>
<a id='line_894'>10:17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and</a>
<a id='line_895'>intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death</a>
<a id='line_896'>only.</a>
<a id='line_897'></a>
<a id='line_898'>10:18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_899'></a>
<a id='line_900'>10:19 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away</a>
<a id='line_901'>the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one</a>
<a id='line_902'>locust in all the coasts of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_903'></a>
<a id='line_904'>10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let</a>
<a id='line_905'>the children of Israel go.</a>
<a id='line_906'></a>
<a id='line_907'>10:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward</a>
<a id='line_908'>heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even</a>
<a id='line_909'>darkness which may be felt.</a>
<a id='line_910'></a>
<a id='line_911'>10:22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was</a>
<a id='line_912'>a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: 10:23 They saw</a>
<a id='line_913'>not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but</a>
<a id='line_914'>all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.</a>
<a id='line_915'></a>
<a id='line_916'>10:24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD;</a>
<a id='line_917'>only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones</a>
<a id='line_918'>also go with you.</a>
<a id='line_919'></a>
<a id='line_920'>10:25 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt</a>
<a id='line_921'>offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.</a>
<a id='line_922'></a>
<a id='line_923'>10:26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be</a>
<a id='line_924'>left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and</a>
<a id='line_925'>we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.</a>
<a id='line_926'></a>
<a id='line_927'>10:27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them</a>
<a id='line_928'>go.</a>
<a id='line_929'></a>
<a id='line_930'>10:28 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to</a>
<a id='line_931'>thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou</a>
<a id='line_932'>shalt die.</a>
<a id='line_933'></a>
<a id='line_934'>10:29 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again</a>
<a id='line_935'>no more.</a>
<a id='line_936'></a>
<a id='line_937'>11:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more</a>
<a id='line_938'>upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence:</a>
<a id='line_939'>when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence</a>
<a id='line_940'>altogether.</a>
<a id='line_941'></a>
<a id='line_942'>11:2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of</a>
<a id='line_943'>his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and</a>
<a id='line_944'>jewels of gold.</a>
<a id='line_945'></a>
<a id='line_946'>11:3 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the</a>
<a id='line_947'>Egyptians.</a>
<a id='line_948'></a>
<a id='line_949'>Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the</a>
<a id='line_950'>sight of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the sight of the people.</a>
<a id='line_951'></a>
<a id='line_952'>11:4 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out</a>
<a id='line_953'>into the midst of Egypt: 11:5 And all the firstborn in the land of</a>
<a id='line_954'>Egypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his</a>
<a id='line_955'>throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the</a>
<a id='line_956'>mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.</a>
<a id='line_957'></a>
<a id='line_958'>11:6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,</a>
<a id='line_959'>such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.</a>
<a id='line_960'></a>
<a id='line_961'>11:7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move</a>
<a id='line_962'>his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD</a>
<a id='line_963'>doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.</a>
<a id='line_964'></a>
<a id='line_965'>11:8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down</a>
<a id='line_966'>themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that</a>
<a id='line_967'>follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from</a>
<a id='line_968'>Pharaoh in a great anger.</a>
<a id='line_969'></a>
<a id='line_970'>11:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;</a>
<a id='line_971'>that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_972'></a>
<a id='line_973'>11:10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and</a>
<a id='line_974'>the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let the</a>
<a id='line_975'>children of Israel go out of his land.</a>
<a id='line_976'></a>
<a id='line_977'>12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt</a>
<a id='line_978'>saying, 12:2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it</a>
<a id='line_979'>shall be the first month of the year to you.</a>
<a id='line_980'></a>
<a id='line_981'>12:3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the</a>
<a id='line_982'>tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb,</a>
<a id='line_983'>according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: 12:4 And</a>
<a id='line_984'>if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour</a>
<a id='line_985'>next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls;</a>
<a id='line_986'>every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.</a>
<a id='line_987'></a>
<a id='line_988'>12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye</a>
<a id='line_989'>shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: 12:6 And ye shall</a>
<a id='line_990'>keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole</a>
<a id='line_991'>assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.</a>
<a id='line_992'></a>
<a id='line_993'>12:7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side</a>
<a id='line_994'>posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat</a>
<a id='line_995'>it.</a>
<a id='line_996'></a>
<a id='line_997'>12:8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and</a>
<a id='line_998'>unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.</a>
<a id='line_999'></a>
<a id='line_1000'>12:9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with</a>
<a id='line_1001'>fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.</a>
<a id='line_1002'></a>
<a id='line_1003'>12:10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and</a>
<a id='line_1004'>that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.</a>
<a id='line_1005'></a>
<a id='line_1006'>12:11 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on</a>
<a id='line_1007'>your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste:</a>
<a id='line_1008'>it is the LORD’s passover.</a>
<a id='line_1009'></a>
<a id='line_1010'>12:12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will</a>
<a id='line_1011'>smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and</a>
<a id='line_1012'>against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1013'></a>
<a id='line_1014'>12:13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where</a>
<a id='line_1015'>ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague</a>
<a id='line_1016'>shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1017'></a>
<a id='line_1018'>12:14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep</a>
<a id='line_1019'>it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a</a>
<a id='line_1020'>feast by an ordinance for ever.</a>
<a id='line_1021'></a>
<a id='line_1022'>12:15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye</a>
<a id='line_1023'>shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth</a>
<a id='line_1024'>leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul</a>
<a id='line_1025'>shall be cut off from Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1026'></a>
<a id='line_1027'>12:16 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in</a>
<a id='line_1028'>the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner</a>
<a id='line_1029'>of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat,</a>
<a id='line_1030'>that only may be done of you.</a>
<a id='line_1031'></a>
<a id='line_1032'>12:17 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this</a>
<a id='line_1033'>selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:</a>
<a id='line_1034'>therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an</a>
<a id='line_1035'>ordinance for ever.</a>
<a id='line_1036'></a>
<a id='line_1037'>12:18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even,</a>
<a id='line_1038'>ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the</a>
<a id='line_1039'>month at even.</a>
<a id='line_1040'></a>
<a id='line_1041'>12:19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for</a>
<a id='line_1042'>whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut</a>
<a id='line_1043'>off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born</a>
<a id='line_1044'>in the land.</a>
<a id='line_1045'></a>
<a id='line_1046'>12:20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye</a>
<a id='line_1047'>eat unleavened bread.</a>
<a id='line_1048'></a>
<a id='line_1049'>12:21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_1050'>them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and</a>
<a id='line_1051'>kill the passover.</a>
<a id='line_1052'></a>
<a id='line_1053'>12:22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood</a>
<a id='line_1054'>that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts</a>
<a id='line_1055'>with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at</a>
<a id='line_1056'>the door of his house until the morning.</a>
<a id='line_1057'></a>
<a id='line_1058'>12:23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when</a>
<a id='line_1059'>he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the</a>
<a id='line_1060'>LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to</a>
<a id='line_1061'>come in unto your houses to smite you.</a>
<a id='line_1062'></a>
<a id='line_1063'>12:24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to</a>
<a id='line_1064'>thy sons for ever.</a>
<a id='line_1065'></a>
<a id='line_1066'>12:25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the</a>
<a id='line_1067'>LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep</a>
<a id='line_1068'>this service.</a>
<a id='line_1069'></a>
<a id='line_1070'>12:26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto</a>
<a id='line_1071'>you, What mean ye by this service?  12:27 That ye shall say, It is the</a>
<a id='line_1072'>sacrifice of the LORD’s passover, who passed over the houses of the</a>
<a id='line_1073'>children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and</a>
<a id='line_1074'>delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.</a>
<a id='line_1075'></a>
<a id='line_1076'>12:28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had</a>
<a id='line_1077'>commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</a>
<a id='line_1078'></a>
<a id='line_1079'>12:29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the</a>
<a id='line_1080'>firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat</a>
<a id='line_1081'>on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the</a>
<a id='line_1082'>dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.</a>
<a id='line_1083'></a>
<a id='line_1084'>12:30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and</a>
<a id='line_1085'>all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was</a>
<a id='line_1086'>not a house where there was not one dead.</a>
<a id='line_1087'></a>
<a id='line_1088'>12:31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,</a>
<a id='line_1089'>and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of</a>
<a id='line_1090'>Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.</a>
<a id='line_1091'></a>
<a id='line_1092'>12:32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be</a>
<a id='line_1093'>gone; and bless me also.</a>
<a id='line_1094'></a>
<a id='line_1095'>12:33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might</a>
<a id='line_1096'>send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.</a>
<a id='line_1097'></a>
<a id='line_1098'>12:34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their</a>
<a id='line_1099'>kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.</a>
<a id='line_1100'></a>
<a id='line_1101'>12:35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;</a>
<a id='line_1102'>and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of</a>
<a id='line_1103'>gold, and raiment: 12:36 And the LORD gave the people favour in the</a>
<a id='line_1104'>sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as</a>
<a id='line_1105'>they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.</a>
<a id='line_1106'></a>
<a id='line_1107'>12:37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,</a>
<a id='line_1108'>about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.</a>
<a id='line_1109'></a>
<a id='line_1110'>12:38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and</a>
<a id='line_1111'>herds, even very much cattle.</a>
<a id='line_1112'></a>
<a id='line_1113'>12:39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought</a>
<a id='line_1114'>forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust</a>
<a id='line_1115'>out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for</a>
<a id='line_1116'>themselves any victual.</a>
<a id='line_1117'></a>
<a id='line_1118'>12:40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in</a>
<a id='line_1119'>Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.</a>
<a id='line_1120'></a>
<a id='line_1121'>12:41 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty</a>
<a id='line_1122'>years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of</a>
<a id='line_1123'>the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1124'></a>
<a id='line_1125'>12:42 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing</a>
<a id='line_1126'>them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be</a>
<a id='line_1127'>observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.</a>
<a id='line_1128'></a>
<a id='line_1129'>12:43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of</a>
<a id='line_1130'>the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: 12:44 But every</a>
<a id='line_1131'>man’s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised</a>
<a id='line_1132'>him, then shall he eat thereof.</a>
<a id='line_1133'></a>
<a id='line_1134'>12:45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.</a>
<a id='line_1135'></a>
<a id='line_1136'>12:46 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought</a>
<a id='line_1137'>of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone</a>
<a id='line_1138'>thereof.</a>
<a id='line_1139'></a>
<a id='line_1140'>12:47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.</a>
<a id='line_1141'></a>
<a id='line_1142'>12:48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the</a>
<a id='line_1143'>passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let</a>
<a id='line_1144'>him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the</a>
<a id='line_1145'>land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.</a>
<a id='line_1146'></a>
<a id='line_1147'>12:49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger</a>
<a id='line_1148'>that sojourneth among you.</a>
<a id='line_1149'></a>
<a id='line_1150'>12:50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses</a>
<a id='line_1151'>and Aaron, so did they.</a>
<a id='line_1152'></a>
<a id='line_1153'>12:51 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring</a>
<a id='line_1154'>the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.</a>
<a id='line_1155'></a>
<a id='line_1156'>13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Sanctify unto me all</a>
<a id='line_1157'>the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of</a>
<a id='line_1158'>Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.</a>
<a id='line_1159'></a>
<a id='line_1160'>13:3 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye</a>
<a id='line_1161'>came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of</a>
<a id='line_1162'>hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened</a>
<a id='line_1163'>bread be eaten.</a>
<a id='line_1164'></a>
<a id='line_1165'>13:4 This day came ye out in the month Abib.</a>
<a id='line_1166'></a>
<a id='line_1167'>13:5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of</a>
<a id='line_1168'>the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites,</a>
<a id='line_1169'>and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a</a>
<a id='line_1170'>land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in</a>
<a id='line_1171'>this month.</a>
<a id='line_1172'></a>
<a id='line_1173'>13:6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh</a>
<a id='line_1174'>day shall be a feast to the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1175'></a>
<a id='line_1176'>13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no</a>
<a id='line_1177'>leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen</a>
<a id='line_1178'>with thee in all thy quarters.</a>
<a id='line_1179'></a>
<a id='line_1180'>13:8 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done</a>
<a id='line_1181'>because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of</a>
<a id='line_1182'>Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1183'></a>
<a id='line_1184'>13:9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a</a>
<a id='line_1185'>memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD’s law may be in thy mouth:</a>
<a id='line_1186'>for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1187'></a>
<a id='line_1188'>13:10 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year</a>
<a id='line_1189'>to year.</a>
<a id='line_1190'></a>
<a id='line_1191'>13:11 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of</a>
<a id='line_1192'>the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall</a>
<a id='line_1193'>give it thee, 13:12 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that</a>
<a id='line_1194'>openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which</a>
<a id='line_1195'>thou hast; the males shall be the LORD’s.</a>
<a id='line_1196'></a>
<a id='line_1197'>13:13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and</a>
<a id='line_1198'>if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all</a>
<a id='line_1199'>the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.</a>
<a id='line_1200'></a>
<a id='line_1201'>13:14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,</a>
<a id='line_1202'>saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of</a>
<a id='line_1203'>hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:</a>
<a id='line_1204'>13:15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that</a>
<a id='line_1205'>the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the</a>
<a id='line_1206'>firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to</a>
<a id='line_1207'>the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the</a>
<a id='line_1208'>firstborn of my children I redeem.</a>
<a id='line_1209'></a>
<a id='line_1210'>13:16 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets</a>
<a id='line_1211'>between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth</a>
<a id='line_1212'>out of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1213'></a>
<a id='line_1214'>13:17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that</a>
<a id='line_1215'>God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines,</a>
<a id='line_1216'>although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people</a>
<a id='line_1217'>repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: 13:18 But God led</a>
<a id='line_1218'>the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea:</a>
<a id='line_1219'>and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1220'></a>
<a id='line_1221'>13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly</a>
<a id='line_1222'>sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and</a>
<a id='line_1223'>ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.</a>
<a id='line_1224'></a>
<a id='line_1225'>13:20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham,</a>
<a id='line_1226'>in the edge of the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_1227'></a>
<a id='line_1228'>13:21 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to</a>
<a id='line_1229'>lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them</a>
<a id='line_1230'>light; to go by day and night: 13:22 He took not away the pillar of</a>
<a id='line_1231'>the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the</a>
<a id='line_1232'>people.</a>
<a id='line_1233'></a>
<a id='line_1234'>14:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 14:2 Speak unto the</a>
<a id='line_1235'>children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth,</a>
<a id='line_1236'>between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall</a>
<a id='line_1237'>ye encamp by the sea.</a>
<a id='line_1238'></a>
<a id='line_1239'>14:3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are</a>
<a id='line_1240'>entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.</a>
<a id='line_1241'></a>
<a id='line_1242'>14:4 And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, that he shall follow after</a>
<a id='line_1243'>them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that</a>
<a id='line_1244'>the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.</a>
<a id='line_1245'></a>
<a id='line_1246'>14:5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the</a>
<a id='line_1247'>heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people,</a>
<a id='line_1248'>and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from</a>
<a id='line_1249'>serving us?  14:6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people</a>
<a id='line_1250'>with him: 14:7 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the</a>
<a id='line_1251'>chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.</a>
<a id='line_1252'></a>
<a id='line_1253'>14:8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he</a>
<a id='line_1254'>pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went</a>
<a id='line_1255'>out with an high hand.</a>
<a id='line_1256'></a>
<a id='line_1257'>14:9 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots</a>
<a id='line_1258'>of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them</a>
<a id='line_1259'>encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.</a>
<a id='line_1260'></a>
<a id='line_1261'>14:10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up</a>
<a id='line_1262'>their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they</a>
<a id='line_1263'>were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1264'></a>
<a id='line_1265'>14:11 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,</a>
<a id='line_1266'>hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou</a>
<a id='line_1267'>dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?  14:12 Is not this</a>
<a id='line_1268'>the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we</a>
<a id='line_1269'>may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the</a>
<a id='line_1270'>Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_1271'></a>
<a id='line_1272'>14:13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and</a>
<a id='line_1273'>see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for</a>
<a id='line_1274'>the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no</a>
<a id='line_1275'>more for ever.</a>
<a id='line_1276'></a>
<a id='line_1277'>14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.</a>
<a id='line_1278'></a>
<a id='line_1279'>14:15 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?</a>
<a id='line_1280'>speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: 14:16 But</a>
<a id='line_1281'>lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and</a>
<a id='line_1282'>divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through</a>
<a id='line_1283'>the midst of the sea.</a>
<a id='line_1284'></a>
<a id='line_1285'>14:17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and</a>
<a id='line_1286'>they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and</a>
<a id='line_1287'>upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.</a>
<a id='line_1288'></a>
<a id='line_1289'>14:18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have</a>
<a id='line_1290'>gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his</a>
<a id='line_1291'>horsemen.</a>
<a id='line_1292'></a>
<a id='line_1293'>14:19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_1294'>removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from</a>
<a id='line_1295'>before their face, and stood behind them: 14:20 And it came between</a>
<a id='line_1296'>the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud</a>
<a id='line_1297'>and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the</a>
<a id='line_1298'>one came not near the other all the night.</a>
<a id='line_1299'></a>
<a id='line_1300'>14:21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1301'>caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and</a>
<a id='line_1302'>made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.</a>
<a id='line_1303'></a>
<a id='line_1304'>14:22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon</a>
<a id='line_1305'>the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right</a>
<a id='line_1306'>hand, and on their left.</a>
<a id='line_1307'></a>
<a id='line_1308'>14:23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst</a>
<a id='line_1309'>of the sea, even all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.</a>
<a id='line_1310'></a>
<a id='line_1311'>14:24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked</a>
<a id='line_1312'>unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the</a>
<a id='line_1313'>cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 14:25 And took off</a>
<a id='line_1314'>their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the</a>
<a id='line_1315'>Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1316'>fighteth for them against the Egyptians.</a>
<a id='line_1317'></a>
<a id='line_1318'>14:26 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the</a>
<a id='line_1319'>sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their</a>
<a id='line_1320'>chariots, and upon their horsemen.</a>
<a id='line_1321'></a>
<a id='line_1322'>14:27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea</a>
<a id='line_1323'>returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians</a>
<a id='line_1324'>fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of</a>
<a id='line_1325'>the sea.</a>
<a id='line_1326'></a>
<a id='line_1327'>14:28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the</a>
<a id='line_1328'>horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after</a>
<a id='line_1329'>them; there remained not so much as one of them.</a>
<a id='line_1330'></a>
<a id='line_1331'>14:29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of</a>
<a id='line_1332'>the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and</a>
<a id='line_1333'>on their left.</a>
<a id='line_1334'></a>
<a id='line_1335'>14:30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_1336'>Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.</a>
<a id='line_1337'></a>
<a id='line_1338'>14:31 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the</a>
<a id='line_1339'>Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_1340'>his servant Moses.</a>
<a id='line_1341'></a>
<a id='line_1342'>15:1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the</a>
<a id='line_1343'>LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath</a>
<a id='line_1344'>triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the</a>
<a id='line_1345'>sea.</a>
<a id='line_1346'></a>
<a id='line_1347'>15:2 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation:</a>
<a id='line_1348'>he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father’s God,</a>
<a id='line_1349'>and I will exalt him.</a>
<a id='line_1350'></a>
<a id='line_1351'>15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.</a>
<a id='line_1352'></a>
<a id='line_1353'>15:4 Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his</a>
<a id='line_1354'>chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.</a>
<a id='line_1355'></a>
<a id='line_1356'>15:5 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a</a>
<a id='line_1357'>stone.</a>
<a id='line_1358'></a>
<a id='line_1359'>15:6 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right</a>
<a id='line_1360'>hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.</a>
<a id='line_1361'></a>
<a id='line_1362'>15:7 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown</a>
<a id='line_1363'>them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which</a>
<a id='line_1364'>consumed them as stubble.</a>
<a id='line_1365'></a>
<a id='line_1366'>15:8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered</a>
<a id='line_1367'>together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were</a>
<a id='line_1368'>congealed in the heart of the sea.</a>
<a id='line_1369'></a>
<a id='line_1370'>15:9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the</a>
<a id='line_1371'>spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my</a>
<a id='line_1372'>hand shall destroy them.</a>
<a id='line_1373'></a>
<a id='line_1374'>15:10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank</a>
<a id='line_1375'>as lead in the mighty waters.</a>
<a id='line_1376'></a>
<a id='line_1377'>15:11 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee,</a>
<a id='line_1378'>glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?  15:12 Thou</a>
<a id='line_1379'>stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.</a>
<a id='line_1380'></a>
<a id='line_1381'>15:13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast</a>
<a id='line_1382'>redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy</a>
<a id='line_1383'>habitation.</a>
<a id='line_1384'></a>
<a id='line_1385'>15:14 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on</a>
<a id='line_1386'>the inhabitants of Palestina.</a>
<a id='line_1387'></a>
<a id='line_1388'>15:15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,</a>
<a id='line_1389'>trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan</a>
<a id='line_1390'>shall melt away.</a>
<a id='line_1391'></a>
<a id='line_1392'>15:16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine</a>
<a id='line_1393'>arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O</a>
<a id='line_1394'>LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.</a>
<a id='line_1395'></a>
<a id='line_1396'>15:17 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of</a>
<a id='line_1397'>thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee</a>
<a id='line_1398'>to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have</a>
<a id='line_1399'>established.</a>
<a id='line_1400'></a>
<a id='line_1401'>15:18 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.</a>
<a id='line_1402'></a>
<a id='line_1403'>15:19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his</a>
<a id='line_1404'>horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the</a>
<a id='line_1405'>sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the</a>
<a id='line_1406'>midst of the sea.</a>
<a id='line_1407'></a>
<a id='line_1408'>15:20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel</a>
<a id='line_1409'>in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and</a>
<a id='line_1410'>with dances.</a>
<a id='line_1411'></a>
<a id='line_1412'>15:21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath</a>
<a id='line_1413'>triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the</a>
<a id='line_1414'>sea.</a>
<a id='line_1415'></a>
<a id='line_1416'>15:22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into</a>
<a id='line_1417'>the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness,</a>
<a id='line_1418'>and found no water.</a>
<a id='line_1419'></a>
<a id='line_1420'>15:23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters</a>
<a id='line_1421'>of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called</a>
<a id='line_1422'>Marah.</a>
<a id='line_1423'></a>
<a id='line_1424'>15:24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we</a>
<a id='line_1425'>drink?  15:25 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a</a>
<a id='line_1426'>tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made</a>
<a id='line_1427'>sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he</a>
<a id='line_1428'>proved them, 15:26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the</a>
<a id='line_1429'>voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his</a>
<a id='line_1430'>sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his</a>
<a id='line_1431'>statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have</a>
<a id='line_1432'>brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.</a>
<a id='line_1433'></a>
<a id='line_1434'>15:27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and</a>
<a id='line_1435'>threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.</a>
<a id='line_1436'></a>
<a id='line_1437'>16:1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation</a>
<a id='line_1438'>of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is</a>
<a id='line_1439'>between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after</a>
<a id='line_1440'>their departing out of the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1441'></a>
<a id='line_1442'>16:2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured</a>
<a id='line_1443'>against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: 16:3 And the children of</a>
<a id='line_1444'>Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_1445'>LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we</a>
<a id='line_1446'>did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this</a>
<a id='line_1447'>wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.</a>
<a id='line_1448'></a>
<a id='line_1449'>16:4 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from</a>
<a id='line_1450'>heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate</a>
<a id='line_1451'>every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or</a>
<a id='line_1452'>no.</a>
<a id='line_1453'></a>
<a id='line_1454'>16:5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall</a>
<a id='line_1455'>prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as</a>
<a id='line_1456'>they gather daily.</a>
<a id='line_1457'></a>
<a id='line_1458'>16:6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At</a>
<a id='line_1459'>even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the</a>
<a id='line_1460'>land of Egypt: 16:7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of</a>
<a id='line_1461'>the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and</a>
<a id='line_1462'>what are we, that ye murmur against us?  16:8 And Moses said, This</a>
<a id='line_1463'>shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat,</a>
<a id='line_1464'>and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your</a>
<a id='line_1465'>murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your</a>
<a id='line_1466'>murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1467'></a>
<a id='line_1468'>16:9 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the</a>
<a id='line_1469'>children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your</a>
<a id='line_1470'>murmurings.</a>
<a id='line_1471'></a>
<a id='line_1472'>16:10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation</a>
<a id='line_1473'>of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness,</a>
<a id='line_1474'>and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.</a>
<a id='line_1475'></a>
<a id='line_1476'>16:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:12 I have heard the</a>
<a id='line_1477'>murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even</a>
<a id='line_1478'>ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread;</a>
<a id='line_1479'>and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.</a>
<a id='line_1480'></a>
<a id='line_1481'>16:13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and</a>
<a id='line_1482'>covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.</a>
<a id='line_1483'></a>
<a id='line_1484'>16:14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of</a>
<a id='line_1485'>the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar</a>
<a id='line_1486'>frost on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_1487'></a>
<a id='line_1488'>16:15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to</a>
<a id='line_1489'>another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said</a>
<a id='line_1490'>unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.</a>
<a id='line_1491'></a>
<a id='line_1492'>16:16 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it</a>
<a id='line_1493'>every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to</a>
<a id='line_1494'>the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in</a>
<a id='line_1495'>his tents.</a>
<a id='line_1496'></a>
<a id='line_1497'>16:17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some</a>
<a id='line_1498'>less.</a>
<a id='line_1499'></a>
<a id='line_1500'>16:18 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much</a>
<a id='line_1501'>had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they</a>
<a id='line_1502'>gathered every man according to his eating.</a>
<a id='line_1503'></a>
<a id='line_1504'>16:19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.</a>
<a id='line_1505'></a>
<a id='line_1506'>16:20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them</a>
<a id='line_1507'>left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses</a>
<a id='line_1508'>was wroth with them.</a>
<a id='line_1509'></a>
<a id='line_1510'>16:21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his</a>
<a id='line_1511'>eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.</a>
<a id='line_1512'></a>
<a id='line_1513'>16:22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice</a>
<a id='line_1514'>as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the</a>
<a id='line_1515'>congregation came and told Moses.</a>
<a id='line_1516'></a>
<a id='line_1517'>16:23 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To</a>
<a id='line_1518'>morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which</a>
<a id='line_1519'>ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which</a>
<a id='line_1520'>remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.</a>
<a id='line_1521'></a>
<a id='line_1522'>16:24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did</a>
<a id='line_1523'>not stink, neither was there any worm therein.</a>
<a id='line_1524'></a>
<a id='line_1525'>16:25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto</a>
<a id='line_1526'>the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.</a>
<a id='line_1527'></a>
<a id='line_1528'>16:26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is</a>
<a id='line_1529'>the sabbath, in it there shall be none.</a>
<a id='line_1530'></a>
<a id='line_1531'>16:27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on</a>
<a id='line_1532'>the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.</a>
<a id='line_1533'></a>
<a id='line_1534'>16:28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my</a>
<a id='line_1535'>commandments and my laws?  16:29 See, for that the LORD hath given you</a>
<a id='line_1536'>the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two</a>
<a id='line_1537'>days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place</a>
<a id='line_1538'>on the seventh day.</a>
<a id='line_1539'></a>
<a id='line_1540'>16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.</a>
<a id='line_1541'></a>
<a id='line_1542'>16:31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it</a>
<a id='line_1543'>was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers</a>
<a id='line_1544'>made with honey.</a>
<a id='line_1545'></a>
<a id='line_1546'>16:32 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,</a>
<a id='line_1547'>Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see</a>
<a id='line_1548'>the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought</a>
<a id='line_1549'>you forth from the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1550'></a>
<a id='line_1551'>16:33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of</a>
<a id='line_1552'>manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your</a>
<a id='line_1553'>generations.</a>
<a id='line_1554'></a>
<a id='line_1555'>16:34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the</a>
<a id='line_1556'>Testimony, to be kept.</a>
<a id='line_1557'></a>
<a id='line_1558'>16:35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they</a>
<a id='line_1559'>came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the</a>
<a id='line_1560'>borders of the land of Canaan.</a>
<a id='line_1561'></a>
<a id='line_1562'>16:36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.</a>
<a id='line_1563'></a>
<a id='line_1564'>17:1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from</a>
<a id='line_1565'>the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the</a>
<a id='line_1566'>commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no</a>
<a id='line_1567'>water for the people to drink.</a>
<a id='line_1568'></a>
<a id='line_1569'>17:2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us</a>
<a id='line_1570'>water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with</a>
<a id='line_1571'>me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?  17:3 And the people thirsted</a>
<a id='line_1572'>there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said,</a>
<a id='line_1573'>Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill</a>
<a id='line_1574'>us and our children and our cattle with thirst?  17:4 And Moses cried</a>
<a id='line_1575'>unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be</a>
<a id='line_1576'>almost ready to stone me.</a>
<a id='line_1577'></a>
<a id='line_1578'>17:5 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take</a>
<a id='line_1579'>with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest</a>
<a id='line_1580'>the river, take in thine hand, and go.</a>
<a id='line_1581'></a>
<a id='line_1582'>17:6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;</a>
<a id='line_1583'>and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it,</a>
<a id='line_1584'>that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders</a>
<a id='line_1585'>of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1586'></a>
<a id='line_1587'>17:7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because</a>
<a id='line_1588'>of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the</a>
<a id='line_1589'>LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?  17:8 Then came Amalek,</a>
<a id='line_1590'>and fought with Israel in Rephidim.</a>
<a id='line_1591'></a>
<a id='line_1592'>17:9 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight</a>
<a id='line_1593'>with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the</a>
<a id='line_1594'>rod of God in mine hand.</a>
<a id='line_1595'></a>
<a id='line_1596'>17:10 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek:</a>
<a id='line_1597'>and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.</a>
<a id='line_1598'></a>
<a id='line_1599'>17:11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel</a>
<a id='line_1600'>prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</a>
<a id='line_1601'></a>
<a id='line_1602'>17:12 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it</a>
<a id='line_1603'>under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands,</a>
<a id='line_1604'>the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his</a>
<a id='line_1605'>hands were steady until the going down of the sun.</a>
<a id='line_1606'></a>
<a id='line_1607'>17:13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of</a>
<a id='line_1608'>the sword.</a>
<a id='line_1609'></a>
<a id='line_1610'>17:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a</a>
<a id='line_1611'>book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put</a>
<a id='line_1612'>out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1613'></a>
<a id='line_1614'>17:15 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it</a>
<a id='line_1615'>Jehovahnissi: 17:16 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the</a>
<a id='line_1616'>LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.</a>
<a id='line_1617'></a>
<a id='line_1618'>18:1 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father in law, heard of</a>
<a id='line_1619'>all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that</a>
<a id='line_1620'>the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; 18:2 Then Jethro, Moses’</a>
<a id='line_1621'>father in law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her back,</a>
<a id='line_1622'>18:3 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for</a>
<a id='line_1623'>he said, I have been an alien in a strange land: 18:4 And the name of</a>
<a id='line_1624'>the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine</a>
<a id='line_1625'>help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh: 18:5 And Jethro,</a>
<a id='line_1626'>Moses’ father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into</a>
<a id='line_1627'>the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: 18:6 And he</a>
<a id='line_1628'>said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy</a>
<a id='line_1629'>wife, and her two sons with her.</a>
<a id='line_1630'></a>
<a id='line_1631'>18:7 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance,</a>
<a id='line_1632'>and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they</a>
<a id='line_1633'>came into the tent.</a>
<a id='line_1634'></a>
<a id='line_1635'>18:8 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto</a>
<a id='line_1636'>Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, and all the travail</a>
<a id='line_1637'>that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.</a>
<a id='line_1638'></a>
<a id='line_1639'>18:9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done</a>
<a id='line_1640'>to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.</a>
<a id='line_1641'></a>
<a id='line_1642'>18:10 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out</a>
<a id='line_1643'>of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath</a>
<a id='line_1644'>delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.</a>
<a id='line_1645'></a>
<a id='line_1646'>18:11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the</a>
<a id='line_1647'>thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.</a>
<a id='line_1648'></a>
<a id='line_1649'>18:12 And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took a burnt offering and</a>
<a id='line_1650'>sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to</a>
<a id='line_1651'>eat bread with Moses’ father in law before God.</a>
<a id='line_1652'></a>
<a id='line_1653'>18:13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the</a>
<a id='line_1654'>people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the</a>
<a id='line_1655'>evening.</a>
<a id='line_1656'></a>
<a id='line_1657'>18:14 And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people,</a>
<a id='line_1658'>he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest</a>
<a id='line_1659'>thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto</a>
<a id='line_1660'>even?  18:15 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people</a>
<a id='line_1661'>come unto me to enquire of God: 18:16 When they have a matter, they</a>
<a id='line_1662'>come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them</a>
<a id='line_1663'>know the statutes of God, and his laws.</a>
<a id='line_1664'></a>
<a id='line_1665'>18:17 And Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that thou</a>
<a id='line_1666'>doest is not good.</a>
<a id='line_1667'></a>
<a id='line_1668'>18:18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is</a>
<a id='line_1669'>with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to</a>
<a id='line_1670'>perform it thyself alone.</a>
<a id='line_1671'></a>
<a id='line_1672'>18:19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God</a>
<a id='line_1673'>shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou</a>
<a id='line_1674'>mayest bring the causes unto God: 18:20 And thou shalt teach them</a>
<a id='line_1675'>ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must</a>
<a id='line_1676'>walk, and the work that they must do.</a>
<a id='line_1677'></a>
<a id='line_1678'>18:21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such</a>
<a id='line_1679'>as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over</a>
<a id='line_1680'>them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of</a>
<a id='line_1681'>fifties, and rulers of tens: 18:22 And let them judge the people at</a>
<a id='line_1682'>all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring</a>
<a id='line_1683'>unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be</a>
<a id='line_1684'>easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.</a>
<a id='line_1685'></a>
<a id='line_1686'>18:23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou</a>
<a id='line_1687'>shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their</a>
<a id='line_1688'>place in peace.</a>
<a id='line_1689'></a>
<a id='line_1690'>18:24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did</a>
<a id='line_1691'>all that he had said.</a>
<a id='line_1692'></a>
<a id='line_1693'>18:25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads</a>
<a id='line_1694'>over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of</a>
<a id='line_1695'>fifties, and rulers of tens.</a>
<a id='line_1696'></a>
<a id='line_1697'>18:26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they</a>
<a id='line_1698'>brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.</a>
<a id='line_1699'></a>
<a id='line_1700'>18:27 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into</a>
<a id='line_1701'>his own land.</a>
<a id='line_1702'></a>
<a id='line_1703'>19:1 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth</a>
<a id='line_1704'>out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness</a>
<a id='line_1705'>of Sinai.</a>
<a id='line_1706'></a>
<a id='line_1707'>19:2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert</a>
<a id='line_1708'>of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped</a>
<a id='line_1709'>before the mount.</a>
<a id='line_1710'></a>
<a id='line_1711'>19:3 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of</a>
<a id='line_1712'>the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and</a>
<a id='line_1713'>tell the children of Israel; 19:4 Ye have seen what I did unto the</a>
<a id='line_1714'>Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto</a>
<a id='line_1715'>myself.</a>
<a id='line_1716'></a>
<a id='line_1717'>19:5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my</a>
<a id='line_1718'>covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all</a>
<a id='line_1719'>people: for all the earth is mine: 19:6 And ye shall be unto me a</a>
<a id='line_1720'>kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.</a>
<a id='line_1721'></a>
<a id='line_1722'>These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of</a>
<a id='line_1723'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1724'></a>
<a id='line_1725'>19:7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid</a>
<a id='line_1726'>before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.</a>
<a id='line_1727'></a>
<a id='line_1728'>19:8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1729'>hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people</a>
<a id='line_1730'>unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1731'></a>
<a id='line_1732'>19:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick</a>
<a id='line_1733'>cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe</a>
<a id='line_1734'>thee for ever.</a>
<a id='line_1735'></a>
<a id='line_1736'>And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1737'></a>
<a id='line_1738'>19:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify</a>
<a id='line_1739'>them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, 19:11 And</a>
<a id='line_1740'>be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come</a>
<a id='line_1741'>down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.</a>
<a id='line_1742'></a>
<a id='line_1743'>19:12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1744'>Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch</a>
<a id='line_1745'>the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to</a>
<a id='line_1746'>death: 19:13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be</a>
<a id='line_1747'>stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not</a>
<a id='line_1748'>live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.</a>
<a id='line_1749'></a>
<a id='line_1750'>19:14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and</a>
<a id='line_1751'>sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.</a>
<a id='line_1752'></a>
<a id='line_1753'>19:15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:</a>
<a id='line_1754'>come not at your wives.</a>
<a id='line_1755'></a>
<a id='line_1756'>19:16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there</a>
<a id='line_1757'>were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and</a>
<a id='line_1758'>the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that</a>
<a id='line_1759'>was in the camp trembled.</a>
<a id='line_1760'></a>
<a id='line_1761'>19:17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with</a>
<a id='line_1762'>God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.</a>
<a id='line_1763'></a>
<a id='line_1764'>19:18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1765'>descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke</a>
<a id='line_1766'>of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.</a>
<a id='line_1767'></a>
<a id='line_1768'>19:19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder</a>
<a id='line_1769'>and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.</a>
<a id='line_1770'></a>
<a id='line_1771'>19:20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the</a>
<a id='line_1772'>mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses</a>
<a id='line_1773'>went up.</a>
<a id='line_1774'></a>
<a id='line_1775'>19:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest</a>
<a id='line_1776'>they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.</a>
<a id='line_1777'></a>
<a id='line_1778'>19:22 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify</a>
<a id='line_1779'>themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.</a>
<a id='line_1780'></a>
<a id='line_1781'>19:23 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount</a>
<a id='line_1782'>Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and</a>
<a id='line_1783'>sanctify it.</a>
<a id='line_1784'></a>
<a id='line_1785'>19:24 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_1786'>come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the</a>
<a id='line_1787'>people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth</a>
<a id='line_1788'>upon them.</a>
<a id='line_1789'></a>
<a id='line_1790'>19:25 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.</a>
<a id='line_1791'></a>
<a id='line_1792'>20:1 And God spake all these words, saying, 20:2 I am the LORD thy</a>
<a id='line_1793'>God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the</a>
<a id='line_1794'>house of bondage.</a>
<a id='line_1795'></a>
<a id='line_1796'>20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</a>
<a id='line_1797'></a>
<a id='line_1798'>20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness</a>
<a id='line_1799'>of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath,</a>
<a id='line_1800'>or that is in the water under the earth.</a>
<a id='line_1801'></a>
<a id='line_1802'>20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I</a>
<a id='line_1803'>the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the</a>
<a id='line_1804'>fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them</a>
<a id='line_1805'>that hate me; 20:6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love</a>
<a id='line_1806'>me, and keep my commandments.</a>
<a id='line_1807'></a>
<a id='line_1808'>20:7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the</a>
<a id='line_1809'>LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</a>
<a id='line_1810'></a>
<a id='line_1811'>20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</a>
<a id='line_1812'></a>
<a id='line_1813'>20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 20:10 But the</a>
<a id='line_1814'>seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not</a>
<a id='line_1815'>do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor</a>
<a id='line_1816'>thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy</a>
<a id='line_1817'>gates: 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea,</a>
<a id='line_1818'>and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the</a>
<a id='line_1819'>LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</a>
<a id='line_1820'></a>
<a id='line_1821'>20:12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon</a>
<a id='line_1822'>the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</a>
<a id='line_1823'></a>
<a id='line_1824'>20:13 Thou shalt not kill.</a>
<a id='line_1825'></a>
<a id='line_1826'>20:14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.</a>
<a id='line_1827'></a>
<a id='line_1828'>20:15 Thou shalt not steal.</a>
<a id='line_1829'></a>
<a id='line_1830'>20:16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.</a>
<a id='line_1831'></a>
<a id='line_1832'>20:17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbours house, thou shalt not covet</a>
<a id='line_1833'>thy neighbours wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his</a>
<a id='line_1834'>ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbours.</a>
<a id='line_1835'></a>
<a id='line_1836'>20:18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and</a>
<a id='line_1837'>the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the</a>
<a id='line_1838'>people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.</a>
<a id='line_1839'></a>
<a id='line_1840'>20:19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear:</a>
<a id='line_1841'>but let not God speak with us, lest we die.</a>
<a id='line_1842'></a>
<a id='line_1843'>20:20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to</a>
<a id='line_1844'>prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin</a>
<a id='line_1845'>not.</a>
<a id='line_1846'></a>
<a id='line_1847'>20:21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the</a>
<a id='line_1848'>thick darkness where God was.</a>
<a id='line_1849'></a>
<a id='line_1850'>20:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the</a>
<a id='line_1851'>children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from</a>
<a id='line_1852'>heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1853'></a>
<a id='line_1854'>20:23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make</a>
<a id='line_1855'>unto you gods of gold.</a>
<a id='line_1856'></a>
<a id='line_1857'>20:24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice</a>
<a id='line_1858'>thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and</a>
<a id='line_1859'>thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto</a>
<a id='line_1860'>thee, and I will bless thee.</a>
<a id='line_1861'></a>
<a id='line_1862'>20:25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build</a>
<a id='line_1863'>it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast</a>
<a id='line_1864'>polluted it.</a>
<a id='line_1865'></a>
<a id='line_1866'>20:26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy</a>

<a id='line_1881'>21:5 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife,</a>
<a id='line_1882'>and my children; I will not go out free: 21:6 Then his master shall</a>
<a id='line_1883'>bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or</a>
<a id='line_1884'>unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an</a>
<a id='line_1885'>aul; and he shall serve him for ever.</a>

<a id='line_2201'>24:4 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in</a>

<a id='line_2204'></a>
<a id='line_2205'>24:5 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered</a>

<a id='line_2250'>25:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 25:2 Speak unto the</a>

<a id='line_2803'>and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he</a>
<a id='line_2804'>shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons’</a>

<a id='line_2863'>29:37 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and</a>

<a id='line_2891'>29:45 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their</a>

<a id='line_2912'></a>
<a id='line_2913'>30:5 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them</a>

<a id='line_2919'></a>
<a id='line_2920'>30:7 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he</a>

<a id='line_2933'>is most holy unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2934'></a>
<a id='line_2935'>30:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:12 When thou takest</a>

<a id='line_2940'></a>
<a id='line_2941'>30:13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are</a>

<a id='line_2944'></a>
<a id='line_2945'>30:14 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty</a>
<a id='line_2946'>years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2947'></a>
<a id='line_2948'>30:15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less</a>

<a id='line_2950'>an atonement for your souls.</a>
<a id='line_2951'></a>
<a id='line_2952'>30:16 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of</a>
<a id='line_2953'>Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_2954'>congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel</a>
<a id='line_2955'>before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.</a>
<a id='line_2956'></a>
<a id='line_2957'>30:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:18 Thou shalt also</a>
<a id='line_2958'>make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and</a>
<a id='line_2959'>thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the</a>
<a id='line_2960'>altar, and thou shalt put water therein.</a>
<a id='line_2961'></a>
<a id='line_2962'>30:19 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet</a>
<a id='line_2963'>thereat: 30:20 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation,</a>
<a id='line_2964'>they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near</a>
<a id='line_2965'>to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:</a>
<a id='line_2966'>30:21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die</a>
<a id='line_2967'>not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to</a>
<a id='line_2968'>his seed throughout their generations.</a>
<a id='line_2969'></a>
<a id='line_2970'>30:22 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:23 Take thou also</a>
<a id='line_2971'>unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of</a>
<a id='line_2972'>sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and</a>
<a id='line_2973'>of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels, 30:24 And of cassia</a>
<a id='line_2974'>five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil</a>
<a id='line_2975'>olive an hin: 30:25 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an</a>
<a id='line_2976'>ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy</a>
<a id='line_2977'>anointing oil.</a>
<a id='line_2978'></a>
<a id='line_2979'>30:26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation</a>

<a id='line_2981'>his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of</a>
<a id='line_2982'>incense, 30:28 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels,</a>
<a id='line_2983'>and the laver and his foot.</a>
<a id='line_2984'></a>
<a id='line_2985'>30:29 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:</a>
<a id='line_2986'>whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.</a>
<a id='line_2987'></a>
<a id='line_2988'>30:30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them,</a>
<a id='line_2989'>that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office.</a>
<a id='line_2990'></a>
<a id='line_2991'>30:31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This</a>
<a id='line_2992'>shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.</a>
<a id='line_2993'></a>
<a id='line_2994'>30:32 Upon man’s flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make</a>
<a id='line_2995'>any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it</a>

<a id='line_2997'></a>
<a id='line_2998'>30:33 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of</a>
<a id='line_2999'>it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.</a>
<a id='line_3000'></a>
<a id='line_3001'>30:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,</a>
<a id='line_3002'>stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure</a>
<a id='line_3003'>frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight: 30:35 And thou</a>
<a id='line_3004'>shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary,</a>
<a id='line_3005'>tempered together, pure and holy: 30:36 And thou shalt beat some of it</a>
<a id='line_3006'>very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of</a>
<a id='line_3007'>the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you</a>
<a id='line_3008'>most holy.</a>
<a id='line_3009'></a>
<a id='line_3010'>30:37 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make</a>
<a id='line_3011'>to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto</a>
<a id='line_3012'>thee holy for the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3013'></a>
<a id='line_3014'>30:38 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall</a>
<a id='line_3015'>even be cut off from his people.</a>
<a id='line_3016'></a>
<a id='line_3017'>31:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:2 See, I have called by</a>
<a id='line_3018'>name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:</a>
<a id='line_3019'>31:3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in</a>
<a id='line_3020'>understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,</a>
<a id='line_3021'>31:4 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in</a>
<a id='line_3022'>brass, 31:5 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of</a>
<a id='line_3023'>timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.</a>
<a id='line_3024'></a>
<a id='line_3025'>31:6 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of</a>
<a id='line_3026'>Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise</a>
<a id='line_3027'>hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have</a>
<a id='line_3028'>commanded thee; 31:7 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark</a>
<a id='line_3029'>of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the</a>
<a id='line_3030'>furniture of the tabernacle, 31:8 And the table and his furniture, and</a>
<a id='line_3031'>the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,</a>
<a id='line_3032'>31:9 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the</a>

<a id='line_3035'>minister in the priest’s office, 31:11 And the anointing oil, and</a>
<a id='line_3036'>sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have</a>
<a id='line_3037'>commanded thee shall they do.</a>
<a id='line_3038'></a>
<a id='line_3039'>31:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:13 Speak thou also</a>
<a id='line_3040'>unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep:</a>
<a id='line_3041'>for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that</a>
<a id='line_3042'>ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.</a>
<a id='line_3043'></a>
<a id='line_3044'>31:14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you:</a>
<a id='line_3045'>every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever</a>
<a id='line_3046'>doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his</a>
<a id='line_3047'>people.</a>
<a id='line_3048'></a>
<a id='line_3049'>31:15 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of</a>
<a id='line_3050'>rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day,</a>
<a id='line_3051'>he shall surely be put to death.</a>
<a id='line_3052'></a>
<a id='line_3053'>31:16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to</a>
<a id='line_3054'>observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual</a>
<a id='line_3055'>covenant.</a>
<a id='line_3056'></a>
<a id='line_3057'>31:17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for</a>
<a id='line_3058'>in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he</a>
<a id='line_3059'>rested, and was refreshed.</a>
<a id='line_3060'></a>
<a id='line_3061'>31:18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing</a>
<a id='line_3062'>with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone,</a>
<a id='line_3063'>written with the finger of God.</a>
<a id='line_3064'></a>
<a id='line_3065'>32:1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of</a>
<a id='line_3066'>the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and</a>
<a id='line_3067'>said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for</a>
<a id='line_3068'>this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we</a>
<a id='line_3069'>wot not what is become of him.</a>
<a id='line_3070'></a>
<a id='line_3071'>32:2 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which</a>
<a id='line_3072'>are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters,</a>
<a id='line_3073'>and bring them unto me.</a>
<a id='line_3074'></a>
<a id='line_3075'>32:3 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in</a>
<a id='line_3076'>their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.</a>
<a id='line_3077'></a>
<a id='line_3078'>32:4 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a</a>
<a id='line_3079'>graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These</a>
<a id='line_3080'>be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_3081'></a>
<a id='line_3082'>32:5 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron</a>
<a id='line_3083'>made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3084'></a>
<a id='line_3085'>32:6 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt</a>
<a id='line_3086'>offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat</a>
<a id='line_3087'>and to drink, and rose up to play.</a>
<a id='line_3088'></a>
<a id='line_3089'>32:7 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people,</a>
<a id='line_3090'>which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted</a>
<a id='line_3091'>themselves: 32:8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I</a>
<a id='line_3092'>commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped</a>
<a id='line_3093'>it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O</a>
<a id='line_3094'>Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_3095'></a>
<a id='line_3096'>32:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,</a>
<a id='line_3097'>behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 32:10 Now therefore let me alone,</a>
<a id='line_3098'>that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them:</a>
<a id='line_3099'>and I will make of thee a great nation.</a>
<a id='line_3100'></a>
<a id='line_3101'>32:11 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth</a>
<a id='line_3102'>thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth</a>
<a id='line_3103'>out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?</a>
<a id='line_3104'>32:12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did</a>
<a id='line_3105'>he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them</a>
<a id='line_3106'>from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of</a>
<a id='line_3107'>this evil against thy people.</a>
<a id='line_3108'></a>
<a id='line_3109'>32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou</a>
<a id='line_3110'>swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your</a>
<a id='line_3111'>seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of</a>
<a id='line_3112'>will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.</a>
<a id='line_3113'></a>
<a id='line_3114'>32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto</a>
<a id='line_3115'>his people.</a>
<a id='line_3116'></a>
<a id='line_3117'>32:15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two</a>
<a id='line_3118'>tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on</a>
<a id='line_3119'>both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.</a>
<a id='line_3120'></a>
<a id='line_3121'>32:16 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the</a>
<a id='line_3122'>writing of God, graven upon the tables.</a>
<a id='line_3123'></a>
<a id='line_3124'>32:17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,</a>
<a id='line_3125'>he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.</a>
<a id='line_3126'></a>
<a id='line_3127'>32:18 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery,</a>
<a id='line_3128'>neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the</a>
<a id='line_3129'>noise of them that sing do I hear.</a>
<a id='line_3130'></a>
<a id='line_3131'>32:19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that</a>
<a id='line_3132'>he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses’ anger waxed hot, and he</a>
<a id='line_3133'>cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.</a>
<a id='line_3134'></a>
<a id='line_3135'>32:20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the</a>
<a id='line_3136'>fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made</a>
<a id='line_3137'>the children of Israel drink of it.</a>
<a id='line_3138'></a>
<a id='line_3139'>32:21 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that</a>
<a id='line_3140'>thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?  32:22 And Aaron said, Let</a>
<a id='line_3141'>not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they</a>
<a id='line_3142'>are set on mischief.</a>
<a id='line_3143'></a>
<a id='line_3144'>32:23 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us:</a>
<a id='line_3145'>for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of</a>
<a id='line_3146'>Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.</a>
<a id='line_3147'></a>
<a id='line_3148'>32:24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it</a>
<a id='line_3149'>off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came</a>
<a id='line_3150'>out this calf.</a>
<a id='line_3151'></a>
<a id='line_3152'>32:25 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had</a>
<a id='line_3153'>made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:) 32:26 Then</a>
<a id='line_3154'>Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD’s</a>
<a id='line_3155'>side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered</a>
<a id='line_3156'>themselves together unto him.</a>
<a id='line_3157'></a>
<a id='line_3158'>32:27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put</a>
<a id='line_3159'>every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate</a>
<a id='line_3160'>throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his</a>
<a id='line_3161'>companion, and every man his neighbour.</a>
<a id='line_3162'></a>
<a id='line_3163'>32:28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and</a>
<a id='line_3164'>there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</a>
<a id='line_3165'></a>
<a id='line_3166'>32:29 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_3167'>even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow</a>
<a id='line_3168'>upon you a blessing this day.</a>
<a id='line_3169'></a>
<a id='line_3170'>32:30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the</a>
<a id='line_3171'>people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the</a>
<a id='line_3172'>LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.</a>
<a id='line_3173'></a>
<a id='line_3174'>32:31 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have</a>
<a id='line_3175'>sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.</a>
<a id='line_3176'></a>
<a id='line_3177'>32:32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me,</a>
<a id='line_3178'>I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.</a>
<a id='line_3179'></a>
<a id='line_3180'>32:33 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me,</a>
<a id='line_3181'>him will I blot out of my book.</a>
<a id='line_3182'></a>
<a id='line_3183'>32:34 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have</a>
<a id='line_3184'>spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee:</a>
<a id='line_3185'>nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.</a>
<a id='line_3186'></a>
<a id='line_3187'>32:35 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,</a>
<a id='line_3188'>which Aaron made.</a>
<a id='line_3189'></a>
<a id='line_3190'>33:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and</a>
<a id='line_3191'>the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto</a>
<a id='line_3192'>the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying,</a>
<a id='line_3193'>Unto thy seed will I give it: 33:2 And I will send an angel before</a>
<a id='line_3194'>thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the</a>
<a id='line_3195'>Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 33:3 Unto a</a>
<a id='line_3196'>land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of</a>
<a id='line_3197'>thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the</a>
<a id='line_3198'>way.</a>
<a id='line_3199'></a>
<a id='line_3200'>33:4 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and</a>
<a id='line_3201'>no man did put on him his ornaments.</a>
<a id='line_3202'></a>
<a id='line_3203'>33:5 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of</a>
<a id='line_3204'>Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of</a>
<a id='line_3205'>thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy</a>
<a id='line_3206'>ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_3207'></a>
<a id='line_3208'>33:6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments</a>
<a id='line_3209'>by the mount Horeb.</a>
<a id='line_3210'></a>
<a id='line_3211'>33:7 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp,</a>
<a id='line_3212'>afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_3213'>congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the</a>
<a id='line_3214'>LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was</a>
<a id='line_3215'>without the camp.</a>
<a id='line_3216'></a>
<a id='line_3217'>33:8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,</a>
<a id='line_3218'>that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and</a>
<a id='line_3219'>looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.</a>
<a id='line_3220'></a>
<a id='line_3221'>33:9 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the</a>
<a id='line_3222'>cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and</a>
<a id='line_3223'>the Lord talked with Moses.</a>
<a id='line_3224'></a>
<a id='line_3225'>33:10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle</a>
<a id='line_3226'>door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent</a>
<a id='line_3227'>door.</a>
<a id='line_3228'></a>
<a id='line_3229'>33:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh</a>
<a id='line_3230'>unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant</a>
<a id='line_3231'>Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the</a>
<a id='line_3232'>tabernacle.</a>
<a id='line_3233'></a>
<a id='line_3234'>33:12 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up</a>
<a id='line_3235'>this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with</a>
<a id='line_3236'>me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found</a>
<a id='line_3237'>grace in my sight.</a>
<a id='line_3238'></a>
<a id='line_3239'>33:13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight,</a>
<a id='line_3240'>shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in</a>
<a id='line_3241'>thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.</a>
<a id='line_3242'></a>
<a id='line_3243'>33:14 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give</a>
<a id='line_3244'>thee rest.</a>
<a id='line_3245'></a>
<a id='line_3246'>33:15 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us</a>
<a id='line_3247'>not up hence.</a>
<a id='line_3248'></a>
<a id='line_3249'>33:16 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have</a>
<a id='line_3250'>found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so</a>
<a id='line_3251'>shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are</a>
<a id='line_3252'>upon the face of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_3253'></a>
<a id='line_3254'>33:17 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that</a>
<a id='line_3255'>thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know</a>
<a id='line_3256'>thee by name.</a>
<a id='line_3257'></a>
<a id='line_3258'>33:18 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.</a>
<a id='line_3259'></a>
<a id='line_3260'>33:19 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I</a>
<a id='line_3261'>will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious</a>
<a id='line_3262'>to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew</a>
<a id='line_3263'>mercy.</a>
<a id='line_3264'></a>
<a id='line_3265'>33:20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man</a>
<a id='line_3266'>see me, and live.</a>
<a id='line_3267'></a>
<a id='line_3268'>33:21 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou</a>
<a id='line_3269'>shalt stand upon a rock: 33:22 And it shall come to pass, while my</a>
<a id='line_3270'>glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and</a>
<a id='line_3271'>will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: 33:23 And I will take</a>
<a id='line_3272'>away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall</a>
<a id='line_3273'>not be seen.</a>
<a id='line_3274'></a>
<a id='line_3275'>34:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like</a>
<a id='line_3276'>unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were</a>
<a id='line_3277'>in the first tables, which thou brakest.</a>
<a id='line_3278'></a>
<a id='line_3279'>34:2 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto</a>
<a id='line_3280'>mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.</a>
<a id='line_3281'></a>
<a id='line_3282'>34:3 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen</a>
<a id='line_3283'>throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before</a>
<a id='line_3284'>that mount.</a>
<a id='line_3285'></a>
<a id='line_3286'>34:4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses</a>
<a id='line_3287'>rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the</a>
<a id='line_3288'>LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.</a>
<a id='line_3289'></a>
<a id='line_3290'>34:5 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,</a>
<a id='line_3291'>and proclaimed the name of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3292'></a>
<a id='line_3293'>34:6 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The</a>
<a id='line_3294'>LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in</a>
<a id='line_3295'>goodness and truth, 34:7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving</a>
<a id='line_3296'>iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear</a>
<a id='line_3297'>the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,</a>
<a id='line_3298'>and upon the children’s children, unto the third and to the fourth</a>
<a id='line_3299'>generation.</a>
<a id='line_3300'></a>
<a id='line_3301'>34:8 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and</a>
<a id='line_3302'>worshipped.</a>
<a id='line_3303'></a>
<a id='line_3304'>34:9 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let</a>
<a id='line_3305'>my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and</a>
<a id='line_3306'>pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_3307'></a>
<a id='line_3308'>34:10 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I</a>
<a id='line_3309'>will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in</a>
<a id='line_3310'>any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work</a>
<a id='line_3311'>of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.</a>
<a id='line_3312'></a>
<a id='line_3313'>34:11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive</a>
<a id='line_3314'>out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and</a>
<a id='line_3315'>the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</a>
<a id='line_3316'></a>
<a id='line_3317'>34:12 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the</a>
<a id='line_3318'>inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in</a>
<a id='line_3319'>the midst of thee: 34:13 But ye shall destroy their altars, break</a>
<a id='line_3320'>their images, and cut down their groves: 34:14 For thou shalt worship</a>
<a id='line_3321'>no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:</a>
<a id='line_3322'>34:15 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and</a>
<a id='line_3323'>they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods,</a>
<a id='line_3324'>and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 34:16 And thou take</a>
<a id='line_3325'>of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring</a>
<a id='line_3326'>after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.</a>
<a id='line_3327'></a>
<a id='line_3328'>34:17 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.</a>
<a id='line_3329'></a>
<a id='line_3330'>34:18 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou</a>
<a id='line_3331'>shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the</a>
<a id='line_3332'>month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_3333'></a>
<a id='line_3334'>34:19 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among</a>
<a id='line_3335'>thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.</a>
<a id='line_3336'></a>
<a id='line_3337'>34:20 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and</a>
<a id='line_3338'>if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the</a>
<a id='line_3339'>firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before</a>
<a id='line_3340'>me empty.</a>
<a id='line_3341'></a>
<a id='line_3342'>34:21 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_3343'>rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.</a>
<a id='line_3344'></a>
<a id='line_3345'>34:22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of</a>
<a id='line_3346'>wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year’s end.</a>
<a id='line_3347'></a>
<a id='line_3348'>34:23 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the</a>
<a id='line_3349'>LORD God, the God of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3350'></a>
<a id='line_3351'>34:24 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy</a>
<a id='line_3352'>borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up</a>
<a id='line_3353'>to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.</a>
<a id='line_3354'></a>
<a id='line_3355'>34:25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;</a>
<a id='line_3356'>neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto</a>
<a id='line_3357'>the morning.</a>
<a id='line_3358'></a>
<a id='line_3359'>34:26 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto</a>
<a id='line_3360'>the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his</a>
<a id='line_3361'>mother’s milk.</a>
<a id='line_3362'></a>
<a id='line_3363'>34:27 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after</a>
<a id='line_3364'>the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with</a>
<a id='line_3365'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3366'></a>
<a id='line_3367'>34:28 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he</a>
<a id='line_3368'>did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables</a>
<a id='line_3369'>the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.</a>
<a id='line_3370'></a>
<a id='line_3371'>34:29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with</a>
<a id='line_3372'>the two tables of testimony in Moses’ hand, when he came down from the</a>
<a id='line_3373'>mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he</a>
<a id='line_3374'>talked with him.</a>
<a id='line_3375'></a>
<a id='line_3376'>34:30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold,</a>
<a id='line_3377'>the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.</a>
<a id='line_3378'></a>
<a id='line_3379'>34:31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the</a>
<a id='line_3380'>congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.</a>
<a id='line_3381'></a>
<a id='line_3382'>34:32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave</a>
<a id='line_3383'>them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount</a>
<a id='line_3384'>Sinai.</a>
<a id='line_3385'></a>
<a id='line_3386'>34:33 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his</a>
<a id='line_3387'>face.</a>
<a id='line_3388'></a>
<a id='line_3389'>34:34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he</a>
<a id='line_3390'>took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto</a>
<a id='line_3391'>the children of Israel that which he was commanded.</a>
<a id='line_3392'></a>
<a id='line_3393'>34:35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin</a>
<a id='line_3394'>of Moses’ face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again,</a>
<a id='line_3395'>until he went in to speak with him.</a>
<a id='line_3396'></a>
<a id='line_3397'>35:1 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel</a>
<a id='line_3398'>together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath</a>
<a id='line_3399'>commanded, that ye should do them.</a>
<a id='line_3400'></a>
<a id='line_3401'>35:2 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall</a>
<a id='line_3402'>be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth</a>
<a id='line_3403'>work therein shall be put to death.</a>

<a id='line_3476'>wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of</a>
<a id='line_3477'>workmanship; 35:32 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and</a>
<a id='line_3478'>in silver, and in brass, 35:33 And in the cutting of stones, to set</a>
<a id='line_3479'>them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.</a>
<a id='line_3480'></a>
<a id='line_3481'>35:34 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and</a>
<a id='line_3482'>Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.</a>
<a id='line_3483'></a>
<a id='line_3484'>35:35 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of</a>
<a id='line_3485'>work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the</a>

<a id='line_3487'>and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that</a>
<a id='line_3488'>devise cunning work.</a>
<a id='line_3489'></a>
<a id='line_3490'>36:1 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in</a>
<a id='line_3491'>whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all</a>

<a id='line_3493'>the LORD had commanded.</a>
<a id='line_3494'></a>
<a id='line_3495'>36:2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted</a>
<a id='line_3496'>man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose</a>
<a id='line_3497'>heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: 36:3 And they</a>
<a id='line_3498'>received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had</a>
<a id='line_3499'>brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it</a>
<a id='line_3500'>withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.</a>
<a id='line_3501'></a>
<a id='line_3502'>36:4 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary,</a>
<a id='line_3503'>came every man from his work which they made; 36:5 And they spake unto</a>
<a id='line_3504'>Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service</a>
<a id='line_3505'>of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.</a>
<a id='line_3506'></a>
<a id='line_3507'>36:6 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed</a>
<a id='line_3508'>throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more</a>
<a id='line_3509'>work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained</a>
<a id='line_3510'>from bringing.</a>
<a id='line_3511'></a>
<a id='line_3512'>36:7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make</a>
<a id='line_3513'>it, and too much.</a>
<a id='line_3514'></a>
<a id='line_3515'>36:8 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of</a>
<a id='line_3516'>the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and</a>
<a id='line_3517'>purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.</a>
<a id='line_3518'></a>
<a id='line_3519'>36:9 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the</a>
<a id='line_3520'>breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.</a>
<a id='line_3521'></a>
<a id='line_3522'>36:10 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other</a>
<a id='line_3523'>five curtains he coupled one unto another.</a>
<a id='line_3524'></a>
<a id='line_3525'>36:11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the</a>
<a id='line_3526'>selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of</a>
<a id='line_3527'>another curtain, in the coupling of the second.</a>
<a id='line_3528'></a>
<a id='line_3529'>36:12 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in</a>
<a id='line_3530'>the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the</a>
<a id='line_3531'>loops held one curtain to another.</a>
<a id='line_3532'></a>
<a id='line_3533'>36:13 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one</a>
<a id='line_3534'>unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.</a>
<a id='line_3535'></a>
<a id='line_3536'>36:14 And he made curtains of goats’ hair for the tent over the</a>
<a id='line_3537'>tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.</a>
<a id='line_3538'></a>
<a id='line_3539'>36:15 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was</a>
<a id='line_3540'>the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.</a>

<a id='line_3542'>36:16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by</a>
<a id='line_3543'>themselves.</a>
<a id='line_3544'></a>
<a id='line_3545'>36:17 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain</a>
<a id='line_3546'>in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain</a>
<a id='line_3547'>which coupleth the second.</a>
<a id='line_3548'></a>
<a id='line_3549'>36:18 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together,</a>
<a id='line_3550'>that it might be one.</a>
<a id='line_3551'></a>
<a id='line_3552'>36:19 And he made a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and</a>
<a id='line_3553'>a covering of badgers’ skins above that.</a>
<a id='line_3554'></a>
<a id='line_3555'>36:20 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing</a>
<a id='line_3556'>up.</a>
<a id='line_3557'></a>
<a id='line_3558'>36:21 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board</a>

<a id='line_3560'></a>
<a id='line_3561'>36:22 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus</a>
<a id='line_3562'>did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.</a>
<a id='line_3563'></a>
<a id='line_3564'>36:23 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the</a>
<a id='line_3565'>south side southward: 36:24 And forty sockets of silver he made under</a>
<a id='line_3566'>the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and</a>
<a id='line_3567'>two sockets under another board for his two tenons.</a>
<a id='line_3568'></a>
<a id='line_3569'>36:25 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the</a>
<a id='line_3570'>north corner, he made twenty boards, 36:26 And their forty sockets of</a>
<a id='line_3571'>silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another</a>
<a id='line_3572'>board.</a>
<a id='line_3573'></a>
<a id='line_3574'>36:27 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.</a>
<a id='line_3575'></a>
<a id='line_3576'>36:28 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the</a>
<a id='line_3577'>two sides.</a>
<a id='line_3578'></a>
<a id='line_3579'>36:29 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head</a>
<a id='line_3580'>thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.</a>
<a id='line_3581'></a>
<a id='line_3582'>36:30 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen</a>
<a id='line_3583'>sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.</a>
<a id='line_3584'></a>
<a id='line_3585'>36:31 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one</a>
<a id='line_3586'>side of the tabernacle, 36:32 And five bars for the boards of the</a>
<a id='line_3587'>other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the</a>
<a id='line_3588'>tabernacle for the sides westward.</a>
<a id='line_3589'></a>
<a id='line_3590'>36:33 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the</a>
<a id='line_3591'>one end to the other.</a>
<a id='line_3592'></a>
<a id='line_3593'>36:34 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of</a>
<a id='line_3594'>gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.</a>
<a id='line_3595'></a>
<a id='line_3596'>36:35 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine</a>
<a id='line_3597'>twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.</a>
<a id='line_3598'></a>
<a id='line_3599'>36:36 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid</a>
<a id='line_3600'>them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four</a>
<a id='line_3601'>sockets of silver.</a>
<a id='line_3602'></a>
<a id='line_3603'>36:37 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and</a>

<a id='line_3607'>brass.</a>
<a id='line_3608'></a>
<a id='line_3609'>37:1 And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half</a>

<a id='line_3613'></a>
<a id='line_3614'>37:3 And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four</a>
<a id='line_3615'>corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings</a>
<a id='line_3616'>upon the other side of it.</a>
<a id='line_3617'></a>
<a id='line_3618'>37:4 And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.</a>
<a id='line_3619'></a>
<a id='line_3620'>37:5 And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to</a>
<a id='line_3621'>bear the ark.</a>
<a id='line_3622'></a>
<a id='line_3623'>37:6 And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half</a>

<a id='line_3628'>on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of</a>
<a id='line_3629'>the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof.</a>
<a id='line_3630'></a>
<a id='line_3631'>37:9 And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered</a>
<a id='line_3632'>with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another;</a>

<a id='line_3708'></a>
<a id='line_3709'>38:4 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the</a>
<a id='line_3710'>compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.</a>

<a id='line_3713'>to be places for the staves.</a>
<a id='line_3714'></a>

<a id='line_3818'>and in the fine linen, with cunning work.</a>
<a id='line_3819'></a>
<a id='line_3820'>39:4 They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the</a>
<a id='line_3821'>two edges was it coupled together.</a>
<a id='line_3822'></a>
<a id='line_3823'>39:5 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the</a>
<a id='line_3824'>same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and</a>
<a id='line_3825'>scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_3826'></a>
<a id='line_3827'>39:6 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven,</a>
<a id='line_3828'>as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3829'></a>
<a id='line_3830'>39:7 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should</a>
<a id='line_3831'>be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3832'>commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_3833'></a>
<a id='line_3834'>39:8 And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the</a>
<a id='line_3835'>ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.</a>
<a id='line_3836'></a>
<a id='line_3837'>39:9 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was</a>
<a id='line_3838'>the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.</a>
<a id='line_3839'></a>
<a id='line_3840'>39:10 And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a</a>
<a id='line_3841'>sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.</a>
<a id='line_3842'></a>
<a id='line_3843'>39:11 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.</a>
<a id='line_3844'></a>
<a id='line_3845'>39:12 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.</a>
<a id='line_3846'></a>
<a id='line_3847'>39:13 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were</a>
<a id='line_3848'>inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.</a>
<a id='line_3849'></a>
<a id='line_3850'>39:14 And the stones were according to the names of the children of</a>
<a id='line_3851'>Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a</a>
<a id='line_3852'>signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.</a>
<a id='line_3853'></a>
<a id='line_3854'>39:15 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of</a>
<a id='line_3855'>wreathen work of pure gold.</a>
<a id='line_3856'></a>
<a id='line_3857'>39:16 And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put</a>
<a id='line_3858'>the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.</a>
<a id='line_3859'></a>
<a id='line_3860'>39:17 And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on</a>
<a id='line_3861'>the ends of the breastplate.</a>
<a id='line_3862'></a>
<a id='line_3863'>39:18 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the</a>
<a id='line_3864'>two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before</a>
<a id='line_3865'>it.</a>
<a id='line_3866'></a>
<a id='line_3867'>39:19 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of</a>
<a id='line_3868'>the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the</a>
<a id='line_3869'>ephod inward.</a>
<a id='line_3870'></a>
<a id='line_3871'>39:20 And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two</a>
<a id='line_3872'>sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against</a>
<a id='line_3873'>the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.</a>
<a id='line_3874'></a>
<a id='line_3875'>39:21 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of</a>
<a id='line_3876'>the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious</a>
<a id='line_3877'>girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from</a>
<a id='line_3878'>the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_3879'></a>
<a id='line_3880'>39:22 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.</a>
<a id='line_3881'></a>
<a id='line_3882'>39:23 And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of</a>
<a id='line_3883'>an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not</a>
<a id='line_3884'>rend.</a>
<a id='line_3885'></a>
<a id='line_3886'>39:24 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue,</a>
<a id='line_3887'>and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.</a>
<a id='line_3888'></a>
<a id='line_3889'>39:25 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the</a>
<a id='line_3890'>pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the</a>
<a id='line_3891'>pomegranates; 39:26 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a</a>
<a id='line_3892'>pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the</a>
<a id='line_3893'>LORD commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_3894'></a>
<a id='line_3895'>39:27 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and</a>
<a id='line_3896'>for his sons, 39:28 And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of</a>
<a id='line_3897'>fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen, 39:29 And a</a>
<a id='line_3898'>girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of</a>
<a id='line_3899'>needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_3900'></a>
<a id='line_3901'>39:30 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and</a>
<a id='line_3902'>wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS</a>
<a id='line_3903'>TO THE LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3904'></a>
<a id='line_3905'>39:31 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon</a>
<a id='line_3906'>the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_3907'></a>
<a id='line_3908'>39:32 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the</a>
<a id='line_3909'>congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all</a>
<a id='line_3910'>that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.</a>
<a id='line_3911'></a>
<a id='line_3912'>39:33 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all</a>

<a id='line_3929'></a>
<a id='line_3930'>39:42 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children</a>
<a id='line_3931'>of Israel made all the work.</a>

<a id='line_3934'>it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses</a>
<a id='line_3935'>blessed them.</a>
<a id='line_3936'></a>
<a id='line_3937'>40:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 40:2 On the first day of</a>
<a id='line_3938'>the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the</a>
<a id='line_3939'>congregation.</a>
<a id='line_3940'></a>
<a id='line_3941'>40:3 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover</a>
<a id='line_3942'>the ark with the vail.</a>
<a id='line_3943'></a>

<a id='line_3945'>that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the</a>
<a id='line_3946'>candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.</a>
<a id='line_3947'></a>
<a id='line_3948'>40:5 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the</a>
<a id='line_3949'>ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the</a>

<a id='line_3951'></a>
<a id='line_3952'>40:6 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the</a>
<a id='line_3953'>door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.</a>
<a id='line_3954'></a>
<a id='line_3955'>40:7 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation</a>
<a id='line_3956'>and the altar, and shalt put water therein.</a>
<a id='line_3957'></a>
<a id='line_3958'>40:8 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the</a>
<a id='line_3959'>hanging at the court gate.</a>

<a id='line_3968'></a>
<a id='line_3969'>40:11 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.</a>

<a id='line_3973'></a>
<a id='line_3974'>40:13 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him,</a>

<a id='line_3982'></a>
<a id='line_3983'>40:16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so</a>

<a id='line_3989'>40:18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,</a>
<a id='line_3990'>and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared</a>
<a id='line_3991'>up his pillars.</a>
<a id='line_3992'></a>
<a id='line_3993'>40:19 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the</a>
<a id='line_3994'>covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_3995'></a>
<a id='line_3996'>40:20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the</a>

<a id='line_4001'></a>
<a id='line_4002'>40:22 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the</a>
<a id='line_4003'>side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.</a>
<a id='line_4004'></a>
<a id='line_4005'>40:23 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the</a>

<a id='line_4011'>40:25 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded</a>
<a id='line_4012'>Moses.</a>
<a id='line_4013'></a>
<a id='line_4014'>40:26 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation</a>
<a id='line_4015'>before the vail: 40:27 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD</a>
<a id='line_4016'>commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_4017'></a>
<a id='line_4018'>40:28 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.</a>
<a id='line_4019'></a>
<a id='line_4020'>40:29 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the</a>
<a id='line_4021'>tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the</a>
<a id='line_4022'>burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_4023'></a>
<a id='line_4024'>40:30 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and</a>
<a id='line_4025'>the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.</a>
<a id='line_4026'></a>
<a id='line_4027'>40:31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their</a>
<a id='line_4028'>feet thereat: 40:32 When they went into the tent of the congregation,</a>
<a id='line_4029'>and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD</a>
<a id='line_4030'>commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_4031'></a>
<a id='line_4032'>40:33 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the</a>
<a id='line_4033'>altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the</a>
<a id='line_4034'>work.</a>
<a id='line_4035'></a>
<a id='line_4036'>40:34 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory</a>
<a id='line_4037'>of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</a>
<a id='line_4038'></a>
<a id='line_4039'>40:35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the</a>
<a id='line_4040'>congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the</a>
<a id='line_4041'>LORD filled the tabernacle.</a>
<a id='line_4042'></a>
<a id='line_4043'>40:36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the</a>
<a id='line_4044'>children of Israel went onward in all their journeys: 40:37 But if the</a>
<a id='line_4045'>cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it</a>
<a id='line_4046'>was taken up.</a>
<a id='line_4047'></a>
<a id='line_4048'>40:38 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and</a>
<a id='line_4049'>fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_4050'>throughout all their journeys.</a>
