<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom;</a>
<a id='line_4'>We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among</a>
<a id='line_5'>the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>1:2 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly</a>
<a id='line_8'>despised.</a>
<a id='line_9'></a>
<a id='line_10'>1:3 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in</a>
<a id='line_11'>the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his</a>
<a id='line_12'>heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?  1:4 Though thou exalt</a>
<a id='line_13'>thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars,</a>
<a id='line_14'>thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_15'></a>
<a id='line_16'>1:5 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut</a>
<a id='line_17'>off!)  would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the</a>
<a id='line_18'>grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?  1:6</a>
<a id='line_19'>How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things</a>
<a id='line_20'>sought up!  1:7 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even</a>
<a id='line_21'>to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived</a>
<a id='line_22'>thee, and prevailed against thee; that they eat thy bread have laid a</a>
<a id='line_23'>wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'>1:8 Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise men</a>
<a id='line_26'>out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?  1:9 And thy</a>
<a id='line_27'>mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of</a>
<a id='line_28'>the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>1:10 For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover</a>
<a id='line_31'>thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.</a>
<a id='line_32'></a>
<a id='line_33'>1:11 In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that</a>
<a id='line_34'>the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered</a>
<a id='line_35'>into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of</a>
<a id='line_36'>them.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>1:12 But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in</a>
<a id='line_39'>the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have</a>
<a id='line_40'>rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction;</a>
<a id='line_41'>neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>1:13 Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the</a>
<a id='line_44'>day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their</a>
<a id='line_45'>affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their</a>
<a id='line_46'>substance in the day of their calamity; 1:14 Neither shouldest thou</a>
<a id='line_47'>have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape;</a>
<a id='line_48'>neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain</a>
<a id='line_49'>in the day of distress.</a>
<a id='line_50'></a>
<a id='line_51'>1:15 For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou</a>
<a id='line_52'>hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon</a>
<a id='line_53'>thine own head.</a>
<a id='line_54'></a>
<a id='line_55'>1:16 For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the</a>
<a id='line_56'>heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall</a>
<a id='line_57'>swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.</a>
<a id='line_58'></a>
<a id='line_59'>1:17 But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be</a>
<a id='line_60'>holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>1:18 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a</a>
<a id='line_63'>flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in</a>
<a id='line_64'>them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the</a>
<a id='line_65'>house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it.</a>
<a id='line_66'></a>
<a id='line_67'>1:19 And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they</a>
<a id='line_68'>of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of</a>
<a id='line_69'>Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.</a>
<a id='line_70'></a>
<a id='line_71'>1:20 And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall</a>
<a id='line_72'>possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity</a>
<a id='line_73'>of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the</a>
<a id='line_74'>south.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>1:21 And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of</a>
<a id='line_77'>Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORDâ€™s.</a>
