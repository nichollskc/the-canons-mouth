<a id='line_6'>      While the Romans languished under the ignominious tyranny of</a>
<a id='line_7'>      eunuchs and bishops, the praises of Julian were repeated with</a>
<a id='line_8'>      transport in every part of the empire, except in the palace of</a>
<a id='line_9'>      Constantius. The barbarians of Germany had felt, and still</a>
<a id='line_10'>      dreaded, the arms of the young C¾sar; his soldiers were the</a>
<a id='line_11'>      companions of his victory; the grateful provincials enjoyed the</a>
<a id='line_12'>      blessings of his reign; but the favorites, who had opposed his</a>
<a id='line_13'>      elevation, were offended by his virtues; and they justly</a>
<a id='line_14'>      considered the friend of the people as the enemy of the court. As</a>
<a id='line_15'>      long as the fame of Julian was doubtful, the buffoons of the</a>
<a id='line_16'>      palace, who were skilled in the language of satire, tried the</a>
<a id='line_17'>      efficacy of those arts which they had so often practised with</a>
<a id='line_18'>      success. They easily discovered, that his simplicity was not</a>
<a id='line_19'>      exempt from affectation: the ridiculous epithets of a hairy</a>
<a id='line_20'>      savage, of an ape invested with the purple, were applied to the</a>
<a id='line_21'>      dress and person of the philosophic warrior; and his modest</a>
<a id='line_22'>      despatches were stigmatized as the vain and elaborate fictions of</a>
<a id='line_23'>      a loquacious Greek, a speculative soldier, who had studied the</a>
<a id='line_24'>      art of war amidst the groves of the academy. 1 The voice of</a>
<a id='line_25'>      malicious folly was at length silenced by the shouts of victory;</a>
<a id='line_26'>      the conqueror of the Franks and Alemanni could no longer be</a>
<a id='line_27'>      painted as an object of contempt; and the monarch himself was</a>
<a id='line_28'>      meanly ambitious of stealing from his lieutenant the honorable</a>
<a id='line_29'>      reward of his labors. In the letters crowned with laurel, which,</a>
<a id='line_30'>      according to ancient custom, were addressed to the provinces, the</a>
<a id='line_31'>      name of Julian was omitted. ÒConstantius had made his</a>
<a id='line_32'>      dispositions in person; _he_ had signalized his valor in the</a>
<a id='line_33'>      foremost ranks; _his_ military conduct had secured the victory;</a>
<a id='line_34'>      and the captive king of the barbarians was presented to _him_ on</a>
<a id='line_35'>      the field of battle,Ó from which he was at that time distant</a>
<a id='line_36'>      about forty daysÕ journey. 2 So extravagant a fable was</a>
<a id='line_37'>      incapable, however, of deceiving the public credulity, or even of</a>
<a id='line_38'>      satisfying the pride of the emperor himself. Secretly conscious</a>
<a id='line_39'>      that the applause and favor of the Romans accompanied the rising</a>
<a id='line_40'>      fortunes of Julian, his discontented mind was prepared to receive</a>
<a id='line_41'>      the subtle poison of those artful sycophants, who colored their</a>
<a id='line_42'>      mischievous designs with the fairest appearances of truth and</a>
<a id='line_43'>      candor. 3 Instead of depreciating the merits of Julian, they</a>
<a id='line_44'>      acknowledged, and even exaggerated, his popular fame, superior</a>
<a id='line_45'>      talents, and important services. But they darkly insinuated, that</a>
<a id='line_46'>      the virtues of the C¾sar might instantly be converted into the</a>
<a id='line_47'>      most dangerous crimes, if the inconstant multitude should prefer</a>
<a id='line_48'>      their inclinations to their duty; or if the general of a</a>
<a id='line_49'>      victorious army should be tempted from his allegiance by the</a>
<a id='line_50'>      hopes of revenge and independent greatness. The personal fears of</a>
<a id='line_51'>      Constantius were interpreted by his council as a laudable anxiety</a>
<a id='line_52'>      for the public safety; whilst in private, and perhaps in his own</a>
<a id='line_53'>      breast, he disguised, under the less odious appellation of fear,</a>
<a id='line_54'>      the sentiments of hatred and envy, which he had secretly</a>
<a id='line_55'>      conceived for the inimitable virtues of Julian.</a>

<a id='line_87'></a>
<a id='line_88'>      The apparent tranquillity of Gaul, and the imminent danger of the</a>
<a id='line_89'>      eastern provinces, offered a specious pretence for the design</a>
<a id='line_90'>      which was artfully concerted by the Imperial ministers. They</a>
<a id='line_91'>      resolved to disarm the C¾sar; to recall those faithful troops who</a>
<a id='line_92'>      guarded his person and dignity; and to employ, in a distant war</a>
<a id='line_93'>      against the Persian monarch, the hardy veterans who had</a>
<a id='line_94'>      vanquished, on the banks of the Rhine, the fiercest nations of</a>
<a id='line_95'>      Germany. While Julian used the laborious hours of his winter</a>
<a id='line_96'>      quarters at Paris in the administration of power, which, in his</a>
<a id='line_97'>      hands, was the exercise of virtue, he was surprised by the hasty</a>
<a id='line_98'>      arrival of a tribune and a notary, with positive orders, from the</a>
<a id='line_99'>      emperor, which _they_ were directed to execute, and _he_ was</a>
<a id='line_100'>      commanded not to oppose. Constantius signified his pleasure, that</a>
<a id='line_101'>      four entire legions, the Celt¾, and Petulants, the Heruli, and</a>
<a id='line_102'>      the Batavians, should be separated from the standard of Julian,</a>
<a id='line_103'>      under which they had acquired their fame and discipline; that in</a>
<a id='line_104'>      each of the remaining bands three hundred of the bravest youths</a>
<a id='line_105'>      should be selected; and that this numerous detachment, the</a>
<a id='line_106'>      strength of the Gallic army, should instantly begin their march,</a>
<a id='line_107'>      and exert their utmost diligence to arrive, before the opening of</a>
<a id='line_108'>      the campaign, on the frontiers of Persia. 4 The C¾sar foresaw and</a>
<a id='line_109'>      lamented the consequences of this fatal mandate. Most of the</a>
<a id='line_110'>      auxiliaries, who engaged their voluntary service, had stipulated,</a>
<a id='line_111'>      that they should never be obliged to pass the Alps. The public</a>
<a id='line_112'>      faith of Rome, and the personal honor of Julian, had been pledged</a>
<a id='line_113'>      for the observance of this condition. Such an act of treachery</a>
<a id='line_114'>      and oppression would destroy the confidence, and excite the</a>
<a id='line_115'>      resentment, of the independent warriors of Germany, who</a>
<a id='line_116'>      considered truth as the noblest of their virtues, and freedom as</a>
<a id='line_117'>      the most valuable of their possessions. The legionaries, who</a>
<a id='line_118'>      enjoyed the title and privileges of Romans, were enlisted for the</a>
<a id='line_119'>      general defence of the republic; but those mercenary troops heard</a>
<a id='line_120'>      with cold indifference the antiquated names of the republic and</a>
<a id='line_121'>      of Rome. Attached, either from birth or long habit, to the</a>
<a id='line_122'>      climate and manners of Gaul, they loved and admired Julian; they</a>
<a id='line_123'>      despised, and perhaps hated, the emperor; they dreaded the</a>
<a id='line_124'>      laborious march, the Persian arrows, and the burning deserts of</a>
<a id='line_125'>      Asia. They claimed as their own the country which they had saved;</a>
<a id='line_126'>      and excused their want of spirit, by pleading the sacred and more</a>
<a id='line_127'>      immediate duty of protecting their families and friends.</a>
<a id='line_128'></a>
<a id='line_129'>      The apprehensions of the Gauls were derived from the knowledge of</a>
<a id='line_130'>      the impending and inevitable danger. As soon as the provinces</a>
<a id='line_131'>      were exhausted of their military strength, the Germans would</a>
<a id='line_132'>      violate a treaty which had been imposed on their fears; and</a>
<a id='line_133'>      notwithstanding the abilities and valor of Julian, the general of</a>
<a id='line_134'>      a nominal army, to whom the public calamities would be imputed,</a>
<a id='line_135'>      must find himself, after a vain resistance, either a prisoner in</a>
<a id='line_136'>      the camp of the barbarians, or a criminal in the palace of</a>
<a id='line_137'>      Constantius. If Julian complied with the orders which he had</a>
<a id='line_138'>      received, he subscribed his own destruction, and that of a people</a>
<a id='line_139'>      who deserved his affection. But a positive refusal was an act of</a>
<a id='line_140'>      rebellion, and a declaration of war. The inexorable jealousy of</a>
<a id='line_141'>      the emperor, the peremptory, and perhaps insidious, nature of his</a>
<a id='line_142'>      commands, left not any room for a fair apology, or candid</a>
<a id='line_143'>      interpretation; and the dependent station of the C¾sar scarcely</a>
<a id='line_144'>      allowed him to pause or to deliberate. Solitude increased the</a>
<a id='line_145'>      perplexity of Julian; he could no longer apply to the faithful</a>
<a id='line_146'>      counsels of Sallust, who had been removed from his office by the</a>
<a id='line_147'>      judicious malice of the eunuchs: he could not even enforce his</a>
<a id='line_148'>      representations by the concurrence of the ministers, who would</a>
<a id='line_149'>      have been afraid or ashamed to approve the ruin of Gaul. The</a>
<a id='line_150'>      moment had been chosen, when Lupicinus, 5 the general of the</a>
<a id='line_151'>      cavalry, was despatched into Britain, to repulse the inroads of</a>
<a id='line_152'>      the Scots and Picts; and Florentius was occupied at Vienna by the</a>
<a id='line_153'>      assessment of the tribute. The latter, a crafty and corrupt</a>
<a id='line_154'>      statesman, declining to assume a responsible part on this</a>
<a id='line_155'>      dangerous occasion, eluded the pressing and repeated invitations</a>
<a id='line_156'>      of Julian, who represented to him, that in every important</a>
<a id='line_157'>      measure, the presence of the pr¾fect was indispensable in the</a>
<a id='line_158'>      council of the prince. In the mean while the C¾sar was oppressed</a>
<a id='line_159'>      by the rude and importunate solicitations of the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_160'>      messengers, who presumed to suggest, that if he expected the</a>
<a id='line_161'>      return of his ministers, he would charge himself with the guilt</a>
<a id='line_162'>      of the delay, and reserve for them the merit of the execution.</a>
<a id='line_163'>      Unable to resist, unwilling to comply, Julian expressed, in the</a>
<a id='line_164'>      most serious terms, his wish, and even his intention, of</a>
<a id='line_165'>      resigning the purple, which he could not preserve with honor, but</a>
<a id='line_166'>      which he could not abdicate with safety.</a>

<a id='line_171'>      three thousand miles, would render the orders of Constantius as</a>
<a id='line_172'>      extravagant as they were unjust. The troops of Gaul could not</a>

<a id='line_190'>      his pride, bellowing in a tragic tone, and exciting a doubt</a>
<a id='line_191'>      whether he was more cruel or avaricious. The danger from the</a>
<a id='line_192'>      Scots and Picts was so serious that Julian himself had some</a>
<a id='line_193'>      thoughts of passing over into the island.]</a>
<a id='line_194'></a>
<a id='line_195'>      After a painful conflict, Julian was compelled to acknowledge,</a>
<a id='line_196'>      that obedience was the virtue of the most eminent subject, and</a>
<a id='line_197'>      that the sovereign alone was entitled to judge of the public</a>
<a id='line_198'>      welfare. He issued the necessary orders for carrying into</a>
<a id='line_199'>      execution the commands of Constantius; a part of the troops began</a>
<a id='line_200'>      their march for the Alps; and the detachments from the several</a>
<a id='line_201'>      garrisons moved towards their respective places of assembly. They</a>
<a id='line_202'>      advanced with difficulty through the trembling and affrighted</a>
<a id='line_203'>      crowds of provincials, who attempted to excite their pity by</a>
<a id='line_204'>      silent despair, or loud lamentations, while the wives of the</a>
<a id='line_205'>      soldiers, holding their infants in their arms, accused the</a>
<a id='line_206'>      desertion of their husbands, in the mixed language of grief, of</a>
<a id='line_207'>      tenderness, and of indignation. This scene of general distress</a>
<a id='line_208'>      afflicted the humanity of the C¾sar; he granted a sufficient</a>

<a id='line_210'>      soldiers, 6 endeavored to alleviate the hardships which he was</a>
<a id='line_211'>      constrained to inflict, and increased, by the most laudable arts,</a>

<a id='line_214'>      licentious murmurs, which every hour were communicated from tent</a>
<a id='line_215'>      to tent with more boldness and effect, prepared their minds for</a>
<a id='line_216'>      the most daring acts of sedition; and by the connivance of their</a>

<a id='line_244'>      venal acclamations, maintained an obstinate silence; and after a</a>
<a id='line_245'>      short pause, were dismissed to their quarters. The principal</a>
<a id='line_246'>      officers were entertained by the C¾sar, who professed, in the</a>

<a id='line_250'>      perplexity; and lamented the hardship of their fate, which tore</a>
<a id='line_251'>      them from their beloved general and their native country. The</a>
<a id='line_252'>      only expedient which could prevent their separation was boldly</a>
<a id='line_253'>      agitated and approved; the popular resentment was insensibly</a>
<a id='line_254'>      moulded into a regular conspiracy; their just reasons of</a>
<a id='line_255'>      complaint were heightened by passion, and their passions were</a>
<a id='line_256'>      inflamed by wine; as, on the eve of their departure, the troops</a>
<a id='line_257'>      were indulged in licentious festivity. At the hour of midnight,</a>
<a id='line_258'>      the impetuous multitude, with swords, and bows, and torches in</a>
<a id='line_259'>      their hands, rushed into the suburbs; encompassed the palace; 7</a>
<a id='line_260'>      and, careless of future dangers, pronounced the fatal and</a>
<a id='line_261'>      irrevocable words, Julian Augustus! The prince, whose anxious</a>
<a id='line_262'>      suspense was interrupted by their disorderly acclamations,</a>
<a id='line_263'>      secured the doors against their intrusion; and as long as it was</a>
<a id='line_264'>      in his power, secluded his person and dignity from the accidents</a>
<a id='line_265'>      of a nocturnal tumult. At the dawn of day, the soldiers, whose</a>
<a id='line_266'>      zeal was irritated by opposition, forcibly entered the palace,</a>
<a id='line_267'>      seized, with respectful violence, the object of their choice,</a>
<a id='line_268'>      guarded Julian with drawn swords through the streets of Paris,</a>
<a id='line_269'>      placed him on the tribunal, and with repeated shouts saluted him</a>
<a id='line_270'>      as their emperor. Prudence, as well as loyalty, inculcated the</a>
<a id='line_271'>      propriety of resisting their treasonable designs; and of</a>
<a id='line_272'>      preparing, for his oppressed virtue, the excuse of violence.</a>
<a id='line_273'>      Addressing himself by turns to the multitude and to individuals,</a>
<a id='line_274'>      he sometimes implored their mercy, and sometimes expressed his</a>
<a id='line_275'>      indignation; conjured them not to sully the fame of their</a>
<a id='line_276'>      immortal victories; and ventured to promise, that if they would</a>
<a id='line_277'>      immediately return to their allegiance, he would undertake to</a>
<a id='line_278'>      obtain from the emperor not only a free and gracious pardon, but</a>
<a id='line_279'>      even the revocation of the orders which had excited their</a>
<a id='line_280'>      resentment. But the soldiers, who were conscious of their guilt,</a>
<a id='line_281'>      chose rather to depend on the gratitude of Julian, than on the</a>
<a id='line_282'>      clemency of the emperor. Their zeal was insensibly turned into</a>
<a id='line_283'>      impatience, and their impatience into rage. The inflexible C¾sar</a>
<a id='line_284'>      sustained, till the third hour of the day, their prayers, their</a>
<a id='line_285'>      reproaches, and their menaces; nor did he yield, till he had been</a>
<a id='line_286'>      repeatedly assured, that if he wished to live, he must consent to</a>
<a id='line_287'>      reign. He was exalted on a shield in the presence, and amidst the</a>
<a id='line_288'>      unanimous acclamations, of the troops; a rich military collar,</a>
<a id='line_289'>      which was offered by chance, supplied the want of a diadem; 8 the</a>
<a id='line_290'>      ceremony was concluded by the promise of a moderate donative; and</a>

<a id='line_332'>      The grief of Julian could proceed only from his innocence; out</a>

<a id='line_334'>      those who have learned to suspect the motives and the professions</a>
<a id='line_335'>      of princes. His lively and active mind was susceptible of the</a>
<a id='line_336'>      various impressions of hope and fear, of gratitude and revenge,</a>
<a id='line_337'>      of duty and of ambition, of the love of fame, and of the fear of</a>

<a id='line_340'>      principles of action which might escape the observation, while</a>
<a id='line_341'>      they guided, or rather impelled, the steps of Julian himself. The</a>
<a id='line_342'>      discontent of the troops was produced by the malice of his</a>
<a id='line_343'>      enemies; their tumult was the natural effect of interest and of</a>
<a id='line_344'>      passion; and if Julian had tried to conceal a deep design under</a>

<a id='line_346'>      consummate artifice without necessity, and probably without</a>
<a id='line_347'>      success. He solemnly declares, in the presence of Jupiter, of the</a>
<a id='line_348'>      Sun, of Mars, of Minerva, and of all the other deities, that till</a>
<a id='line_349'>      the close of the evening which preceded his elevation, he was</a>
<a id='line_350'>      utterly ignorant of the designs of the soldiers; 12 and it may</a>
<a id='line_351'>      seem ungenerous to distrust the honor of a hero and the truth of</a>
<a id='line_352'>      a philosopher. Yet the superstitious confidence that Constantius</a>
<a id='line_353'>      was the enemy, and that he himself was the favorite, of the gods,</a>
<a id='line_354'>      might prompt him to desire, to solicit, and even to hasten the</a>
<a id='line_355'>      auspicious moment of his reign, which was predestined to restore</a>
<a id='line_356'>      the ancient religion of mankind. When Julian had received the</a>
<a id='line_357'>      intelligence of the conspiracy, he resigned himself to a short</a>

<a id='line_393'>      employed the first days of the reign of the new emperor. Although</a>
<a id='line_394'>      he was firmly resolved to maintain the station which he had</a>
<a id='line_395'>      assumed, he was still desirous of saving his country from the</a>

<a id='line_397'>      forces of Constantius, and of preserving his own character from</a>
<a id='line_398'>      the reproach of perfidy and ingratitude. Adorned with the ensigns</a>
<a id='line_399'>      of military and imperial pomp, Julian showed himself in the field</a>
<a id='line_400'>      of Mars to the soldiers, who glowed with ardent enthusiasm in the</a>
<a id='line_401'>      cause of their pupil, their leader, and their friend. He</a>
<a id='line_402'>      recapitulated their victories, lamented their sufferings,</a>
<a id='line_403'>      applauded their resolution, animated their hopes, and checked</a>
<a id='line_404'>      their impetuosity; nor did he dismiss the assembly, till he had</a>
<a id='line_405'>      obtained a solemn promise from the troops, that if the emperor of</a>
<a id='line_406'>      the East would subscribe an equitable treaty, they would renounce</a>
<a id='line_407'>      any views of conquest, and satisfy themselves with the tranquil</a>
<a id='line_408'>      possession of the Gallic provinces. On this foundation he</a>
<a id='line_409'>      composed, in his own name, and in that of the army, a specious</a>
<a id='line_410'>      and moderate epistle, 15 which was delivered to Pentadius, his</a>

<a id='line_412'>      ambassadors whom he appointed to receive the answer, and observe</a>
<a id='line_413'>      the dispositions of Constantius. This epistle is inscribed with</a>
<a id='line_414'>      the modest appellation of C¾sar; but Julian solicits in a</a>
<a id='line_415'>      peremptory, though respectful, manner, the confirmation of the</a>
<a id='line_416'>      title of Augustus. He acknowledges the irregularity of his own</a>
<a id='line_417'>      election, while he justifies, in some measure, the resentment and</a>
<a id='line_418'>      violence of the troops which had extorted his reluctant consent.</a>
<a id='line_419'>      He allows the supremacy of his brother Constantius; and engages</a>
<a id='line_420'>      to send him an annual present of Spanish horses, to recruit his</a>
<a id='line_421'>      army with a select number of barbarian youths, and to accept from</a>
<a id='line_422'>      his choice a Pr¾torian pr¾fect of approved discretion and</a>
<a id='line_423'>      fidelity. But he reserves for himself the nomination of his other</a>
<a id='line_424'>      civil and military officers, with the troops, the revenue, and</a>
<a id='line_425'>      the sovereignty of the provinces beyond the Alps. He admonishes</a>
<a id='line_426'>      the emperor to consult the dictates of justice; to distrust the</a>
<a id='line_427'>      arts of those venal flatterers, who subsist only by the discord</a>
<a id='line_428'>      of princes; and to embrace the offer of a fair and honorable</a>
<a id='line_429'>      treaty, equally advantageous to the republic and to the house of</a>
<a id='line_430'>      Constantine. In this negotiation Julian claimed no more than he</a>

<a id='line_456'>      The negotiations of peace were accompanied and supported by the</a>
<a id='line_457'>      most vigorous preparations for war. The army, which Julian held</a>
<a id='line_458'>      in readiness for immediate action, was recruited and augmented by</a>
<a id='line_459'>      the disorders of the times. The cruel persecutions of the faction</a>
<a id='line_460'>      of Magnentius had filled Gaul with numerous bands of outlaws and</a>
<a id='line_461'>      robbers. They cheerfully accepted the offer of a general pardon</a>
<a id='line_462'>      from a prince whom they could trust, submitted to the restraints</a>
<a id='line_463'>      of military discipline, and retained only their implacable hatred</a>
<a id='line_464'>      to the person and government of Constantius. 17 As soon as the</a>
<a id='line_465'>      season of the year permitted Julian to take the field, he</a>
<a id='line_466'>      appeared at the head of his legions; threw a bridge over the</a>
<a id='line_467'>      Rhine in the neighborhood of Cleves; and prepared to chastise the</a>
<a id='line_468'>      perfidy of the Attuarii, a tribe of Franks, who presumed that</a>
<a id='line_469'>      they might ravage, with impunity, the frontiers of a divided</a>
<a id='line_470'>      empire. The difficulty, as well as glory, of this enterprise,</a>
<a id='line_471'>      consisted in a laborious march; and Julian had conquered, as soon</a>
<a id='line_472'>      as he could penetrate into a country, which former princes had</a>
<a id='line_473'>      considered as inaccessible. After he had given peace to the</a>
<a id='line_474'>      Barbarians, the emperor carefully visited the fortifications</a>
<a id='line_475'>      along the Qhine from Cleves to Basil; surveyed, with peculiar</a>
<a id='line_476'>      attention, the territories which he had recovered from the hands</a>
<a id='line_477'>      of the Alemanni, passed through Besanon, 18 which had severely</a>
<a id='line_478'>      suffered from their fury, and fixed his headquarters at Vienna</a>
<a id='line_479'>      for the ensuing winter. The barrier of Gaul was improved and</a>
<a id='line_480'>      strengthened with additional fortifications; and Julian</a>
<a id='line_481'>      entertained some hopes that the Germans, whom he had so often</a>
<a id='line_482'>      vanquished, might, in his absence, be restrained by the terror of</a>
<a id='line_483'>      his name. Vadomair 19 was the only prince of the Alemanni whom he</a>
<a id='line_484'>      esteemed or feared and while the subtle Barbarian affected to</a>
<a id='line_485'>      observe the faith of treaties, the progress of his arms</a>
<a id='line_486'>      threatened the state with an unseasonable and dangerous war. The</a>
<a id='line_487'>      policy of Julian condescended to surprise the prince of the</a>
<a id='line_488'>      Alemanni by his own arts: and Vadomair, who, in the character of</a>
<a id='line_489'>      a friend, had incautiously accepted an invitation from the Roman</a>
<a id='line_490'>      governors, was seized in the midst of the entertainment, and sent</a>
<a id='line_491'>      away prisoner into the heart of Spain. Before the Barbarians were</a>
<a id='line_492'>      recovered from their amazement, the emperor appeared in arms on</a>
<a id='line_493'>      the banks of the Rhine, and, once more crossing the river,</a>

<a id='line_525'>      The ambassadors of Julian had been instructed to execute, with</a>
<a id='line_526'>      the utmost diligence, their important commission. But, in their</a>
<a id='line_527'>      passage through Italy and Illyricum, they were detained by the</a>
<a id='line_528'>      tedious and affected delays of the provincial governors; they</a>
<a id='line_529'>      were conducted by slow journeys from Constantinople to C¾sarea in</a>
<a id='line_530'>      Cappadocia; and when at length they were admitted to the presence</a>
<a id='line_531'>      of Constantius, they found that he had already conceived, from</a>
<a id='line_532'>      the despatches of his own officers, the most unfavorable opinion</a>
<a id='line_533'>      of the conduct of Julian, and of the Gallic army. The letters</a>
<a id='line_534'>      were heard with impatience; the trembling messengers were</a>
<a id='line_535'>      dismissed with indignation and contempt; and the looks, gestures,</a>
<a id='line_536'>      the furious language of the monarch, expressed the disorder of</a>
<a id='line_537'>      his soul. The domestic connection, which might have reconciled</a>
<a id='line_538'>      the brother and the husband of Helena, was recently dissolved by</a>
<a id='line_539'>      the death of that princess, whose pregnancy had been several</a>
<a id='line_540'>      times fruitless, and was at last fatal to herself. 21 The empress</a>
<a id='line_541'>      Eusebia had preserved, to the last moment of her life, the warm,</a>
<a id='line_542'>      and even jealous, affection which she had conceived for Julian;</a>
<a id='line_543'>      and her mild influence might have moderated the resentment of a</a>
<a id='line_544'>      prince, who, since her death, was abandoned to his own passions,</a>
<a id='line_545'>      and to the arts of his eunuchs. But the terror of a foreign</a>
<a id='line_546'>      invasion obliged him to suspend the punishment of a private</a>
<a id='line_547'>      enemy: he continued his march towards the confines of Persia, and</a>
<a id='line_548'>      thought it sufficient to signify the conditions which might</a>
<a id='line_549'>      entitle Julian and his guilty followers to the clemency of their</a>
<a id='line_550'>      offended sovereign. He required, that the presumptuous C¾sar</a>
<a id='line_551'>      should expressly renounce the appellation and rank of Augustus,</a>
<a id='line_552'>      which he had accepted from the rebels; that he should descend to</a>
<a id='line_553'>      his former station of a limited and dependent minister; that he</a>
<a id='line_554'>      should vest the powers of the state and army in the hands of</a>
<a id='line_555'>      those officers who were appointed by the Imperial court; and that</a>
<a id='line_556'>      he should trust his safety to the assurances of pardon, which</a>
<a id='line_557'>      were announced by Epictetus, a Gallic bishop, and one of the</a>
<a id='line_558'>      Arian favorites of Constantius. Several months were ineffectually</a>
<a id='line_559'>      consumed in a treaty which was negotiated at the distance of</a>
<a id='line_560'>      three thousand miles between Paris and Antioch; and, as soon as</a>
<a id='line_561'>      Julian perceived that his modest and respectful behavior served</a>
<a id='line_562'>      only to irritate the pride of an implacable adversary, he boldly</a>
<a id='line_563'>      resolved to commit his life and fortune to the chance of a civil</a>
<a id='line_564'>      war. He gave a public and military audience to the qu¾stor</a>
<a id='line_565'>      Leonas: the haughty epistle of Constantius was read to the</a>
<a id='line_566'>      attentive multitude; and Julian protested, with the most</a>
<a id='line_567'>      flattering deference, that he was ready to resign the title of</a>
<a id='line_568'>      Augustus, if he could obtain the consent of those whom he</a>
<a id='line_569'>      acknowledged as the authors of his elevation. The faint proposal</a>
<a id='line_570'>      was impetuously silenced; and the acclamations of ÒJulian</a>

<a id='line_573'>      from every part of the field, and terrified the pale ambassador</a>

<a id='line_579'></a>
<a id='line_580'>      ÒAn orphan!Ó interrupted Julian, who justified his cause by</a>
<a id='line_581'>      indulging his passions: Òdoes the assassin of my family reproach</a>

<a id='line_584'>      dismissed; and Leonas, who, with some difficulty, had been</a>
<a id='line_585'>      protected from the popular fury, was sent back to his master with</a>
<a id='line_586'>      an epistle, in which Julian expressed, in a strain of the most</a>
<a id='line_587'>      vehement eloquence, the sentiments of contempt, of hatred, and of</a>
<a id='line_588'>      resentment, which had been suppressed and imbittered by the</a>
<a id='line_589'>      dissimulation of twenty years. After this message, which might be</a>
<a id='line_590'>      considered as a signal of irreconcilable war, Julian, who, some</a>
<a id='line_591'>      weeks before, had celebrated the Christian festival of the</a>
<a id='line_592'>      Epiphany, 22 made a public declaration that he committed the care</a>

<a id='line_629'></a>
<a id='line_630'>      The situation of Julian required a vigorous and immediate</a>
<a id='line_631'>      resolution. He had discovered, from intercepted letters, that his</a>
<a id='line_632'>      adversary, sacrificing the interest of the state to that of the</a>
<a id='line_633'>      monarch, had again excited the Barbarians to invade the provinces</a>
<a id='line_634'>      of the West. The position of two magazines, one of them collected</a>
<a id='line_635'>      on the banks of the Lake of Constance, the other formed at the</a>
<a id='line_636'>      foot of the Cottian Alps, seemed to indicate the march of two</a>
<a id='line_637'>      armies; and the size of those magazines, each of which consisted</a>
<a id='line_638'>      of six hundred thousand quarters of wheat, or rather flour, 24</a>
<a id='line_639'>      was a threatening evidence of the strength and numbers of the</a>
<a id='line_640'>      enemy who prepared to surround him. But the Imperial legions were</a>
<a id='line_641'>      still in their distant quarters of Asia; the Danube was feebly</a>
<a id='line_642'>      guarded; and if Julian could occupy, by a sudden incursion, the</a>
<a id='line_643'>      important provinces of Illyricum, he might expect that a people</a>
<a id='line_644'>      of soldiers would resort to his standard, and that the rich mines</a>
<a id='line_645'>      of gold and silver would contribute to the expenses of the civil</a>
<a id='line_646'>      war. He proposed this bold enterprise to the assembly of the</a>
<a id='line_647'>      soldiers; inspired them with a just confidence in their general,</a>
<a id='line_648'>      and in themselves; and exhorted them to maintain their reputation</a>
<a id='line_649'>      of being terrible to the enemy, moderate to their</a>
<a id='line_650'>      fellow-citizens, and obedient to their officers. His spirited</a>
<a id='line_651'>      discourse was received with the loudest acclamations, and the</a>
<a id='line_652'>      same troops which had taken up arms against Constantius, when he</a>
<a id='line_653'>      summoned them to leave Gaul, now declared with alacrity, that</a>
<a id='line_654'>      they would follow Julian to the farthest extremities of Europe or</a>
<a id='line_655'>      Asia. The oath of fidelity was administered; and the soldiers,</a>
<a id='line_656'>      clashing their shields, and pointing their drawn swords to their</a>
<a id='line_657'>      throats, devoted themselves, with horrid imprecations, to the</a>
<a id='line_658'>      service of a leader whom they celebrated as the deliverer of Gaul</a>
<a id='line_659'>      and the conqueror of the Germans. 25 This solemn engagement,</a>
<a id='line_660'>      which seemed to be dictated by affection rather than by duty, was</a>
<a id='line_661'>      singly opposed by Nebridius, who had been admitted to the office</a>
<a id='line_662'>      of Pr¾torian pr¾fect. That faithful minister, alone and</a>
<a id='line_663'>      unassisted, asserted the rights of Constantius, in the midst of</a>
<a id='line_664'>      an armed and angry multitude, to whose fury he had almost fallen</a>
<a id='line_665'>      an honorable, but useless sacrifice. After losing one of his</a>
<a id='line_666'>      hands by the stroke of a sword, he embraced the knees of the</a>
<a id='line_667'>      prince whom he had offended. Julian covered the pr¾fect with his</a>
<a id='line_668'>      Imperial mantle, and, protecting him from the zeal of his</a>
<a id='line_669'>      followers, dismissed him to his own house, with less respect than</a>
<a id='line_670'>      was perhaps due to the virtue of an enemy. 26 The high office of</a>
<a id='line_671'>      Nebridius was bestowed on Sallust; and the provinces of Gaul,</a>
<a id='line_672'>      which were now delivered from the intolerable oppression of</a>
<a id='line_673'>      taxes, enjoyed the mild and equitable administration of the</a>

<a id='line_699'></a>
<a id='line_700'>      The hopes of Julian depended much less on the number of his</a>
<a id='line_701'>      troops, than on the celerity of his motions. In the execution of</a>
<a id='line_702'>      a daring enterprise, he availed himself of every precaution, as</a>
<a id='line_703'>      far as prudence could suggest; and where prudence could no longer</a>
<a id='line_704'>      accompany his steps, he trusted the event to valor and to</a>
<a id='line_705'>      fortune. In the neighborhood of Basil he assembled and divided</a>
<a id='line_706'>      his army. 28 One body, which consisted of ten thousand men, was</a>
<a id='line_707'>      directed under the command of Nevitta, general of the cavalry, to</a>
<a id='line_708'>      advance through the midland parts of Rh¾tia and Noricum. A</a>
<a id='line_709'>      similar division of troops, under the orders of Jovius and</a>
<a id='line_710'>      Jovinus, prepared to follow the oblique course of the highways,</a>
<a id='line_711'>      through the Alps, and the northern confines of Italy. The</a>
<a id='line_712'>      instructions to the generals were conceived with energy and</a>
<a id='line_713'>      precision: to hasten their march in close and compact columns,</a>
<a id='line_714'>      which, according to the disposition of the ground, might readily</a>
<a id='line_715'>      be changed into any order of battle; to secure themselves against</a>
<a id='line_716'>      the surprises of the night by strong posts and vigilant guards;</a>
<a id='line_717'>      to prevent resistance by their unexpected arrival; to elude</a>
<a id='line_718'>      examination by their sudden departure; to spread the opinion of</a>
<a id='line_719'>      their strength, and the terror of his name; and to join their</a>
<a id='line_720'>      sovereign under the walls of Sirmium. For himself Julian had</a>
<a id='line_721'>      reserved a more difficult and extraordinary part. He selected</a>
<a id='line_722'>      three thousand brave and active volunteers, resolved, like their</a>
<a id='line_723'>      leader, to cast behind them every hope of a retreat; at the head</a>
<a id='line_724'>      of this faithful band, he fearlessly plunged into the recesses of</a>
<a id='line_725'>      the Marcian, or Black Forest, which conceals the sources of the</a>
<a id='line_726'>      Danube; 29 and, for many days, the fate of Julian was unknown to</a>
<a id='line_727'>      the world. The secrecy of his march, his diligence, and vigor,</a>
<a id='line_728'>      surmounted every obstacle; he forced his way over mountains and</a>
<a id='line_729'>      morasses, occupied the bridges or swam the rivers, pursued his</a>
<a id='line_730'>      direct course, 30 without reflecting whether he traversed the</a>
<a id='line_731'>      territory of the Romans or of the Barbarians, and at length</a>
<a id='line_732'>      emerged, between Ratisbon and Vienna, at the place where he</a>
<a id='line_733'>      designed to embark his troops on the Danube. By a well-concerted</a>
<a id='line_734'>      stratagem, he seized a fleet of light brigantines, 31 as it lay</a>
<a id='line_735'>      at anchor; secured a apply of coarse provisions sufficient to</a>
<a id='line_736'>      satisfy the indelicate, and voracious, appetite of a Gallic army;</a>
<a id='line_737'>      and boldly committed himself to the stream of the Danube. The</a>
<a id='line_738'>      labors of the mariners, who plied their oars with incessant</a>
<a id='line_739'>      diligence, and the steady continuance of a favorable wind,</a>
<a id='line_740'>      carried his fleet above seven hundred miles in eleven days; 32</a>
<a id='line_741'>      and he had already disembarked his troops at Bononia, 3211 only</a>
<a id='line_742'>      nineteen miles from Sirmium, before his enemies could receive any</a>
<a id='line_743'>      certain intelligence that he had left the banks of the Rhine. In</a>
<a id='line_744'>      the course of this long and rapid navigation, the mind of Julian</a>
<a id='line_745'>      was fixed on the object of his enterprise; and though he accepted</a>
<a id='line_746'>      the deputations of some cities, which hastened to claim the merit</a>
<a id='line_747'>      of an early submission, he passed before the hostile stations,</a>
<a id='line_748'>      which were placed along the river, without indulging the</a>
<a id='line_749'>      temptation of signalizing a useless and ill-timed valor. The</a>
<a id='line_750'>      banks of the Danube were crowded on either side with spectators,</a>
<a id='line_751'>      who gazed on the military pomp, anticipated the importance of the</a>
<a id='line_752'>      event, and diffused through the adjacent country the fame of a</a>

<a id='line_755'>      rank of general of the cavalry, commanded the military powers of</a>
<a id='line_756'>      Illyricum, was alarmed and perplexed by the doubtful reports,</a>
<a id='line_757'>      which he could neither reject nor believe. He had taken some slow</a>
<a id='line_758'>      and irresolute measures for the purpose of collecting his troops,</a>
<a id='line_759'>      when he was surprised by Dagalaiphus, an active officer, whom</a>
<a id='line_760'>      Julian, as soon as he landed at Bononia, had pushed forwards with</a>
<a id='line_761'>      some light infantry. The captive general, uncertain of his life</a>
<a id='line_762'>      or death, was hastily thrown upon a horse, and conducted to the</a>
<a id='line_763'>      presence of Julian; who kindly raised him from the ground, and</a>
<a id='line_764'>      dispelled the terror and amazement which seemed to stupefy his</a>
<a id='line_765'>      faculties. But Lucilian had no sooner recovered his spirits, than</a>
<a id='line_766'>      he betrayed his want of discretion, by presuming to admonish his</a>
<a id='line_767'>      conqueror that he had rashly ventured, with a handful of men, to</a>
<a id='line_768'>      expose his person in the midst of his enemies. ÒReserve for your</a>
<a id='line_769'>      master Constantius these timid remonstrances,Ó replied Julian,</a>
<a id='line_770'>      with a smile of contempt: Òwhen I gave you my purple to kiss, I</a>
<a id='line_771'>      received you not as a counsellor, but as a suppliant.Ó Conscious</a>
<a id='line_772'>      that success alone could justify his attempt, and that boldness</a>
<a id='line_773'>      only could command success, he instantly advanced, at the head of</a>
<a id='line_774'>      three thousand soldiers, to attack the strongest and most</a>
<a id='line_775'>      populous city of the Illyrian provinces. As he entered the long</a>
<a id='line_776'>      suburb of Sirmium, he was received by the joyful acclamations of</a>
<a id='line_777'>      the army and people; who, crowned with flowers, and holding</a>
<a id='line_778'>      lighted tapers in their hands, conducted their acknowledged</a>
<a id='line_779'>      sovereign to his Imperial residence. Two days were devoted to the</a>
<a id='line_780'>      public joy, which was celebrated by the games of the circus; but,</a>
<a id='line_781'>      early on the morning of the third day, Julian marched to occupy</a>
<a id='line_782'>      the narrow pass of Succi, in the defiles of Mount H¾mus; which,</a>
<a id='line_783'>      almost in the midway between Sirmium and Constantinople,</a>

<a id='line_785'>      towards the former, and a gentle declivity on the side of the</a>
<a id='line_786'>      latter. 33 The defence of this important post was intrusted to</a>
<a id='line_787'>      the brave Nevitta; who, as well as the generals of the Italian</a>

<a id='line_839'>      were administered by Taurus and Florentius, who united that</a>

<a id='line_844'>      the Year, the epithet of _fugitive_ to the names of the two</a>
<a id='line_845'>      consuls. The provinces which had been deserted by their first</a>

<a id='line_847'>      conciliating the qualities of a soldier with those of a</a>
<a id='line_848'>      philosopher, was equally admired in the camps of the Danube and</a>
<a id='line_849'>      in the cities of Greece. From his palace, or, more properly, from</a>
<a id='line_850'>      his head-quarters of Sirmium and Naissus, he distributed to the</a>
<a id='line_851'>      principal cities of the empire, a labored apology for his own</a>

<a id='line_854'>      one of whom had expelled, and the other had invited, the</a>
<a id='line_855'>      Barbarians. 36 Julian, whose mind was deeply wounded by the</a>
<a id='line_856'>      reproach of ingratitude, aspired to maintain, by argument as well</a>
<a id='line_857'>      as by arms, the superior merits of his cause; and to excel, not</a>
<a id='line_858'>      only in the arts of war, but in those of composition. His epistle</a>
<a id='line_859'>      to the senate and people of Athens 37 seems to have been dictated</a>
<a id='line_860'>      by an elegant enthusiasm; which prompted him to submit his</a>

<a id='line_864'>      His application to the senate of Rome, which was still permitted</a>

<a id='line_910'>      chase to Julian; for he never spoke of his military expedition in</a>

<a id='line_929'>      was increased by an unexpected event, which might have been</a>
<a id='line_930'>      productive of fatal consequences. Julian had received the</a>
<a id='line_931'>      submission of two legions and a cohort of archers, who were</a>
<a id='line_932'>      stationed at Sirmium; but he suspected, with reason, the fidelity</a>
<a id='line_933'>      of those troops which had been distinguished by the emperor; and</a>
<a id='line_934'>      it was thought expedient, under the pretence of the exposed state</a>
<a id='line_935'>      of the Gallic frontier, to dismiss them from the most important</a>
<a id='line_936'>      scene of action. They advanced, with reluctance, as far as the</a>
<a id='line_937'>      confines of Italy; but as they dreaded the length of the way, and</a>
<a id='line_938'>      the savage fierceness of the Germans, they resolved, by the</a>
<a id='line_939'>      instigation of one of their tribunes, to halt at Aquileia, and to</a>
<a id='line_940'>      erect the banners of Constantius on the walls of that impregnable</a>

<a id='line_1006'>      he advanced from Naissus through the mountains of H¾mus, and the</a>
<a id='line_1007'>      cities of Thrace. When he reached Heraclea, at the distance of</a>
<a id='line_1008'>      sixty miles, all Constantinople was poured forth to receive him;</a>
<a id='line_1009'>      and he made his triumphal entry amidst the dutiful acclamations</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      of the soldiers, the people, and the senate. An innumerable</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      multitude pressed around him with eager respect and were perhaps</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      disappointed when they beheld the small stature and simple garb</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      of a hero, whose unexperienced youth had vanquished the</a>
<a id='line_1014'>      Barbarians of Germany, and who had now traversed, in a successful</a>
<a id='line_1015'>      career, the whole continent of Europe, from the shores of the</a>
<a id='line_1016'>      Atlantic to those of the Bosphorus. 43 A few days afterwards,</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      when the remains of the deceased emperor were landed in the</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      harbor, the subjects of Julian applauded the real or affected</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      humanity of their sovereign. On foot, without his diadem, and</a>
<a id='line_1020'>      clothed in a mourning habit, he accompanied the funeral as far as</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      the church of the Holy Apostles, where the body was deposited:</a>
<a id='line_1022'>      and if these marks of respect may be interpreted as a selfish</a>

<a id='line_1024'>      tears of Julian professed to the world that he had forgot the</a>
<a id='line_1025'>      injuries, and remembered only the obligations, which he had</a>
<a id='line_1026'>      received from Constantius. 44 As soon as the legions of Aquileia</a>
<a id='line_1027'>      were assured of the death of the emperor, they opened the gates</a>
<a id='line_1028'>      of the city, and, by the sacrifice of their guilty leaders,</a>
<a id='line_1029'>      obtained an easy pardon from the prudence or lenity of Julian;</a>

<a id='line_1071'>      Philosophy had instructed Julian to compare the advantages of</a>
<a id='line_1072'>      action and retirement; but the elevation of his birth, and the</a>
<a id='line_1073'>      accidents of his life, never allowed him the freedom of choice.</a>
<a id='line_1074'>      He might perhaps sincerely have preferred the groves of the</a>

<a id='line_1077'>      Constantius, to expose his person and fame to the dangers of</a>
<a id='line_1078'>      Imperial greatness; and to make himself accountable to the world,</a>
<a id='line_1079'>      and to posterity, for the happiness of millions. 46 Julian</a>
<a id='line_1080'>      recollected with terror the observation of his master Plato, 47</a>
<a id='line_1081'>      that the government of our flocks and herds is always committed</a>

<a id='line_1083'>      requires and deserves the celestial powers of the gods or of the</a>
<a id='line_1084'>      genii. From this principle he justly concluded, that the man who</a>
<a id='line_1085'>      presumes to reign, should aspire to the perfection of the divine</a>
<a id='line_1086'>      nature; that he should purify his soul from her mortal and</a>
<a id='line_1087'>      terrestrial part; that he should extinguish his appetites,</a>
<a id='line_1088'>      enlighten his understanding, regulate his passions, and subdue</a>
<a id='line_1089'>      the wild beast, which, according to the lively metaphor of</a>
<a id='line_1090'>      Aristotle, 48 seldom fails to ascend the throne of a despot. The</a>
<a id='line_1091'>      throne of Julian, which the death of Constantius fixed on an</a>
<a id='line_1092'>      independent basis, was the seat of reason, of virtue, and perhaps</a>
<a id='line_1093'>      of vanity. He despised the honors, renounced the pleasures, and</a>
<a id='line_1094'>      discharged with incessant diligence the duties, of his exalted</a>
<a id='line_1095'>      station; and there were few among his subjects who would have</a>
<a id='line_1096'>      consented to relieve him from the weight of the diadem, had they</a>
<a id='line_1097'>      been obliged to submit their time and their actions to the</a>
<a id='line_1098'>      rigorous laws which that philosophic emperor imposed on himself.</a>
<a id='line_1099'>      One of his most intimate friends, 49 who had often shared the</a>
<a id='line_1100'>      frugal simplicity of his table, has remarked, that his light and</a>
<a id='line_1101'>      sparing diet (which was usually of the vegetable kind) left his</a>
<a id='line_1102'>      mind and body always free and active, for the various and</a>
<a id='line_1103'>      important business of an author, a pontiff, a magistrate, a</a>
<a id='line_1104'>      general, and a prince. In one and the same day, he gave audience</a>
<a id='line_1105'>      to several ambassadors, and wrote, or dictated, a great number of</a>
<a id='line_1106'>      letters to his generals, his civil magistrates, his private</a>
<a id='line_1107'>      friends, and the different cities of his dominions. He listened</a>
<a id='line_1108'>      to the memorials which had been received, considered the subject</a>
<a id='line_1109'>      of the petitions, and signified his intentions more rapidly than</a>
<a id='line_1110'>      they could be taken in short-hand by the diligence of his</a>
<a id='line_1111'>      secretaries. He possessed such flexibility of thought, and such</a>
<a id='line_1112'>      firmness of attention, that he could employ his hand to write,</a>
<a id='line_1113'>      his ear to listen, and his voice to dictate; and pursue at once</a>
<a id='line_1114'>      three several trains of ideas without hesitation, and without</a>
<a id='line_1115'>      error. While his ministers reposed, the prince flew with agility</a>
<a id='line_1116'>      from one labor to another, and, after a hasty dinner, retired</a>
<a id='line_1117'>      into his library, till the public business, which he had</a>
<a id='line_1118'>      appointed for the evening, summoned him to interrupt the</a>
<a id='line_1119'>      prosecution of his studies. The supper of the emperor was still</a>
<a id='line_1120'>      less substantial than the former meal; his sleep was never</a>
<a id='line_1121'>      clouded by the fumes of indigestion; and except in the short</a>
<a id='line_1122'>      interval of a marriage, which was the effect of policy rather</a>
<a id='line_1123'>      than love, the chaste Julian never shared his bed with a female</a>
<a id='line_1124'>      companion. 50 He was soon awakened by the entrance of fresh</a>
<a id='line_1125'>      secretaries, who had slept the preceding day; and his servants</a>
<a id='line_1126'>      were obliged to wait alternately while their indefatigable master</a>
<a id='line_1127'>      allowed himself scarcely any other refreshment than the change of</a>
<a id='line_1128'>      occupation. The predecessors of Julian, his uncle, his brother,</a>
<a id='line_1129'>      and his cousin, indulged their puerile taste for the games of the</a>
<a id='line_1130'>      Circus, under the specious pretence of complying with the</a>
<a id='line_1131'>      inclinations of the people; and they frequently remained the</a>
<a id='line_1132'>      greatest part of the day as idle spectators, and as a part of the</a>
<a id='line_1133'>      splendid spectacle, till the ordinary round of twenty-four races</a>
<a id='line_1134'>      51 was completely finished. On solemn festivals, Julian, who felt</a>
<a id='line_1135'>      and professed an unfashionable dislike to these frivolous</a>
<a id='line_1136'>      amusements, condescended to appear in the Circus; and after</a>
<a id='line_1137'>      bestowing a careless glance at five or six of the races, he</a>
<a id='line_1138'>      hastily withdrew with the impatience of a philosopher, who</a>
<a id='line_1139'>      considered every moment as lost that was not devoted to the</a>
<a id='line_1140'>      advantage of the public or the improvement of his own mind. 52 By</a>
<a id='line_1141'>      this avarice of time, he seemed to protract the short duration of</a>
<a id='line_1142'>      his reign; and if the dates were less securely ascertained, we</a>
<a id='line_1143'>      should refuse to believe, that only sixteen months elapsed</a>
<a id='line_1144'>      between the death of Constantius and the departure of his</a>

<a id='line_1225'>      were decorated with many colored marbles, and ornaments of massy</a>

<a id='line_1243'>      could be equalled only by the extravagance of their dissipations.</a>

<a id='line_1518'>      Julian was not insensible of the advantages of freedom. 70 From</a>
<a id='line_1519'>      his studies he had imbibed the spirit of ancient sages and</a>
<a id='line_1520'>      heroes; his life and fortunes had depended on the caprice of a</a>
<a id='line_1521'>      tyrant; and when he ascended the throne, his pride was sometimes</a>
<a id='line_1522'>      mortified by the reflection, that the slaves who would not dare</a>

<a id='line_1527'>      prevented the execution of the design, which Julian had</a>
<a id='line_1528'>      frequently meditated, of relieving his head from the weight of a</a>
<a id='line_1529'>      costly diadem; 72 but he absolutely refused the title of</a>
<a id='line_1530'>      _Dominus_, or _Lord_, 73 a word which was grown so familiar to</a>
<a id='line_1531'>      the ears of the Romans, that they no longer remembered its</a>
<a id='line_1532'>      servile and humiliating origin. The office, or rather the name,</a>
<a id='line_1533'>      of consul, was cherished by a prince who contemplated with</a>
<a id='line_1534'>      reverence the ruins of the republic; and the same behavior which</a>
<a id='line_1535'>      had been assumed by the prudence of Augustus was adopted by</a>
<a id='line_1536'>      Julian from choice and inclination. On the calends of January, at</a>
<a id='line_1537'>      break of day, the new consuls, Mamertinus and Nevitta, hastened</a>
<a id='line_1538'>      to the palace to salute the emperor. As soon as he was informed</a>
<a id='line_1539'>      of their approach, he leaped from his throne, eagerly advanced to</a>
<a id='line_1540'>      meet them, and compelled the blushing magistrates to receive the</a>
<a id='line_1541'>      demonstrations of his affected humility. From the palace they</a>
<a id='line_1542'>      proceeded to the senate. The emperor, on foot, marched before</a>
<a id='line_1543'>      their litters; and the gazing multitude admired the image of</a>
<a id='line_1544'>      ancient times, or secretly blamed a conduct, which, in their</a>
<a id='line_1545'>      eyes, degraded the majesty of the purple. 74 But the behavior of</a>
<a id='line_1546'>      Julian was uniformly supported. During the games of the Circus,</a>
<a id='line_1547'>      he had, imprudently or designedly, performed the manumission of a</a>
<a id='line_1548'>      slave in the presence of the consul. The moment he was reminded</a>
<a id='line_1549'>      that he had trespassed on the jurisdiction of _another_</a>
<a id='line_1550'>      magistrate, he condemned himself to pay a fine of ten pounds of</a>
<a id='line_1551'>      gold; and embraced this public occasion of declaring to the</a>
<a id='line_1552'>      world, that he was subject, like the rest of his fellow-citizens,</a>
<a id='line_1553'>      to the laws, 75 and even to the forms, of the republic. The</a>
<a id='line_1554'>      spirit of his administration, and his regard for the place of his</a>
<a id='line_1555'>      nativity, induced Julian to confer on the senate of</a>
<a id='line_1556'>      Constantinople the same honors, privileges, and authority, which</a>
<a id='line_1557'>      were still enjoyed by the senate of ancient Rome. 76 A legal</a>
<a id='line_1558'>      fiction was introduced, and gradually established, that one half</a>
<a id='line_1559'>      of the national council had migrated into the East; and the</a>
<a id='line_1560'>      despotic successors of Julian, accepting the title of Senators,</a>
<a id='line_1561'>      acknowledged themselves the members of a respectable body, which</a>
<a id='line_1562'>      was permitted to represent the majesty of the Roman name. From</a>
<a id='line_1563'>      Constantinople, the attention of the monarch was extended to the</a>
<a id='line_1564'>      municipal senates of the provinces. He abolished, by repeated</a>
<a id='line_1565'>      edicts, the unjust and pernicious exemptions which had withdrawn</a>
<a id='line_1566'>      so many idle citizens from the services of their country; and by</a>
<a id='line_1567'>      imposing an equal distribution of public duties, he restored the</a>
<a id='line_1568'>      strength, the splendor, or, according to the glowing expression</a>
<a id='line_1569'>      of Libanius, 77 the soul of the expiring cities of his empire.</a>
<a id='line_1570'>      The venerable age of Greece excited the most tender compassion in</a>
<a id='line_1571'>      the mind of Julian, which kindled into rapture when he</a>
<a id='line_1572'>      recollected the gods, the heroes, and the men superior to heroes</a>
<a id='line_1573'>      and to gods, who have bequeathed to the latest posterity the</a>
<a id='line_1574'>      monuments of their genius, or the example of their virtues. He</a>
<a id='line_1575'>      relieved the distress, and restored the beauty, of the cities of</a>
<a id='line_1576'>      Epirus and Peloponnesus. 78 Athens acknowledged him for her</a>
<a id='line_1577'>      benefactor; Argos, for her deliverer. The pride of Corinth, again</a>
<a id='line_1578'>      rising from her ruins with the honors of a Roman colony, exacted</a>
<a id='line_1579'>      a tribute from the adjacent republics, for the purpose of</a>
<a id='line_1580'>      defraying the games of the Isthmus, which were celebrated in the</a>
<a id='line_1581'>      amphitheatre with the hunting of bears and panthers. From this</a>
<a id='line_1582'>      tribute the cities of Elis, of Delphi, and of Argos, which had</a>
<a id='line_1583'>      inherited from their remote ancestors the sacred office of</a>
<a id='line_1584'>      perpetuating the Olympic, the Pythian, and the Nemean games,</a>
<a id='line_1585'>      claimed a just exemption. The immunity of Elis and Delphi was</a>
<a id='line_1586'>      respected by the Corinthians; but the poverty of Argos tempted</a>
<a id='line_1587'>      the insolence of oppression; and the feeble complaints of its</a>
<a id='line_1588'>      deputies were silenced by the decree of a provincial magistrate,</a>
<a id='line_1589'>      who seems to have consulted only the interest of the capital in</a>

<a id='line_1591'>      allowed the cause to be referred to a superior tribunal; and his</a>
<a id='line_1592'>      eloquence was interposed, most probably with success, in the</a>

<a id='line_1688'>      amusement; and although he might have trusted the integrity and</a>
<a id='line_1689'>      discernment of his Pr¾torian pr¾fects, he often placed himself by</a>
<a id='line_1690'>      their side on the seat of judgment. The acute penetration of his</a>

<a id='line_1738'>      these laws to give an idea of JulianÕs Latin style, which is</a>
<a id='line_1739'>      forcible and elaborate, but less pure than his Greek.]</a>
<a id='line_1740'></a>
<a id='line_1741'>      The generality of princes, if they were stripped of their purple,</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      and cast naked into the world, would immediately sink to the</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      lowest rank of society, without a hope of emerging from their</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      obscurity. But the personal merit of Julian was, in some measure,</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      independent of his fortune. Whatever had been his choice of life,</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      by the force of intrepid courage, lively wit, and intense</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      application, he would have obtained, or at least he would have</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      deserved, the highest honors of his profession; and Julian might</a>
<a id='line_1749'>      have raised himself to the rank of minister, or general, of the</a>
<a id='line_1750'>      state in which he was born a private citizen. If the jealous</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      caprice of power had disappointed his expectations, if he had</a>
<a id='line_1752'>      prudently declined the paths of greatness, the employment of the</a>
<a id='line_1753'>      same talents in studious solitude would have placed beyond the</a>
<a id='line_1754'>      reach of kings his present happiness and his immortal fame. When</a>
<a id='line_1755'>      we inspect, with minute, or perhaps malevolent attention, the</a>
<a id='line_1756'>      portrait of Julian, something seems wanting to the grace and</a>
<a id='line_1757'>      perfection of the whole figure. His genius was less powerful and</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      sublime than that of C¾sar; nor did he possess the consummate</a>
<a id='line_1759'>      prudence of Augustus. The virtues of Trajan appear more steady</a>
<a id='line_1760'>      and natural, and the philosophy of Marcus is more simple and</a>
<a id='line_1761'>      consistent. Yet Julian sustained adversity with firmness, and</a>
<a id='line_1762'>      prosperity with moderation. After an interval of one hundred and</a>
<a id='line_1763'>      twenty years from the death of Alexander Severus, the Romans</a>
<a id='line_1764'>      beheld an emperor who made no distinction between his duties and</a>
<a id='line_1765'>      his pleasures; who labored to relieve the distress, and to revive</a>
<a id='line_1766'>      the spirit, of his subjects; and who endeavored always to connect</a>
<a id='line_1767'>      authority with merit, and happiness with virtue. Even faction,</a>
<a id='line_1768'>      and religious faction, was constrained to acknowledge the</a>
<a id='line_1769'>      superiority of his genius, in peace as well as in war, and to</a>
<a id='line_1770'>      confess, with a sigh, that the apostate Julian was a lover of his</a>
<a id='line_1771'>      country, and that he deserved the empire of the world. 85</a>
