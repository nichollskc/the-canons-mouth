<a id='line_44'></a>
<a id='line_45'>Enter POET, PAINTER, JEWELLER, MERCHANT, and MERCER, at several doors</a>
<a id='line_46'></a>
<a id='line_47'>  POET. Good day, sir.</a>
<a id='line_48'>  PAINTER. I am glad y'are well.</a>
<a id='line_49'>  POET. I have not seen you long; how goes the world?</a>
<a id='line_50'>  PAINTER. It wears, sir, as it grows.</a>
<a id='line_51'>  POET. Ay, that's well known.</a>
<a id='line_52'>    But what particular rarity? What strange,</a>
<a id='line_53'>    Which manifold record not matches? See,</a>
<a id='line_54'>    Magic of bounty, all these spirits thy power</a>
<a id='line_55'>    Hath conjur'd to attend! I know the merchant.</a>
<a id='line_56'>  PAINTER. I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.</a>
<a id='line_57'>  MERCHANT. O, 'tis a worthy lord!</a>
<a id='line_58'>  JEWELLER. Nay, that's most fix'd.</a>
<a id='line_59'>  MERCHANT. A most incomparable man; breath'd, as it were,</a>
<a id='line_60'>    To an untirable and continuate goodness.</a>
<a id='line_61'>    He passes.</a>
<a id='line_62'>  JEWELLER. I have a jewel here-</a>
<a id='line_63'>  MERCHANT. O, pray let's see't. For the Lord Timon, sir?</a>
<a id='line_64'>  JEWELLER. If he will touch the estimate. But for that-</a>
<a id='line_65'>  POET. When we for recompense have prais'd the vile,</a>
<a id='line_66'>    It stains the glory in that happy verse</a>
<a id='line_67'>    Which aptly sings the good.</a>
<a id='line_68'>  MERCHANT. [Looking at the jewel] 'Tis a good form.</a>
<a id='line_69'>  JEWELLER. And rich. Here is a water, look ye.</a>
<a id='line_70'>  PAINTER. You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication</a>
<a id='line_71'>    To the great lord.</a>
<a id='line_72'>  POET. A thing slipp'd idly from me.</a>
<a id='line_73'>    Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes</a>
<a id='line_74'>    From whence 'tis nourish'd. The fire i' th' flint</a>
<a id='line_75'>    Shows not till it be struck: our gentle flame</a>
<a id='line_76'>    Provokes itself, and like the current flies</a>
<a id='line_77'>    Each bound it chafes. What have you there?</a>
<a id='line_78'>  PAINTER. A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?</a>
<a id='line_79'>  POET. Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.</a>
<a id='line_80'>    Let's see your piece.</a>
<a id='line_81'>  PAINTER. 'Tis a good piece.</a>
<a id='line_82'>  POET. So 'tis; this comes off well and excellent.</a>
<a id='line_83'>  PAINTER. Indifferent.</a>
<a id='line_84'>  POET. Admirable. How this grace</a>
<a id='line_85'>    Speaks his own standing! What a mental power</a>
<a id='line_86'>    This eye shoots forth! How big imagination</a>
<a id='line_87'>    Moves in this lip! To th' dumbness of the gesture</a>
<a id='line_88'>    One might interpret.</a>
<a id='line_89'>  PAINTER. It is a pretty mocking of the life.</a>
<a id='line_90'>    Here is a touch; is't good?</a>
<a id='line_91'>  POET. I will say of it</a>
<a id='line_92'>    It tutors nature. Artificial strife</a>
<a id='line_93'>    Lives in these touches, livelier than life.</a>
<a id='line_94'></a>
<a id='line_95'>              Enter certain SENATORS, and pass over</a>
<a id='line_96'></a>
<a id='line_97'>  PAINTER. How this lord is followed!</a>
<a id='line_98'>  POET. The senators of Athens- happy man!</a>
<a id='line_99'>  PAINTER. Look, moe!</a>
<a id='line_100'>  POET. You see this confluence, this great flood of visitors.</a>
<a id='line_101'>    I have in this rough work shap'd out a man</a>
<a id='line_102'>    Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug</a>
<a id='line_103'>    With amplest entertainment. My free drift</a>
<a id='line_104'>    Halts not particularly, but moves itself</a>
<a id='line_105'>    In a wide sea of tax. No levell'd malice</a>
<a id='line_106'>    Infects one comma in the course I hold,</a>
<a id='line_107'>    But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,</a>
<a id='line_108'>    Leaving no tract behind.</a>
<a id='line_109'>  PAINTER. How shall I understand you?</a>
<a id='line_110'>  POET. I will unbolt to you.</a>
<a id='line_111'>    You see how all conditions, how all minds-</a>
<a id='line_112'>    As well of glib and slipp'ry creatures as</a>
<a id='line_113'>    Of grave and austere quality, tender down</a>
<a id='line_114'>    Their services to Lord Timon. His large fortune,</a>
<a id='line_115'>    Upon his good and gracious nature hanging,</a>
<a id='line_116'>    Subdues and properties to his love and tendance</a>
<a id='line_117'>    All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-fac'd flatterer</a>
<a id='line_118'>    To Apemantus, that few things loves better</a>
<a id='line_119'>    Than to abhor himself; even he drops down</a>
<a id='line_120'>    The knee before him, and returns in peace</a>
<a id='line_121'>    Most rich in Timon's nod.</a>
<a id='line_122'>  PAINTER. I saw them speak together.</a>
<a id='line_123'>  POET. Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill</a>
<a id='line_124'>    Feign'd Fortune to be thron'd. The base o' th' mount</a>
<a id='line_125'>    Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures</a>
<a id='line_126'>    That labour on the bosom of this sphere</a>
<a id='line_127'>    To propagate their states. Amongst them all</a>
<a id='line_128'>    Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd</a>
<a id='line_129'>    One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,</a>
<a id='line_130'>    Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;</a>
<a id='line_131'>    Whose present grace to present slaves and servants</a>
<a id='line_132'>    Translates his rivals.</a>
<a id='line_133'>  PAINTER. 'Tis conceiv'd to scope.</a>
<a id='line_134'>    This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,</a>
<a id='line_135'>    With one man beckon'd from the rest below,</a>
<a id='line_136'>    Bowing his head against the steepy mount</a>
<a id='line_137'>    To climb his happiness, would be well express'd</a>
<a id='line_138'>    In our condition.</a>
<a id='line_139'>  POET. Nay, sir, but hear me on.</a>
<a id='line_140'>    All those which were his fellows but of late-</a>
<a id='line_141'>    Some better than his value- on the moment</a>
<a id='line_142'>    Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,</a>
<a id='line_143'>    Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,</a>
<a id='line_144'>    Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him</a>
<a id='line_145'>    Drink the free air.</a>
<a id='line_146'>  PAINTER. Ay, marry, what of these?</a>
<a id='line_147'>  POET. When Fortune in her shift and change of mood</a>
<a id='line_148'>    Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants,</a>
<a id='line_149'>    Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top</a>
<a id='line_150'>    Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,</a>
<a id='line_151'>    Not one accompanying his declining foot.</a>
<a id='line_152'>  PAINTER. 'Tis common.</a>
<a id='line_153'>    A thousand moral paintings I can show</a>
<a id='line_154'>    That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's</a>
<a id='line_155'>    More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well</a>
<a id='line_156'>    To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen</a>
<a id='line_157'>    The foot above the head.</a>
<a id='line_158'></a>
<a id='line_159'>         Trumpets sound. Enter TIMON, addressing himself</a>
<a id='line_160'>          courteously to every suitor, a MESSENGER from</a>
<a id='line_161'>         VENTIDIUS talking with him; LUCILIUS and other</a>
<a id='line_162'>                       servants following</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>  TIMON. Imprison'd is he, say you?</a>
<a id='line_165'>  MESSENGER. Ay, my good lord. Five talents is his debt;</a>
<a id='line_166'>    His means most short, his creditors most strait.</a>
<a id='line_167'>    Your honourable letter he desires</a>
<a id='line_168'>    To those have shut him up; which failing,</a>
<a id='line_169'>    Periods his comfort.</a>
<a id='line_170'>  TIMON. Noble Ventidius! Well.</a>
<a id='line_171'>    I am not of that feather to shake of</a>
<a id='line_172'>    My friend when he must need me. I do know him</a>
<a id='line_173'>    A gentleman that well deserves a help,</a>
<a id='line_174'>    Which he shall have. I'll pay the debt, and free him.</a>
<a id='line_175'>  MESSENGER. Your lordship ever binds him.</a>
<a id='line_176'>  TIMON. Commend me to him; I will send his ransom;</a>
<a id='line_177'>    And being enfranchis'd, bid him come to me.</a>
<a id='line_178'>    'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,</a>
<a id='line_179'>    But to support him after. Fare you well.</a>
<a id='line_180'>  MESSENGER. All happiness to your honour!                  Exit</a>
<a id='line_181'></a>
<a id='line_182'>                      Enter an OLD ATHENIAN</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>  OLD ATHENIAN. Lord Timon, hear me speak.</a>
<a id='line_185'>  TIMON. Freely, good father.</a>
<a id='line_186'>  OLD ATHENIAN. Thou hast a servant nam'd Lucilius.</a>
<a id='line_187'>  TIMON. I have so; what of him?</a>
<a id='line_188'>  OLD ATHENIAN. Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.</a>
<a id='line_189'>  TIMON. Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!</a>
<a id='line_190'>  LUCILIUS. Here, at your lordship's service.</a>
<a id='line_191'>  OLD ATHENIAN. This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,</a>
<a id='line_192'>    By night frequents my house. I am a man</a>
<a id='line_193'>    That from my first have been inclin'd to thrift,</a>
<a id='line_194'>    And my estate deserves an heir more rais'd</a>
<a id='line_195'>    Than one which holds a trencher.</a>
<a id='line_196'>  TIMON. Well; what further?</a>
<a id='line_197'>  OLD ATHENIAN. One only daughter have I, no kin else,</a>
<a id='line_198'>    On whom I may confer what I have got.</a>
<a id='line_199'>    The maid is fair, o' th' youngest for a bride,</a>
<a id='line_200'>    And I have bred her at my dearest cost</a>
<a id='line_201'>    In qualities of the best. This man of thine</a>
<a id='line_202'>    Attempts her love; I prithee, noble lord,</a>
<a id='line_203'>    Join with me to forbid him her resort;</a>
<a id='line_204'>    Myself have spoke in vain.</a>
<a id='line_205'>  TIMON. The man is honest.</a>
<a id='line_206'>  OLD ATHENIAN. Therefore he will be, Timon.</a>
<a id='line_207'>    His honesty rewards him in itself;</a>
<a id='line_208'>    It must not bear my daughter.</a>
<a id='line_209'>  TIMON. Does she love him?</a>
<a id='line_210'>  OLD ATHENIAN. She is young and apt:</a>
<a id='line_211'>    Our own precedent passions do instruct us</a>
<a id='line_212'>    What levity's in youth.</a>
<a id='line_213'>  TIMON. Love you the maid?</a>
<a id='line_214'>  LUCILIUS. Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.</a>
<a id='line_215'>  OLD ATHENIAN. If in her marriage my consent be missing,</a>
<a id='line_216'>    I call the gods to witness I will choose</a>
<a id='line_217'>    Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,</a>
<a id='line_218'>    And dispossess her all.</a>
<a id='line_219'>  TIMON. How shall she be endow'd,</a>
<a id='line_220'>    If she be mated with an equal husband?</a>
<a id='line_221'>  OLD ATHENIAN. Three talents on the present; in future, all.</a>
<a id='line_222'>  TIMON. This gentleman of mine hath serv'd me long;.</a>
<a id='line_223'>    To build his fortune I will strain a little,</a>
<a id='line_224'>    For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:</a>
<a id='line_225'>    What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,</a>
<a id='line_226'>    And make him weigh with her.</a>
<a id='line_227'>  OLD ATHENIAN. Most noble lord,</a>
<a id='line_228'>    Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.</a>
<a id='line_229'>  TIMON. My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.</a>
<a id='line_230'>  LUCILIUS. Humbly I thank your lordship. Never may</a>
<a id='line_231'>    That state or fortune fall into my keeping</a>
<a id='line_232'>    Which is not owed to you!</a>
<a id='line_233'>                                Exeunt LUCILIUS and OLD ATHENIAN</a>
<a id='line_234'>  POET. [Presenting his poem] Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your</a>
<a id='line_235'>    lordship!</a>
<a id='line_236'>  TIMON. I thank you; you shall hear from me anon;</a>
<a id='line_237'>    Go not away. What have you there, my friend?</a>
<a id='line_238'>  PAINTER. A piece of painting, which I do beseech</a>
<a id='line_239'>    Your lordship to accept.</a>
<a id='line_240'>  TIMON. Painting is welcome.</a>
<a id='line_241'>    The painting is almost the natural man;</a>
<a id='line_242'>    For since dishonour traffics with man's nature,</a>
<a id='line_243'>    He is but outside; these pencill'd figures are</a>
<a id='line_244'>    Even such as they give out. I like your work,</a>
<a id='line_245'>    And you shall find I like it; wait attendance</a>
<a id='line_246'>    Till you hear further from me.</a>
<a id='line_247'>  PAINTER. The gods preserve ye!</a>
<a id='line_248'>  TIMON. Well fare you, gentleman. Give me your hand;</a>
<a id='line_249'>    We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel</a>
<a id='line_250'>    Hath suffered under praise.</a>
<a id='line_251'>  JEWELLER. What, my lord! Dispraise?</a>
<a id='line_252'>  TIMON. A mere satiety of commendations;</a>
<a id='line_253'>    If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,</a>
<a id='line_254'>    It would unclew me quite.</a>
<a id='line_255'>  JEWELLER. My lord, 'tis rated</a>
<a id='line_256'>    As those which sell would give; but you well know</a>
<a id='line_257'>    Things of like value, differing in the owners,</a>
<a id='line_258'>    Are prized by their masters. Believe't, dear lord,</a>
<a id='line_259'>    You mend the jewel by the wearing it.</a>
<a id='line_260'>  TIMON. Well mock'd.</a>
<a id='line_261'></a>
<a id='line_262'>                      Enter APEMANTUS</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>  MERCHANT. No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,</a>
<a id='line_265'>    Which all men speak with him.</a>
<a id='line_266'>  TIMON. Look who comes here; will you be chid?</a>
<a id='line_267'>  JEWELLER. We'll bear, with your lordship.</a>
<a id='line_268'>  MERCHANT. He'll spare none.</a>
<a id='line_269'>  TIMON. Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!</a>
<a id='line_270'>  APEMANTUS. Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;</a>
<a id='line_271'>    When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.</a>
<a id='line_272'>  TIMON. Why dost thou call them knaves? Thou know'st them not.</a>
<a id='line_273'>  APEMANTUS. Are they not Athenians?</a>
<a id='line_274'>  TIMON. Yes.</a>
<a id='line_275'>  APEMANTUS. Then I repent not.</a>
<a id='line_276'>  JEWELLER. You know me, Apemantus?</a>
<a id='line_277'>  APEMANTUS. Thou know'st I do; I call'd thee by thy name.</a>
<a id='line_278'>  TIMON. Thou art proud, Apemantus.</a>
<a id='line_279'>  APEMANTUS. Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.</a>
<a id='line_280'>  TIMON. Whither art going?</a>
<a id='line_281'>  APEMANTUS. To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.</a>
<a id='line_282'>  TIMON. That's a deed thou't die for.</a>
<a id='line_283'>  APEMANTUS. Right, if doing nothing be death by th' law.</a>
<a id='line_284'>  TIMON. How lik'st thou this picture, Apemantus?</a>
<a id='line_285'>  APEMANTUS. The best, for the innocence.</a>
<a id='line_286'>  TIMON. Wrought he not well that painted it?</a>
<a id='line_287'>  APEMANTUS. He wrought better that made the painter; and yet he's</a>
<a id='line_288'>    but a filthy piece of work.</a>
<a id='line_289'>  PAINTER. Y'are a dog.</a>
<a id='line_290'>  APEMANTUS. Thy mother's of my generation; what's she, if I be a dog?</a>
<a id='line_291'>  TIMON. Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?</a>
<a id='line_292'>  APEMANTUS. No; I eat not lords.</a>
<a id='line_293'>  TIMON. An thou shouldst, thou'dst anger ladies.</a>
<a id='line_294'>  APEMANTUS. O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.</a>
<a id='line_295'>  TIMON. That's a lascivious apprehension.</a>
<a id='line_296'>  APEMANTUS. So thou apprehend'st it take it for thy labour.</a>
<a id='line_297'>  TIMON. How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?</a>
<a id='line_298'>  APEMANTUS. Not so well as plain dealing, which will not cost a man</a>
<a id='line_299'>    a doit.</a>
<a id='line_300'>  TIMON. What dost thou think 'tis worth?</a>
<a id='line_301'>  APEMANTUS. Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!</a>
<a id='line_302'>  POET. How now, philosopher!</a>
<a id='line_303'>  APEMANTUS. Thou liest.</a>
<a id='line_304'>  POET. Art not one?</a>
<a id='line_305'>  APEMANTUS. Yes.</a>
<a id='line_306'>  POET. Then I lie not.</a>

<a id='line_355'>  FIRST LORD. What time o' day is't, Apemantus?</a>
<a id='line_356'>  APEMANTUS. Time to be honest.</a>
<a id='line_357'>  FIRST LORD. That time serves still.</a>
<a id='line_358'>  APEMANTUS. The more accursed thou that still omit'st it.</a>
<a id='line_359'>  SECOND LORD. Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast.</a>
<a id='line_360'>  APEMANTUS. Ay; to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.</a>
<a id='line_361'>  SECOND LORD. Fare thee well, fare thee well.</a>
<a id='line_362'>  APEMANTUS. Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.</a>
<a id='line_363'>  SECOND LORD. Why, Apemantus?</a>
<a id='line_364'>  APEMANTUS. Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to give</a>
<a id='line_365'>    thee none.</a>
<a id='line_366'>  FIRST LORD. Hang thyself.</a>
<a id='line_367'>  APEMANTUS. No, I will do nothing at thy bidding; make thy requests</a>
<a id='line_368'>    to thy friend.</a>
<a id='line_369'>  SECOND LORD. Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence.</a>
<a id='line_370'>  APEMANTUS. I will fly, like a dog, the heels o' th' ass.  Exit</a>
<a id='line_371'>  FIRST LORD. He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in</a>
<a id='line_372'>    And taste Lord Timon's bounty? He outgoes</a>
<a id='line_373'>    The very heart of kindness.</a>
<a id='line_374'>  SECOND LORD. He pours it out: Plutus, the god of gold,</a>
<a id='line_375'>    Is but his steward; no meed but he repays</a>
<a id='line_376'>    Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him</a>
<a id='line_377'>    But breeds the giver a return exceeding</a>
<a id='line_378'>    All use of quittance.</a>
<a id='line_379'>  FIRST LORD. The noblest mind he carries</a>

<a id='line_382'>  FIRST LORD. I'll keep you company.                      Exeunt</a>

<a id='line_384'>SCENE II. A room of state in TIMON'S house</a>
<a id='line_385'></a>
<a id='line_386'>Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet serv'd in;</a>
<a id='line_387'>FLAVIUS and others attending; and then enter LORD TIMON, the states,</a>
<a id='line_388'>the ATHENIAN LORDS, VENTIDIUS, which TIMON redeem'd from prison.</a>
<a id='line_389'>Then comes, dropping after all, APEMANTUS, discontentedly, like himself</a>
<a id='line_390'></a>
<a id='line_391'>  VENTIDIUS. Most honoured Timon,</a>
<a id='line_392'>    It hath pleas'd the gods to remember my father's age,</a>
<a id='line_393'>    And call him to long peace.</a>
<a id='line_394'>    He is gone happy, and has left me rich.</a>
<a id='line_395'>    Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound</a>
<a id='line_396'>    To your free heart, I do return those talents,</a>
<a id='line_397'>    Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help</a>
<a id='line_398'>    I deriv'd liberty.</a>
<a id='line_399'>  TIMON. O, by no means,</a>
<a id='line_400'>    Honest Ventidius! You mistake my love;</a>
<a id='line_401'>    I gave it freely ever; and there's none</a>
<a id='line_402'>    Can truly say he gives, if he receives.</a>
<a id='line_403'>    If our betters play at that game, we must not dare</a>
<a id='line_404'>    To imitate them: faults that are rich are fair.</a>
<a id='line_405'>  VENTIDIUS. A noble spirit!</a>
<a id='line_406'>  TIMON. Nay, my lords, ceremony was but devis'd at first</a>
<a id='line_407'>    To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,</a>
<a id='line_408'>    Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;</a>
<a id='line_409'>    But where there is true friendship there needs none.</a>
<a id='line_410'>    Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes</a>
<a id='line_411'>    Than my fortunes to me.                           [They sit]</a>
<a id='line_412'>  FIRST LORD. My lord, we always have confess'd it.</a>
<a id='line_413'>  APEMANTUS. Ho, ho, confess'd it! Hang'd it, have you not?</a>
<a id='line_414'>  TIMON. O, Apemantus, you are welcome.</a>
<a id='line_415'>  APEMANTUS. No;</a>
<a id='line_416'>    You shall not make me welcome.</a>
<a id='line_417'>    I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.</a>
<a id='line_418'>  TIMON. Fie, th'art a churl; ye have got a humour there</a>
<a id='line_419'>    Does not become a man; 'tis much to blame.</a>
<a id='line_420'>    They say, my lords, Ira furor brevis est; but yond man is ever</a>
<a id='line_421'>    angry. Go, let him have a table by himself; for he does neither</a>
<a id='line_422'>    affect company nor is he fit for't indeed.</a>
<a id='line_423'>  APEMANTUS. Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon.</a>
<a id='line_424'>    I come to observe; I give thee warning on't.</a>
<a id='line_425'>  TIMON. I take no heed of thee. Th'art an Athenian, therefore</a>
<a id='line_426'>    welcome. I myself would have no power; prithee let my meat make</a>
<a id='line_427'>    thee silent.</a>
<a id='line_428'>  APEMANTUS. I scorn thy meat; 't'would choke me, for I should ne'er</a>
<a id='line_429'>    flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of men eats Timon, and he</a>
<a id='line_430'>    sees 'em not! It grieves me to see so many dip their meat in one</a>
<a id='line_431'>    man's blood; and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.</a>
<a id='line_432'>    I wonder men dare trust themselves with men.</a>
<a id='line_433'>    Methinks they should invite them without knives:</a>
<a id='line_434'>    Good for their meat and safer for their lives.</a>
<a id='line_435'>    There's much example for't; the fellow that sits next him now,</a>
<a id='line_436'>    parts bread with him, pledges the breath of him in a divided</a>
<a id='line_437'>    draught, is the readiest man to kill him. 'T has been proved. If</a>
<a id='line_438'>    I were a huge man I should fear to drink at meals.</a>
<a id='line_439'>    Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:</a>
<a id='line_440'>    Great men should drink with harness on their throats.</a>
<a id='line_441'>  TIMON. My lord, in heart! and let the health go round.</a>
<a id='line_442'>  SECOND LORD. Let it flow this way, my good lord.</a>
<a id='line_443'>  APEMANTUS. Flow this way! A brave fellow! He keeps his tides well.</a>
<a id='line_444'>    Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill, Timon.</a>
<a id='line_445'>    Here's that which is too weak to be a sinner, honest water, which</a>
<a id='line_446'>    ne'er left man i' th' mire.</a>
<a id='line_447'>    This and my food are equals; there's no odds.'</a>
<a id='line_448'>    Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.</a>

<a id='line_451'></a>
<a id='line_452'>           Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;</a>
<a id='line_453'>           I pray for no man but myself.</a>

<a id='line_460'>           Amen. So fall to't.</a>
<a id='line_461'>           Rich men sin, and I eat root.       [Eats and drinks]</a>
<a id='line_462'></a>
<a id='line_463'>    Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!</a>
<a id='line_464'>  TIMON. Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.</a>
<a id='line_465'>  ALCIBIADES. My heart is ever at your service, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_466'>  TIMON. You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than dinner of</a>
<a id='line_467'>    friends.</a>
<a id='line_468'>  ALCIBIADES. So they were bleeding new, my lord, there's no meat</a>
<a id='line_469'>    like 'em; I could wish my best friend at such a feast.</a>
<a id='line_470'>  APEMANTUS. Would all those flatterers were thine enemies then, that</a>
<a id='line_471'>    then thou mightst kill 'em, and bid me to 'em.</a>
<a id='line_472'>  FIRST LORD. Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you</a>
<a id='line_473'>    would once use our hearts, whereby we might express some part of</a>
<a id='line_474'>    our zeals, we should think ourselves for ever perfect.</a>
<a id='line_475'>  TIMON. O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods themselves have</a>
<a id='line_476'>    provided that I shall have much help from you. How had you been</a>
<a id='line_477'>    my friends else? Why have you that charitable title from</a>
<a id='line_478'>    thousands, did not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told</a>
<a id='line_479'>    more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own</a>
<a id='line_480'>    behalf; and thus far I confirm you. O you gods, think I, what</a>
<a id='line_481'>    need we have any friends if we should ne'er have need of 'em?</a>
<a id='line_482'>    They were the most needless creatures living, should we ne'er</a>
<a id='line_483'>    have use for 'em; and would most resemble sweet instruments hung</a>
<a id='line_484'>    up in cases, that keep their sounds to themselves. Why, I have</a>
<a id='line_485'>    often wish'd myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We</a>
<a id='line_486'>    are born to do benefits; and what better or properer can we call</a>
<a id='line_487'>    our own than the riches of our friends? O, what a precious</a>
<a id='line_488'>    comfort 'tis to have so many like brothers commanding one</a>
<a id='line_489'>    another's fortunes! O, joy's e'en made away ere't can be born!</a>
<a id='line_490'>    Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks. To forget their</a>
<a id='line_491'>    faults, I drink to you.</a>
<a id='line_492'>  APEMANTUS. Thou weep'st to make them drink, Timon.</a>
<a id='line_493'>  SECOND LORD. Joy had the like conception in our eyes,</a>
<a id='line_494'>    And at that instant like a babe sprung up.</a>

<a id='line_875'>    When my indisposition put you back,</a>

<a id='line_877'>    Thus to excuse yourself.</a>
<a id='line_878'>  FLAVIUS. O my good lord,</a>
<a id='line_879'>    At many times I brought in my accounts,</a>
<a id='line_880'>    Laid them before you; you would throw them off</a>
<a id='line_881'>    And say you found them in mine honesty.</a>
<a id='line_882'>    When, for some trifling present, you have bid me</a>
<a id='line_883'>    Return so much, I have shook my head and wept;</a>
<a id='line_884'>    Yea, 'gainst th' authority of manners, pray'd you</a>
<a id='line_885'>    To hold your hand more close. I did endure</a>
<a id='line_886'>    Not seldom, nor no slight checks, when I have</a>
<a id='line_887'>    Prompted you in the ebb of your estate</a>
<a id='line_888'>    And your great flow of debts. My lov'd lord,</a>
<a id='line_889'>    Though you hear now- too late!- yet now's a time:</a>
<a id='line_890'>    The greatest of your having lacks a half</a>
<a id='line_891'>    To pay your present debts.</a>
<a id='line_892'>  TIMON. Let all my land be sold.</a>

<a id='line_896'>    What shall defend the interim? And at length</a>

<a id='line_899'>  FLAVIUS. O my good lord, the world is but a word;</a>
<a id='line_900'>    Were it all yours to give it in a breath,</a>
<a id='line_901'>    How quickly were it gone!</a>
<a id='line_902'>  TIMON. You tell me true.</a>

<a id='line_904'>    Call me before th' exactest auditors</a>
<a id='line_905'>    And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,</a>
<a id='line_906'>    When all our offices have been oppress'd</a>
<a id='line_907'>    With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept</a>
<a id='line_908'>    With drunken spilth of wine, when every room</a>
<a id='line_909'>    Hath blaz'd with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,</a>
<a id='line_910'>    I have retir'd me to a wasteful cock</a>
<a id='line_911'>    And set mine eyes at flow.</a>
<a id='line_912'>  TIMON. Prithee no more.</a>
<a id='line_913'>  FLAVIUS. 'Heavens,' have I said 'the bounty of this lord!</a>
<a id='line_914'>    How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants</a>
<a id='line_915'>    This night englutted! Who is not Lord Timon's?</a>

<a id='line_917'>    Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!'</a>
<a id='line_918'>    Ah! when the means are gone that buy this praise,</a>
<a id='line_919'>    The breath is gone whereof this praise is made.</a>
<a id='line_920'>    Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter show'rs,</a>
<a id='line_921'>    These flies are couch'd.</a>

<a id='line_923'>    No villainous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;</a>
<a id='line_924'>    Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.</a>

<a id='line_927'>    If I would broach the vessels of my love,</a>

<a id='line_929'>    Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use</a>

<a id='line_955'>    But they do shake their heads, and I am here</a>

<a id='line_972'>    'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;</a>

<a id='line_980'>    Imprison'd, and in scarcity of friends,</a>
<a id='line_981'>    I clear'd him with five talents. Greet him from me,</a>

<a id='line_983'>    Touches his friend, which craves to be rememb'red</a>
<a id='line_984'>    With those five talents. That had, give't these fellows</a>

<a id='line_1060'>  LUCIUS. Who, the Lord Timon? He is my very good friend, and an</a>
<a id='line_1061'>    honourable gentleman.</a>
<a id='line_1062'>  FIRST STRANGER. We know him for no less, though we are but</a>
<a id='line_1063'>    strangers to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and</a>
<a id='line_1064'>    which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's happy hours</a>
<a id='line_1065'>    are done and past, and his estate shrinks from him.</a>
<a id='line_1066'>  LUCIUS. Fie, no: do not believe it; he cannot want for money.</a>
<a id='line_1067'>  SECOND STRANGER. But believe you this, my lord, that not long ago</a>
<a id='line_1068'>     one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow so many</a>
<a id='line_1069'>    talents; nay, urg'd extremely for't, and showed what necessity</a>
<a id='line_1070'>    belong'd to't, and yet was denied.</a>
<a id='line_1071'>  LUCIUS. How?</a>
<a id='line_1072'>  SECOND STRANGER. I tell you, denied, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_1073'>  LUCIUS. What a strange case was that! Now, before the gods, I am</a>
<a id='line_1074'>    asham'd on't. Denied that honourable man! There was very little</a>
<a id='line_1075'>    honour show'd in't. For my own part, I must needs confess I have</a>
<a id='line_1076'>    received some small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels,</a>
<a id='line_1077'>    and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his; yet, had he</a>

<a id='line_1091'>  SERVILIUS. Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_1092'>    requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many</a>
<a id='line_1093'>    talents.</a>
<a id='line_1094'>  LUCIUS. I know his lordship is but merry with me;</a>
<a id='line_1095'>    He cannot want fifty-five hundred talents.</a>

<a id='line_1097'>    If his occasion were not virtuous</a>
<a id='line_1098'>    I should not urge it half so faithfully.</a>
<a id='line_1099'>  LUCIUS. Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?</a>
<a id='line_1100'>  SERVILIUS. Upon my soul, 'tis true, sir.</a>
<a id='line_1101'>  LUCIUS. What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such</a>
<a id='line_1102'>    a good time, when I might ha' shown myself honourable! How</a>
<a id='line_1103'>    unluckily it happ'ned that I should purchase the day before for a</a>

<a id='line_1109'>    honour will conceive the fairest of me, because I have no power</a>
<a id='line_1110'>    to be kind. And tell him this from me: I count it one of my</a>
<a id='line_1111'>    greatest afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an</a>
<a id='line_1112'>    honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you befriend me so far</a>

<a id='line_1123'>    Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him his friend</a>
<a id='line_1124'>    That dips in the same dish? For, in my knowing,</a>
<a id='line_1125'>    Timon has been this lord's father,</a>
<a id='line_1126'>    And kept his credit with his purse;</a>
<a id='line_1127'>    Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money</a>
<a id='line_1128'>    Has paid his men their wages. He ne'er drinks</a>

<a id='line_1131'>    When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!-</a>

<a id='line_1491'>    conjur'd me beyond them, and I must needs appear.</a>
<a id='line_1492'>  SECOND LORD. In like manner was I in debt to my importunate</a>

<a id='line_1541'>  TIMON. Each man to his stool with that spur as he would to the lip</a>

<a id='line_1545'></a>
<a id='line_1546'>    You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with thankfulness. For</a>
<a id='line_1547'>    your own gifts make yourselves prais'd; but reserve still to give,</a>

<a id='line_2304'>    so full of gold?</a>
<a id='line_2305'>  PAINTER. Certain. Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and Timandra had</a>
<a id='line_2306'>    gold of him. He likewise enrich'd poor straggling soldiers with</a>
<a id='line_2307'>    great quantity. 'Tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.</a>
<a id='line_2308'>  POET. Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends?</a>
<a id='line_2309'>  PAINTER. Nothing else. You shall see him a palm in Athens again,</a>
<a id='line_2310'>    and flourish with the highest. Therefore 'tis not amiss we tender</a>
<a id='line_2311'>    our loves to him in this suppos'd distress of his; it will show</a>
<a id='line_2312'>    honestly in us, and is very likely to load our purposes with what</a>

<a id='line_2315'>  POET. What have you now to present unto him?</a>
<a id='line_2316'>  PAINTER. Nothing at this time but my visitation; only I will</a>

<a id='line_2355'>  PAINTER. Our late noble master!</a>
<a id='line_2356'>  TIMON. Have I once liv'd to see two honest men?</a>
<a id='line_2357'>  POET. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_2358'>    Having often of your open bounty tasted,</a>
<a id='line_2359'>    Hearing you were retir'd, your friends fall'n off,</a>
<a id='line_2360'>    Whose thankless natures- O abhorred spirits!-</a>
<a id='line_2361'>    Not all the whips of heaven are large enough-</a>
<a id='line_2362'>    What! to you,</a>
<a id='line_2363'>    Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence</a>
<a id='line_2364'>    To their whole being! I am rapt, and cannot cover</a>
<a id='line_2365'>    The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude</a>
<a id='line_2366'>    With any size of words.</a>
<a id='line_2367'>  TIMON. Let it go naked: men may see't the better.</a>
<a id='line_2368'>    You that are honest, by being what you are,</a>
<a id='line_2369'>    Make them best seen and known.</a>
<a id='line_2370'>  PAINTER. He and myself</a>
<a id='line_2371'>    Have travail'd in the great show'r of your gifts,</a>
<a id='line_2372'>    And sweetly felt it.</a>
<a id='line_2373'>  TIMON. Ay, you are honest men.</a>
<a id='line_2374'>  PAINTER. We are hither come to offer you our service.</a>
<a id='line_2375'>  TIMON. Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?</a>
<a id='line_2376'>    Can you eat roots, and drink cold water- No?</a>
<a id='line_2377'>  BOTH. What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.</a>
<a id='line_2378'>  TIMON. Y'are honest men. Y'have heard that I have gold;</a>
<a id='line_2379'>    I am sure you have. Speak truth; y'are honest men.</a>
<a id='line_2380'>  PAINTER. So it is said, my noble lord; but therefore</a>
<a id='line_2381'>    Came not my friend nor I.</a>
<a id='line_2382'>  TIMON. Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit</a>
<a id='line_2383'>    Best in all Athens. Th'art indeed the best;</a>
<a id='line_2384'>    Thou counterfeit'st most lively.</a>
<a id='line_2385'>  PAINTER. So, so, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2386'>  TIMON. E'en so, sir, as I say. [To To POET] And for thy fiction,</a>
<a id='line_2387'>    Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth</a>

<a id='line_2389'>    But for all this, my honest-natur'd friends,</a>
<a id='line_2390'>    I must needs say you have a little fault.</a>
<a id='line_2391'>    Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you; neither wish I</a>

<a id='line_2396'>  BOTH. Most thankfully, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2397'>  TIMON. Will you indeed?</a>
<a id='line_2398'>  BOTH. Doubt it not, worthy lord.</a>
<a id='line_2399'>  TIMON. There's never a one of you but trusts a knave</a>
<a id='line_2400'>    That mightily deceives you.</a>
<a id='line_2401'>  BOTH. Do we, my lord?</a>
<a id='line_2402'>  TIMON. Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,</a>
<a id='line_2403'>    Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,</a>
<a id='line_2404'>    Keep in your bosom; yet remain assur'd</a>
<a id='line_2405'>    That he's a made-up villain.</a>
<a id='line_2406'>  PAINTER. I know not such, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2407'>  POET. Nor I.</a>
<a id='line_2408'>  TIMON. Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,</a>
<a id='line_2409'>    Rid me these villains from your companies.</a>
<a id='line_2410'>    Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,</a>
<a id='line_2411'>    Confound them by some course, and come to me,</a>
<a id='line_2412'>    I'll give you gold enough.</a>
<a id='line_2413'>  BOTH. Name them, my lord; let's know them.</a>
<a id='line_2414'>  TIMON. You that way, and you this- but two in company;</a>
<a id='line_2415'>    Each man apart, all single and alone,</a>
<a id='line_2416'>    Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.</a>
<a id='line_2417'>    [To the PAINTER] If, where thou art, two villians shall not be,</a>
<a id='line_2418'>    Come not near him. [To the POET] If thou wouldst not reside</a>

<a id='line_2420'>    Hence, pack! there's gold; you came for gold, ye slaves.</a>
<a id='line_2421'>    [To the PAINTER] You have work for me; there's payment; hence!</a>
<a id='line_2422'>    [To the POET] You are an alchemist; make gold of that.-</a>

<a id='line_2556'>    And strain what other means is left unto us</a>
<a id='line_2557'>    In our dear peril.</a>
<a id='line_2558'>  FIRST SENATOR. It requires swift foot.                  Exeunt</a>
<a id='line_2559'></a>
<a id='line_2560'>SCENE II. Before the walls of Athens</a>
<a id='line_2561'></a>
<a id='line_2562'>Enter two other SENATORS with a MESSENGER</a>
<a id='line_2563'></a>
<a id='line_2564'>  FIRST SENATOR. Thou hast painfully discover'd; are his files</a>
<a id='line_2565'>    As full as thy report?</a>
<a id='line_2566'>  MESSENGER. I have spoke the least.</a>
<a id='line_2567'>    Besides, his expedition promises</a>
<a id='line_2568'>    Present approach.</a>
<a id='line_2569'>  SECOND SENATOR. We stand much hazard if they bring not Timon.</a>
<a id='line_2570'>  MESSENGER. I met a courier, one mine ancient friend,</a>
<a id='line_2571'>    Whom, though in general part we were oppos'd,</a>
<a id='line_2572'>    Yet our old love had a particular force,</a>
<a id='line_2573'>    And made us speak like friends. This man was riding</a>
<a id='line_2574'>    From Alcibiades to Timon's cave</a>
<a id='line_2575'>    With letters of entreaty, which imported</a>
<a id='line_2576'>    His fellowship i' th' cause against your city,</a>
<a id='line_2577'>    In part for his sake mov'd.</a>
<a id='line_2578'></a>
<a id='line_2579'>               Enter the other SENATORS, from TIMON</a>
<a id='line_2580'></a>
<a id='line_2581'>  FIRST SENATOR. Here come our brothers.</a>
<a id='line_2582'>  THIRD SENATOR. No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.</a>
<a id='line_2583'>    The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouring</a>
<a id='line_2584'>    Doth choke the air with dust. In, and prepare.</a>
<a id='line_2585'>    Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare.         Exeunt</a>
<a id='line_2586'></a>
<a id='line_2587'>SCENE III. The TIMON's cave, and a rude tomb seen</a>
<a id='line_2588'></a>
<a id='line_2589'>Enter a SOLDIER in the woods, seeking TIMON</a>
<a id='line_2590'></a>
<a id='line_2591'>  SOLDIER. By all description this should be the place.</a>
<a id='line_2592'>    Who's here? Speak, ho! No answer? What is this?</a>
<a id='line_2593'>    Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span.</a>
<a id='line_2594'>    Some beast rear'd this; here does not live a man.</a>
<a id='line_2595'>    Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb</a>
<a id='line_2596'>    I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax.</a>
<a id='line_2597'>    Our captain hath in every figure skill,</a>
<a id='line_2598'>    An ag'd interpreter, though young in days;</a>
<a id='line_2599'>    Before proud Athens he's set down by this,</a>
<a id='line_2600'>    Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.                 Exit</a>
<a id='line_2601'></a>
<a id='line_2602'>SCENE IV. Before the walls of Athens</a>
<a id='line_2603'></a>
<a id='line_2604'>Trumpets sound. Enter ALCIBIADES with his powers before Athens</a>
<a id='line_2605'></a>
<a id='line_2606'>  ALCIBIADES. Sound to this coward and lascivious town</a>
<a id='line_2607'>    Our terrible approach.</a>
<a id='line_2608'></a>
<a id='line_2609'>       Sound a parley. The SENATORS appear upon the walls</a>
<a id='line_2610'></a>
<a id='line_2611'>    Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time</a>
<a id='line_2612'>    With all licentious measure, making your wills</a>
<a id='line_2613'>    The scope of justice; till now, myself, and such</a>
<a id='line_2614'>    As slept within the shadow of your power,</a>
<a id='line_2615'>    Have wander'd with our travers'd arms, and breath'd</a>
<a id='line_2616'>    Our sufferance vainly. Now the time is flush,</a>
<a id='line_2617'>    When crouching marrow, in the bearer strong,</a>
<a id='line_2618'>    Cries of itself 'No more!' Now breathless wrong</a>
<a id='line_2619'>    Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,</a>
<a id='line_2620'>    And pursy insolence shall break his wind</a>
<a id='line_2621'>    With fear and horrid flight.</a>
<a id='line_2622'>  FIRST SENATOR. Noble and young,</a>
<a id='line_2623'>    When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,</a>
<a id='line_2624'>    Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,</a>
<a id='line_2625'>    We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,</a>
<a id='line_2626'>    To wipe out our ingratitude with loves</a>
<a id='line_2627'>    Above their quantity.</a>
<a id='line_2628'>  SECOND SENATOR. So did we woo</a>
<a id='line_2629'>    Transformed Timon to our city's love</a>
<a id='line_2630'>    By humble message and by promis'd means.</a>
<a id='line_2631'>    We were not all unkind, nor all deserve</a>
<a id='line_2632'>    The common stroke of war.</a>
<a id='line_2633'>  FIRST SENATOR. These walls of ours</a>
<a id='line_2634'>    Were not erected by their hands from whom</a>
<a id='line_2635'>    You have receiv'd your griefs; nor are they such</a>
<a id='line_2636'>    That these great tow'rs, trophies, and schools, should fall</a>
<a id='line_2637'>    For private faults in them.</a>
<a id='line_2638'>  SECOND SENATOR. Nor are they living</a>
<a id='line_2639'>    Who were the motives that you first went out;</a>
<a id='line_2640'>    Shame, that they wanted cunning, in excess</a>
<a id='line_2641'>    Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,</a>
<a id='line_2642'>    Into our city with thy banners spread.</a>
<a id='line_2643'>    By decimation and a tithed death-</a>
<a id='line_2644'>    If thy revenges hunger for that food</a>
<a id='line_2645'>    Which nature loathes- take thou the destin'd tenth,</a>
<a id='line_2646'>    And by the hazard of the spotted die</a>
<a id='line_2647'>    Let die the spotted.</a>
<a id='line_2648'>  FIRST SENATOR. All have not offended;</a>
<a id='line_2649'>    For those that were, it is not square to take,</a>
<a id='line_2650'>    On those that are, revenge: crimes, like lands,</a>
<a id='line_2651'>    Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,</a>
<a id='line_2652'>    Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage;</a>
<a id='line_2653'>    Spare thy Athenian cradle, and those kin</a>
<a id='line_2654'>    Which, in the bluster of thy wrath, must fall</a>
<a id='line_2655'>    With those that have offended. Like a shepherd</a>
<a id='line_2656'>    Approach the fold and cull th' infected forth,</a>
<a id='line_2657'>    But kill not all together.</a>
<a id='line_2658'>  SECOND SENATOR. What thou wilt,</a>
<a id='line_2659'>    Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile</a>
<a id='line_2660'>    Than hew to't with thy sword.</a>
<a id='line_2661'>  FIRST SENATOR. Set but thy foot</a>
<a id='line_2662'>    Against our rampir'd gates and they shall ope,</a>
<a id='line_2663'>    So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before</a>
<a id='line_2664'>    To say thou't enter friendly.</a>
<a id='line_2665'>  SECOND SENATOR. Throw thy glove,</a>
<a id='line_2666'>    Or any token of thine honour else,</a>
<a id='line_2667'>    That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress</a>
<a id='line_2668'>    And not as our confusion, all thy powers</a>
<a id='line_2669'>    Shall make their harbour in our town till we</a>
<a id='line_2670'>    Have seal'd thy full desire.</a>
<a id='line_2671'>  ALCIBIADES. Then there's my glove;</a>
<a id='line_2672'>    Descend, and open your uncharged ports.</a>
<a id='line_2673'>    Those enemies of Timon's and mine own,</a>
<a id='line_2674'>    Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof,</a>
<a id='line_2675'>    Fall, and no more. And, to atone your fears</a>
<a id='line_2676'>    With my more noble meaning, not a man</a>
<a id='line_2677'>    Shall pass his quarter or offend the stream</a>
<a id='line_2678'>    Of regular justice in your city's bounds,</a>
<a id='line_2679'>    But shall be render'd to your public laws</a>
<a id='line_2680'>    At heaviest answer.</a>
<a id='line_2681'>  BOTH. 'Tis most nobly spoken.</a>
<a id='line_2682'>  ALCIBIADES. Descend, and keep your words.</a>
<a id='line_2683'>                       [The SENATORS descend and open the gates]</a>
<a id='line_2684'></a>
<a id='line_2685'>                 Enter a SOLDIER as a Messenger</a>
<a id='line_2686'></a>
<a id='line_2687'>  SOLDIER. My noble General, Timon is dead;</a>
<a id='line_2688'>    Entomb'd upon the very hem o' th' sea;</a>
<a id='line_2689'>    And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which</a>
<a id='line_2690'>    With wax I brought away, whose soft impression</a>
<a id='line_2691'>    Interprets for my poor ignorance.</a>
<a id='line_2692'></a>

<a id='line_2694'></a>
<a id='line_2695'>    'Here lies a wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft;</a>
<a id='line_2696'>    Seek not my name. A plague consume you wicked caitiffs left!</a>
<a id='line_2697'>    Here lie I, Timon, who alive all living men did hate.</a>
<a id='line_2698'>    Pass by, and curse thy fill; but pass, and stay not here thy</a>
<a id='line_2699'>      gait.'</a>
<a id='line_2700'>    These well express in thee thy latter spirits.</a>
<a id='line_2701'>    Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,</a>
<a id='line_2702'>    Scorn'dst our brain's flow, and those our droplets which</a>
<a id='line_2703'>    From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit</a>
<a id='line_2704'>    Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye</a>
<a id='line_2705'>    On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead</a>
<a id='line_2706'>    Is noble Timon, of whose memory</a>
<a id='line_2707'>    Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,</a>
<a id='line_2708'>    And I will use the olive, with my sword;</a>
<a id='line_2709'>    Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each</a>
<a id='line_2710'>    Prescribe to other, as each other's leech.</a>
<a id='line_2711'>    Let our drums strike.                                 Exeunt</a>
