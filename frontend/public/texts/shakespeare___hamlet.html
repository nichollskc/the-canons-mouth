<a id='line_138'>BARNARDO.</a>
<a id='line_139'>Say, what, is Horatio there?</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_142'>A piece of him.</a>
<a id='line_143'></a>
<a id='line_144'>BARNARDO.</a>
<a id='line_145'>Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.</a>
<a id='line_146'></a>
<a id='line_147'>MARCELLUS.</a>
<a id='line_148'>What, has this thing appear’d again tonight?</a>
<a id='line_149'></a>
<a id='line_150'>BARNARDO.</a>
<a id='line_151'>I have seen nothing.</a>
<a id='line_152'></a>
<a id='line_153'>MARCELLUS.</a>
<a id='line_154'>Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy,</a>
<a id='line_155'>And will not let belief take hold of him</a>
<a id='line_156'>Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.</a>
<a id='line_157'>Therefore I have entreated him along</a>
<a id='line_158'>With us to watch the minutes of this night,</a>
<a id='line_159'>That if again this apparition come</a>
<a id='line_160'>He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_163'>Tush, tush, ’twill not appear.</a>
<a id='line_164'></a>
<a id='line_165'>BARNARDO.</a>
<a id='line_166'>Sit down awhile,</a>
<a id='line_167'>And let us once again assail your ears,</a>
<a id='line_168'>That are so fortified against our story,</a>
<a id='line_169'>What we two nights have seen.</a>
<a id='line_170'></a>
<a id='line_171'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_172'>Well, sit we down,</a>
<a id='line_173'>And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>BARNARDO.</a>
<a id='line_176'>Last night of all,</a>
<a id='line_177'>When yond same star that’s westward from the pole,</a>
<a id='line_178'>Had made his course t’illume that part of heaven</a>
<a id='line_179'>Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,</a>
<a id='line_180'>The bell then beating one—</a>
<a id='line_181'></a>
<a id='line_182'>MARCELLUS.</a>
<a id='line_183'>Peace, break thee off. Look where it comes again.</a>
<a id='line_184'></a>
<a id='line_185'> Enter Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_186'></a>
<a id='line_187'>BARNARDO.</a>
<a id='line_188'>In the same figure, like the King that’s dead.</a>
<a id='line_189'></a>
<a id='line_190'>MARCELLUS.</a>
<a id='line_191'>Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.</a>
<a id='line_192'></a>
<a id='line_193'>BARNARDO.</a>
<a id='line_194'>Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.</a>
<a id='line_195'></a>
<a id='line_196'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_197'>Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>BARNARDO</a>
<a id='line_200'>It would be spoke to.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>MARCELLUS.</a>
<a id='line_203'>Question it, Horatio.</a>
<a id='line_204'></a>
<a id='line_205'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_206'>What art thou that usurp’st this time of night,</a>
<a id='line_207'>Together with that fair and warlike form</a>
<a id='line_208'>In which the majesty of buried Denmark</a>
<a id='line_209'>Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak.</a>
<a id='line_210'></a>
<a id='line_211'>MARCELLUS.</a>
<a id='line_212'>It is offended.</a>
<a id='line_213'></a>
<a id='line_214'>BARNARDO.</a>
<a id='line_215'>See, it stalks away.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_218'>Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak!</a>
<a id='line_219'></a>
<a id='line_220'> [_Exit Ghost._]</a>
<a id='line_221'></a>
<a id='line_222'>MARCELLUS.</a>
<a id='line_223'>’Tis gone, and will not answer.</a>
<a id='line_224'></a>
<a id='line_225'>BARNARDO.</a>
<a id='line_226'>How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale.</a>
<a id='line_227'>Is not this something more than fantasy?</a>
<a id='line_228'>What think you on’t?</a>
<a id='line_229'></a>
<a id='line_230'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_231'>Before my God, I might not this believe</a>
<a id='line_232'>Without the sensible and true avouch</a>
<a id='line_233'>Of mine own eyes.</a>
<a id='line_234'></a>
<a id='line_235'>MARCELLUS.</a>
<a id='line_236'>Is it not like the King?</a>
<a id='line_237'></a>
<a id='line_238'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_239'>As thou art to thyself:</a>
<a id='line_240'>Such was the very armour he had on</a>
<a id='line_241'>When he th’ambitious Norway combated;</a>
<a id='line_242'>So frown’d he once, when in an angry parle</a>
<a id='line_243'>He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.</a>
<a id='line_244'>’Tis strange.</a>
<a id='line_245'></a>
<a id='line_246'>MARCELLUS.</a>
<a id='line_247'>Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,</a>
<a id='line_248'>With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</a>
<a id='line_249'></a>
<a id='line_250'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_251'>In what particular thought to work I know not;</a>
<a id='line_252'>But in the gross and scope of my opinion,</a>
<a id='line_253'>This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</a>
<a id='line_254'></a>
<a id='line_255'>MARCELLUS.</a>
<a id='line_256'>Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,</a>
<a id='line_257'>Why this same strict and most observant watch</a>
<a id='line_258'>So nightly toils the subject of the land,</a>
<a id='line_259'>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon</a>
<a id='line_260'>And foreign mart for implements of war;</a>
<a id='line_261'>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task</a>
<a id='line_262'>Does not divide the Sunday from the week.</a>
<a id='line_263'>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste</a>
<a id='line_264'>Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:</a>
<a id='line_265'>Who is’t that can inform me?</a>
<a id='line_266'></a>
<a id='line_267'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_268'>That can I;</a>
<a id='line_269'>At least, the whisper goes so. Our last King,</a>
<a id='line_270'>Whose image even but now appear’d to us,</a>
<a id='line_271'>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</a>
<a id='line_272'>Thereto prick’d on by a most emulate pride,</a>
<a id='line_273'>Dar’d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet,</a>
<a id='line_274'>For so this side of our known world esteem’d him,</a>
<a id='line_275'>Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal’d compact,</a>
<a id='line_276'>Well ratified by law and heraldry,</a>
<a id='line_277'>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands</a>
<a id='line_278'>Which he stood seiz’d of, to the conqueror;</a>
<a id='line_279'>Against the which, a moiety competent</a>
<a id='line_280'>Was gaged by our King; which had return’d</a>
<a id='line_281'>To the inheritance of Fortinbras,</a>
<a id='line_282'>Had he been vanquisher; as by the same cov’nant</a>
<a id='line_283'>And carriage of the article design’d,</a>
<a id='line_284'>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</a>
<a id='line_285'>Of unimproved mettle, hot and full,</a>
<a id='line_286'>Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,</a>
<a id='line_287'>Shark’d up a list of lawless resolutes,</a>
<a id='line_288'>For food and diet, to some enterprise</a>
<a id='line_289'>That hath a stomach in’t; which is no other,</a>
<a id='line_290'>As it doth well appear unto our state,</a>
<a id='line_291'>But to recover of us by strong hand</a>
<a id='line_292'>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</a>
<a id='line_293'>So by his father lost. And this, I take it,</a>
<a id='line_294'>Is the main motive of our preparations,</a>
<a id='line_295'>The source of this our watch, and the chief head</a>
<a id='line_296'>Of this post-haste and rummage in the land.</a>
<a id='line_297'></a>
<a id='line_298'>BARNARDO.</a>
<a id='line_299'>I think it be no other but e’en so:</a>
<a id='line_300'>Well may it sort that this portentous figure</a>
<a id='line_301'>Comes armed through our watch so like the King</a>
<a id='line_302'>That was and is the question of these wars.</a>
<a id='line_303'></a>
<a id='line_304'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_305'>A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.</a>
<a id='line_306'>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_307'>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</a>
<a id='line_308'>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead</a>
<a id='line_309'>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;</a>
<a id='line_310'>As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,</a>
<a id='line_311'>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,</a>
<a id='line_312'>Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands,</a>
<a id='line_313'>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.</a>
<a id='line_314'>And even the like precurse of fierce events,</a>
<a id='line_315'>As harbingers preceding still the fates</a>
<a id='line_316'>And prologue to the omen coming on,</a>
<a id='line_317'>Have heaven and earth together demonstrated</a>
<a id='line_318'>Unto our climatures and countrymen.</a>
<a id='line_319'></a>
<a id='line_320'> Re-enter Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_321'></a>
<a id='line_322'>But, soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again!</a>
<a id='line_323'>I’ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!</a>
<a id='line_324'>If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,</a>
<a id='line_325'>Speak to me.</a>
<a id='line_326'>If there be any good thing to be done,</a>
<a id='line_327'>That may to thee do ease, and grace to me,</a>
<a id='line_328'>Speak to me.</a>
<a id='line_329'>If thou art privy to thy country’s fate,</a>
<a id='line_330'>Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,</a>
<a id='line_331'>O speak!</a>
<a id='line_332'>Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life</a>
<a id='line_333'>Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,</a>
<a id='line_334'>For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,</a>
<a id='line_335'>Speak of it. Stay, and speak!</a>
<a id='line_336'></a>
<a id='line_337'> [_The cock crows._]</a>
<a id='line_338'></a>
<a id='line_339'>Stop it, Marcellus!</a>
<a id='line_340'></a>
<a id='line_341'>MARCELLUS.</a>
<a id='line_342'>Shall I strike at it with my partisan?</a>
<a id='line_343'></a>
<a id='line_344'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_345'>Do, if it will not stand.</a>
<a id='line_346'></a>
<a id='line_347'>BARNARDO.</a>

<a id='line_354'></a>
<a id='line_355'>MARCELLUS.</a>
<a id='line_356'>’Tis gone!</a>
<a id='line_357'>We do it wrong, being so majestical,</a>
<a id='line_358'>To offer it the show of violence,</a>
<a id='line_359'>For it is as the air, invulnerable,</a>
<a id='line_360'>And our vain blows malicious mockery.</a>
<a id='line_361'></a>
<a id='line_362'>BARNARDO.</a>
<a id='line_363'>It was about to speak, when the cock crew.</a>
<a id='line_364'></a>
<a id='line_365'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_366'>And then it started, like a guilty thing</a>
<a id='line_367'>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard</a>
<a id='line_368'>The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,</a>
<a id='line_369'>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat</a>
<a id='line_370'>Awake the god of day; and at his warning,</a>
<a id='line_371'>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</a>
<a id='line_372'>Th’extravagant and erring spirit hies</a>
<a id='line_373'>To his confine. And of the truth herein</a>
<a id='line_374'>This present object made probation.</a>
<a id='line_375'></a>
<a id='line_376'>MARCELLUS.</a>
<a id='line_377'>It faded on the crowing of the cock.</a>
<a id='line_378'>Some say that ever ’gainst that season comes</a>
<a id='line_379'>Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated,</a>
<a id='line_380'>The bird of dawning singeth all night long;</a>
<a id='line_381'>And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,</a>
<a id='line_382'>The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,</a>
<a id='line_383'>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;</a>
<a id='line_384'>So hallow’d and so gracious is the time.</a>
<a id='line_385'></a>
<a id='line_386'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_387'>So have I heard, and do in part believe it.</a>
<a id='line_388'>But look, the morn in russet mantle clad,</a>
<a id='line_389'>Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill.</a>
<a id='line_390'>Break we our watch up, and by my advice,</a>
<a id='line_391'>Let us impart what we have seen tonight</a>
<a id='line_392'>Unto young Hamlet; for upon my life,</a>
<a id='line_393'>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.</a>
<a id='line_394'>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,</a>
<a id='line_395'>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</a>
<a id='line_396'></a>
<a id='line_397'>MARCELLUS.</a>
<a id='line_398'>Let’s do’t, I pray, and I this morning know</a>
<a id='line_399'>Where we shall find him most conveniently.</a>
<a id='line_400'></a>
<a id='line_401'> [_Exeunt._]</a>
<a id='line_402'></a>
<a id='line_403'>SCENE II. Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.</a>
<a id='line_404'></a>
<a id='line_405'> Enter Claudius King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius,</a>
<a id='line_406'> Laertes, Voltemand,</a>
<a id='line_407'>Cornelius, Lords and Attendant.</a>
<a id='line_408'></a>
<a id='line_409'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_410'>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death</a>
<a id='line_411'>The memory be green, and that it us befitted</a>
<a id='line_412'>To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom</a>
<a id='line_413'>To be contracted in one brow of woe;</a>
<a id='line_414'>Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature</a>
<a id='line_415'>That we with wisest sorrow think on him,</a>
<a id='line_416'>Together with remembrance of ourselves.</a>
<a id='line_417'>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,</a>
<a id='line_418'>Th’imperial jointress to this warlike state,</a>
<a id='line_419'>Have we, as ’twere with a defeated joy,</a>
<a id='line_420'>With one auspicious and one dropping eye,</a>
<a id='line_421'>With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,</a>
<a id='line_422'>In equal scale weighing delight and dole,</a>
<a id='line_423'>Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr’d</a>
<a id='line_424'>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone</a>
<a id='line_425'>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.</a>
<a id='line_426'>Now follows, that you know young Fortinbras,</a>
<a id='line_427'>Holding a weak supposal of our worth,</a>
<a id='line_428'>Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death</a>
<a id='line_429'>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,</a>
<a id='line_430'>Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,</a>
<a id='line_431'>He hath not fail’d to pester us with message,</a>
<a id='line_432'>Importing the surrender of those lands</a>
<a id='line_433'>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,</a>
<a id='line_434'>To our most valiant brother. So much for him.</a>
<a id='line_435'>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:</a>
<a id='line_436'>Thus much the business is: we have here writ</a>
<a id='line_437'>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,</a>
<a id='line_438'>Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears</a>
<a id='line_439'>Of this his nephew’s purpose, to suppress</a>
<a id='line_440'>His further gait herein; in that the levies,</a>
<a id='line_441'>The lists, and full proportions are all made</a>
<a id='line_442'>Out of his subject: and we here dispatch</a>
<a id='line_443'>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,</a>
<a id='line_444'>For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,</a>
<a id='line_445'>Giving to you no further personal power</a>
<a id='line_446'>To business with the King, more than the scope</a>
<a id='line_447'>Of these dilated articles allow.</a>
<a id='line_448'>Farewell; and let your haste commend your duty.</a>
<a id='line_449'></a>
<a id='line_450'>CORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND.</a>
<a id='line_451'>In that, and all things, will we show our duty.</a>
<a id='line_452'></a>
<a id='line_453'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_454'>We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.</a>
<a id='line_455'></a>
<a id='line_456'> [_Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius._]</a>
<a id='line_457'></a>
<a id='line_458'>And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?</a>
<a id='line_459'>You told us of some suit. What is’t, Laertes?</a>
<a id='line_460'>You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,</a>
<a id='line_461'>And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,</a>
<a id='line_462'>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?</a>
<a id='line_463'>The head is not more native to the heart,</a>
<a id='line_464'>The hand more instrumental to the mouth,</a>
<a id='line_465'>Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.</a>
<a id='line_466'>What wouldst thou have, Laertes?</a>
<a id='line_467'></a>
<a id='line_468'>LAERTES.</a>
<a id='line_469'>Dread my lord,</a>
<a id='line_470'>Your leave and favour to return to France,</a>
<a id='line_471'>From whence though willingly I came to Denmark</a>
<a id='line_472'>To show my duty in your coronation;</a>
<a id='line_473'>Yet now I must confess, that duty done,</a>
<a id='line_474'>My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,</a>
<a id='line_475'>And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.</a>
<a id='line_476'></a>
<a id='line_477'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_478'>Have you your father’s leave? What says Polonius?</a>
<a id='line_479'></a>
<a id='line_480'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_481'>He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave</a>
<a id='line_482'>By laboursome petition; and at last</a>
<a id='line_483'>Upon his will I seal’d my hard consent.</a>
<a id='line_484'>I do beseech you give him leave to go.</a>
<a id='line_485'></a>
<a id='line_486'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_487'>Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,</a>
<a id='line_488'>And thy best graces spend it at thy will!</a>
<a id='line_489'>But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son—</a>
<a id='line_490'></a>
<a id='line_491'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_492'>[_Aside._] A little more than kin, and less than kind.</a>
<a id='line_493'></a>
<a id='line_494'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_495'>How is it that the clouds still hang on you?</a>
<a id='line_496'></a>
<a id='line_497'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_498'>Not so, my lord, I am too much i’ the sun.</a>
<a id='line_499'></a>
<a id='line_500'>QUEEN.</a>
<a id='line_501'>Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,</a>
<a id='line_502'>And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.</a>
<a id='line_503'>Do not for ever with thy vailed lids</a>
<a id='line_504'>Seek for thy noble father in the dust.</a>
<a id='line_505'>Thou know’st ’tis common, all that lives must die,</a>
<a id='line_506'>Passing through nature to eternity.</a>
<a id='line_507'></a>
<a id='line_508'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_509'>Ay, madam, it is common.</a>
<a id='line_510'></a>
<a id='line_511'>QUEEN.</a>
<a id='line_512'>If it be,</a>
<a id='line_513'>Why seems it so particular with thee?</a>
<a id='line_514'></a>
<a id='line_515'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_516'>Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.</a>
<a id='line_517'>’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,</a>
<a id='line_518'>Nor customary suits of solemn black,</a>
<a id='line_519'>Nor windy suspiration of forc’d breath,</a>
<a id='line_520'>No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,</a>
<a id='line_521'>Nor the dejected haviour of the visage,</a>
<a id='line_522'>Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief,</a>
<a id='line_523'>That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,</a>
<a id='line_524'>For they are actions that a man might play;</a>
<a id='line_525'>But I have that within which passeth show;</a>
<a id='line_526'>These but the trappings and the suits of woe.</a>
<a id='line_527'></a>
<a id='line_528'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_529'>’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,</a>
<a id='line_530'>To give these mourning duties to your father;</a>
<a id='line_531'>But you must know, your father lost a father,</a>
<a id='line_532'>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound</a>
<a id='line_533'>In filial obligation, for some term</a>
<a id='line_534'>To do obsequious sorrow. But to persevere</a>
<a id='line_535'>In obstinate condolement is a course</a>
<a id='line_536'>Of impious stubbornness. ’Tis unmanly grief,</a>
<a id='line_537'>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,</a>
<a id='line_538'>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,</a>
<a id='line_539'>An understanding simple and unschool’d;</a>
<a id='line_540'>For what we know must be, and is as common</a>
<a id='line_541'>As any the most vulgar thing to sense,</a>
<a id='line_542'>Why should we in our peevish opposition</a>
<a id='line_543'>Take it to heart? Fie, ’tis a fault to heaven,</a>
<a id='line_544'>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,</a>
<a id='line_545'>To reason most absurd, whose common theme</a>
<a id='line_546'>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,</a>
<a id='line_547'>From the first corse till he that died today,</a>
<a id='line_548'>‘This must be so.’ We pray you throw to earth</a>
<a id='line_549'>This unprevailing woe, and think of us</a>
<a id='line_550'>As of a father; for let the world take note</a>
<a id='line_551'>You are the most immediate to our throne,</a>
<a id='line_552'>And with no less nobility of love</a>
<a id='line_553'>Than that which dearest father bears his son</a>
<a id='line_554'>Do I impart toward you. For your intent</a>
<a id='line_555'>In going back to school in Wittenberg,</a>
<a id='line_556'>It is most retrograde to our desire:</a>
<a id='line_557'>And we beseech you bend you to remain</a>
<a id='line_558'>Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,</a>
<a id='line_559'>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.</a>
<a id='line_560'></a>
<a id='line_561'>QUEEN.</a>
<a id='line_562'>Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.</a>
<a id='line_563'>I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.</a>
<a id='line_564'></a>
<a id='line_565'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_566'>I shall in all my best obey you, madam.</a>
<a id='line_567'></a>
<a id='line_568'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_569'>Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply.</a>
<a id='line_570'>Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;</a>
<a id='line_571'>This gentle and unforc’d accord of Hamlet</a>
<a id='line_572'>Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,</a>
<a id='line_573'>No jocund health that Denmark drinks today</a>
<a id='line_574'>But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,</a>
<a id='line_575'>And the King’s rouse the heaven shall bruit again,</a>
<a id='line_576'>Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.</a>
<a id='line_577'></a>
<a id='line_578'> [_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]</a>
<a id='line_579'></a>
<a id='line_580'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_581'>O that this too too solid flesh would melt,</a>
<a id='line_582'>Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!</a>
<a id='line_583'>Or that the Everlasting had not fix’d</a>
<a id='line_584'>His canon ’gainst self-slaughter. O God! O God!</a>
<a id='line_585'>How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable</a>
<a id='line_586'>Seem to me all the uses of this world!</a>
<a id='line_587'>Fie on’t! Oh fie! ’tis an unweeded garden</a>
<a id='line_588'>That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature</a>
<a id='line_589'>Possess it merely. That it should come to this!</a>
<a id='line_590'>But two months dead—nay, not so much, not two:</a>
<a id='line_591'>So excellent a king; that was to this</a>
<a id='line_592'>Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,</a>
<a id='line_593'>That he might not beteem the winds of heaven</a>
<a id='line_594'>Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!</a>
<a id='line_595'>Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him</a>
<a id='line_596'>As if increase of appetite had grown</a>
<a id='line_597'>By what it fed on; and yet, within a month—</a>
<a id='line_598'>Let me not think on’t—Frailty, thy name is woman!</a>
<a id='line_599'>A little month, or ere those shoes were old</a>
<a id='line_600'>With which she followed my poor father’s body</a>
<a id='line_601'>Like Niobe, all tears.—Why she, even she—</a>
<a id='line_602'>O God! A beast that wants discourse of reason</a>
<a id='line_603'>Would have mourn’d longer,—married with mine uncle,</a>
<a id='line_604'>My father’s brother; but no more like my father</a>
<a id='line_605'>Than I to Hercules. Within a month?</a>
<a id='line_606'>Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears</a>
<a id='line_607'>Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,</a>
<a id='line_608'>She married. O most wicked speed, to post</a>
<a id='line_609'>With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!</a>
<a id='line_610'>It is not, nor it cannot come to good.</a>
<a id='line_611'>But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue.</a>
<a id='line_612'></a>
<a id='line_613'> Enter Horatio, Marcellus and Barnardo.</a>
<a id='line_614'></a>
<a id='line_615'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_616'>Hail to your lordship!</a>
<a id='line_617'></a>
<a id='line_618'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_619'>I am glad to see you well:</a>
<a id='line_620'>Horatio, or I do forget myself.</a>
<a id='line_621'></a>
<a id='line_622'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_623'>The same, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_624'>And your poor servant ever.</a>
<a id='line_625'></a>
<a id='line_626'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_627'>Sir, my good friend;</a>
<a id='line_628'>I’ll change that name with you:</a>

<a id='line_635'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_636'>I am very glad to see you.—Good even, sir.—</a>
<a id='line_637'>But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?</a>
<a id='line_638'></a>
<a id='line_639'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_640'>A truant disposition, good my lord.</a>
<a id='line_641'></a>
<a id='line_642'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_643'>I would not hear your enemy say so;</a>
<a id='line_644'>Nor shall you do my ear that violence,</a>
<a id='line_645'>To make it truster of your own report</a>
<a id='line_646'>Against yourself. I know you are no truant.</a>
<a id='line_647'>But what is your affair in Elsinore?</a>
<a id='line_648'>We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.</a>
<a id='line_649'></a>
<a id='line_650'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_651'>My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.</a>
<a id='line_652'></a>
<a id='line_653'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_654'>I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.</a>
<a id='line_655'>I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.</a>
<a id='line_656'></a>
<a id='line_657'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_658'>Indeed, my lord, it follow’d hard upon.</a>

<a id='line_660'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_661'>Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak’d meats</a>
<a id='line_662'>Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.</a>
<a id='line_663'>Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven</a>
<a id='line_664'>Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio.</a>

<a id='line_672'></a>
<a id='line_673'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_674'>I saw him once; he was a goodly king.</a>
<a id='line_675'></a>
<a id='line_676'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_677'>He was a man, take him for all in all,</a>
<a id='line_678'>I shall not look upon his like again.</a>
<a id='line_679'></a>
<a id='line_680'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_681'>My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.</a>
<a id='line_682'></a>
<a id='line_683'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_684'>Saw? Who?</a>
<a id='line_685'></a>
<a id='line_686'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_687'>My lord, the King your father.</a>
<a id='line_688'></a>
<a id='line_689'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_690'>The King my father!</a>
<a id='line_691'></a>
<a id='line_692'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_693'>Season your admiration for a while</a>
<a id='line_694'>With an attent ear, till I may deliver</a>
<a id='line_695'>Upon the witness of these gentlemen</a>
<a id='line_696'>This marvel to you.</a>

<a id='line_698'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_699'>For God’s love let me hear.</a>
<a id='line_700'></a>
<a id='line_701'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_702'>Two nights together had these gentlemen,</a>
<a id='line_703'>Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch</a>
<a id='line_704'>In the dead waste and middle of the night,</a>
<a id='line_705'>Been thus encounter’d. A figure like your father,</a>
<a id='line_706'>Armed at point exactly, cap-à-pie,</a>
<a id='line_707'>Appears before them, and with solemn march</a>
<a id='line_708'>Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk’d</a>
<a id='line_709'>By their oppress’d and fear-surprised eyes,</a>
<a id='line_710'>Within his truncheon’s length; whilst they, distill’d</a>
<a id='line_711'>Almost to jelly with the act of fear,</a>
<a id='line_712'>Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me</a>
<a id='line_713'>In dreadful secrecy impart they did,</a>
<a id='line_714'>And I with them the third night kept the watch,</a>
<a id='line_715'>Where, as they had deliver’d, both in time,</a>
<a id='line_716'>Form of the thing, each word made true and good,</a>
<a id='line_717'>The apparition comes. I knew your father;</a>
<a id='line_718'>These hands are not more like.</a>
<a id='line_719'></a>
<a id='line_720'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_721'>But where was this?</a>
<a id='line_722'></a>
<a id='line_723'>MARCELLUS.</a>
<a id='line_724'>My lord, upon the platform where we watch.</a>
<a id='line_725'></a>
<a id='line_726'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_727'>Did you not speak to it?</a>
<a id='line_728'></a>
<a id='line_729'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_730'>My lord, I did;</a>
<a id='line_731'>But answer made it none: yet once methought</a>
<a id='line_732'>It lifted up it head, and did address</a>
<a id='line_733'>Itself to motion, like as it would speak.</a>
<a id='line_734'>But even then the morning cock crew loud,</a>
<a id='line_735'>And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,</a>
<a id='line_736'>And vanish’d from our sight.</a>
<a id='line_737'></a>
<a id='line_738'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_739'>’Tis very strange.</a>
<a id='line_740'></a>
<a id='line_741'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_742'>As I do live, my honour’d lord, ’tis true;</a>
<a id='line_743'>And we did think it writ down in our duty</a>
<a id='line_744'>To let you know of it.</a>
<a id='line_745'></a>
<a id='line_746'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_747'>Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.</a>
<a id='line_748'>Hold you the watch tonight?</a>
<a id='line_749'></a>
<a id='line_750'>Mar. and BARNARDO.</a>
<a id='line_751'>We do, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_752'></a>
<a id='line_753'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_754'>Arm’d, say you?</a>
<a id='line_755'></a>
<a id='line_756'>Both.</a>
<a id='line_757'>Arm’d, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_758'></a>
<a id='line_759'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_760'>From top to toe?</a>
<a id='line_761'></a>
<a id='line_762'>BOTH.</a>
<a id='line_763'>My lord, from head to foot.</a>
<a id='line_764'></a>
<a id='line_765'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_766'>Then saw you not his face?</a>
<a id='line_767'></a>
<a id='line_768'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_769'>O yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.</a>
<a id='line_770'></a>
<a id='line_771'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_772'>What, look’d he frowningly?</a>
<a id='line_773'></a>
<a id='line_774'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_775'>A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.</a>
<a id='line_776'></a>
<a id='line_777'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_778'>Pale, or red?</a>
<a id='line_779'></a>
<a id='line_780'>HORATIO.</a>
<a id='line_781'>Nay, very pale.</a>

<a id='line_890'>May give his saying deed; which is no further</a>

<a id='line_946'>Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,</a>
<a id='line_947'>But not express’d in fancy; rich, not gaudy:</a>

<a id='line_1549'>As I perchance hereafter shall think meet</a>

<a id='line_1591'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_1592'>You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,</a>
<a id='line_1593'>Before you visit him, to make inquiry</a>
<a id='line_1594'>Of his behaviour.</a>
<a id='line_1595'></a>
<a id='line_1596'>REYNALDO.</a>
<a id='line_1597'>My lord, I did intend it.</a>
<a id='line_1598'></a>
<a id='line_1599'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_1600'>Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,</a>
<a id='line_1601'>Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;</a>
<a id='line_1602'>And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,</a>
<a id='line_1603'>What company, at what expense; and finding</a>
<a id='line_1604'>By this encompassment and drift of question,</a>
<a id='line_1605'>That they do know my son, come you more nearer</a>
<a id='line_1606'>Than your particular demands will touch it.</a>
<a id='line_1607'>Take you as ’twere some distant knowledge of him,</a>
<a id='line_1608'>As thus, ‘I know his father and his friends,</a>

<a id='line_1610'></a>
<a id='line_1611'>REYNALDO.</a>
<a id='line_1612'>Ay, very well, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_1613'></a>
<a id='line_1614'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_1615'>‘And in part him, but,’ you may say, ‘not well;</a>
<a id='line_1616'>But if’t be he I mean, he’s very wild;</a>
<a id='line_1617'>Addicted so and so;’ and there put on him</a>
<a id='line_1618'>What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank</a>
<a id='line_1619'>As may dishonour him; take heed of that;</a>
<a id='line_1620'>But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips</a>
<a id='line_1621'>As are companions noted and most known</a>

<a id='line_1623'></a>

<a id='line_1626'></a>
<a id='line_1627'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_1628'>Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing,</a>
<a id='line_1629'>Quarrelling, drabbing. You may go so far.</a>
<a id='line_1630'></a>
<a id='line_1631'>REYNALDO.</a>
<a id='line_1632'>My lord, that would dishonour him.</a>
<a id='line_1633'></a>
<a id='line_1634'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_1635'>Faith no, as you may season it in the charge.</a>
<a id='line_1636'>You must not put another scandal on him,</a>
<a id='line_1637'>That he is open to incontinency;</a>
<a id='line_1638'>That’s not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly</a>
<a id='line_1639'>That they may seem the taints of liberty;</a>
<a id='line_1640'>The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,</a>
<a id='line_1641'>A savageness in unreclaimed blood,</a>
<a id='line_1642'>Of general assault.</a>

<a id='line_1649'></a>
<a id='line_1650'>REYNALDO.</a>
<a id='line_1651'>Ay, my lord, I would know that.</a>
<a id='line_1652'></a>
<a id='line_1653'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_1654'>Marry, sir, here’s my drift,</a>
<a id='line_1655'>And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.</a>

<a id='line_1663'>‘Good sir,’ or so; or ‘friend,’ or ‘gentleman’—</a>

<a id='line_1669'></a>
<a id='line_1670'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_1671'>And then, sir, does he this,—</a>
<a id='line_1672'>He does—What was I about to say?</a>
<a id='line_1673'>By the mass, I was about to say something. Where did I leave?</a>
<a id='line_1674'></a>
<a id='line_1675'>REYNALDO.</a>

<a id='line_1679'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_1680'>At ‘closes in the consequence’ ay, marry!</a>
<a id='line_1681'>He closes with you thus: ‘I know the gentleman,</a>
<a id='line_1682'>I saw him yesterday, or t’other day,</a>
<a id='line_1683'>Or then, or then, with such and such; and, as you say,</a>
<a id='line_1684'>There was he gaming, there o’ertook in’s rouse,</a>
<a id='line_1685'>There falling out at tennis’: or perchance,</a>
<a id='line_1686'>‘I saw him enter such a house of sale’—</a>
<a id='line_1687'>_Videlicet_, a brothel, or so forth. See you now;</a>
<a id='line_1688'>Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;</a>
<a id='line_1689'>And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,</a>
<a id='line_1690'>With windlasses, and with assays of bias,</a>
<a id='line_1691'>By indirections find directions out.</a>
<a id='line_1692'>So by my former lecture and advice</a>
<a id='line_1693'>Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?</a>

<a id='line_1723'>How now, Ophelia, what’s the matter?</a>
<a id='line_1724'></a>
<a id='line_1725'>OPHELIA.</a>
<a id='line_1726'>Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted.</a>
<a id='line_1727'></a>
<a id='line_1728'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_1729'>With what, in the name of God?</a>
<a id='line_1730'></a>
<a id='line_1731'>OPHELIA.</a>
<a id='line_1732'>My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber,</a>
<a id='line_1733'>Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac’d,</a>
<a id='line_1734'>No hat upon his head, his stockings foul’d,</a>
<a id='line_1735'>Ungart’red, and down-gyved to his ankle,</a>
<a id='line_1736'>Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,</a>
<a id='line_1737'>And with a look so piteous in purport</a>
<a id='line_1738'>As if he had been loosed out of hell</a>
<a id='line_1739'>To speak of horrors, he comes before me.</a>
<a id='line_1740'></a>
<a id='line_1741'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_1742'>Mad for thy love?</a>
<a id='line_1743'></a>
<a id='line_1744'>OPHELIA.</a>
<a id='line_1745'>My lord, I do not know, but truly I do fear it.</a>
<a id='line_1746'></a>
<a id='line_1747'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_1748'>What said he?</a>
<a id='line_1749'></a>
<a id='line_1750'>OPHELIA.</a>
<a id='line_1751'>He took me by the wrist and held me hard;</a>
<a id='line_1752'>Then goes he to the length of all his arm;</a>
<a id='line_1753'>And with his other hand thus o’er his brow,</a>
<a id='line_1754'>He falls to such perusal of my face</a>
<a id='line_1755'>As he would draw it. Long stay’d he so,</a>
<a id='line_1756'>At last,—a little shaking of mine arm,</a>
<a id='line_1757'>And thrice his head thus waving up and down,</a>
<a id='line_1758'>He rais’d a sigh so piteous and profound</a>
<a id='line_1759'>As it did seem to shatter all his bulk</a>
<a id='line_1760'>And end his being. That done, he lets me go,</a>
<a id='line_1761'>And with his head over his shoulder turn’d</a>
<a id='line_1762'>He seem’d to find his way without his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1763'>For out o’ doors he went without their help,</a>
<a id='line_1764'>And to the last bended their light on me.</a>
<a id='line_1765'></a>
<a id='line_1766'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_1767'>Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.</a>
<a id='line_1768'>This is the very ecstasy of love,</a>
<a id='line_1769'>Whose violent property fordoes itself,</a>
<a id='line_1770'>And leads the will to desperate undertakings,</a>
<a id='line_1771'>As oft as any passion under heaven</a>
<a id='line_1772'>That does afflict our natures. I am sorry,—</a>
<a id='line_1773'>What, have you given him any hard words of late?</a>
<a id='line_1774'></a>
<a id='line_1775'>OPHELIA.</a>
<a id='line_1776'>No, my good lord; but as you did command,</a>
<a id='line_1777'>I did repel his letters and denied</a>
<a id='line_1778'>His access to me.</a>
<a id='line_1779'></a>
<a id='line_1780'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_1781'>That hath made him mad.</a>
<a id='line_1782'>I am sorry that with better heed and judgment</a>
<a id='line_1783'>I had not quoted him. I fear’d he did but trifle,</a>
<a id='line_1784'>And meant to wreck thee. But beshrew my jealousy!</a>
<a id='line_1785'>It seems it is as proper to our age</a>
<a id='line_1786'>To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions</a>
<a id='line_1787'>As it is common for the younger sort</a>
<a id='line_1788'>To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.</a>
<a id='line_1789'>This must be known, which, being kept close, might move</a>

<a id='line_2287'>To what end, my lord?</a>
<a id='line_2288'></a>
<a id='line_2289'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2290'>That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our</a>
<a id='line_2291'>fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our</a>
<a id='line_2292'>ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could</a>
<a id='line_2293'>charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent</a>
<a id='line_2294'>for or no.</a>
<a id='line_2295'></a>
<a id='line_2296'>ROSENCRANTZ.</a>
<a id='line_2297'>[_To Guildenstern._] What say you?</a>
<a id='line_2298'></a>
<a id='line_2299'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2300'>[_Aside._] Nay, then I have an eye of you. If you love me, hold not</a>
<a id='line_2301'>off.</a>
<a id='line_2302'></a>
<a id='line_2303'>GUILDENSTERN.</a>
<a id='line_2304'>My lord, we were sent for.</a>
<a id='line_2305'></a>
<a id='line_2306'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2307'>I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery,</a>
<a id='line_2308'>and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I have of</a>
<a id='line_2309'>late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custom</a>
<a id='line_2310'>of exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition that</a>
<a id='line_2311'>this goodly frame the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this</a>
<a id='line_2312'>most excellent canopy the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging</a>
<a id='line_2313'>firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it</a>
<a id='line_2314'>appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of</a>
<a id='line_2315'>vapours. What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason? How infinite</a>
<a id='line_2316'>in faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable? In action</a>
<a id='line_2317'>how like an angel? In apprehension, how like a god? The beauty of the</a>
<a id='line_2318'>world, the paragon of animals. And yet, to me, what is this</a>
<a id='line_2319'>quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman neither,</a>
<a id='line_2320'>though by your smiling you seem to say so.</a>
<a id='line_2321'></a>
<a id='line_2322'>ROSENCRANTZ.</a>
<a id='line_2323'>My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.</a>
<a id='line_2324'></a>
<a id='line_2325'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2326'>Why did you laugh then, when I said ‘Man delights not me’?</a>
<a id='line_2327'></a>
<a id='line_2328'>ROSENCRANTZ.</a>
<a id='line_2329'>To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what Lenten entertainment</a>
<a id='line_2330'>the players shall receive from you. We coted them on the way, and</a>
<a id='line_2331'>hither are they coming to offer you service.</a>
<a id='line_2332'></a>
<a id='line_2333'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2334'>He that plays the king shall be welcome,—his Majesty shall have tribute</a>
<a id='line_2335'>of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover</a>
<a id='line_2336'>shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace;</a>
<a id='line_2337'>the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a’ th’ sere;</a>
<a id='line_2338'>and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt</a>
<a id='line_2339'>for’t. What players are they?</a>
<a id='line_2340'></a>
<a id='line_2341'>ROSENCRANTZ.</a>
<a id='line_2342'>Even those you were wont to take such delight in—the tragedians of the</a>
<a id='line_2343'>city.</a>
<a id='line_2344'></a>
<a id='line_2345'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2346'>How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputation and</a>
<a id='line_2347'>profit, was better both ways.</a>
<a id='line_2348'></a>
<a id='line_2349'>ROSENCRANTZ.</a>
<a id='line_2350'>I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.</a>
<a id='line_2351'></a>
<a id='line_2352'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2353'>Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are</a>
<a id='line_2354'>they so followed?</a>
<a id='line_2355'></a>
<a id='line_2356'>ROSENCRANTZ.</a>
<a id='line_2357'>No, indeed, they are not.</a>
<a id='line_2358'></a>
<a id='line_2359'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2360'>How comes it? Do they grow rusty?</a>
<a id='line_2361'></a>
<a id='line_2362'>ROSENCRANTZ.</a>
<a id='line_2363'>Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, sir, an</a>
<a id='line_2364'>ayry of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question,</a>
<a id='line_2365'>and are most tyrannically clapped for’t. These are now the fashion, and</a>
<a id='line_2366'>so berattle the common stages—so they call them—that many wearing</a>
<a id='line_2367'>rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.</a>
<a id='line_2368'></a>
<a id='line_2369'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2370'>What, are they children? Who maintains ’em? How are they escoted? Will</a>
<a id='line_2371'>they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? Will they not say</a>
<a id='line_2372'>afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players—as it is</a>
<a id='line_2373'>most like, if their means are no better—their writers do them wrong to</a>
<a id='line_2374'>make them exclaim against their own succession?</a>
<a id='line_2375'></a>
<a id='line_2376'>ROSENCRANTZ.</a>
<a id='line_2377'>Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it</a>
<a id='line_2378'>no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was for a while, no money</a>
<a id='line_2379'>bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the</a>
<a id='line_2380'>question.</a>
<a id='line_2381'></a>
<a id='line_2382'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2383'>Is’t possible?</a>
<a id='line_2384'></a>
<a id='line_2385'>GUILDENSTERN.</a>
<a id='line_2386'>O, there has been much throwing about of brains.</a>
<a id='line_2387'></a>
<a id='line_2388'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2389'>Do the boys carry it away?</a>
<a id='line_2390'></a>
<a id='line_2391'>ROSENCRANTZ.</a>
<a id='line_2392'>Ay, that they do, my lord. Hercules and his load too.</a>
<a id='line_2393'></a>
<a id='line_2394'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2395'>It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that</a>
<a id='line_2396'>would make mouths at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty,</a>
<a id='line_2397'>fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little. ’Sblood,</a>
<a id='line_2398'>there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find</a>
<a id='line_2399'>it out.</a>

<a id='line_2405'></a>
<a id='line_2406'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2407'>Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come. The</a>
<a id='line_2408'>appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply with you</a>
<a id='line_2409'>in this garb, lest my extent to the players, which I tell you must show</a>
<a id='line_2410'>fairly outward, should more appear like entertainment than yours. You</a>
<a id='line_2411'>are welcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.</a>
<a id='line_2412'></a>
<a id='line_2413'>GUILDENSTERN.</a>

<a id='line_2415'></a>
<a id='line_2416'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2417'>I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly, I know a</a>

<a id='line_2421'></a>
<a id='line_2422'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_2423'>Well be with you, gentlemen.</a>
<a id='line_2424'></a>
<a id='line_2425'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2426'>Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too, at each ear a hearer. That great</a>

<a id='line_2428'></a>
<a id='line_2429'>ROSENCRANTZ.</a>
<a id='line_2430'>Happily he’s the second time come to them; for they say an old man is</a>

<a id='line_2432'></a>
<a id='line_2433'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2434'>I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.—You say</a>
<a id='line_2435'>right, sir: for a Monday morning ’twas so indeed.</a>
<a id='line_2436'></a>
<a id='line_2437'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_2438'>My lord, I have news to tell you.</a>
<a id='line_2439'></a>
<a id='line_2440'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2441'>My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome—</a>
<a id='line_2442'></a>
<a id='line_2443'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_2444'>The actors are come hither, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2445'></a>
<a id='line_2446'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2447'>Buzz, buzz.</a>
<a id='line_2448'></a>
<a id='line_2449'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_2450'>Upon my honour.</a>
<a id='line_2451'></a>
<a id='line_2452'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2453'>Then came each actor on his ass—</a>
<a id='line_2454'></a>
<a id='line_2455'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_2456'>The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history,</a>
<a id='line_2457'>pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical,</a>
<a id='line_2458'>tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem</a>
<a id='line_2459'>unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light, for the</a>
<a id='line_2460'>law of writ and the liberty. These are the only men.</a>

<a id='line_2462'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2463'>O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!</a>

<a id='line_2470'>   ’One fair daughter, and no more,</a>
<a id='line_2471'>   The which he loved passing well.’</a>
<a id='line_2472'></a>

<a id='line_2488'></a>
<a id='line_2489'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2490'>Why,</a>
<a id='line_2491'>   As by lot, God wot,</a>
<a id='line_2492'>and then, you know,</a>
<a id='line_2493'>   It came to pass, as most like it was.</a>
<a id='line_2494'>The first row of the pious chanson will show you more. For look where</a>
<a id='line_2495'>my abridgement comes.</a>
<a id='line_2496'></a>
<a id='line_2497'> Enter four or five Players.</a>
<a id='line_2498'></a>
<a id='line_2499'>You are welcome, masters, welcome all. I am glad to see thee well.</a>
<a id='line_2500'>Welcome, good friends. O, my old friend! Thy face is valanc’d since I</a>
<a id='line_2501'>saw thee last. Com’st thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady</a>
<a id='line_2502'>and mistress! By’r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I</a>
<a id='line_2503'>saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a</a>
<a id='line_2504'>piece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. Masters, you</a>
<a id='line_2505'>are all welcome. We’ll e’en to’t like French falconers, fly at anything</a>
<a id='line_2506'>we see. We’ll have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your</a>
<a id='line_2507'>quality. Come, a passionate speech.</a>
<a id='line_2508'></a>
<a id='line_2509'>FIRST PLAYER.</a>
<a id='line_2510'>What speech, my lord?</a>
<a id='line_2511'></a>
<a id='line_2512'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2513'>I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it</a>
<a id='line_2514'>was, not above once, for the play, I remember, pleased not the million,</a>
<a id='line_2515'>’twas caviare to the general. But it was—as I received it, and others,</a>
<a id='line_2516'>whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent</a>
<a id='line_2517'>play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as</a>
<a id='line_2518'>cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make</a>
<a id='line_2519'>the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the</a>
<a id='line_2520'>author of affectation, but called it an honest method, as wholesome as</a>
<a id='line_2521'>sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it, I</a>
<a id='line_2522'>chiefly loved. ’Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido, and thereabout of it</a>
<a id='line_2523'>especially where he speaks of Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your</a>
<a id='line_2524'>memory, begin at this line, let me see, let me see:</a>
<a id='line_2525'>   _The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast,—_</a>
<a id='line_2526'>It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus—</a>
<a id='line_2527'>   _The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,</a>
<a id='line_2528'>   Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</a>
<a id='line_2529'>   When he lay couched in the ominous horse,</a>
<a id='line_2530'>   Hath now this dread and black complexion smear’d</a>
<a id='line_2531'>   With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot</a>
<a id='line_2532'>   Now is he total gules, horridly trick’d</a>
<a id='line_2533'>   With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,</a>
<a id='line_2534'>   Bak’d and impasted with the parching streets,</a>
<a id='line_2535'>   That lend a tyrannous and a damned light</a>
<a id='line_2536'>   To their vile murders. Roasted in wrath and fire,</a>
<a id='line_2537'>   And thus o’ersized with coagulate gore,</a>
<a id='line_2538'>   With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus</a>
<a id='line_2539'>   Old grandsire Priam seeks._</a>
<a id='line_2540'>So, proceed you.</a>
<a id='line_2541'></a>
<a id='line_2542'>POLONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_2543'>’Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.</a>
<a id='line_2544'></a>
<a id='line_2545'>FIRST PLAYER.</a>
<a id='line_2546'>   _Anon he finds him,</a>
<a id='line_2547'>   Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,</a>
<a id='line_2548'>   Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,</a>
<a id='line_2549'>   Repugnant to command. Unequal match’d,</a>
<a id='line_2550'>   Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;</a>
<a id='line_2551'>   But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword</a>
<a id='line_2552'>   Th’unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,</a>
<a id='line_2553'>   Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top</a>
<a id='line_2554'>   Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash</a>
<a id='line_2555'>   Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear. For lo, his sword,</a>
<a id='line_2556'>   Which was declining on the milky head</a>
<a id='line_2557'>   Of reverend Priam, seem’d i’ th’air to stick.</a>
<a id='line_2558'>   So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,</a>
<a id='line_2559'>   And like a neutral to his will and matter,</a>
<a id='line_2560'>   Did nothing.</a>
<a id='line_2561'>   But as we often see against some storm,</a>
<a id='line_2562'>   A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,</a>
<a id='line_2563'>   The bold winds speechless, and the orb below</a>
<a id='line_2564'>   As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder</a>
<a id='line_2565'>   Doth rend the region; so after Pyrrhus’ pause,</a>
<a id='line_2566'>   Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work,</a>
<a id='line_2567'>   And never did the Cyclops’ hammers fall</a>
<a id='line_2568'>   On Mars’s armour, forg’d for proof eterne,</a>
<a id='line_2569'>   With less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword</a>
<a id='line_2570'>   Now falls on Priam.</a>
<a id='line_2571'>   Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,</a>
<a id='line_2572'>   In general synod, take away her power;</a>
<a id='line_2573'>   Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,</a>
<a id='line_2574'>   And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,</a>

<a id='line_2837'></a>
<a id='line_2838'>HAMLET.</a>
<a id='line_2839'>To be, or not to be, that is the question:</a>
<a id='line_2840'>Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer</a>
<a id='line_2841'>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</a>
<a id='line_2842'>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</a>
<a id='line_2843'>And by opposing end them? To die—to sleep,</a>

<a id='line_2845'>The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks</a>
<a id='line_2846'>That flesh is heir to: ’tis a consummation</a>
<a id='line_2847'>Devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep.</a>
<a id='line_2848'>To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub,</a>

<a id='line_2850'>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</a>
<a id='line_2851'>Must give us pause. There’s the respect</a>
<a id='line_2852'>That makes calamity of so long life.</a>
<a id='line_2853'>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</a>
<a id='line_2854'>The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,</a>
<a id='line_2855'>The pangs of dispriz’d love, the law’s delay,</a>
<a id='line_2856'>The insolence of office, and the spurns</a>
<a id='line_2857'>That patient merit of the unworthy takes,</a>
<a id='line_2858'>When he himself might his quietus make</a>
<a id='line_2859'>With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,</a>
<a id='line_2860'>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</a>
<a id='line_2861'>But that the dread of something after death,</a>
<a id='line_2862'>The undiscover’d country, from whose bourn</a>
<a id='line_2863'>No traveller returns, puzzles the will,</a>
<a id='line_2864'>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</a>
<a id='line_2865'>Than fly to others that we know not of?</a>

<a id='line_2867'>And thus the native hue of resolution</a>

<a id='line_3034'>with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent,</a>
<a id='line_3035'>tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and</a>
<a id='line_3036'>beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the</a>
<a id='line_3037'>soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to</a>
<a id='line_3038'>tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who, for</a>
<a id='line_3039'>the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and</a>

<a id='line_3052'>to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age</a>
<a id='line_3053'>and body of the time his form and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come</a>
<a id='line_3054'>tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the</a>
<a id='line_3055'>judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance</a>
<a id='line_3056'>o’erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have</a>

<a id='line_3058'>profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians, nor the gait</a>
<a id='line_3059'>of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have</a>
<a id='line_3060'>thought some of Nature’s journeymen had made men, and not made them</a>

<a id='line_3070'>too, though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then</a>

<a id='line_5207'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_5208'>It falls right.</a>
<a id='line_5209'>You have been talk’d of since your travel much,</a>
<a id='line_5210'>And that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality</a>
<a id='line_5211'>Wherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts</a>
<a id='line_5212'>Did not together pluck such envy from him</a>
<a id='line_5213'>As did that one, and that, in my regard,</a>

<a id='line_5219'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_5220'>A very riband in the cap of youth,</a>

<a id='line_5222'>The light and careless livery that it wears</a>
<a id='line_5223'>Than settled age his sables and his weeds,</a>

<a id='line_5225'>Here was a gentleman of Normandy,—</a>
<a id='line_5226'>I’ve seen myself, and serv’d against, the French,</a>
<a id='line_5227'>And they can well on horseback, but this gallant</a>
<a id='line_5228'>Had witchcraft in’t. He grew unto his seat,</a>
<a id='line_5229'>And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,</a>
<a id='line_5230'>As had he been incorps’d and demi-natur’d</a>
<a id='line_5231'>With the brave beast. So far he topp’d my thought</a>
<a id='line_5232'>That I in forgery of shapes and tricks,</a>

<a id='line_5250'></a>
<a id='line_5251'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_5252'>He made confession of you,</a>

<a id='line_5255'>And for your rapier most especially,</a>
<a id='line_5256'>That he cried out ’twould be a sight indeed</a>

<a id='line_5260'>Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy</a>
<a id='line_5261'>That he could nothing do but wish and beg</a>
<a id='line_5262'>Your sudden coming o’er to play with him.</a>

<a id='line_5267'></a>
<a id='line_5268'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_5269'>Laertes, was your father dear to you?</a>
<a id='line_5270'>Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,</a>
<a id='line_5271'>A face without a heart?</a>
<a id='line_5272'></a>
<a id='line_5273'>LAERTES.</a>
<a id='line_5274'>Why ask you this?</a>
<a id='line_5275'></a>
<a id='line_5276'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_5277'>Not that I think you did not love your father,</a>
<a id='line_5278'>But that I know love is begun by time,</a>
<a id='line_5279'>And that I see, in passages of proof,</a>
<a id='line_5280'>Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.</a>
<a id='line_5281'>There lives within the very flame of love</a>
<a id='line_5282'>A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;</a>
<a id='line_5283'>And nothing is at a like goodness still,</a>
<a id='line_5284'>For goodness, growing to a pleurisy,</a>
<a id='line_5285'>Dies in his own too much. That we would do,</a>
<a id='line_5286'>We should do when we would; for this ‘would’ changes,</a>
<a id='line_5287'>And hath abatements and delays as many</a>
<a id='line_5288'>As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;</a>
<a id='line_5289'>And then this ‘should’ is like a spendthrift sigh</a>
<a id='line_5290'>That hurts by easing. But to the quick o’ th’ulcer:</a>
<a id='line_5291'>Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake</a>
<a id='line_5292'>To show yourself your father’s son in deed,</a>
<a id='line_5293'>More than in words?</a>
<a id='line_5294'></a>
<a id='line_5295'>LAERTES.</a>
<a id='line_5296'>To cut his throat i’ th’ church.</a>
<a id='line_5297'></a>
<a id='line_5298'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_5299'>No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;</a>
<a id='line_5300'>Revenge should have no bounds. But good Laertes,</a>
<a id='line_5301'>Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.</a>
<a id='line_5302'>Hamlet return’d shall know you are come home:</a>
<a id='line_5303'>We’ll put on those shall praise your excellence,</a>
<a id='line_5304'>And set a double varnish on the fame</a>
<a id='line_5305'>The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together</a>
<a id='line_5306'>And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,</a>
<a id='line_5307'>Most generous, and free from all contriving,</a>
<a id='line_5308'>Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,</a>
<a id='line_5309'>Or with a little shuffling, you may choose</a>
<a id='line_5310'>A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice,</a>
<a id='line_5311'>Requite him for your father.</a>
<a id='line_5312'></a>
<a id='line_5313'>LAERTES.</a>
<a id='line_5314'>I will do’t.</a>
<a id='line_5315'>And for that purpose I’ll anoint my sword.</a>
<a id='line_5316'>I bought an unction of a mountebank</a>
<a id='line_5317'>So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,</a>
<a id='line_5318'>Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,</a>
<a id='line_5319'>Collected from all simples that have virtue</a>
<a id='line_5320'>Under the moon, can save the thing from death</a>
<a id='line_5321'>This is but scratch’d withal. I’ll touch my point</a>
<a id='line_5322'>With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,</a>
<a id='line_5323'>It may be death.</a>
<a id='line_5324'></a>
<a id='line_5325'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_5326'>Let’s further think of this,</a>
<a id='line_5327'>Weigh what convenience both of time and means</a>
<a id='line_5328'>May fit us to our shape. If this should fail,</a>
<a id='line_5329'>And that our drift look through our bad performance.</a>
<a id='line_5330'>’Twere better not assay’d. Therefore this project</a>
<a id='line_5331'>Should have a back or second, that might hold</a>

<a id='line_5333'>We’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,—</a>
<a id='line_5334'>I ha’t! When in your motion you are hot and dry,</a>

<a id='line_5336'>And that he calls for drink, I’ll have prepar’d him</a>
<a id='line_5337'>A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,</a>
<a id='line_5338'>If he by chance escape your venom’d stuck,</a>

<a id='line_5351'></a>

<a id='line_5353'>There is a willow grows aslant a brook,</a>
<a id='line_5354'>That shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream.</a>
<a id='line_5355'>There with fantastic garlands did she make</a>
<a id='line_5356'>Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,</a>
<a id='line_5357'>That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,</a>

<a id='line_5359'>There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds</a>
<a id='line_5360'>Clamb’ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,</a>
<a id='line_5361'>When down her weedy trophies and herself</a>
<a id='line_5362'>Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,</a>
<a id='line_5363'>And mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up,</a>
<a id='line_5364'>Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,</a>
<a id='line_5365'>As one incapable of her own distress,</a>
<a id='line_5366'>Or like a creature native and indued</a>
<a id='line_5367'>Unto that element. But long it could not be</a>
<a id='line_5368'>Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,</a>
<a id='line_5369'>Pull’d the poor wretch from her melodious lay</a>

<a id='line_5417'>Why, ’tis found so.</a>
<a id='line_5418'></a>
<a id='line_5419'>FIRST CLOWN.</a>
<a id='line_5420'>It must be _se offendendo_, it cannot be else. For here lies the point:</a>
<a id='line_5421'>if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three</a>
<a id='line_5422'>branches. It is to act, to do, and to perform: argal, she drowned</a>

<a id='line_5431'>goes,—mark you that. But if the water come to him and drown him, he</a>

<a id='line_6107'>excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing. Indeed,</a>
<a id='line_6108'>to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry; for</a>
<a id='line_6109'>you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.</a>

<a id='line_6115'>extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of</a>
<a id='line_6116'>such dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblable</a>
