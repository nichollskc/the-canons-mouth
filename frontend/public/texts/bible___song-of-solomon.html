                    <a id='line_0'>The Song of Solomon</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The song of songs, which is Solomon’s.</a>
<a id='line_4'></a>
<a id='line_5'>1:2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is</a>
<a id='line_6'>better than wine.</a>
<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>1:3 Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as</a>
<a id='line_9'>ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.</a>
<a id='line_10'></a>
<a id='line_11'>1:4 Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his</a>
<a id='line_12'>chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy</a>
<a id='line_13'>love more than wine: the upright love thee.</a>
<a id='line_14'></a>
<a id='line_15'>1:5 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents</a>
<a id='line_16'>of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</a>
<a id='line_17'></a>
<a id='line_18'>1:6 Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked</a>
<a id='line_19'>upon me: my mother’s children were angry with me; they made me the</a>
<a id='line_20'>keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>1:7 Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where</a>
<a id='line_23'>thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that</a>
<a id='line_24'>turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?  1:8 If thou know not,</a>
<a id='line_25'>O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the</a>
<a id='line_26'>flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents.</a>
<a id='line_27'></a>
<a id='line_28'>1:9 I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in</a>
<a id='line_29'>Pharaoh’s chariots.</a>
<a id='line_30'></a>
<a id='line_31'>1:10 Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains</a>
<a id='line_32'>of gold.</a>
<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'>1:11 We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.</a>
<a id='line_35'></a>
<a id='line_36'>1:12 While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth</a>
<a id='line_37'>the smell thereof.</a>
<a id='line_38'></a>
<a id='line_39'>1:13 A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all</a>
<a id='line_40'>night betwixt my breasts.</a>
<a id='line_41'></a>
<a id='line_42'>1:14 My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards</a>
<a id='line_43'>of Engedi.</a>
<a id='line_44'></a>
<a id='line_45'>1:15 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast</a>
<a id='line_46'>doves’ eyes.</a>
<a id='line_47'></a>
<a id='line_48'>1:16 Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is</a>
<a id='line_49'>green.</a>
<a id='line_50'></a>
<a id='line_51'>1:17 The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>2:1 I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.</a>
<a id='line_54'></a>
<a id='line_55'>2:2 As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.</a>
<a id='line_56'></a>
<a id='line_57'>2:3 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved</a>
<a id='line_58'>among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and</a>
<a id='line_59'>his fruit was sweet to my taste.</a>
<a id='line_60'></a>
<a id='line_61'>2:4 He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was</a>
<a id='line_62'>love.</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>2:5 Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of</a>
<a id='line_65'>love.</a>
<a id='line_66'></a>
<a id='line_67'>2:6 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace</a>
<a id='line_68'>me.</a>
<a id='line_69'></a>
<a id='line_70'>2:7 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the</a>
<a id='line_71'>hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he</a>
<a id='line_72'>please.</a>
<a id='line_73'></a>
<a id='line_74'>2:8 The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the</a>
<a id='line_75'>mountains, skipping upon the hills.</a>
<a id='line_76'></a>
<a id='line_77'>2:9 My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth</a>
<a id='line_78'>behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself</a>
<a id='line_79'>through the lattice.</a>
<a id='line_80'></a>
<a id='line_81'>2:10 My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair</a>
<a id='line_82'>one, and come away.</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>2:11 For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; 2:12 The</a>
<a id='line_85'>flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come,</a>
<a id='line_86'>and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; 2:13 The fig tree</a>
<a id='line_87'>putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give</a>
<a id='line_88'>a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>2:14 O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret</a>
<a id='line_91'>places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy</a>
<a id='line_92'>voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>2:15 Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for</a>
<a id='line_95'>our vines have tender grapes.</a>
<a id='line_96'></a>
<a id='line_97'>2:16 My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.</a>
<a id='line_98'></a>
<a id='line_99'>2:17 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved,</a>
<a id='line_100'>and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>3:1 By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him,</a>
<a id='line_103'>but I found him not.</a>
<a id='line_104'></a>
<a id='line_105'>3:2 I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the</a>
<a id='line_106'>broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I</a>
<a id='line_107'>found him not.</a>
<a id='line_108'></a>
<a id='line_109'>3:3 The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw</a>
<a id='line_110'>ye him whom my soul loveth?  3:4 It was but a little that I passed</a>
<a id='line_111'>from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would</a>
<a id='line_112'>not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother’s house, and</a>
<a id='line_113'>into the chamber of her that conceived me.</a>
<a id='line_114'></a>
<a id='line_115'>3:5 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the</a>
<a id='line_116'>hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he</a>
<a id='line_117'>please.</a>
<a id='line_118'></a>
<a id='line_119'>3:6 Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of</a>
<a id='line_120'>smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the</a>
<a id='line_121'>merchant?  3:7 Behold his bed, which is Solomon’s; threescore valiant</a>
<a id='line_122'>men are about it, of the valiant of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_123'></a>
<a id='line_124'>3:8 They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his</a>
<a id='line_125'>sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.</a>
<a id='line_126'></a>
<a id='line_127'>3:9 King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.</a>
<a id='line_128'></a>
<a id='line_129'>3:10 He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of</a>
<a id='line_130'>gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with</a>
<a id='line_131'>love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_132'></a>
<a id='line_133'>3:11 Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with</a>
<a id='line_134'>the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his</a>
<a id='line_135'>espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.</a>
<a id='line_136'></a>
<a id='line_137'>4:1 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast</a>
<a id='line_138'>doves’ eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that</a>
<a id='line_139'>appear from mount Gilead.</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>4:2 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which</a>
<a id='line_142'>came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is</a>
<a id='line_143'>barren among them.</a>
<a id='line_144'></a>
<a id='line_145'>4:3 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely:</a>
<a id='line_146'>thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>4:4 Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury,</a>
<a id='line_149'>whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.</a>
<a id='line_150'></a>
<a id='line_151'>4:5 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed</a>
<a id='line_152'>among the lilies.</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>4:6 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to</a>
<a id='line_155'>the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>4:7 Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.</a>
<a id='line_158'></a>
<a id='line_159'>4:8 Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look</a>
<a id='line_160'>from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the</a>
<a id='line_161'>lions’ dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</a>
<a id='line_162'></a>
<a id='line_163'>4:9 Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast</a>
<a id='line_164'>ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.</a>
<a id='line_165'></a>
<a id='line_166'>4:10 How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is</a>
<a id='line_167'>thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!</a>
<a id='line_168'>4:11 Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are</a>
<a id='line_169'>under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of</a>
<a id='line_170'>Lebanon.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>4:12 A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a</a>
<a id='line_173'>fountain sealed.</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>4:13 Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits;</a>
<a id='line_176'>camphire, with spikenard, 4:14 Spikenard and saffron; calamus and</a>
<a id='line_177'>cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all</a>
<a id='line_178'>the chief spices: 4:15 A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters,</a>
<a id='line_179'>and streams from Lebanon.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>4:16 Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden,</a>
<a id='line_182'>that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his</a>
<a id='line_183'>garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.</a>
<a id='line_184'></a>
<a id='line_185'>5:1 I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my</a>
<a id='line_186'>myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have</a>
<a id='line_187'>drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink</a>
<a id='line_188'>abundantly, O beloved.</a>
<a id='line_189'></a>
<a id='line_190'>5:2 I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that</a>
<a id='line_191'>knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my</a>
<a id='line_192'>undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops</a>
<a id='line_193'>of the night.</a>
<a id='line_194'></a>
<a id='line_195'>5:3 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my</a>
<a id='line_196'>feet; how shall I defile them?  5:4 My beloved put in his hand by the</a>
<a id='line_197'>hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>5:5 I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh,</a>
<a id='line_200'>and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the</a>
<a id='line_201'>lock.</a>
<a id='line_202'></a>
<a id='line_203'>5:6 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and</a>
<a id='line_204'>was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not</a>
<a id='line_205'>find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</a>
<a id='line_206'></a>
<a id='line_207'>5:7 The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me,</a>
<a id='line_208'>they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.</a>
<a id='line_209'></a>
<a id='line_210'>5:8 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved,</a>
<a id='line_211'>that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.</a>
<a id='line_212'></a>
<a id='line_213'>5:9 What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest</a>
<a id='line_214'>among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou</a>
<a id='line_215'>dost so charge us?  5:10 My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest</a>
<a id='line_216'>among ten thousand.</a>
<a id='line_217'></a>
<a id='line_218'>5:11 His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black</a>
<a id='line_219'>as a raven.</a>
<a id='line_220'></a>
<a id='line_221'>5:12 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed</a>
<a id='line_222'>with milk, and fitly set.</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>5:13 His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips</a>
<a id='line_225'>like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>5:14 His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as</a>
<a id='line_228'>bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.</a>
<a id='line_229'></a>
<a id='line_230'>5:15 His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold:</a>
<a id='line_231'>his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</a>
<a id='line_232'></a>
<a id='line_233'>5:16 His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my</a>
<a id='line_234'>beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_235'></a>
<a id='line_236'>6:1 Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither</a>
<a id='line_237'>is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.</a>
<a id='line_238'></a>
<a id='line_239'>6:2 My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to</a>
<a id='line_240'>feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</a>
<a id='line_241'></a>
<a id='line_242'>6:3 I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the</a>
<a id='line_243'>lilies.</a>
<a id='line_244'></a>
<a id='line_245'>6:4 Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_246'>terrible as an army with banners.</a>
<a id='line_247'></a>
<a id='line_248'>6:5 Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair</a>
<a id='line_249'>is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.</a>
<a id='line_250'></a>
<a id='line_251'>6:6 Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing,</a>
<a id='line_252'>whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among</a>
<a id='line_253'>them.</a>
<a id='line_254'></a>
<a id='line_255'>6:7 As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.</a>
<a id='line_256'></a>
<a id='line_257'>6:8 There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins</a>
<a id='line_258'>without number.</a>
<a id='line_259'></a>
<a id='line_260'>6:9 My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her</a>
<a id='line_261'>mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw</a>
<a id='line_262'>her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they</a>
<a id='line_263'>praised her.</a>
<a id='line_264'></a>
<a id='line_265'>6:10 Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon,</a>
<a id='line_266'>clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?  6:11 I went</a>
<a id='line_267'>down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to</a>
<a id='line_268'>see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded.</a>
<a id='line_269'></a>
<a id='line_270'>6:12 Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of</a>
<a id='line_271'>Amminadib.</a>
<a id='line_272'></a>
<a id='line_273'>6:13 Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look</a>
<a id='line_274'>upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company</a>
<a id='line_275'>of two armies.</a>
<a id='line_276'></a>
<a id='line_277'>7:1 How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince’s daughter! the</a>
<a id='line_278'>joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a</a>
<a id='line_279'>cunning workman.</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>7:2 Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy</a>
<a id='line_282'>belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.</a>
<a id='line_283'></a>
<a id='line_284'>7:3 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.</a>
<a id='line_285'></a>
<a id='line_286'>7:4 Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in</a>
<a id='line_287'>Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of</a>
<a id='line_288'>Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.</a>
<a id='line_289'></a>
<a id='line_290'>7:5 Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head</a>
<a id='line_291'>like purple; the king is held in the galleries.</a>
<a id='line_292'></a>
<a id='line_293'>7:6 How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!  7:7</a>
<a id='line_294'>This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters</a>
<a id='line_295'>of grapes.</a>
<a id='line_296'></a>
<a id='line_297'>7:8 I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the</a>
<a id='line_298'>boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine,</a>
<a id='line_299'>and the smell of thy nose like apples; 7:9 And the roof of thy mouth</a>
<a id='line_300'>like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing</a>
<a id='line_301'>the lips of those that are asleep to speak.</a>
<a id='line_302'></a>
<a id='line_303'>7:10 I am my beloved’s, and his desire is toward me.</a>
<a id='line_304'></a>
<a id='line_305'>7:11 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in</a>
<a id='line_306'>the villages.</a>
<a id='line_307'></a>
<a id='line_308'>7:12 Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine</a>
<a id='line_309'>flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud</a>
<a id='line_310'>forth: there will I give thee my loves.</a>
<a id='line_311'></a>
<a id='line_312'>7:13 The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of</a>
<a id='line_313'>pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my</a>
<a id='line_314'>beloved.</a>
<a id='line_315'></a>
<a id='line_316'>8:1 O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my</a>
<a id='line_317'>mother!  when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I</a>
<a id='line_318'>should not be despised.</a>
<a id='line_319'></a>
<a id='line_320'>8:2 I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother’s house, who</a>
<a id='line_321'>would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the</a>
<a id='line_322'>juice of my pomegranate.</a>
<a id='line_323'></a>
<a id='line_324'>8:3 His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should</a>
<a id='line_325'>embrace me.</a>

<a id='line_327'>8:4 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor</a>
<a id='line_328'>awake my love, until he please.</a>
<a id='line_329'></a>
<a id='line_330'>8:5 Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her</a>
<a id='line_331'>beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother</a>
<a id='line_332'>brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.</a>
<a id='line_333'></a>
<a id='line_334'>8:6 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for</a>
<a id='line_335'>love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals</a>
<a id='line_336'>thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.</a>
<a id='line_337'></a>
<a id='line_338'>8:7 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it:</a>
<a id='line_339'>if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would</a>
<a id='line_340'>utterly be contemned.</a>
<a id='line_341'></a>
<a id='line_342'>8:8 We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do</a>
<a id='line_343'>for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?  8:9 If she be</a>
<a id='line_344'>a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a</a>
<a id='line_345'>door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.</a>
<a id='line_346'></a>
<a id='line_347'>8:10 I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes</a>
<a id='line_348'>as one that found favour.</a>
<a id='line_349'></a>
<a id='line_350'>8:11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto</a>
<a id='line_351'>keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand</a>
<a id='line_352'>pieces of silver.</a>
<a id='line_353'></a>
<a id='line_354'>8:12 My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must</a>
<a id='line_355'>have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.</a>
<a id='line_356'></a>
<a id='line_357'>8:13 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy</a>
<a id='line_358'>voice: cause me to hear it.</a>
<a id='line_359'></a>
<a id='line_360'>8:14 Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young</a>
<a id='line_361'>hart upon the mountains of spices.</a>
