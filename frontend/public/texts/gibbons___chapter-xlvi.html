<a id='line_11'>      The conflict of Rome and Persia was prolonged from the death of</a>
<a id='line_12'>      Craesus to the reign of Heraclius. An experience of seven hundred</a>
<a id='line_13'>      years might convince the rival nations of the impossibility of</a>
<a id='line_14'>      maintaining their conquests beyond the fatal limits of the Tigris</a>
<a id='line_15'>      and Euphrates. Yet the emulation of Trajan and Julian was</a>
<a id='line_16'>      awakened by the trophies of Alexander, and the sovereigns of</a>
<a id='line_17'>      Persia indulged the ambitious hope of restoring the empire of</a>
<a id='line_18'>      Cyrus. 1 Such extraordinary efforts of power and courage will</a>
<a id='line_19'>      always command the attention of posterity; but the events by</a>
<a id='line_20'>      which the fate of nations is not materially changed, leave a</a>
<a id='line_21'>      faint impression on the page of history, and the patience of the</a>
<a id='line_22'>      reader would be exhausted by the repetition of the same</a>
<a id='line_23'>      hostilities, undertaken without cause, prosecuted without glory,</a>
<a id='line_24'>      and terminated without effect. The arts of negotiation, unknown</a>
<a id='line_25'>      to the simple greatness of the senate and the Caesars, were</a>
<a id='line_26'>      assiduously cultivated by the Byzantine princes; and the</a>
<a id='line_27'>      memorials of their perpetual embassies 2 repeat, with the same</a>
<a id='line_28'>      uniform prolixity, the language of falsehood and declamation, the</a>
<a id='line_29'>      insolence of the Barbarians, and the servile temper of the</a>
<a id='line_30'>      tributary Greeks. Lamenting the barren superfluity of materials,</a>
<a id='line_31'>      I have studied to compress the narrative of these uninteresting</a>
<a id='line_32'>      transactions: but the just Nushirvan is still applauded as the</a>
<a id='line_33'>      model of Oriental kings, and the ambition of his grandson</a>
<a id='line_34'>      Chosroes prepared the revolution of the East, which was speedily</a>

<a id='line_47'></a>
<a id='line_48'>      In the useless altercations, that precede and justify the</a>
<a id='line_49'>      quarrels of princes, the Greeks and the Barbarians accused each</a>
<a id='line_50'>      other of violating the peace which had been concluded between the</a>
<a id='line_51'>      two empires about four years before the death of Justinian. The</a>
<a id='line_52'>      sovereign of Persia and India aspired to reduce under his</a>
<a id='line_53'>      obedience the province of Yemen or Arabia 3 Felix; the distant</a>
<a id='line_54'>      land of myrrh and frankincense, which had escaped, rather than</a>
<a id='line_55'>      opposed, the conquerors of the East. After the defeat of Abrahah</a>
<a id='line_56'>      under the walls of Mecca, the discord of his sons and brothers</a>
<a id='line_57'>      gave an easy entrance to the Persians: they chased the strangers</a>
<a id='line_58'>      of Abyssinia beyond the Red Sea; and a native prince of the</a>
<a id='line_59'>      ancient Homerites was restored to the throne as the vassal or</a>
<a id='line_60'>      viceroy of the great Nushirvan. 4 But the nephew of Justinian</a>
<a id='line_61'>      declared his resolution to avenge the injuries of his Christian</a>
<a id='line_62'>      ally the prince of Abyssinia, as they suggested a decent pretence</a>
<a id='line_63'>      to discontinue the annual tribute, which was poorly disguised by</a>
<a id='line_64'>      the name of pension. The churches of Persarmenia were oppressed</a>
<a id='line_65'>      by the intolerant spirit of the Magi; 411 they secretly invoked</a>
<a id='line_66'>      the protector of the Christians, and, after the pious murder of</a>
<a id='line_67'>      their satraps, the rebels were avowed and supported as the</a>
<a id='line_68'>      brethren and subjects of the Roman emperor. The complaints of</a>
<a id='line_69'>      Nushirvan were disregarded by the Byzantine court; Justin yielded</a>
<a id='line_70'>      to the importunities of the Turks, who offered an alliance</a>
<a id='line_71'>      against the common enemy; and the Persian monarchy was threatened</a>
<a id='line_72'>      at the same instant by the united forces of Europe, of Aethiopia,</a>
<a id='line_73'>      and of Scythia. At the age of fourscore the sovereign of the East</a>
<a id='line_74'>      would perhaps have chosen the peaceful enjoyment of his glory and</a>
<a id='line_75'>      greatness; but as soon as war became inevitable, he took the</a>
<a id='line_76'>      field with the alacrity of youth, whilst the aggressor trembled</a>
<a id='line_77'>      in the palace of Constantinople. Nushirvan, or Chosroes,</a>
<a id='line_78'>      conducted in person the siege of Dara; and although that</a>
<a id='line_79'>      important fortress had been left destitute of troops and</a>
<a id='line_80'>      magazines, the valor of the inhabitants resisted above five</a>
<a id='line_81'>      months the archers, the elephants, and the military engines of</a>
<a id='line_82'>      the Great King. In the mean while his general Adarman advanced</a>
<a id='line_83'>      from Babylon, traversed the desert, passed the Euphrates,</a>
<a id='line_84'>      insulted the suburbs of Antioch, reduced to ashes the city of</a>
<a id='line_85'>      Apamea, and laid the spoils of Syria at the feet of his master,</a>
<a id='line_86'>      whose perseverance in the midst of winter at length subverted the</a>
<a id='line_87'>      bulwark of the East. But these losses, which astonished the</a>
<a id='line_88'>      provinces and the court, produced a salutary effect in the</a>
<a id='line_89'>      repentance and abdication of the emperor Justin: a new spirit</a>
<a id='line_90'>      arose in the Byzantine councils; and a truce of three years was</a>
<a id='line_91'>      obtained by the prudence of Tiberius. That seasonable interval</a>
<a id='line_92'>      was employed in the preparations of war; and the voice of rumor</a>
<a id='line_93'>      proclaimed to the world, that from the distant countries of the</a>
<a id='line_94'>      Alps and the Rhine, from Scythia, Maesia, Pannonia, Illyricum,</a>
<a id='line_95'>      and Isauria, the strength of the Imperial cavalry was reenforced</a>
<a id='line_96'>      with one hundred and fifty thousand soldiers. Yet the king of</a>
<a id='line_97'>      Persia, without fear, or without faith, resolved to prevent the</a>
<a id='line_98'>      attack of the enemy; again passed the Euphrates, and dismissing</a>
<a id='line_99'>      the ambassadors of Tiberius, arrogantly commanded them to await</a>
<a id='line_100'>      his arrival at Caesarea, the metropolis of the Cappadocian</a>
<a id='line_101'>      provinces. The two armies encountered each other in the battle of</a>
<a id='line_102'>      Melitene: 412 the Barbarians, who darkened the air with a cloud</a>
<a id='line_103'>      of arrows, prolonged their line, and extended their wings across</a>
<a id='line_104'>      the plain; while the Romans, in deep and solid bodies, expected</a>
<a id='line_105'>      to prevail in closer action, by the weight of their swords and</a>
<a id='line_106'>      lances. A Scythian chief, who commanded their right wing,</a>
<a id='line_107'>      suddenly turned the flank of the enemy, attacked their rear-guard</a>
<a id='line_108'>      in the presence of Chosroes, penetrated to the midst of the camp,</a>
<a id='line_109'>      pillaged the royal tent, profaned the eternal fire, loaded a</a>
<a id='line_110'>      train of camels with the spoils of Asia, cut his way through the</a>
<a id='line_111'>      Persian host, and returned with songs of victory to his friends,</a>
<a id='line_112'>      who had consumed the day in single combats, or ineffectual</a>
<a id='line_113'>      skirmishes. The darkness of the night, and the separation of the</a>
<a id='line_114'>      Romans, afforded the Persian monarch an opportunity of revenge;</a>
<a id='line_115'>      and one of their camps was swept away by a rapid and impetuous</a>
<a id='line_116'>      assault. But the review of his loss, and the consciousness of his</a>
<a id='line_117'>      danger, determined Chosroes to a speedy retreat: he burnt, in his</a>
<a id='line_118'>      passage, the vacant town of Melitene; and, without consulting the</a>
<a id='line_119'>      safety of his troops, boldly swam the Euphrates on the back of an</a>
<a id='line_120'>      elephant. After this unsuccessful campaign, the want of</a>
<a id='line_121'>      magazines, and perhaps some inroad of the Turks, obliged him to</a>
<a id='line_122'>      disband or divide his forces; the Romans were left masters of the</a>
<a id='line_123'>      field, and their general Justinian, advancing to the relief of</a>
<a id='line_124'>      the Persarmenian rebels, erected his standard on the banks of the</a>
<a id='line_125'>      Araxes. The great Pompey had formerly halted within three days’</a>
<a id='line_126'>      march of the Caspian: 5 that inland sea was explored, for the</a>
<a id='line_127'>      first time, by a hostile fleet, 6 and seventy thousand captives</a>
<a id='line_128'>      were transplanted from Hyrcania to the Isle of Cyprus. On the</a>
<a id='line_129'>      return of spring, Justinian descended into the fertile plains of</a>
<a id='line_130'>      Assyria; the flames of war approached the residence of Nushirvan;</a>
<a id='line_131'>      the indignant monarch sunk into the grave; and his last edict</a>
<a id='line_132'>      restrained his successors from exposing their person in battle</a>
<a id='line_133'>      against the Romans. 611 Yet the memory of this transient affront</a>
<a id='line_134'>      was lost in the glories of a long reign; and his formidable</a>
<a id='line_135'>      enemies, after indulging their dream of conquest, again solicited</a>
<a id='line_136'>      a short respite from the calamities of war. 7</a>

<a id='line_247'>      same scenes were renewed at Ctesiphon, which had been exhibited</a>
<a id='line_248'>      at Rome after the death of Marcus Antoninus. The ministers of</a>
<a id='line_249'>      flattery and corruption, who had been banished by his father,</a>
<a id='line_250'>      were recalled and cherished by the son; the disgrace and exile of</a>
<a id='line_251'>      the friends of Nushirvan established their tyranny; and virtue</a>
<a id='line_252'>      was driven by degrees from the mind of Hormouz, from his palace,</a>
<a id='line_253'>      and from the government of the state. The faithful agents, the</a>
<a id='line_254'>      eyes and ears of the king, informed him of the progress of</a>
<a id='line_255'>      disorder, that the provincial governors flew to their prey with</a>
<a id='line_256'>      the fierceness of lions and eagles, and that their rapine and</a>
<a id='line_257'>      injustice would teach the most loyal of his subjects to abhor the</a>
<a id='line_258'>      name and authority of their sovereign. The sincerity of this</a>
<a id='line_259'>      advice was punished with death; the murmurs of the cities were</a>
<a id='line_260'>      despised, their tumults were quelled by military execution: the</a>
<a id='line_261'>      intermediate powers between the throne and the people were</a>
<a id='line_262'>      abolished; and the childish vanity of Hormouz, who affected the</a>
<a id='line_263'>      daily use of the tiara, was fond of declaring, that he alone</a>
<a id='line_264'>      would be the judge as well as the master of his kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_265'></a>
<a id='line_266'>      In every word, and in every action, the son of Nushirvan</a>
<a id='line_267'>      degenerated from the virtues of his father. His avarice defrauded</a>
<a id='line_268'>      the troops; his jealous caprice degraded the satraps; the palace,</a>
<a id='line_269'>      the tribunals, the waters of the Tigris, were stained with the</a>
<a id='line_270'>      blood of the innocent, and the tyrant exulted in the sufferings</a>
<a id='line_271'>      and execution of thirteen thousand victims. As the excuse of his</a>
<a id='line_272'>      cruelty, he sometimes condescended to observe, that the fears of</a>
<a id='line_273'>      the Persians would be productive of hatred, and that their hatred</a>
<a id='line_274'>      must terminate in rebellion but he forgot that his own guilt and</a>
<a id='line_275'>      folly had inspired the sentiments which he deplored, and prepared</a>
<a id='line_276'>      the event which he so justly apprehended. Exasperated by long and</a>
<a id='line_277'>      hopeless oppression, the provinces of Babylon, Susa, and</a>
<a id='line_278'>      Carmania, erected the standard of revolt; and the princes of</a>
<a id='line_279'>      Arabia, India, and Scythia, refused the customary tribute to the</a>
<a id='line_280'>      unworthy successor of Nushirvan. The arms of the Romans, in slow</a>
<a id='line_281'>      sieges and frequent inroads, afflicted the frontiers of</a>
<a id='line_282'>      Mesopotamia and Assyria: one of their generals professed himself</a>

<a id='line_284'>      miraculous image of Christ, whose mild aspect should never have</a>
<a id='line_285'>      been displayed in the front of battle. 9 At the same time, the</a>
<a id='line_286'>      eastern provinces of Persia were invaded by the great khan, who</a>
<a id='line_287'>      passed the Oxus at the head of three or four hundred thousand</a>

<a id='line_317'>      substantial, prerogatives exalted them above the heads of the</a>
<a id='line_318'>      Persian nobility. 11 At the siege of Dara, the valor of Bahram</a>
<a id='line_319'>      was signalized under the eyes of Nushirvan, and both the father</a>
<a id='line_320'>      and son successively promoted him to the command of armies, the</a>
<a id='line_321'>      government of Media, and the superintendence of the palace. The</a>
<a id='line_322'>      popular prediction which marked him as the deliverer of Persia,</a>
<a id='line_323'>      might be inspired by his past victories and extraordinary figure:</a>
<a id='line_324'>      the epithet Giubin 1111 is expressive of the quality of dry wood:</a>
<a id='line_325'>      he had the strength and stature of a giant; and his savage</a>

<a id='line_327'>      the nation trembled, while Hormouz disguised his terror by the</a>
<a id='line_328'>      name of suspicion, and his servants concealed their disloyalty</a>
<a id='line_329'>      under the mask of fear, Bahram alone displayed his undaunted</a>
<a id='line_330'>      courage and apparent fidelity: and as soon as he found that no</a>
<a id='line_331'>      more than twelve thousand soldiers would follow him against the</a>
<a id='line_332'>      enemy; he prudently declared, that to this fatal number Heaven</a>
<a id='line_333'>      had reserved the honors of the triumph. 1112 The steep and narrow</a>
<a id='line_334'>      descent of the Pule Rudbar, 12 or Hyrcanian rock, is the only</a>
<a id='line_335'>      pass through which an army can penetrate into the territory of</a>
<a id='line_336'>      Rei and the plains of Media. From the commanding heights, a band</a>
<a id='line_337'>      of resolute men might overwhelm with stones and darts the myriads</a>
<a id='line_338'>      of the Turkish host: their emperor and his son were transpierced</a>
<a id='line_339'>      with arrows; and the fugitives were left, without counsel or</a>
<a id='line_340'>      provisions, to the revenge of an injured people. The patriotism</a>
<a id='line_341'>      of the Persian general was stimulated by his affection for the</a>
<a id='line_342'>      city of his forefathers: in the hour of victory, every peasant</a>
<a id='line_343'>      became a soldier, and every soldier a hero; and their ardor was</a>
<a id='line_344'>      kindled by the gorgeous spectacle of beds, and thrones, and</a>
<a id='line_345'>      tables of massy gold, the spoils of Asia, and the luxury of the</a>
<a id='line_346'>      hostile camp. A prince of a less malignant temper could not</a>
<a id='line_347'>      easily have forgiven his benefactor; and the secret hatred of</a>
<a id='line_348'>      Hormouz was envenomed by a malicious report, that Bahram had</a>
<a id='line_349'>      privately retained the most precious fruits of his Turkish</a>
<a id='line_350'>      victory. But the approach of a Roman army on the side of the</a>
<a id='line_351'>      Araxes compelled the implacable tyrant to smile and to applaud;</a>
<a id='line_352'>      and the toils of Bahram were rewarded with the permission of</a>
<a id='line_353'>      encountering a new enemy, by their skill and discipline more</a>
<a id='line_354'>      formidable than a Scythian multitude. Elated by his recent</a>
<a id='line_355'>      success, he despatched a herald with a bold defiance to the camp</a>
<a id='line_356'>      of the Romans, requesting them to fix a day of battle, and to</a>
<a id='line_357'>      choose whether they would pass the river themselves, or allow a</a>
<a id='line_358'>      free passage to the arms of the great king. The lieutenant of the</a>
<a id='line_359'>      emperor Maurice preferred the safer alternative; and this local</a>
<a id='line_360'>      circumstance, which would have enhanced the victory of the</a>
<a id='line_361'>      Persians, rendered their defeat more bloody and their escape more</a>
<a id='line_362'>      difficult. But the loss of his subjects, and the danger of his</a>
<a id='line_363'>      kingdom, were overbalanced in the mind of Hormouz by the disgrace</a>
<a id='line_364'>      of his personal enemy; and no sooner had Bahram collected and</a>
<a id='line_365'>      reviewed his forces, than he received from a royal messenger the</a>

<a id='line_454'>      of ignominious stripes, it was impossible to forget how recently</a>
<a id='line_455'>      they had adored the divine splendor of his diadem and purple. But</a>
<a id='line_456'>      an angry murmur arose in the assembly as soon as he presumed to</a>
<a id='line_457'>      vindicate his conduct, and to applaud the victories of his reign.</a>
<a id='line_458'>      He defined the duties of a king, and the Persian nobles listened</a>
<a id='line_459'>      with a smile of contempt; they were fired with indignation when</a>

<a id='line_461'>      indiscreet offer of resigning the sceptre to the second of his</a>
<a id='line_462'>      sons, he subscribed his own condemnation, and sacrificed the life</a>
<a id='line_463'>      of his own innocent favorite. The mangled bodies of the boy and</a>
<a id='line_464'>      his mother were exposed to the people; the eyes of Hormouz were</a>
<a id='line_465'>      pierced with a hot needle; and the punishment of the father was</a>
<a id='line_466'>      succeeded by the coronation of his eldest son. Chosroes had</a>
<a id='line_467'>      ascended the throne without guilt, and his piety strove to</a>

<a id='line_469'>      he removed Hormouz to an apartment of the palace, supplied with</a>
<a id='line_470'>      liberality the consolations of sensual enjoyment, and patiently</a>
<a id='line_471'>      endured the furious sallies of his resentment and despair. He</a>
<a id='line_472'>      might despise the resentment of a blind and unpopular tyrant, but</a>
<a id='line_473'>      the tiara was trembling on his head, till he could subvert the</a>
<a id='line_474'>      power, or acquire the friendship, of the great Bahram, who</a>
<a id='line_475'>      sternly denied the justice of a revolution, in which himself and</a>
<a id='line_476'>      his soldiers, the true representatives of Persia, had never been</a>
<a id='line_477'>      consulted. The offer of a general amnesty, and of the second rank</a>
<a id='line_478'>      in his kingdom, was answered by an epistle from Bahram, friend of</a>
<a id='line_479'>      the gods, conqueror of men, and enemy of tyrants, the satrap of</a>
<a id='line_480'>      satraps, general of the Persian armies, and a prince adorned with</a>
<a id='line_481'>      the title of eleven virtues. 14 He commands Chosroes, the son of</a>
<a id='line_482'>      Hormouz, to shun the example and fate of his father, to confine</a>
<a id='line_483'>      the traitors who had been released from their chains, to deposit</a>
<a id='line_484'>      in some holy place the diadem which he had usurped, and to accept</a>
<a id='line_485'>      from his gracious benefactor the pardon of his faults and the</a>
<a id='line_486'>      government of a province. The rebel might not be proud, and the</a>
<a id='line_487'>      king most assuredly was not humble; but the one was conscious of</a>
<a id='line_488'>      his strength, the other was sensible of his weakness; and even</a>
<a id='line_489'>      the modest language of his reply still left room for treaty and</a>
<a id='line_490'>      reconciliation. Chosroes led into the field the slaves of the</a>
<a id='line_491'>      palace and the populace of the capital: they beheld with terror</a>
<a id='line_492'>      the banners of a veteran army; they were encompassed and</a>

<a id='line_529'>      considered that the neighborhood of Syria would render his escape</a>

<a id='line_535'>      was informed of his approach, and he introduced the royal</a>
<a id='line_536'>      stranger to the fortress at the dawn of day. From thence the king</a>
<a id='line_537'>      of Persia was conducted to the more honorable residence of</a>
<a id='line_538'>      Hierapolis; and Maurice dissembled his pride, and displayed his</a>
<a id='line_539'>      benevolence, at the reception of the letters and ambassadors of</a>
<a id='line_540'>      the grandson of Nushirvan. They humbly represented the</a>
<a id='line_541'>      vicissitudes of fortune and the common interest of princes,</a>
<a id='line_542'>      exaggerated the ingratitude of Bahram, the agent of the evil</a>

<a id='line_545'>      which balance the world, the two great luminaries by whose</a>
<a id='line_546'>      salutary influence it is vivified and adorned. The anxiety of</a>
<a id='line_547'>      Chosroes was soon relieved by the assurance, that the emperor had</a>
<a id='line_548'>      espoused the cause of justice and royalty; but Maurice prudently</a>
<a id='line_549'>      declined the expense and delay of his useless visit to</a>
<a id='line_550'>      Constantinople. In the name of his generous benefactor, a rich</a>
<a id='line_551'>      diadem was presented to the fugitive prince, with an inestimable</a>
<a id='line_552'>      gift of jewels and gold; a powerful army was assembled on the</a>
<a id='line_553'>      frontiers of Syria and Armenia, under the command of the valiant</a>
<a id='line_554'>      and faithful Narses, 17 and this general, of his own nation, and</a>

<a id='line_556'>      sheathe his sword till he had restored Chosroes to the throne of</a>
<a id='line_557'>      his ancestors. 1711 The enterprise, however splendid, was less</a>
<a id='line_558'>      arduous than it might appear. Persia had already repented of her</a>
<a id='line_559'>      fatal rashness, which betrayed the heir of the house of Sassan to</a>
<a id='line_560'>      the ambition of a rebellious subject: and the bold refusal of the</a>
<a id='line_561'>      Magi to consecrate his usurpation, compelled Bahram to assume the</a>
<a id='line_562'>      sceptre, regardless of the laws and prejudices of the nation. The</a>
<a id='line_563'>      palace was soon distracted with conspiracy, the city with tumult,</a>
<a id='line_564'>      the provinces with insurrection; and the cruel execution of the</a>
<a id='line_565'>      guilty and the suspected served to irritate rather than subdue</a>
<a id='line_566'>      the public discontent. No sooner did the grandson of Nushirvan</a>
<a id='line_567'>      display his own and the Roman banners beyond the Tigris, than he</a>
<a id='line_568'>      was joined, each day, by the increasing multitudes of the</a>
<a id='line_569'>      nobility and people; and as he advanced, he received from every</a>
<a id='line_570'>      side the grateful offerings of the keys of his cities and the</a>
<a id='line_571'>      heads of his enemies. As soon as Modain was freed from the</a>
<a id='line_572'>      presence of the usurper, the loyal inhabitants obeyed the first</a>
<a id='line_573'>      summons of Mebodes at the head of only two thousand horse, and</a>
<a id='line_574'>      Chosroes accepted the sacred and precious ornaments of the palace</a>
<a id='line_575'>      as the pledge of their truth and the presage of his approaching</a>
<a id='line_576'>      success. After the junction of the Imperial troops, which Bahram</a>
<a id='line_577'>      vainly struggled to prevent, the contest was decided by two</a>
<a id='line_578'>      battles on the banks of the Zab, and the confines of Media. The</a>
<a id='line_579'>      Romans, with the faithful subjects of Persia, amounted to sixty</a>
<a id='line_580'>      thousand, while the whole force of the usurper did not exceed</a>
<a id='line_581'>      forty thousand men: the two generals signalized their valor and</a>
<a id='line_582'>      ability; but the victory was finally determined by the prevalence</a>
<a id='line_583'>      of numbers and discipline. With the remnant of a broken army,</a>
<a id='line_584'>      Bahram fled towards the eastern provinces of the Oxus: the enmity</a>
<a id='line_585'>      of Persia reconciled him to the Turks; but his days were</a>
<a id='line_586'>      shortened by poison, perhaps the most incurable of poisons; the</a>
<a id='line_587'>      stings of remorse and despair, and the bitter remembrance of lost</a>

<a id='line_645'>      steadily professed the same gratitude and reverence to his</a>
<a id='line_646'>      adopted father; and till the death of Maurice, the peace and</a>

<a id='line_648'>      the mercenary friendship of the Roman prince had been purchased</a>
<a id='line_649'>      with costly and important gifts; the strong cities of</a>

<a id='line_651'>      became the willing subjects of an empire, whose eastern limit was</a>
<a id='line_652'>      extended, beyond the example of former times, as far as the banks</a>

<a id='line_741'>      spread their permanent dominion from the foot of the Alps to the</a>
<a id='line_742'>      sea-coast of the Euxine. The reign of Baian is the brightest aera</a>
<a id='line_743'>      of their monarchy; their chagan, who occupied the rustic palace</a>
<a id='line_744'>      of Attila, appears to have imitated his character and policy; 23</a>
<a id='line_745'>      but as the same scenes were repeated in a smaller circle, a</a>
<a id='line_746'>      minute representation of the copy would be devoid of the</a>
<a id='line_747'>      greatness and novelty of the original. The pride of the second</a>
<a id='line_748'>      Justin, of Tiberius, and Maurice, was humbled by a proud</a>
<a id='line_749'>      Barbarian, more prompt to inflict, than exposed to suffer, the</a>
<a id='line_750'>      injuries of war; and as often as Asia was threatened by the</a>
<a id='line_751'>      Persian arms, Europe was oppressed by the dangerous inroads, or</a>
<a id='line_752'>      costly friendship, of the Avars. When the Roman envoys approached</a>
<a id='line_753'>      the presence of the chagan, they were commanded to wait at the</a>
<a id='line_754'>      door of his tent, till, at the end perhaps of ten or twelve days,</a>
<a id='line_755'>      he condescended to admit them. If the substance or the style of</a>
<a id='line_756'>      their message was offensive to his ear, he insulted, with real or</a>
<a id='line_757'>      affected fury, their own dignity, and that of their prince; their</a>
<a id='line_758'>      baggage was plundered, and their lives were only saved by the</a>
<a id='line_759'>      promise of a richer present and a more respectful address. But</a>
<a id='line_760'>      his sacred ambassadors enjoyed and abused an unbounded license in</a>
<a id='line_761'>      the midst of Constantinople: they urged, with importunate</a>
<a id='line_762'>      clamors, the increase of tribute, or the restitution of captives</a>
<a id='line_763'>      and deserters: and the majesty of the empire was almost equally</a>
<a id='line_764'>      degraded by a base compliance, or by the false and fearful</a>
<a id='line_765'>      excuses with which they eluded such insolent demands. The chagan</a>
<a id='line_766'>      had never seen an elephant; and his curiosity was excited by the</a>
<a id='line_767'>      strange, and perhaps fabulous, portrait of that wonderful animal.</a>
<a id='line_768'>      At his command, one of the largest elephants of the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_769'>      stables was equipped with stately caparisons, and conducted by a</a>
<a id='line_770'>      numerous train to the royal village in the plains of Hungary. He</a>
<a id='line_771'>      surveyed the enormous beast with surprise, with disgust, and</a>
<a id='line_772'>      possibly with terror; and smiled at the vain industry of the</a>
<a id='line_773'>      Romans, who, in search of such useless rarities, could explore</a>
<a id='line_774'>      the limits of the land and sea. He wished, at the expense of the</a>
<a id='line_775'>      emperor, to repose in a golden bed. The wealth of Constantinople,</a>
<a id='line_776'>      and the skilful diligence of her artists, were instantly devoted</a>
<a id='line_777'>      to the gratification of his caprice; but when the work was</a>
<a id='line_778'>      finished, he rejected with scorn a present so unworthy the</a>
<a id='line_779'>      majesty of a great king. 24 These were the casual sallies of his</a>
<a id='line_780'>      pride; but the avarice of the chagan was a more steady and</a>
<a id='line_781'>      tractable passion: a rich and regular supply of silk apparel,</a>
<a id='line_782'>      furniture, and plate, introduced the rudiments of art and luxury</a>
<a id='line_783'>      among the tents of the Scythians; their appetite was stimulated</a>
<a id='line_784'>      by the pepper and cinnamon of India; 25 the annual subsidy or</a>
<a id='line_785'>      tribute was raised from fourscore to one hundred and twenty</a>
<a id='line_786'>      thousand pieces of gold; and after each hostile interruption, the</a>
<a id='line_787'>      payment of the arrears, with exorbitant interest, was always made</a>
<a id='line_788'>      the first condition of the new treaty. In the language of a</a>
<a id='line_789'>      Barbarian, without guile, the prince of the Avars affected to</a>
<a id='line_790'>      complain of the insincerity of the Greeks; 26 yet he was not</a>
<a id='line_791'>      inferior to the most civilized nations in the refinement of</a>
<a id='line_792'>      dissimulation and perfidy. As the successor of the Lombards, the</a>
<a id='line_793'>      chagan asserted his claim to the important city of Sirmium, the</a>
<a id='line_794'>      ancient bulwark of the Illyrian provinces. 27 The plains of the</a>
<a id='line_795'>      Lower Hungary were covered with the Avar horse and a fleet of</a>
<a id='line_796'>      large boats was built in the Hercynian wood, to descend the</a>
<a id='line_797'>      Danube, and to transport into the Save the materials of a bridge.</a>
<a id='line_798'>      But as the strong garrison of Singidunum, which commanded the</a>
<a id='line_799'>      conflux of the two rivers, might have stopped their passage and</a>
<a id='line_800'>      baffled his designs, he dispelled their apprehensions by a solemn</a>
<a id='line_801'>      oath that his views were not hostile to the empire. He swore by</a>
<a id='line_802'>      his sword, the symbol of the god of war, that he did not, as the</a>
<a id='line_803'>      enemy of Rome, construct a bridge upon the Save. “If I violate my</a>
<a id='line_804'>      oath,” pursued the intrepid Baian, “may I myself, and the last of</a>
<a id='line_805'>      my nation, perish by the sword! May the heavens, and fire, the</a>
<a id='line_806'>      deity of the heavens, fall upon our heads! May the forests and</a>
<a id='line_807'>      mountains bury us in their ruins! and the Save returning, against</a>
<a id='line_808'>      the laws of nature, to his source, overwhelm us in his angry</a>
<a id='line_809'>      waters!” After this barbarous imprecation, he calmly inquired,</a>
<a id='line_810'>      what oath was most sacred and venerable among the Christians,</a>
<a id='line_811'>      what guilt or perjury it was most dangerous to incur. The bishop</a>
<a id='line_812'>      of Singidunum presented the gospel, which the chagan received</a>
<a id='line_813'>      with devout reverence. “I swear,” said he, “by the God who has</a>
<a id='line_814'>      spoken in this holy book, that I have neither falsehood on my</a>
<a id='line_815'>      tongue, nor treachery in my heart.” As soon as he rose from his</a>
<a id='line_816'>      knees, he accelerated the labor of the bridge, and despatched an</a>
<a id='line_817'>      envoy to proclaim what he no longer wished to conceal. “Inform</a>
<a id='line_818'>      the emperor,” said the perfidious Baian, “that Sirmium is</a>
<a id='line_819'>      invested on every side. Advise his prudence to withdraw the</a>
<a id='line_820'>      citizens and their effects, and to resign a city which it is now</a>
<a id='line_821'>      impossible to relieve or defend.” Without the hope of relief, the</a>
<a id='line_822'>      defence of Sirmium was prolonged above three years: the walls</a>
<a id='line_823'>      were still untouched; but famine was enclosed within the walls,</a>
<a id='line_824'>      till a merciful capitulation allowed the escape of the naked and</a>
<a id='line_825'>      hungry inhabitants. Singidunum, at the distance of fifty miles,</a>
<a id='line_826'>      experienced a more cruel fate: the buildings were razed, and the</a>
<a id='line_827'>      vanquished people was condemned to servitude and exile. Yet the</a>
<a id='line_828'>      ruins of Sirmium are no longer visible; the advantageous</a>
<a id='line_829'>      situation of Singidunum soon attracted a new colony of</a>
<a id='line_830'>      Sclavonians, and the conflux of the Save and Danube is still</a>
<a id='line_831'>      guarded by the fortifications of Belgrade, or the White City, so</a>
<a id='line_832'>      often and so obstinately disputed by the Christian and Turkish</a>
<a id='line_833'>      arms. 28 From Belgrade to the walls of Constantinople a line may</a>
<a id='line_834'>      be measured of six hundred miles: that line was marked with</a>
<a id='line_835'>      flames and with blood; the horses of the Avars were alternately</a>
<a id='line_836'>      bathed in the Euxine and the Adriatic; and the Roman pontiff,</a>
<a id='line_837'>      alarmed by the approach of a more savage enemy, 29 was reduced to</a>
<a id='line_838'>      cherish the Lombards, as the protectors of Italy. The despair of</a>
<a id='line_839'>      a captive, whom his country refused to ransom, disclosed to the</a>
<a id='line_840'>      Avars the invention and practice of military engines. 30 But in</a>
<a id='line_841'>      the first attempts they were rudely framed, and awkwardly</a>
<a id='line_842'>      managed; and the resistance of Diocletianopolis and Beraea, of</a>
<a id='line_843'>      Philippopolis and Adrianople, soon exhausted the skill and</a>
<a id='line_844'>      patience of the besiegers. The warfare of Baian was that of a</a>
<a id='line_845'>      Tartar; yet his mind was susceptible of a humane and generous</a>
<a id='line_846'>      sentiment: he spared Anchialus, whose salutary waters had</a>
<a id='line_847'>      restored the health of the best beloved of his wives; and the</a>
<a id='line_848'>      Romans confessed, that their starving army was fed and dismissed</a>
<a id='line_849'>      by the liberality of a foe. His empire extended over Hungary,</a>
<a id='line_850'>      Poland, and Prussia, from the mouth of the Danube to that of the</a>
<a id='line_851'>      Oder; 31 and his new subjects were divided and transplanted by</a>
<a id='line_852'>      the jealous policy of the conqueror. 32 The eastern regions of</a>
<a id='line_853'>      Germany, which had been left vacant by the emigration of the</a>
<a id='line_854'>      Vandals, were replenished with Sclavonian colonists; the same</a>
<a id='line_855'>      tribes are discovered in the neighborhood of the Adriatic and of</a>
<a id='line_856'>      the Baltic, and with the name of Baian himself, the Illyrian</a>
<a id='line_857'>      cities of Neyss and Lissa are again found in the heart of</a>
<a id='line_858'>      Silesia. In the disposition both of his troops and provinces the</a>
<a id='line_859'>      chagan exposed the vassals, whose lives he disregarded, 33 to the</a>
<a id='line_860'>      first assault; and the swords of the enemy were blunted before</a>
<a id='line_861'>      they encountered the native valor of the Avars.</a>

<a id='line_925'>      insolence of the chagan, declared his resolution to march in</a>
<a id='line_926'>      person against the Barbarians. In the space of two centuries,</a>
<a id='line_927'>      none of the successors of Theodosius had appeared in the field:</a>
<a id='line_928'>      their lives were supinely spent in the palace of Constantinople;</a>
<a id='line_929'>      and the Greeks could no longer understand, that the name of</a>
<a id='line_930'>      emperor, in its primitive sense, denoted the chief of the armies</a>
<a id='line_931'>      of the republic. The martial ardor of Maurice was opposed by the</a>
<a id='line_932'>      grave flattery of the senate, the timid superstition of the</a>
<a id='line_933'>      patriarch, and the tears of the empress Constantina; and they all</a>
<a id='line_934'>      conjured him to devolve on some meaner general the fatigues and</a>
<a id='line_935'>      perils of a Scythian campaign. Deaf to their advice and entreaty,</a>
<a id='line_936'>      the emperor boldly advanced 34 seven miles from the capital; the</a>
<a id='line_937'>      sacred ensign of the cross was displayed in the front; and</a>
<a id='line_938'>      Maurice reviewed, with conscious pride, the arms and numbers of</a>
<a id='line_939'>      the veterans who had fought and conquered beyond the Tigris.</a>
<a id='line_940'>      Anchialus was the last term of his progress by sea and land; he</a>
<a id='line_941'>      solicited, without success, a miraculous answer to his nocturnal</a>
<a id='line_942'>      prayers; his mind was confounded by the death of a favorite</a>
<a id='line_943'>      horse, the encounter of a wild boar, a storm of wind and rain,</a>
<a id='line_944'>      and the birth of a monstrous child; and he forgot that the best</a>
<a id='line_945'>      of omens is to unsheathe our sword in the defence of our country.</a>
<a id='line_946'>      35 Under the pretence of receiving the ambassadors of Persia, the</a>
<a id='line_947'>      emperor returned to Constantinople, exchanged the thoughts of war</a>
<a id='line_948'>      for those of devotion, and disappointed the public hope by his</a>
<a id='line_949'>      absence and the choice of his lieutenants. The blind partiality</a>
<a id='line_950'>      of fraternal love might excuse the promotion of his brother</a>
<a id='line_951'>      Peter, who fled with equal disgrace from the Barbarians, from his</a>
<a id='line_952'>      own soldiers and from the inhabitants of a Roman city. That city,</a>
<a id='line_953'>      if we may credit the resemblance of name and character, was the</a>
<a id='line_954'>      famous Azimuntium, 36 which had alone repelled the tempest of</a>
<a id='line_955'>      Attila. The example of her warlike youth was propagated to</a>
<a id='line_956'>      succeeding generations; and they obtained, from the first or the</a>
<a id='line_957'>      second Justin, an honorable privilege, that their valor should be</a>
<a id='line_958'>      always reserved for the defence of their native country. The</a>
<a id='line_959'>      brother of Maurice attempted to violate this privilege, and to</a>
<a id='line_960'>      mingle a patriot band with the mercenaries of his camp; they</a>
<a id='line_961'>      retired to the church, he was not awed by the sanctity of the</a>
<a id='line_962'>      place; the people rose in their cause, the gates were shut, the</a>
<a id='line_963'>      ramparts were manned; and the cowardice of Peter was found equal</a>
<a id='line_964'>      to his arrogance and injustice. The military fame of Commentiolus</a>
<a id='line_965'>      37 is the object of satire or comedy rather than of serious</a>
<a id='line_966'>      history, since he was even deficient in the vile and vulgar</a>
<a id='line_967'>      qualification of personal courage. His solemn councils, strange</a>
<a id='line_968'>      evolutions, and secret orders, always supplied an apology for</a>
<a id='line_969'>      flight or delay. If he marched against the enemy, the pleasant</a>
<a id='line_970'>      valleys of Mount Haemus opposed an insuperable barrier; but in</a>
<a id='line_971'>      his retreat, he explored, with fearless curiosity, the most</a>
<a id='line_972'>      difficult and obsolete paths, which had almost escaped the memory</a>
<a id='line_973'>      of the oldest native. The only blood which he lost was drawn, in</a>
<a id='line_974'>      a real or affected malady, by the lancet of a surgeon; and his</a>
<a id='line_975'>      health, which felt with exquisite sensibility the approach of the</a>
<a id='line_976'>      Barbarians, was uniformly restored by the repose and safety of</a>
<a id='line_977'>      the winter season. A prince who could promote and support this</a>
<a id='line_978'>      unworthy favorite must derive no glory from the accidental merit</a>
<a id='line_979'>      of his colleague Priscus. 38 In five successive battles, which</a>
<a id='line_980'>      seem to have been conducted with skill and resolution, seventeen</a>
<a id='line_981'>      thousand two hundred Barbarians were made prisoners: near sixty</a>
<a id='line_982'>      thousand, with four sons of the chagan, were slain: the Roman</a>
<a id='line_983'>      general surprised a peaceful district of the Gepidae, who slept</a>

<a id='line_1024'>      skill of the Byzantine workmen. The magazines were plentifully</a>
<a id='line_1025'>      stored with every species of offensive and defensive arms. In the</a>
<a id='line_1026'>      construction and use of ships, engines, and fortifications, the</a>
<a id='line_1027'>      Barbarians admired the superior ingenuity of a people whom they</a>

<a id='line_1029'>      order, evolutions, and stratagems of antiquity, was transcribed</a>
<a id='line_1030'>      and studied in the books of the Greeks and Romans. But the</a>
<a id='line_1031'>      solitude or degeneracy of the provinces could no longer supply a</a>
<a id='line_1032'>      race of men to handle those weapons, to guard those walls, to</a>

<a id='line_1037'>      animate the lifeless bodies of slaves and strangers, who had</a>
<a id='line_1038'>      succeeded to the honors of the legions: it was in the camp alone</a>
<a id='line_1039'>      that the emperor should have exercised a despotic command; it was</a>
<a id='line_1040'>      only in the camps that his authority was disobeyed and insulted:</a>
<a id='line_1041'>      he appeased and inflamed with gold the licentiousness of the</a>
<a id='line_1042'>      troops; but their vices were inherent, their victories were</a>
<a id='line_1043'>      accidental, and their costly maintenance exhausted the substance</a>
<a id='line_1044'>      of a state which they were unable to defend. After a long and</a>
<a id='line_1045'>      pernicious indulgence, the cure of this inveterate evil was</a>
<a id='line_1046'>      undertaken by Maurice; but the rash attempt, which drew</a>
<a id='line_1047'>      destruction on his own head, tended only to aggravate the</a>
<a id='line_1048'>      disease. A reformer should be exempt from the suspicion of</a>
<a id='line_1049'>      interest, and he must possess the confidence and esteem of those</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      whom he proposes to reclaim. The troops of Maurice might listen</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      to the voice of a victorious leader; they disdained the</a>
<a id='line_1052'>      admonitions of statesmen and sophists; and, when they received an</a>
<a id='line_1053'>      edict which deducted from their pay the price of their arms and</a>
<a id='line_1054'>      clothing, they execrated the avarice of a prince insensible of</a>
<a id='line_1055'>      the dangers and fatigues from which he had escaped.</a>
<a id='line_1056'></a>
<a id='line_1057'>      The camps both of Asia and Europe were agitated with frequent and</a>
<a id='line_1058'>      furious seditions; 41 the enraged soldiers of Edessa pursued with</a>
<a id='line_1059'>      reproaches, with threats, with wounds, their trembling generals;</a>
<a id='line_1060'>      they overturned the statues of the emperor, cast stones against</a>
<a id='line_1061'>      the miraculous image of Christ, and either rejected the yoke of</a>
<a id='line_1062'>      all civil and military laws, or instituted a dangerous model of</a>
<a id='line_1063'>      voluntary subordination. The monarch, always distant and often</a>
<a id='line_1064'>      deceived, was incapable of yielding or persisting, according to</a>
<a id='line_1065'>      the exigence of the moment. But the fear of a general revolt</a>
<a id='line_1066'>      induced him too readily to accept any act of valor, or any</a>
<a id='line_1067'>      expression of loyalty, as an atonement for the popular offence;</a>
<a id='line_1068'>      the new reform was abolished as hastily as it had been announced,</a>
<a id='line_1069'>      and the troops, instead of punishment and restraint, were</a>
<a id='line_1070'>      agreeably surprised by a gracious proclamation of immunities and</a>
<a id='line_1071'>      rewards. But the soldiers accepted without gratitude the tardy</a>
<a id='line_1072'>      and reluctant gifts of the emperor: their insolence was elated by</a>
<a id='line_1073'>      the discovery of his weakness and their own strength; and their</a>
<a id='line_1074'>      mutual hatred was inflamed beyond the desire of forgiveness or</a>
<a id='line_1075'>      the hope of reconciliation. The historians of the times adopt the</a>
<a id='line_1076'>      vulgar suspicion, that Maurice conspired to destroy the troops</a>
<a id='line_1077'>      whom he had labored to reform; the misconduct and favor of</a>
<a id='line_1078'>      Commentiolus are imputed to this malevolent design; and every age</a>
<a id='line_1079'>      must condemn the inhumanity of avarice 42 of a prince, who, by</a>
<a id='line_1080'>      the trifling ransom of six thousand pieces of gold, might have</a>
<a id='line_1081'>      prevented the massacre of twelve thousand prisoners in the hands</a>
<a id='line_1082'>      of the chagan. In the just fervor of indignation, an order was</a>
<a id='line_1083'>      signified to the army of the Danube, that they should spare the</a>
<a id='line_1084'>      magazines of the province, and establish their winter quarters in</a>
<a id='line_1085'>      the hostile country of the Avars. The measure of their grievances</a>
<a id='line_1086'>      was full: they pronounced Maurice unworthy to reign, expelled or</a>
<a id='line_1087'>      slaughtered his faithful adherents, and, under the command of</a>
<a id='line_1088'>      Phocas, a simple centurion, returned by hasty marches to the</a>

<a id='line_1091'>      again revived; yet such was the novelty of the enterprise, that</a>
<a id='line_1092'>      the insurgents were awed by their own rashness. They hesitated to</a>

<a id='line_1094'>      rejected all treaty with Maurice himself, they held a friendly</a>
<a id='line_1095'>      correspondence with his son Theodosius, and with Germanus, the</a>
<a id='line_1096'>      father-in-law of the royal youth. So obscure had been the former</a>
<a id='line_1097'>      condition of Phocas, that the emperor was ignorant of the name</a>
<a id='line_1098'>      and character of his rival; but as soon as he learned, that the</a>

<a id='line_1125'>      the anxiety of his heart, condescended to solicit the applause of</a>

<a id='line_1128'>      hundred greens, whom he affected to esteem as the solid pillars</a>
<a id='line_1129'>      of his throne Their treacherous or languid support betrayed his</a>
<a id='line_1130'>      weakness and hastened his fall: the green faction were the secret</a>
<a id='line_1131'>      accomplices of the rebels, and the blues recommended lenity and</a>
<a id='line_1132'>      moderation in a contest with their Roman brethren The rigid and</a>
<a id='line_1133'>      parsimonious virtues of Maurice had long since alienated the</a>
<a id='line_1134'>      hearts of his subjects: as he walked barefoot in a religious</a>
<a id='line_1135'>      procession, he was rudely assaulted with stones, and his guards</a>
<a id='line_1136'>      were compelled to present their iron maces in the defence of his</a>
<a id='line_1137'>      person. A fanatic monk ran through the streets with a drawn</a>
<a id='line_1138'>      sword, denouncing against him the wrath and the sentence of God;</a>
<a id='line_1139'>      and a vile plebeian, who represented his countenance and apparel,</a>
<a id='line_1140'>      was seated on an ass, and pursued by the imprecations of the</a>
<a id='line_1141'>      multitude. 43 The emperor suspected the popularity of Germanus</a>
<a id='line_1142'>      with the soldiers and citizens: he feared, he threatened, but he</a>
<a id='line_1143'>      delayed to strike; the patrician fled to the sanctuary of the</a>
<a id='line_1144'>      church; the people rose in his defence, the walls were deserted</a>
<a id='line_1145'>      by the guards, and the lawless city was abandoned to the flames</a>
<a id='line_1146'>      and rapine of a nocturnal tumult. In a small bark, the</a>
<a id='line_1147'>      unfortunate Maurice, with his wife and nine children, escaped to</a>
<a id='line_1148'>      the Asiatic shore; but the violence of the wind compelled him to</a>
<a id='line_1149'>      land at the church of St. Autonomus, 44 near Chalcedon, from</a>
<a id='line_1150'>      whence he despatched Theodosius, he eldest son, to implore the</a>
<a id='line_1151'>      gratitude and friendship of the Persian monarch. For himself, he</a>
<a id='line_1152'>      refused to fly: his body was tortured with sciatic pains, 45 his</a>
<a id='line_1153'>      mind was enfeebled by superstition; he patiently awaited the</a>
<a id='line_1154'>      event of the revolution, and addressed a fervent and public</a>
<a id='line_1155'>      prayer to the Almighty, that the punishment of his sins might be</a>
<a id='line_1156'>      inflicted in this world rather than in a future life. After the</a>
<a id='line_1157'>      abdication of Maurice, the two factions disputed the choice of an</a>
<a id='line_1158'>      emperor; but the favorite of the blues was rejected by the</a>
<a id='line_1159'>      jealousy of their antagonists, and Germanus himself was hurried</a>
<a id='line_1160'>      along by the crowds who rushed to the palace of Hebdomon, seven</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      miles from the city, to adore the majesty of Phocas the</a>
<a id='line_1162'>      centurion. A modest wish of resigning the purple to the rank and</a>
<a id='line_1163'>      merit of Germanus was opposed by his resolution, more obstinate</a>
<a id='line_1164'>      and equally sincere; the senate and clergy obeyed his summons;</a>
<a id='line_1165'>      and, as soon as the patriarch was assured of his orthodox belief,</a>
<a id='line_1166'>      he consecrated the successful usurper in the church of St. John</a>
<a id='line_1167'>      the Baptist. On the third day, amidst the acclamations of a</a>
<a id='line_1168'>      thoughtless people, Phocas made his public entry in a chariot</a>
<a id='line_1169'>      drawn by four white horses: the revolt of the troops was rewarded</a>
<a id='line_1170'>      by a lavish donative; and the new sovereign, after visiting the</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      palace, beheld from his throne the games of the hippodrome. In a</a>
<a id='line_1172'>      dispute of precedency between the two factions, his partial</a>
<a id='line_1173'>      judgment inclined in favor of the greens. “Remember that Maurice</a>
<a id='line_1174'>      is still alive,” resounded from the opposite side; and the</a>
<a id='line_1175'>      indiscreet clamor of the blues admonished and stimulated the</a>
<a id='line_1176'>      cruelty of the tyrant. The ministers of death were despatched to</a>
<a id='line_1177'>      Chalcedon: they dragged the emperor from his sanctuary; and the</a>
<a id='line_1178'>      five sons of Maurice were successively murdered before the eyes</a>
<a id='line_1179'>      of their agonizing parent. At each stroke, which he felt in his</a>
<a id='line_1180'>      heart, he found strength to rehearse a pious ejaculation: “Thou</a>
<a id='line_1181'>      art just, O Lord! and thy judgments are righteous.” And such, in</a>
<a id='line_1182'>      the last moments, was his rigid attachment to truth and justice,</a>
<a id='line_1183'>      that he revealed to the soldiers the pious falsehood of a nurse</a>
<a id='line_1184'>      who presented her own child in the place of a royal infant. 46</a>
<a id='line_1185'>      The tragic scene was finally closed by the execution of the</a>
<a id='line_1186'>      emperor himself, in the twentieth year of his reign, and the</a>
<a id='line_1187'>      sixty-third of his age. The bodies of the father and his five</a>

<a id='line_1190'>      was not till some signs of putrefaction had appeared, that Phocas</a>

<a id='line_1231'>      have been criminal, under the reign of Phocas, who was peaceably</a>
<a id='line_1232'>      acknowledged in the provinces of the East and West. The images of</a>
<a id='line_1233'>      the emperor and his wife Leontia were exposed in the Lateran to</a>
<a id='line_1234'>      the veneration of the clergy and senate of Rome, and afterwards</a>
<a id='line_1235'>      deposited in the palace of the Caesars, between those of</a>

<a id='line_1237'>      the duty of Gregory to acquiesce in the established government;</a>
<a id='line_1238'>      but the joyful applause with which he salutes the fortune of the</a>
<a id='line_1239'>      assassin, has sullied, with indelible disgrace, the character of</a>
<a id='line_1240'>      the saint. The successor of the apostles might have inculcated</a>
<a id='line_1241'>      with decent firmness the guilt of blood, and the necessity of</a>
<a id='line_1242'>      repentance; he is content to celebrate the deliverance of the</a>
<a id='line_1243'>      people and the fall of the oppressor; to rejoice that the piety</a>
<a id='line_1244'>      and benignity of Phocas have been raised by Providence to the</a>
<a id='line_1245'>      Imperial throne; to pray that his hands may be strengthened</a>
<a id='line_1246'>      against all his enemies; and to express a wish, perhaps a</a>
<a id='line_1247'>      prophecy, that, after a long and triumphant reign, he may be</a>
<a id='line_1248'>      transferred from a temporal to an everlasting kingdom. 48 I have</a>
<a id='line_1249'>      already traced the steps of a revolution so pleasing, in</a>
<a id='line_1250'>      Gregory’s opinion, both to heaven and earth; and Phocas does not</a>
<a id='line_1251'>      appear less hateful in the exercise than in the acquisition of</a>
<a id='line_1252'>      power. The pencil of an impartial historian has delineated the</a>
<a id='line_1253'>      portrait of a monster: 49 his diminutive and deformed person, the</a>
<a id='line_1254'>      closeness of his shaggy eyebrows, his red hair, his beardless</a>
<a id='line_1255'>      chin, and his cheek disfigured and discolored by a formidable</a>
<a id='line_1256'>      scar. Ignorant of letters, of laws, and even of arms, he indulged</a>
<a id='line_1257'>      in the supreme rank a more ample privilege of lust and</a>
<a id='line_1258'>      drunkenness; and his brutal pleasures were either injurious to</a>
<a id='line_1259'>      his subjects or disgraceful to himself. Without assuming the</a>
<a id='line_1260'>      office of a prince, he renounced the profession of a soldier; and</a>
<a id='line_1261'>      the reign of Phocas afflicted Europe with ignominious peace, and</a>
<a id='line_1262'>      Asia with desolating war. His savage temper was inflamed by</a>
<a id='line_1263'>      passion, hardened by fear, and exasperated by resistance or</a>
<a id='line_1264'>      reproach. The flight of Theodosius to the Persian court had been</a>
<a id='line_1265'>      intercepted by a rapid pursuit, or a deceitful message: he was</a>
<a id='line_1266'>      beheaded at Nice, and the last hours of the young prince were</a>
<a id='line_1267'>      soothed by the comforts of religion and the consciousness of</a>
<a id='line_1268'>      innocence. Yet his phantom disturbed the repose of the usurper: a</a>
<a id='line_1269'>      whisper was circulated through the East, that the son of Maurice</a>
<a id='line_1270'>      was still alive: the people expected their avenger, and the widow</a>
<a id='line_1271'>      and daughters of the late emperor would have adopted as their son</a>
<a id='line_1272'>      and brother the vilest of mankind. In the massacre of the</a>
<a id='line_1273'>      Imperial family, 50 the mercy, or rather the discretion, of</a>
<a id='line_1274'>      Phocas had spared these unhappy females, and they were decently</a>
<a id='line_1275'>      confined to a private house. But the spirit of the empress</a>
<a id='line_1276'>      Constantina, still mindful of her father, her husband, and her</a>
<a id='line_1277'>      sons, aspired to freedom and revenge. At the dead of night, she</a>
<a id='line_1278'>      escaped to the sanctuary of St. Sophia; but her tears, and the</a>
<a id='line_1279'>      gold of her associate Germanus, were insufficient to provoke an</a>
<a id='line_1280'>      insurrection. Her life was forfeited to revenge, and even to</a>
<a id='line_1281'>      justice: but the patriarch obtained and pledged an oath for her</a>
<a id='line_1282'>      safety: a monastery was allotted for her prison, and the widow of</a>
<a id='line_1283'>      Maurice accepted and abused the lenity of his assassin. The</a>
<a id='line_1284'>      discovery or the suspicion of a second conspiracy, dissolved the</a>
<a id='line_1285'>      engagements, and rekindled the fury, of Phocas. A matron who</a>
<a id='line_1286'>      commanded the respect and pity of mankind, the daughter, wife,</a>
<a id='line_1287'>      and mother of emperors, was tortured like the vilest malefactor,</a>
<a id='line_1288'>      to force a confession of her designs and associates; and the</a>
<a id='line_1289'>      empress Constantina, with her three innocent daughters, was</a>
<a id='line_1290'>      beheaded at Chalcedon, on the same ground which had been stained</a>
<a id='line_1291'>      with the blood of her husband and five sons. After such an</a>
<a id='line_1292'>      example, it would be superfluous to enumerate the names and</a>
<a id='line_1293'>      sufferings of meaner victims. Their condemnation was seldom</a>
<a id='line_1294'>      preceded by the forms of trial, and their punishment was</a>
<a id='line_1295'>      embittered by the refinements of cruelty: their eyes were</a>
<a id='line_1296'>      pierced, their tongues were torn from the root, the hands and</a>
<a id='line_1297'>      feet were amputated; some expired under the lash, others in the</a>
<a id='line_1298'>      flames; others again were transfixed with arrows; and a simple</a>
<a id='line_1299'>      speedy death was mercy which they could rarely obtain. The</a>

<a id='line_1301'>      the Romans, was polluted with heads and limbs, and mangled</a>

<a id='line_1356'>      exarch was solicited to save and to govern his country; but his</a>

<a id='line_1358'>      enterprise to his son Heraclius, and to Nicetas, the son of</a>
<a id='line_1359'>      Gregory, his friend and lieutenant. The powers of Africa were</a>

<a id='line_1362'>      the other should lead an army through Egypt and Asia, and that</a>
<a id='line_1363'>      the Imperial purple should be the reward of diligence and</a>
<a id='line_1364'>      success. A faint rumor of their undertaking was conveyed to the</a>
<a id='line_1365'>      ears of Phocas, and the wife and mother of the younger Heraclius</a>
<a id='line_1366'>      were secured as the hostages of his faith: but the treacherous</a>

<a id='line_1368'>      defence were neglected or delayed, and the tyrant supinely slept</a>
<a id='line_1369'>      till the African navy cast anchor in the Hellespont. Their</a>
<a id='line_1370'>      standard was joined at Abidus by the fugitives and exiles who</a>
<a id='line_1371'>      thirsted for revenge; the ships of Heraclius, whose lofty masts</a>
<a id='line_1372'>      were adorned with the holy symbols of religion, 53 steered their</a>
<a id='line_1373'>      triumphant course through the Propontis; and Phocas beheld from</a>

<a id='line_1375'>      The green faction was tempted, by gifts and promises, to oppose a</a>
<a id='line_1376'>      feeble and fruitless resistance to the landing of the Africans:</a>
<a id='line_1377'>      but the people, and even the guards, were determined by the</a>
<a id='line_1378'>      well-timed defection of Crispus; and the tyrant was seized by a</a>
<a id='line_1379'>      private enemy, who boldly invaded the solitude of the palace.</a>
<a id='line_1380'>      Stripped of the diadem and purple, clothed in a vile habit, and</a>
<a id='line_1381'>      loaded with chains, he was transported in a small boat to the</a>

<a id='line_1383'>      of his abominable reign. “Wilt thou govern better?” were the last</a>
<a id='line_1384'>      words of the despair of Phocas. After suffering each variety of</a>
<a id='line_1385'>      insult and torture, his head was severed from his body, the</a>
<a id='line_1386'>      mangled trunk was cast into the flames, and the same treatment</a>
<a id='line_1387'>      was inflicted on the statues of the vain usurper, and the</a>
<a id='line_1388'>      seditious banner of the green faction. The voice of the clergy,</a>
<a id='line_1389'>      the senate, and the people, invited Heraclius to ascend the</a>
<a id='line_1390'>      throne which he had purified from guilt and ignominy; after some</a>
<a id='line_1391'>      graceful hesitation, he yielded to their entreaties. His</a>

<a id='line_1622'>      and hatred, the Persian conqueror governed his new subjects with</a>
<a id='line_1623'>      an iron sceptre; and, as if he suspected the stability of his</a>

<a id='line_1635'>      was deterred by superstition or resentment from approaching the</a>

<a id='line_1773'>      hopeless of relief, had resolved to transfer his person and</a>
<a id='line_1774'>      government to the more secure residence of Carthage. His ships</a>
<a id='line_1775'>      were already laden with the treasures of the palace; but his</a>
<a id='line_1776'>      flight was arrested by the patriarch, who armed the powers of</a>
<a id='line_1777'>      religion in the defence of his country; led Heraclius to the</a>
<a id='line_1778'>      altar of St. Sophia, and extorted a solemn oath, that he would</a>
<a id='line_1779'>      live and die with the people whom God had intrusted to his care.</a>
<a id='line_1780'>      The chagan was encamped in the plains of Thrace; but he</a>
<a id='line_1781'>      dissembled his perfidious designs, and solicited an interview</a>
<a id='line_1782'>      with the emperor near the town of Heraclea. Their reconciliation</a>
<a id='line_1783'>      was celebrated with equestrian games; the senate and people, in</a>
<a id='line_1784'>      their gayest apparel, resorted to the festival of peace; and the</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      Avars beheld, with envy and desire, the spectacle of Roman</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      luxury. On a sudden the hippodrome was encompassed by the</a>
<a id='line_1787'>      Scythian cavalry, who had pressed their secret and nocturnal</a>
<a id='line_1788'>      march: the tremendous sound of the chagan’s whip gave the signal</a>
<a id='line_1789'>      of the assault, and Heraclius, wrapping his diadem round his arm,</a>
<a id='line_1790'>      was saved with extreme hazard, by the fleetness of his horse. So</a>
<a id='line_1791'>      rapid was the pursuit, that the Avars almost entered the golden</a>
<a id='line_1792'>      gate of Constantinople with the flying crowds: 71 but the plunder</a>
<a id='line_1793'>      of the suburbs rewarded their treason, and they transported</a>
<a id='line_1794'>      beyond the Danube two hundred and seventy thousand captives. On</a>
<a id='line_1795'>      the shore of Chalcedon, the emperor held a safer conference with</a>
<a id='line_1796'>      a more honorable foe, who, before Heraclius descended from his</a>
<a id='line_1797'>      galley, saluted with reverence and pity the majesty of the</a>
<a id='line_1798'>      purple. The friendly offer of Sain, the Persian general, to</a>
<a id='line_1799'>      conduct an embassy to the presence of the great king, was</a>
<a id='line_1800'>      accepted with the warmest gratitude, and the prayer for pardon</a>
<a id='line_1801'>      and peace was humbly presented by the Praetorian praefect, the</a>
<a id='line_1802'>      praefect of the city, and one of the first ecclesiastics of the</a>
<a id='line_1803'>      patriarchal church. 72 But the lieutenant of Chosroes had fatally</a>
<a id='line_1804'>      mistaken the intentions of his master. “It was not an embassy,”</a>
<a id='line_1805'>      said the tyrant of Asia, “it was the person of Heraclius, bound</a>
<a id='line_1806'>      in chains, that he should have brought to the foot of my throne.</a>
<a id='line_1807'>      I will never give peace to the emperor of Rome, till he had</a>
<a id='line_1808'>      abjured his crucified God, and embraced the worship of the sun.”</a>
<a id='line_1809'>      Sain was flayed alive, according to the inhuman practice of his</a>
<a id='line_1810'>      country; and the separate and rigorous confinement of the</a>
<a id='line_1811'>      ambassadors violated the law of nations, and the faith of an</a>
<a id='line_1812'>      express stipulation. Yet the experience of six years at length</a>
<a id='line_1813'>      persuaded the Persian monarch to renounce the conquest of</a>
<a id='line_1814'>      Constantinople, and to specify the annual tribute or ransom of</a>

<a id='line_1816'>      of silver, a thousand silk robes, a thousand horses, and a</a>

<a id='line_1836'>      Of the characters conspicuous in history, that of Heraclius is</a>
<a id='line_1837'>      one of the most extraordinary and inconsistent. In the first and</a>
<a id='line_1838'>      last years of a long reign, the emperor appears to be the slave</a>
<a id='line_1839'>      of sloth, of pleasure, or of superstition, the careless and</a>

<a id='line_1841'>      mists of the morning and evening are separated by the brightness</a>
<a id='line_1842'>      of the meridian sun; the Arcadius of the palace arose the Caesar</a>
<a id='line_1843'>      of the camp; and the honor of Rome and Heraclius was gloriously</a>
<a id='line_1844'>      retrieved by the exploits and trophies of six adventurous</a>
<a id='line_1845'>      campaigns. It was the duty of the Byzantine historians to have</a>
<a id='line_1846'>      revealed the causes of his slumber and vigilance. At this</a>
<a id='line_1847'>      distance we can only conjecture, that he was endowed with more</a>
<a id='line_1848'>      personal courage than political resolution; that he was detained</a>
<a id='line_1849'>      by the charms, and perhaps the arts, of his niece Martina, with</a>
<a id='line_1850'>      whom, after the death of Eudocia, he contracted an incestuous</a>
<a id='line_1851'>      marriage; 73 and that he yielded to the base advice of the</a>
<a id='line_1852'>      counsellors, who urged, as a fundamental law, that the life of</a>
<a id='line_1853'>      the emperor should never be exposed in the field. 74 Perhaps he</a>
<a id='line_1854'>      was awakened by the last insolent demand of the Persian</a>
<a id='line_1855'>      conqueror; but at the moment when Heraclius assumed the spirit of</a>
<a id='line_1856'>      a hero, the only hopes of the Romans were drawn from the</a>
<a id='line_1857'>      vicissitudes of fortune, which might threaten the proud</a>
<a id='line_1858'>      prosperity of Chosroes, and must be favorable to those who had</a>
<a id='line_1859'>      attained the lowest period of depression. 75 To provide for the</a>
<a id='line_1860'>      expenses of war, was the first care of the emperor; and for the</a>
<a id='line_1861'>      purpose of collecting the tribute, he was allowed to solicit the</a>
<a id='line_1862'>      benevolence of the eastern provinces. But the revenue no longer</a>
<a id='line_1863'>      flowed in the usual channels; the credit of an arbitrary prince</a>
<a id='line_1864'>      is annihilated by his power; and the courage of Heraclius was</a>
<a id='line_1865'>      first displayed in daring to borrow the consecrated wealth of</a>
<a id='line_1866'>      churches, under the solemn vow of restoring, with usury, whatever</a>
<a id='line_1867'>      he had been compelled to employ in the service of religion and</a>
<a id='line_1868'>      the empire. The clergy themselves appear to have sympathized with</a>
<a id='line_1869'>      the public distress; and the discreet patriarch of Alexandria,</a>
<a id='line_1870'>      without admitting the precedent of sacrilege, assisted his</a>
<a id='line_1871'>      sovereign by the miraculous or seasonable revelation of a secret</a>
<a id='line_1872'>      treasure. 76 Of the soldiers who had conspired with Phocas, only</a>
<a id='line_1873'>      two were found to have survived the stroke of time and of the</a>
<a id='line_1874'>      Barbarians; 77 the loss, even of these seditious veterans, was</a>

<a id='line_1948'>      whatsoever point of the circumference he should direct his</a>
<a id='line_1949'>      attack, it was easy for him to dissemble his own motions, and to</a>
<a id='line_1950'>      prevent those of the enemy. In the camp of Issus, the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1951'>      general reformed the sloth and disorder of the veterans, and</a>
<a id='line_1952'>      educated the new recruits in the knowledge and practice of</a>
<a id='line_1953'>      military virtue. Unfolding the miraculous image of Christ, he</a>
<a id='line_1954'>      urged them to revenge the holy altars which had been profaned by</a>
<a id='line_1955'>      the worshippers of fire; addressing them by the endearing</a>
<a id='line_1956'>      appellations of sons and brethren, he deplored the public and</a>
<a id='line_1957'>      private wrongs of the republic. The subjects of a monarch were</a>
<a id='line_1958'>      persuaded that they fought in the cause of freedom; and a similar</a>
<a id='line_1959'>      enthusiasm was communicated to the foreign mercenaries, who must</a>
<a id='line_1960'>      have viewed with equal indifference the interest of Rome and of</a>
<a id='line_1961'>      Persia. Heraclius himself, with the skill and patience of a</a>
<a id='line_1962'>      centurion, inculcated the lessons of the school of tactics, and</a>
<a id='line_1963'>      the soldiers were assiduously trained in the use of their</a>
<a id='line_1964'>      weapons, and the exercises and evolutions of the field. The</a>
<a id='line_1965'>      cavalry and infantry in light or heavy armor were divided into</a>
<a id='line_1966'>      two parties; the trumpets were fixed in the centre, and their</a>
<a id='line_1967'>      signals directed the march, the charge, the retreat or pursuit;</a>
<a id='line_1968'>      the direct or oblique order, the deep or extended phalanx; to</a>
<a id='line_1969'>      represent in fictitious combat the operations of genuine war.</a>
<a id='line_1970'>      Whatever hardships the emperor imposed on the troops, he</a>
<a id='line_1971'>      inflicted with equal severity on himself; their labor, their</a>
<a id='line_1972'>      diet, their sleep, were measured by the inflexible rules of</a>
<a id='line_1973'>      discipline; and, without despising the enemy, they were taught to</a>
<a id='line_1974'>      repose an implicit confidence in their own valor and the wisdom</a>
<a id='line_1975'>      of their leader. Cilicia was soon encompassed with the Persian</a>
<a id='line_1976'>      arms; but their cavalry hesitated to enter the defiles of Mount</a>
<a id='line_1977'>      Taurus, till they were circumvented by the evolutions of</a>
<a id='line_1978'>      Heraclius, who insensibly gained their rear, whilst he appeared</a>
<a id='line_1979'>      to present his front in order of battle. By a false motion, which</a>
<a id='line_1980'>      seemed to threaten Armenia, he drew them, against their wishes,</a>
<a id='line_1981'>      to a general action. They were tempted by the artful disorder of</a>
<a id='line_1982'>      his camp; but when they advanced to combat, the ground, the sun,</a>
<a id='line_1983'>      and the expectation of both armies, were unpropitious to the</a>
<a id='line_1984'>      Barbarians; the Romans successfully repeated their tactics in a</a>
<a id='line_1985'>      field of battle, 81 and the event of the day declared to the</a>
<a id='line_1986'>      world, that the Persians were not invincible, and that a hero was</a>
<a id='line_1987'>      invested with the purple. Strong in victory and fame, Heraclius</a>
<a id='line_1988'>      boldly ascended the heights of Mount Taurus, directed his march</a>

<a id='line_2037'>      country. With a select band of five thousand soldiers, Heraclius</a>
<a id='line_2038'>      sailed from Constantinople to Trebizond; assembled his forces</a>
<a id='line_2039'>      which had wintered in the Pontic regions; and, from the mouth of</a>

<a id='line_2049'>      pious hatred of the enemies of Christ. The limits of Armenia, as</a>

<a id='line_2057'>      approach of Heraclius, declining the generous alternative of</a>
<a id='line_2058'>      peace or of battle. Instead of half a million of inhabitants,</a>
<a id='line_2059'>      which have been ascribed to Tauris under the reign of the Sophys,</a>
<a id='line_2060'>      the city contained no more than three thousand houses; but the</a>

<a id='line_2062'>      they were the spoils of Croesus, which had been transported by</a>
<a id='line_2063'>      Cyrus from the citadel of Sardes. The rapid conquests of</a>
<a id='line_2064'>      Heraclius were suspended only by the winter season; a motive of</a>

<a id='line_2071'>      fire, and destroyed the temples, of the Magi; the statues of</a>
<a id='line_2072'>      Chosroes, who aspired to divine honors, were abandoned to the</a>

<a id='line_2168'>      But if we devote our lives for the salvation of our brethren, we</a>

<a id='line_2170'>      be liberally paid by God and posterity.” These magnanimous</a>
<a id='line_2171'>      sentiments were supported by the vigor of his actions. He</a>

<a id='line_2190'>      under the walls of Amida; and Heraclius informed the senate of</a>
<a id='line_2191'>      Constantinople of his safety and success, which they had already</a>
<a id='line_2192'>      felt by the retreat of the besiegers. The bridges of the</a>

<a id='line_2428'>      saddle and cuirass, adorned the triumph of Heraclius; and if he</a>

<a id='line_2433'>      standards, besides those which might be broken or torn, were</a>
<a id='line_2434'>      taken from the Persians; the greatest part of their army was cut</a>
<a id='line_2435'>      in pieces, and the victors, concealing their own loss, passed the</a>
<a id='line_2436'>      night on the field. They acknowledged, that on this occasion it</a>
<a id='line_2437'>      was less difficult to kill than to discomfit the soldiers of</a>
<a id='line_2438'>      Chosroes; amidst the bodies of their friends, no more than two</a>
<a id='line_2439'>      bow-shot from the enemy the remnant of the Persian cavalry stood</a>
<a id='line_2440'>      firm till the seventh hour of the night; about the eighth hour</a>
<a id='line_2441'>      they retired to their unrifled camp, collected their baggage, and</a>
<a id='line_2442'>      dispersed on all sides, from the want of orders rather than of</a>
<a id='line_2443'>      resolution. The diligence of Heraclius was not less admirable in</a>
<a id='line_2444'>      the use of victory; by a march of forty-eight miles in</a>
<a id='line_2445'>      four-and-twenty hours, his vanguard occupied the bridges of the</a>
<a id='line_2446'>      great and the lesser Zab; and the cities and palaces of Assyria</a>
<a id='line_2447'>      were open for the first time to the Romans. By a just gradation</a>
<a id='line_2448'>      of magnificent scenes, they penetrated to the royal seat of</a>
<a id='line_2449'>      Dastagerd, 1031 and, though much of the treasure had been</a>
<a id='line_2450'>      removed, and much had been expended, the remaining wealth appears</a>
<a id='line_2451'>      to have exceeded their hopes, and even to have satiated their</a>
<a id='line_2452'>      avarice. Whatever could not be easily transported, they consumed</a>

<a id='line_2529'>      his flight agitated with terror and tumult the palace, the city,</a>

<a id='line_2536'>      Arba, and a line of two hundred elephants; the troops of the more</a>
<a id='line_2537'>      distant provinces successively arrived, and the vilest domestics</a>
<a id='line_2538'>      of the king and satraps were enrolled for the last defence of the</a>
<a id='line_2539'>      throne. It was still in the power of Chosroes to obtain a</a>
<a id='line_2540'>      reasonable peace; and he was repeatedly pressed by the messengers</a>
<a id='line_2541'>      of Heraclius to spare the blood of his subjects, and to relieve a</a>
<a id='line_2542'>      humane conqueror from the painful duty of carrying fire and sword</a>
<a id='line_2543'>      through the fairest countries of Asia. But the pride of the</a>
<a id='line_2544'>      Persian had not yet sunk to the level of his fortune; he derived</a>
<a id='line_2545'>      a momentary confidence from the retreat of the emperor; he wept</a>
<a id='line_2546'>      with impotent rage over the ruins of his Assyrian palaces, and</a>

<a id='line_2554'>      gloried in the rank and merit of his mother Sira, had conspired</a>
<a id='line_2555'>      with the malcontent s to assert and anticipate the rights of</a>

<a id='line_2558'>      to the soldiers, the heir of Chosroes promised an increase of</a>
<a id='line_2559'>      pay; to the Christians, the free exercise of their religion; to</a>
<a id='line_2560'>      the captives, liberty and rewards; and to the nation, instant</a>
<a id='line_2561'>      peace and the reduction of taxes. It was determined by the</a>
<a id='line_2562'>      conspirators, that Siroes, with the ensigns of royalty, should</a>
<a id='line_2563'>      appear in the camp; and if the enterprise should fail, his escape</a>
<a id='line_2564'>      was contrived to the Imperial court. But the new monarch was</a>
<a id='line_2565'>      saluted with unanimous acclamations; the flight of Chosroes (yet</a>
<a id='line_2566'>      where could he have fled?) was rudely arrested, eighteen sons</a>
<a id='line_2567'>      were massacred 1061 before his face, and he was thrown into a</a>
<a id='line_2568'>      dungeon, where he expired on the fifth day. The Greeks and modern</a>
<a id='line_2569'>      Persians minutely describe how Chosroes was insulted, and</a>
<a id='line_2570'>      famished, and tortured, by the command of an inhuman son, who so</a>
<a id='line_2571'>      far surpassed the example of his father: but at the time of his</a>
<a id='line_2572'>      death, what tongue would relate the story of the parricide? what</a>
<a id='line_2573'>      eye could penetrate into the tower of darkness? According to the</a>

<a id='line_2662'>      wounded the vitals of the two monarchies, produced no change in</a>
<a id='line_2663'>      their external and relative situation. The return of Heraclius</a>
<a id='line_2664'>      from Tauris to Constantinople was a perpetual triumph; and after</a>
<a id='line_2665'>      the exploits of six glorious campaigns, he peaceably enjoyed the</a>
<a id='line_2666'>      Sabbath of his toils. After a long impatience, the senate, the</a>
<a id='line_2667'>      clergy, and the people, went forth to meet their hero, with tears</a>
<a id='line_2668'>      and acclamations, with olive branches and innumerable lamps; he</a>

<a id='line_2688'></a>
<a id='line_2689'>      The succeeding year was illustrated by a triumph of a very</a>
<a id='line_2690'>      different kind, the restitution of the true cross to the holy</a>
<a id='line_2691'>      sepulchre. Heraclius performed in person the pilgrimage of</a>
<a id='line_2692'>      Jerusalem, the identity of the relic was verified by the discreet</a>
<a id='line_2693'>      patriarch, 111 and this august ceremony has been commemorated by</a>
<a id='line_2694'>      the annual festival of the exaltation of the cross. Before the</a>
<a id='line_2695'>      emperor presumed to tread the consecrated ground, he was</a>
<a id='line_2696'>      instructed to strip himself of the diadem and purple, the pomp</a>
<a id='line_2697'>      and vanity of the world: but in the judgment of his clergy, the</a>
<a id='line_2698'>      persecution of the Jews was more easily reconciled with the</a>
<a id='line_2699'>      precepts of the gospel. 1113 He again ascended his throne to</a>
<a id='line_2700'>      receive the congratulations of the ambassadors of France and</a>
<a id='line_2701'>      India: and the fame of Moses, Alexander, and Hercules, 112 was</a>
<a id='line_2702'>      eclipsed in the popular estimation, by the superior merit and</a>
<a id='line_2703'>      glory of the great Heraclius. Yet the deliverer of the East was</a>
<a id='line_2704'>      indigent and feeble. Of the Persian spoils, the most valuable</a>
<a id='line_2705'>      portion had been expended in the war, distributed to the</a>
<a id='line_2706'>      soldiers, or buried, by an unlucky tempest, in the waves of the</a>
<a id='line_2707'>      Euxine. The conscience of the emperor was oppressed by the</a>
<a id='line_2708'>      obligation of restoring the wealth of the clergy, which he had</a>
<a id='line_2709'>      borrowed for their own defence: a perpetual fund was required to</a>
<a id='line_2710'>      satisfy these inexorable creditors; the provinces, already wasted</a>
<a id='line_2711'>      by the arms and avarice of the Persians, were compelled to a</a>
<a id='line_2712'>      second payment of the same taxes; and the arrears of a simple</a>
<a id='line_2713'>      citizen, the treasurer of Damascus, were commuted to a fine of</a>
<a id='line_2714'>      one hundred thousand pieces of gold. The loss of two hundred</a>
<a id='line_2715'>      thousand soldiers 113 who had fallen by the sword, was of less</a>
<a id='line_2716'>      fatal importance than the decay of arts, agriculture, and</a>
<a id='line_2717'>      population, in this long and destructive war: and although a</a>
<a id='line_2718'>      victorious army had been formed under the standard of Heraclius,</a>
<a id='line_2719'>      the unnatural effort appears to have exhausted rather than</a>
<a id='line_2720'>      exercised their strength. While the emperor triumphed at</a>
<a id='line_2721'>      Constantinople or Jerusalem, an obscure town on the confines of</a>
<a id='line_2722'>      Syria was pillaged by the Saracens, and they cut in pieces some</a>
<a id='line_2723'>      troops who advanced to its relief; an ordinary and trifling</a>
<a id='line_2724'>      occurrence, had it not been the prelude of a mighty revolution.</a>
<a id='line_2725'>      These robbers were the apostles of Mahomet; their fanatic valor</a>
<a id='line_2726'>      had emerged from the desert; and in the last eight years of his</a>
<a id='line_2727'>      reign, Heraclius lost to the Arabs the same provinces which he</a>
<a id='line_2728'>      had rescued from the Persians.</a>
