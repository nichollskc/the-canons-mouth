<a id='line_24'>  BOOK I.</a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'></a>
<a id='line_27'>    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit</a>
<a id='line_28'>  Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast</a>
<a id='line_29'>  Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,</a>
<a id='line_30'>  With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man</a>
<a id='line_31'>  Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,</a>
<a id='line_32'>  Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top</a>
<a id='line_33'>  Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire</a>
<a id='line_34'>  That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,</a>
<a id='line_35'>  In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth</a>
<a id='line_36'>  Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill</a>
<a id='line_37'>  Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd</a>
<a id='line_38'>  Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence</a>
<a id='line_39'>  Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,</a>
<a id='line_40'>  That with no middle flight intends to soar</a>
<a id='line_41'>  Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues</a>
<a id='line_42'>  Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.</a>
<a id='line_43'>  And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer</a>
<a id='line_44'>  Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,</a>
<a id='line_45'>  Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first</a>
<a id='line_46'>  Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread</a>
<a id='line_47'>  Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss</a>
<a id='line_48'>  And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark</a>
<a id='line_49'>  Illumine, what is low raise and support;</a>
<a id='line_50'>  That to the highth of this great Argument</a>
<a id='line_51'>  I may assert th' Eternal Providence,</a>
<a id='line_52'>  And justifie the wayes of God to men.</a>
<a id='line_53'></a>
<a id='line_54'>    Say first, for Heav'n hides nothing from thy view</a>
<a id='line_55'>  Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause</a>
<a id='line_56'>  Mov'd our Grand Parents in that happy State,</a>
<a id='line_57'>  Favour'd of Heav'n so highly, to fall off</a>
<a id='line_58'>  From their Creator, and transgress his Will</a>
<a id='line_59'>  For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?</a>
<a id='line_60'>  Who first seduc'd them to that fowl revolt?</a>
<a id='line_61'>  Th' infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile</a>
<a id='line_62'>  Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv'd</a>
<a id='line_63'>  The Mother of Mankinde, what time his Pride</a>
<a id='line_64'>  Had cast him out from Heav'n, with all his Host</a>
<a id='line_65'>  Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring</a>
<a id='line_66'>  To set himself in Glory above his Peers,</a>
<a id='line_67'>  He trusted to have equal'd the most High,</a>
<a id='line_68'>  If he oppos'd; and with ambitious aim</a>
<a id='line_69'>  Against the Throne and Monarchy of God</a>
<a id='line_70'>  Rais'd impious War in Heav'n and Battel proud</a>
<a id='line_71'>  With vain attempt.  Him the Almighty Power</a>
<a id='line_72'>  Hurld headlong flaming from th' Ethereal Skie</a>
<a id='line_73'>  With hideous ruine and combustion down</a>
<a id='line_74'>  To bottomless perdition, there to dwell</a>
<a id='line_75'>  In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,</a>
<a id='line_76'>  Who durst defie th' Omnipotent to Arms.</a>
<a id='line_77'>  Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night</a>
<a id='line_78'>  To mortal men, he with his horrid crew</a>
<a id='line_79'>  Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe</a>
<a id='line_80'>  Confounded though immortal: But his doom</a>
<a id='line_81'>  Reserv'd him to more wrath; for now the thought</a>
<a id='line_82'>  Both of lost happiness and lasting pain</a>
<a id='line_83'>  Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes</a>
<a id='line_84'>  That witness'd huge affliction and dismay</a>
<a id='line_85'>  Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:</a>
<a id='line_86'>  At once as far as Angels kenn he views</a>
<a id='line_87'>  The dismal Situation waste and wilde,</a>
<a id='line_88'>  A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round</a>
<a id='line_89'>  As one great Furnace flam'd, yet from those flames</a>
<a id='line_90'>  No light, but rather darkness visible</a>
<a id='line_91'>  Serv'd only to discover sights of woe,</a>
<a id='line_92'>  Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace</a>
<a id='line_93'>  And rest can never dwell, hope never comes</a>
<a id='line_94'>  That comes to all; but torture without end</a>
<a id='line_95'>  Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed</a>
<a id='line_96'>  With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum'd:</a>
<a id='line_97'>  Such place Eternal Justice had prepar'd</a>
<a id='line_98'>  For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain'd</a>
<a id='line_99'>  In utter darkness, and their portion set</a>
<a id='line_100'>  As far remov'd from God and light of Heav'n</a>
<a id='line_101'>  As from the Center thrice to th' utmost Pole.</a>
<a id='line_102'>  O how unlike the place from whence they fell!</a>
<a id='line_103'>  There the companions of his fall, o'rewhelm'd</a>
<a id='line_104'>  With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,</a>
<a id='line_105'>  He soon discerns, and weltring by his side</a>
<a id='line_106'>  One next himself in power, and next in crime,</a>
<a id='line_107'>  Long after known in PALESTINE, and nam'd</a>
<a id='line_108'>  BEELZEBUB.  To whom th' Arch-Enemy,</a>
<a id='line_109'>  And thence in Heav'n call'd Satan, with bold words</a>
<a id='line_110'>  Breaking the horrid silence thus began.</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'>    If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how chang'd</a>
<a id='line_113'>  From him, who in the happy Realms of Light</a>
<a id='line_114'>  Cloth'd with transcendent brightnes didst outshine</a>
<a id='line_115'>  Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,</a>
<a id='line_116'>  United thoughts and counsels, equal hope,</a>
<a id='line_117'>  And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,</a>
<a id='line_118'>  Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd</a>
<a id='line_119'>  In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest</a>
<a id='line_120'>  From what highth fal'n, so much the stronger provd</a>
<a id='line_121'>  He with his Thunder: and till then who knew</a>
<a id='line_122'>  The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those</a>
<a id='line_123'>  Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage</a>
<a id='line_124'>  Can else inflict do I repent or change,</a>
<a id='line_125'>  Though chang'd in outward lustre; that fixt mind</a>
<a id='line_126'>  And high disdain, from sence of injur'd merit,</a>
<a id='line_127'>  That with the mightiest rais'd me to contend,</a>
<a id='line_128'>  And to the fierce contention brought along</a>
<a id='line_129'>  Innumerable force of Spirits arm'd</a>
<a id='line_130'>  That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,</a>
<a id='line_131'>  His utmost power with adverse power oppos'd</a>
<a id='line_132'>  In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n,</a>
<a id='line_133'>  And shook his throne.  What though the field be lost?</a>
<a id='line_134'>  All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,</a>
<a id='line_135'>  And study of revenge, immortal hate,</a>
<a id='line_136'>  And courage never to submit or yield:</a>
<a id='line_137'>  And what is else not to be overcome?</a>
<a id='line_138'>  That Glory never shall his wrath or might</a>
<a id='line_139'>  Extort from me.  To bow and sue for grace</a>
<a id='line_140'>  With suppliant knee, and deifie his power</a>
<a id='line_141'>  Who from the terrour of this Arm so late</a>
<a id='line_142'>  Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,</a>
<a id='line_143'>  That were an ignominy and shame beneath</a>
<a id='line_144'>  This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods</a>
<a id='line_145'>  And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,</a>
<a id='line_146'>  Since through experience of this great event</a>
<a id='line_147'>  In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't,</a>
<a id='line_148'>  We may with more successful hope resolve</a>
<a id='line_149'>  To wage by force or guile eternal Warr</a>
<a id='line_150'>  Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,</a>
<a id='line_151'>  Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy</a>
<a id='line_152'>  Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n.</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>    So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain,</a>
<a id='line_155'>  Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:</a>
<a id='line_156'>  And him thus answer'd soon his bold Compeer.</a>
<a id='line_157'></a>
<a id='line_158'>    O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,</a>
<a id='line_159'>  That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to Warr</a>
<a id='line_160'>  Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds</a>
<a id='line_161'>  Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King;</a>
<a id='line_162'>  And put to proof his high Supremacy,</a>
<a id='line_163'>  Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,</a>
<a id='line_164'>  Too well I see and rue the dire event,</a>
<a id='line_165'>  That with sad overthrow and foul defeat</a>
<a id='line_166'>  Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host</a>
<a id='line_167'>  In horrible destruction laid thus low,</a>
<a id='line_168'>  As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences</a>
<a id='line_169'>  Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains</a>
<a id='line_170'>  Invincible, and vigour soon returns,</a>
<a id='line_171'>  Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state</a>
<a id='line_172'>  Here swallow'd up in endless misery.</a>
<a id='line_173'>  But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now</a>
<a id='line_174'>  Of force believe Almighty, since no less</a>
<a id='line_175'>  Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours)</a>
<a id='line_176'>  Have left us this our spirit and strength intire</a>
<a id='line_177'>  Strongly to suffer and support our pains,</a>
<a id='line_178'>  That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,</a>
<a id='line_179'>  Or do him mightier service as his thralls</a>
<a id='line_180'>  By right of Warr, what e're his business be</a>
<a id='line_181'>  Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,</a>
<a id='line_182'>  Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;</a>
<a id='line_183'>  What can it then avail though yet we feel</a>
<a id='line_184'>  Strength undiminisht, or eternal being</a>
<a id='line_185'>  To undergo eternal punishment?</a>
<a id='line_186'>  Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd.</a>
<a id='line_187'></a>
<a id='line_188'>    Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable</a>
<a id='line_189'>  Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,</a>
<a id='line_190'>  To do ought good never will be our task,</a>
<a id='line_191'>  But ever to do ill our sole delight,</a>
<a id='line_192'>  As being the contrary to his high will</a>
<a id='line_193'>  Whom we resist.  If then his Providence</a>
<a id='line_194'>  Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,</a>
<a id='line_195'>  Our labour must be to pervert that end,</a>
<a id='line_196'>  And out of good still to find means of evil;</a>
<a id='line_197'>  Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps</a>
<a id='line_198'>  Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb</a>
<a id='line_199'>  His inmost counsels from their destind aim.</a>
<a id='line_200'>  But see the angry Victor hath recall'd</a>
<a id='line_201'>  His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit</a>
<a id='line_202'>  Back to the Gates of Heav'n: The Sulphurous Hail</a>
<a id='line_203'>  Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid</a>
<a id='line_204'>  The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice</a>
<a id='line_205'>  Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder,</a>
<a id='line_206'>  Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous rage,</a>
<a id='line_207'>  Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now</a>
<a id='line_208'>  To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.</a>
<a id='line_209'>  Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn,</a>
<a id='line_210'>  Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.</a>
<a id='line_211'>  Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,</a>
<a id='line_212'>  The seat of desolation, voyd of light,</a>
<a id='line_213'>  Save what the glimmering of these livid flames</a>
<a id='line_214'>  Casts pale and dreadful?  Thither let us tend</a>
<a id='line_215'>  From off the tossing of these fiery waves,</a>
<a id='line_216'>  There rest, if any rest can harbour there,</a>
<a id='line_217'>  And reassembling our afflicted Powers,</a>
<a id='line_218'>  Consult how we may henceforth most offend</a>
<a id='line_219'>  Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,</a>
<a id='line_220'>  How overcome this dire Calamity,</a>
<a id='line_221'>  What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,</a>
<a id='line_222'>  If not what resolution from despare.</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>    Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate</a>
<a id='line_225'>  With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes</a>
<a id='line_226'>  That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides</a>
<a id='line_227'>  Prone on the Flood, extended long and large</a>
<a id='line_228'>  Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge</a>
<a id='line_229'>  As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,</a>
<a id='line_230'>  TITANIAN, or EARTH-BORN, that warr'd on JOVE,</a>
<a id='line_231'>  BRIARIOS or TYPHON, whom the Den</a>
<a id='line_232'>  By ancient TARSUS held, or that Sea-beast</a>
<a id='line_233'>  LEVIATHAN, which God of all his works</a>
<a id='line_234'>  Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream:</a>
<a id='line_235'>  Him haply slumbring on the NORWAY foam</a>
<a id='line_236'>  The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff,</a>
<a id='line_237'>  Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,</a>
<a id='line_238'>  With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind</a>
<a id='line_239'>  Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night</a>
<a id='line_240'>  Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:</a>
<a id='line_241'>  So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay</a>
<a id='line_242'>  Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence</a>
<a id='line_243'>  Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will</a>
<a id='line_244'>  And high permission of all-ruling Heaven</a>
<a id='line_245'>  Left him at large to his own dark designs,</a>
<a id='line_246'>  That with reiterated crimes he might</a>
<a id='line_247'>  Heap on himself damnation, while he sought</a>
<a id='line_248'>  Evil to others, and enrag'd might see</a>
<a id='line_249'>  How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth</a>
<a id='line_250'>  Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn</a>
<a id='line_251'>  On Man by him seduc't, but on himself</a>
<a id='line_252'>  Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd.</a>
<a id='line_253'>  Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool</a>
<a id='line_254'>  His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames</a>
<a id='line_255'>  Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, & rowld</a>
<a id='line_256'>  In billows, leave i'th' midst a horrid Vale.</a>
<a id='line_257'>  Then with expanded wings he stears his flight</a>
<a id='line_258'>  Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air</a>
<a id='line_259'>  That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land</a>
<a id='line_260'>  He lights, if it were Land that ever burn'd</a>
<a id='line_261'>  With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;</a>
<a id='line_262'>  And such appear'd in hue, as when the force</a>
<a id='line_263'>  Of subterranean wind transports a Hill</a>
<a id='line_264'>  Torn from PELORUS, or the shatter'd side</a>
<a id='line_265'>  Of thundring AETNA, whose combustible</a>
<a id='line_266'>  And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire,</a>
<a id='line_267'>  Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,</a>
<a id='line_268'>  And leave a singed bottom all involv'd</a>
<a id='line_269'>  With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole</a>
<a id='line_270'>  Of unblest feet.  Him followed his next Mate,</a>
<a id='line_271'>  Both glorying to have scap't the STYGIAN flood</a>
<a id='line_272'>  As Gods, and by their own recover'd strength,</a>
<a id='line_273'>  Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.</a>
<a id='line_274'></a>
<a id='line_275'>    Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,</a>
<a id='line_276'>  Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat</a>
<a id='line_277'>  That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloom</a>
<a id='line_278'>  For that celestial light?  Be it so, since hee</a>
<a id='line_279'>  Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid</a>
<a id='line_280'>  What shall be right: fardest from him is best</a>
<a id='line_281'>  Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream</a>
<a id='line_282'>  Above his equals.  Farewel happy Fields</a>
<a id='line_283'>  Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail</a>
<a id='line_284'>  Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell</a>
<a id='line_285'>  Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings</a>
<a id='line_286'>  A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time.</a>
<a id='line_287'>  The mind is its own place, and in it self</a>
<a id='line_288'>  Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.</a>
<a id='line_289'>  What matter where, if I be still the same,</a>
<a id='line_290'>  And what I should be, all but less then hee</a>
<a id='line_291'>  Whom Thunder hath made greater?  Here at least</a>
<a id='line_292'>  We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built</a>
<a id='line_293'>  Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:</a>
<a id='line_294'>  Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce</a>
<a id='line_295'>  To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:</a>
<a id='line_296'>  Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n.</a>
<a id='line_297'>  But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,</a>
<a id='line_298'>  Th' associates and copartners of our loss</a>
<a id='line_299'>  Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool,</a>
<a id='line_300'>  And call them not to share with us their part</a>
<a id='line_301'>  In this unhappy Mansion, or once more</a>
<a id='line_302'>  With rallied Arms to try what may be yet</a>
<a id='line_303'>  Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell?</a>
<a id='line_304'></a>
<a id='line_305'>    So SATAN spake, and him BEELZEBUB</a>
<a id='line_306'>  Thus answer'd.  Leader of those Armies bright,</a>
<a id='line_307'>  Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld,</a>
<a id='line_308'>  If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge</a>
<a id='line_309'>  Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft</a>
<a id='line_310'>  In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge</a>
<a id='line_311'>  Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults</a>
<a id='line_312'>  Their surest signal, they will soon resume</a>
<a id='line_313'>  New courage and revive, though now they lye</a>
<a id='line_314'>  Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,</a>
<a id='line_315'>  As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd,</a>
<a id='line_316'>  No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth.</a>
<a id='line_317'></a>
<a id='line_318'>    He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend</a>
<a id='line_319'>  Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield</a>
<a id='line_320'>  Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,</a>

<a id='line_468'>  For those the Race of ISRAEL oft forsook</a>
<a id='line_469'>  Their living strength, and unfrequented left</a>
<a id='line_470'>  His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down</a>
<a id='line_471'>  To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low</a>
<a id='line_472'>  Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear</a>
<a id='line_473'>  Of despicable foes.  With these in troop</a>
<a id='line_474'>  Came ASTORETH, whom the PHOENICIANS call'd</a>
<a id='line_475'>  ASTARTE, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns;</a>
<a id='line_476'>  To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon</a>

<a id='line_479'>  Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built</a>
<a id='line_480'>  By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,</a>
<a id='line_481'>  Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell</a>
<a id='line_482'>  To Idols foul.  THAMMUZ came next behind,</a>
<a id='line_483'>  Whose annual wound in LEBANON allur'd</a>
<a id='line_484'>  The SYRIAN Damsels to lament his fate</a>
<a id='line_485'>  In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,</a>
<a id='line_486'>  While smooth ADONIS from his native Rock</a>
<a id='line_487'>  Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood</a>
<a id='line_488'>  Of THAMMUZ yearly wounded: the Love-tale</a>
<a id='line_489'>  Infected SIONS daughters with like heat,</a>
<a id='line_490'>  Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch</a>
<a id='line_491'>  EZEKIEL saw, when by the Vision led</a>
<a id='line_492'>  His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries</a>
<a id='line_493'>  Of alienated JUDAH.  Next came one</a>
<a id='line_494'>  Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark</a>
<a id='line_495'>  Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off</a>
<a id='line_496'>  In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,</a>
<a id='line_497'>  Where he fell flat, and sham'd his Worshipers:</a>
<a id='line_498'>  DAGON his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man</a>
<a id='line_499'>  And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high</a>
<a id='line_500'>  Rear'd in AZOTUS, dreaded through the Coast</a>
<a id='line_501'>  Of PALESTINE, in GATH and ASCALON,</a>
<a id='line_502'>  And ACCARON and GAZA's frontier bounds.</a>
<a id='line_503'>  Him follow'd RIMMON, whose delightful Seat</a>
<a id='line_504'>  Was fair DAMASCUS, on the fertil Banks</a>
<a id='line_505'>  Of ABBANA and PHARPHAR, lucid streams.</a>
<a id='line_506'>  He also against the house of God was bold:</a>
<a id='line_507'>  A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King,</a>
<a id='line_508'>  AHAZ his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew</a>
<a id='line_509'>  Gods Altar to disparage and displace</a>
<a id='line_510'>  For one of SYRIAN mode, whereon to burn</a>
<a id='line_511'>  His odious offrings, and adore the Gods</a>
<a id='line_512'>  Whom he had vanquisht.  After these appear'd</a>
<a id='line_513'>  A crew who under Names of old Renown,</a>
<a id='line_514'>  OSIRIS, ISIS, ORUS and their Train</a>
<a id='line_515'>  With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd</a>
<a id='line_516'>  Fanatic EGYPT and her Priests, to seek</a>
<a id='line_517'>  Thir wandring Gods disguis'd in brutish forms</a>
<a id='line_518'>  Rather then human.  Nor did ISRAEL scape</a>
<a id='line_519'>  Th' infection when their borrow'd Gold compos'd</a>
<a id='line_520'>  The Calf in OREB: and the Rebel King</a>
<a id='line_521'>  Doubl'd that sin in BETHEL and in DAN,</a>
<a id='line_522'>  Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,</a>
<a id='line_523'>  JEHOVAH, who in one Night when he pass'd</a>
<a id='line_524'>  From EGYPT marching, equal'd with one stroke</a>
<a id='line_525'>  Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.</a>
<a id='line_526'>  BELIAL came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd</a>
<a id='line_527'>  Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love</a>
<a id='line_528'>  Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood</a>
<a id='line_529'>  Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee</a>
<a id='line_530'>  In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest</a>
<a id='line_531'>  Turns Atheist, as did ELY'S Sons, who fill'd</a>
<a id='line_532'>  With lust and violence the house of God.</a>
<a id='line_533'>  In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns</a>
<a id='line_534'>  And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse</a>
<a id='line_535'>  Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,</a>
<a id='line_536'>  And injury and outrage: And when Night</a>
<a id='line_537'>  Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons</a>
<a id='line_538'>  Of BELIAL, flown with insolence and wine.</a>
<a id='line_539'>  Witness the Streets of SODOM, and that night</a>
<a id='line_540'>  In GIBEAH, when hospitable Dores</a>
<a id='line_541'>  Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.</a>
<a id='line_542'>  These were the prime in order and in might;</a>
<a id='line_543'>  The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd,</a>

<a id='line_557'>  And ore the CELTIC roam'd the utmost Isles.</a>
<a id='line_558'>  All these and more came flocking; but with looks</a>

<a id='line_562'>  In loss it self; which on his count'nance cast</a>
<a id='line_563'>  Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride</a>
<a id='line_564'>  Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore</a>
<a id='line_565'>  Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais'd</a>
<a id='line_566'>  Their fainted courage, and dispel'd their fears.</a>
<a id='line_567'>  Then strait commands that at the warlike sound</a>

<a id='line_569'>  His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd</a>
<a id='line_570'>  AZAZEL as his right, a Cherube tall:</a>

<a id='line_578'>  A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond</a>
<a id='line_579'>  Frighted the Reign of CHAOS and old Night.</a>
<a id='line_580'>  All in a moment through the gloom were seen</a>
<a id='line_581'>  Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air</a>

<a id='line_633'>  In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds</a>
<a id='line_634'>  On half the Nations, and with fear of change</a>
<a id='line_635'>  Perplexes Monarchs.  Dark'n'd so, yet shon</a>

<a id='line_637'>  Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care</a>
<a id='line_638'>  Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes</a>
<a id='line_639'>  Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride</a>
<a id='line_640'>  Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast</a>
<a id='line_641'>  Signs of remorse and passion to behold</a>
<a id='line_642'>  The fellows of his crime, the followers rather</a>
<a id='line_643'>  (Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd</a>
<a id='line_644'>  For ever now to have their lot in pain,</a>
<a id='line_645'>  Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't</a>
<a id='line_646'>  Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors flung</a>
<a id='line_647'>  For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,</a>

<a id='line_650'>  With singed top their stately growth though bare</a>
<a id='line_651'>  Stands on the blasted Heath.  He now prepar'd</a>

<a id='line_655'>  Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,</a>

<a id='line_661'>  Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire,</a>
<a id='line_662'>  As this place testifies, and this dire change</a>

<a id='line_666'>  How such united force of Gods, how such</a>

<a id='line_677'>  Consent or custome, and his Regal State</a>
<a id='line_678'>  Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd,</a>
<a id='line_679'>  Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.</a>
<a id='line_680'>  Henceforth his might we know, and know our own</a>

<a id='line_689'>  Intended to create, and therein plant</a>
<a id='line_690'>  A generation, whom his choice regard</a>
<a id='line_691'>  Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:</a>
<a id='line_692'>  Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps</a>
<a id='line_693'>  Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:</a>
<a id='line_694'>  For this Infernal Pit shall never hold</a>
<a id='line_695'>  Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th' Abysse</a>
<a id='line_696'>  Long under darkness cover.  But these thoughts</a>
<a id='line_697'>  Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,</a>
<a id='line_698'>  For who can think Submission?  Warr then, Warr</a>

<a id='line_704'>  Far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd</a>
<a id='line_705'>  Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm's</a>
<a id='line_706'>  Clash'd on their sounding shields the din of war,</a>
<a id='line_707'>  Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav'n.</a>
<a id='line_708'></a>
<a id='line_709'>    There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top</a>
<a id='line_710'>  Belch'd fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire</a>
<a id='line_711'>  Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign</a>
<a id='line_712'>  That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,</a>
<a id='line_713'>  The work of Sulphur.  Thither wing'd with speed</a>

<a id='line_716'>  Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,</a>
<a id='line_717'>  Or cast a Rampart.  MAMMON led them on,</a>
<a id='line_718'>  MAMMON, the least erected Spirit that fell</a>
<a id='line_719'>  From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks & thoughts</a>
<a id='line_720'>  Were always downward bent, admiring more</a>

<a id='line_725'>  Ransack'd the Center, and with impious hands</a>
<a id='line_726'>  Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth</a>
<a id='line_727'>  For Treasures better hid.  Soon had his crew</a>
<a id='line_728'>  Op'nd into the Hill a spacious wound</a>

<a id='line_745'>  A various mould, and from the boyling cells</a>
<a id='line_746'>  By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook,</a>
<a id='line_747'>  As in an Organ from one blast of wind</a>

<a id='line_749'>  Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge</a>

<a id='line_755'>  Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n,</a>

<a id='line_773'>  Where Scepter'd Angels held thir residence,</a>
<a id='line_774'>  And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King</a>
<a id='line_775'>  Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,</a>
<a id='line_776'>  Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.</a>

<a id='line_784'>  Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,</a>
<a id='line_785'>  On LEMNOS th' AEGAEAN Ile: thus they relate,</a>

<a id='line_788'>  To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape</a>

<a id='line_850'>  Satan exalted sat, by merit rais'd</a>
<a id='line_851'>  To that bad eminence; and from despair</a>
<a id='line_852'>  Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires</a>
<a id='line_853'>  Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue</a>
<a id='line_854'>  Vain Warr with Heav'n, and by success untaught</a>
<a id='line_855'>  His proud imaginations thus displaid.</a>
<a id='line_856'></a>
<a id='line_857'>    Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav'n,</a>
<a id='line_858'>  For since no deep within her gulf can hold</a>

<a id='line_871'>  In Heav'n, which follows dignity, might draw</a>
<a id='line_872'>  Envy from each inferior; but who here</a>

<a id='line_882'>  To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord,</a>
<a id='line_883'>  More then can be in Heav'n, we now return</a>

<a id='line_926'>  When the fierce Foe hung on our brok'n Rear</a>
<a id='line_927'>  Insulting, and pursu'd us through the Deep,</a>

<a id='line_949'>  On this side nothing; and by proof we feel</a>
<a id='line_950'>  Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav'n,</a>
<a id='line_951'>  And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme,</a>
<a id='line_952'>  Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne:</a>
<a id='line_953'>  Which if not Victory is yet Revenge.</a>
<a id='line_954'></a>
<a id='line_955'>    He ended frowning, and his look denounc'd</a>
<a id='line_956'>  Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous</a>
<a id='line_957'>  To less then Gods.  On th' other side up rose</a>
<a id='line_958'>  BELIAL, in act more graceful and humane;</a>
<a id='line_959'>  A fairer person lost not Heav'n; he seemd</a>
<a id='line_960'>  For dignity compos'd and high exploit:</a>
<a id='line_961'>  But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue</a>
<a id='line_962'>  Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear</a>
<a id='line_963'>  The better reason, to perplex and dash</a>
<a id='line_964'>  Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;</a>
<a id='line_965'>  To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds</a>
<a id='line_966'>  Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the eare,</a>
<a id='line_967'>  And with perswasive accent thus began.</a>
<a id='line_968'></a>
<a id='line_969'>    I should be much for open Warr, O Peers,</a>
<a id='line_970'>  As not behind in hate; if what was urg'd</a>
<a id='line_971'>  Main reason to perswade immediate Warr,</a>
<a id='line_972'>  Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast</a>
<a id='line_973'>  Ominous conjecture on the whole success:</a>
<a id='line_974'>  When he who most excels in fact of Arms,</a>
<a id='line_975'>  In what he counsels and in what excels</a>
<a id='line_976'>  Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair</a>
<a id='line_977'>  And utter dissolution, as the scope</a>
<a id='line_978'>  Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.</a>
<a id='line_979'>  First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav'n are fill'd</a>
<a id='line_980'>  With Armed watch, that render all access</a>
<a id='line_981'>  Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep</a>
<a id='line_982'>  Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing</a>
<a id='line_983'>  Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night,</a>
<a id='line_984'>  Scorning surprize.  Or could we break our way</a>
<a id='line_985'>  By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise</a>
<a id='line_986'>  With blackest Insurrection, to confound</a>
<a id='line_987'>  Heav'ns purest Light, yet our great Enemie</a>
<a id='line_988'>  All incorruptible would on his Throne</a>
<a id='line_989'>  Sit unpolluted, and th' Ethereal mould</a>
<a id='line_990'>  Incapable of stain would soon expel</a>
<a id='line_991'>  Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire</a>
<a id='line_992'>  Victorious.  Thus repuls'd, our final hope</a>
<a id='line_993'>  Is flat despair: we must exasperate</a>
<a id='line_994'>  Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,</a>
<a id='line_995'>  And that must end us, that must be our cure,</a>
<a id='line_996'>  To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose,</a>
<a id='line_997'>  Though full of pain, this intellectual being,</a>
<a id='line_998'>  Those thoughts that wander through Eternity,</a>
<a id='line_999'>  To perish rather, swallowd up and lost</a>
<a id='line_1000'>  In the wide womb of uncreated night,</a>
<a id='line_1001'>  Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows,</a>
<a id='line_1002'>  Let this be good, whether our angry Foe</a>
<a id='line_1003'>  Can give it, or will ever? how he can</a>
<a id='line_1004'>  Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.</a>
<a id='line_1005'>  Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,</a>
<a id='line_1006'>  Belike through impotence, or unaware,</a>
<a id='line_1007'>  To give his Enemies thir wish, and end</a>
<a id='line_1008'>  Them in his anger, whom his anger saves</a>
<a id='line_1009'>  To punish endless? wherefore cease we then?</a>
<a id='line_1010'>  Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed,</a>
<a id='line_1011'>  Reserv'd and destin'd to Eternal woe;</a>
<a id='line_1012'>  Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,</a>
<a id='line_1013'>  What can we suffer worse? is this then worst,</a>
<a id='line_1014'>  Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms?</a>
<a id='line_1015'>  What when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook</a>
<a id='line_1016'>  With Heav'ns afflicting Thunder, and besought</a>
<a id='line_1017'>  The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem'd</a>
<a id='line_1018'>  A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay</a>
<a id='line_1019'>  Chain'd on the burning Lake? that sure was worse.</a>
<a id='line_1020'>  What if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires</a>
<a id='line_1021'>  Awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage</a>
<a id='line_1022'>  And plunge us in the Flames? or from above</a>
<a id='line_1023'>  Should intermitted vengeance Arme again</a>
<a id='line_1024'>  His red right hand to plague us? what if all</a>
<a id='line_1025'>  Her stores were op'n'd, and this Firmament</a>
<a id='line_1026'>  Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire,</a>
<a id='line_1027'>  Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall</a>
<a id='line_1028'>  One day upon our heads; while we perhaps</a>
<a id='line_1029'>  Designing or exhorting glorious Warr,</a>
<a id='line_1030'>  Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl'd</a>
<a id='line_1031'>  Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey</a>
<a id='line_1032'>  Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk</a>
<a id='line_1033'>  Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains;</a>
<a id='line_1034'>  There to converse with everlasting groans,</a>
<a id='line_1035'>  Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd,</a>
<a id='line_1036'>  Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse.</a>
<a id='line_1037'>  Warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike</a>
<a id='line_1038'>  My voice disswades; for what can force or guile</a>
<a id='line_1039'>  With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye</a>
<a id='line_1040'>  Views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth</a>
<a id='line_1041'>  All these our motions vain, sees and derides;</a>
<a id='line_1042'>  Not more Almighty to resist our might</a>
<a id='line_1043'>  Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.</a>
<a id='line_1044'>  Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav'n</a>
<a id='line_1045'>  Thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here</a>
<a id='line_1046'>  Chains & these Torments? better these then worse</a>
<a id='line_1047'>  By my advice; since fate inevitable</a>
<a id='line_1048'>  Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree,</a>
<a id='line_1049'>  The Victors will.  To suffer, as to doe,</a>
<a id='line_1050'>  Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust</a>
<a id='line_1051'>  That so ordains: this was at first resolv'd,</a>
<a id='line_1052'>  If we were wise, against so great a foe</a>
<a id='line_1053'>  Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.</a>
<a id='line_1054'>  I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold</a>
<a id='line_1055'>  And vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear</a>
<a id='line_1056'>  What yet they know must follow, to endure</a>
<a id='line_1057'>  Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,</a>
<a id='line_1058'>  The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now</a>
<a id='line_1059'>  Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,</a>
<a id='line_1060'>  Our Supream Foe in time may much remit</a>
<a id='line_1061'>  His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd</a>
<a id='line_1062'>  Not mind us not offending, satisfi'd</a>
<a id='line_1063'>  With what is punish't; whence these raging fires</a>
<a id='line_1064'>  Will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames.</a>
<a id='line_1065'>  Our purer essence then will overcome</a>
<a id='line_1066'>  Thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel,</a>
<a id='line_1067'>  Or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd</a>
<a id='line_1068'>  In temper and in nature, will receive</a>
<a id='line_1069'>  Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain;</a>
<a id='line_1070'>  This horror will grow milde, this darkness light,</a>
<a id='line_1071'>  Besides what hope the never-ending flight</a>
<a id='line_1072'>  Of future days may bring, what chance, what change</a>
<a id='line_1073'>  Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers</a>
<a id='line_1074'>  For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,</a>
<a id='line_1075'>  If we procure not to our selves more woe.</a>
<a id='line_1076'></a>
<a id='line_1077'>    Thus BELIAL with words cloath'd in reasons garb</a>
<a id='line_1078'>  Counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath,</a>
<a id='line_1079'>  Not peace: and after him thus MAMMON spake.</a>
<a id='line_1080'></a>
<a id='line_1081'>    Either to disinthrone the King of Heav'n</a>
<a id='line_1082'>  We warr, if warr be best, or to regain</a>
<a id='line_1083'>  Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then</a>
<a id='line_1084'>  May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild</a>
<a id='line_1085'>  To fickle Chance, and CHAOS judge the strife:</a>
<a id='line_1086'>  The former vain to hope argues as vain</a>
<a id='line_1087'>  The latter: for what place can be for us</a>
<a id='line_1088'>  Within Heav'ns bound, unless Heav'ns Lord supream</a>
<a id='line_1089'>  We overpower?  Suppose he should relent</a>
<a id='line_1090'>  And publish Grace to all, on promise made</a>
<a id='line_1091'>  Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we</a>
<a id='line_1092'>  Stand in his presence humble, and receive</a>
<a id='line_1093'>  Strict Laws impos'd, to celebrate his Throne</a>
<a id='line_1094'>  With warbl'd Hymns, and to his Godhead sing</a>
<a id='line_1095'>  Forc't Halleluiah's; while he Lordly sits</a>

<a id='line_1107'>  Free, and to none accountable, preferring</a>
<a id='line_1108'>  Hard liberty before the easie yoke</a>
<a id='line_1109'>  Of servile Pomp.  Our greatness will appear</a>
<a id='line_1110'>  Then most conspicuous, when great things of small,</a>

<a id='line_1115'>  Of darkness do we dread?  How oft amidst</a>
<a id='line_1116'>  Thick clouds and dark doth Heav'ns all-ruling Sire</a>
<a id='line_1117'>  Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur'd,</a>
<a id='line_1118'>  And with the Majesty of darkness round</a>

<a id='line_1120'>  Must'ring thir rage, and Heav'n resembles Hell?</a>
<a id='line_1121'>  As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light</a>
<a id='line_1122'>  Imitate when we please?  This Desart soile</a>
<a id='line_1123'>  Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;</a>
<a id='line_1124'>  Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise</a>
<a id='line_1125'>  Magnificence; and what can Heav'n shew more?</a>
<a id='line_1126'>  Our torments also may in length of time</a>

<a id='line_1144'>  As MAMMON ended, and his Sentence pleas'd,</a>
<a id='line_1145'>  Advising peace: for such another Field</a>
<a id='line_1146'>  They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear</a>
<a id='line_1147'>  Of Thunder and the Sword of MICHAEL</a>
<a id='line_1148'>  Wrought still within them; and no less desire</a>
<a id='line_1149'>  To found this nether Empire, which might rise</a>
<a id='line_1150'>  By pollicy, and long process of time,</a>
<a id='line_1151'>  In emulation opposite to Heav'n.</a>
<a id='line_1152'>  Which when BEELZEBUB perceiv'd, then whom,</a>

<a id='line_1155'>  A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven</a>

<a id='line_1159'>  With ATLANTEAN shoulders fit to bear</a>
<a id='line_1160'>  The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look</a>
<a id='line_1161'>  Drew audience and attention still as Night</a>
<a id='line_1162'>  Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.</a>
<a id='line_1163'></a>
<a id='line_1164'>    Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav'n,</a>

<a id='line_1200'>  (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav'n</a>

<a id='line_1202'>  Of som new Race call'd MAN, about this time</a>
<a id='line_1203'>  To be created like to us, though less</a>
<a id='line_1204'>  In power and excellence, but favour'd more</a>
<a id='line_1205'>  Of him who rules above; so was his will</a>
<a id='line_1206'>  Pronounc'd among the Gods, and by an Oath,</a>
<a id='line_1207'>  That shook Heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd.</a>

<a id='line_1589'></a>
<a id='line_1590'>    O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd,</a>

<a id='line_1640'>  I also; at which time this powerful Key</a>

<a id='line_1642'>  These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass</a>
<a id='line_1643'>  Without my op'ning.  Pensive here I sat</a>

<a id='line_2016'>  Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake.</a>
<a id='line_2017'></a>
<a id='line_2018'>    Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage</a>
<a id='line_2019'>  Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds</a>
<a id='line_2020'>  Prescrib'd, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains</a>
<a id='line_2021'>  Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss</a>
<a id='line_2022'>  Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems</a>
<a id='line_2023'>  On desperat revenge, that shall redound</a>
<a id='line_2024'>  Upon his own rebellious head.  And now</a>
<a id='line_2025'>  Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way</a>
<a id='line_2026'>  Not farr off Heav'n, in the Precincts of light,</a>
<a id='line_2027'>  Directly towards the new created World,</a>
<a id='line_2028'>  And Man there plac't, with purpose to assay</a>

<a id='line_2030'>  By som false guile pervert; and shall pervert;</a>

<a id='line_2033'>  Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall</a>
<a id='line_2034'>  Hee and his faithless Progenie: whose fault?</a>
<a id='line_2035'>  Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee</a>
<a id='line_2036'>  All he could have; I made him just and right,</a>
<a id='line_2037'>  Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.</a>
<a id='line_2038'>  Such I created all th' Ethereal Powers</a>
<a id='line_2039'>  And Spirits, both them who stood & them who faild;</a>
<a id='line_2040'>  Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.</a>
<a id='line_2041'>  Not free, what proof could they have givn sincere</a>
<a id='line_2042'>  Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love,</a>
<a id='line_2043'>  Where onely what they needs must do, appeard,</a>
<a id='line_2044'>  Not what they would? what praise could they receive?</a>
<a id='line_2045'>  What pleasure I from such obedience paid,</a>
<a id='line_2046'>  When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice)</a>
<a id='line_2047'>  Useless and vain, of freedom both despoild,</a>
<a id='line_2048'>  Made passive both, had servd necessitie,</a>
<a id='line_2049'>  Not mee.  They therefore as to right belongd,</a>
<a id='line_2050'>  So were created, nor can justly accuse</a>
<a id='line_2051'>  Thir maker, or thir making, or thir Fate;</a>
<a id='line_2052'>  As if Predestination over-rul'd</a>
<a id='line_2053'>  Thir will, dispos'd by absolute Decree</a>
<a id='line_2054'>  Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed</a>
<a id='line_2055'>  Thir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew,</a>
<a id='line_2056'>  Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault,</a>
<a id='line_2057'>  Which had no less prov'd certain unforeknown.</a>
<a id='line_2058'>  So without least impulse or shadow of Fate,</a>
<a id='line_2059'>  Or aught by me immutablie foreseen,</a>
<a id='line_2060'>  They trespass, Authors to themselves in all</a>
<a id='line_2061'>  Both what they judge and what they choose; for so</a>
<a id='line_2062'>  I formd them free, and free they must remain,</a>
<a id='line_2063'>  Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change</a>
<a id='line_2064'>  Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree</a>
<a id='line_2065'>  Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordain'd</a>
<a id='line_2066'>  Thir freedom, they themselves ordain'd thir fall.</a>
<a id='line_2067'>  The first sort by thir own suggestion fell,</a>
<a id='line_2068'>  Self-tempted, self-deprav'd: Man falls deceiv'd</a>
<a id='line_2069'>  By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace,</a>
<a id='line_2070'>  The other none: in Mercy and Justice both,</a>
<a id='line_2071'>  Through Heav'n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel,</a>
<a id='line_2072'>  But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine.</a>
<a id='line_2073'></a>
<a id='line_2074'>    Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd</a>
<a id='line_2075'>  All Heav'n, and in the blessed Spirits elect</a>
<a id='line_2076'>  Sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd:</a>
<a id='line_2077'>  Beyond compare the Son of God was seen</a>

<a id='line_2079'>  Substantially express'd, and in his face</a>
<a id='line_2080'>  Divine compassion visibly appeerd,</a>
<a id='line_2081'>  Love without end, and without measure Grace,</a>
<a id='line_2082'>  Which uttering thus he to his Father spake.</a>
<a id='line_2083'></a>
<a id='line_2084'>    O Father, gracious was that word which clos'd</a>
<a id='line_2085'>  Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace;</a>
<a id='line_2086'>  For which both Heav'n and Earth shall high extoll</a>

<a id='line_2088'>  Of Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy Throne</a>
<a id='line_2089'>  Encompass'd shall resound thee ever blest.</a>
<a id='line_2090'>  For should Man finally be lost, should Man</a>
<a id='line_2091'>  Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest Son</a>
<a id='line_2092'>  Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd</a>
<a id='line_2093'>  With his own folly? that be from thee farr,</a>
<a id='line_2094'>  That farr be from thee, Father, who art Judge</a>
<a id='line_2095'>  Of all things made, and judgest onely right.</a>
<a id='line_2096'>  Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain</a>
<a id='line_2097'>  His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill</a>
<a id='line_2098'>  His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught,</a>
<a id='line_2099'>  Or proud return though to his heavier doom,</a>
<a id='line_2100'>  Yet with revenge accomplish't and to Hell</a>
<a id='line_2101'>  Draw after him the whole Race of mankind,</a>
<a id='line_2102'>  By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self</a>

<a id='line_2104'>  For him, what for thy glorie thou hast made?</a>
<a id='line_2105'>  So should thy goodness and thy greatness both</a>
<a id='line_2106'>  Be questiond and blaspheam'd without defence.</a>
<a id='line_2107'></a>
<a id='line_2108'>    To whom the great Creatour thus reply'd.</a>
<a id='line_2109'>  O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight,</a>
<a id='line_2110'>  Son of my bosom, Son who art alone</a>
<a id='line_2111'>  My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,</a>

<a id='line_2116'>  Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew</a>

<a id='line_2118'>  By sin to foul exorbitant desires;</a>
<a id='line_2119'>  Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand</a>
<a id='line_2120'>  On even ground against his mortal foe,</a>
<a id='line_2121'>  By me upheld, that he may know how frail</a>
<a id='line_2122'>  His fall'n condition is, and to me ow</a>

<a id='line_2124'>  Some I have chosen of peculiar grace</a>
<a id='line_2125'>  Elect above the rest; so is my will:</a>
<a id='line_2126'>  The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd</a>
<a id='line_2127'>  Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes</a>
<a id='line_2128'>  Th' incensed Deitie, while offerd grace</a>
<a id='line_2129'>  Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark,</a>
<a id='line_2130'>  What may suffice, and soft'n stonie hearts</a>
<a id='line_2131'>  To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.</a>
<a id='line_2132'>  To prayer, repentance, and obedience due,</a>
<a id='line_2133'>  Though but endevord with sincere intent,</a>
<a id='line_2134'>  Mine eare shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.</a>
<a id='line_2135'>  And I will place within them as a guide</a>
<a id='line_2136'>  My Umpire CONSCIENCE, whom if they will hear,</a>
<a id='line_2137'>  Light after light well us'd they shall attain,</a>

<a id='line_2139'>  This my long sufferance and my day of grace</a>
<a id='line_2140'>  They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste;</a>
<a id='line_2141'>  But hard be hard'nd, blind be blinded more,</a>

<a id='line_2647'>  That reaches blame, but rather merits praise</a>
<a id='line_2648'>  The more it seems excess, that led thee hither</a>

<a id='line_3157'>  That day I oft remember, when from sleep</a>

<a id='line_3161'>  Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound</a>
<a id='line_3162'>  Of waters issu'd from a Cave and spread</a>
<a id='line_3163'>  Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov'd</a>
<a id='line_3164'>  Pure as th' expanse of Heav'n; I thither went</a>
<a id='line_3165'>  With unexperienc't thought, and laid me downe</a>
<a id='line_3166'>  On the green bank, to look into the cleer</a>
<a id='line_3167'>  Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie.</a>
<a id='line_3168'>  As I bent down to look, just opposite,</a>
<a id='line_3169'>  A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd</a>
<a id='line_3170'>  Bending to look on me, I started back,</a>
<a id='line_3171'>  It started back, but pleasd I soon returnd,</a>
<a id='line_3172'>  Pleas'd it returnd as soon with answering looks</a>

<a id='line_3183'>  Mother of human Race: what could I doe,</a>

<a id='line_3185'>  Till I espi'd thee, fair indeed and tall,</a>
<a id='line_3186'>  Under a Platan, yet methought less faire,</a>
<a id='line_3187'>  Less winning soft, less amiablie milde,</a>
<a id='line_3188'>  Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd,</a>
<a id='line_3189'>  Thou following cryd'st aloud, Return fair EVE,</a>
<a id='line_3190'>  Whom fli'st thou? whom thou fli'st, of him thou art,</a>
<a id='line_3191'>  His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent</a>
<a id='line_3192'>  Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart</a>
<a id='line_3193'>  Substantial Life, to have thee by my side</a>
<a id='line_3194'>  Henceforth an individual solace dear;</a>

<a id='line_3198'>  How beauty is excelld by manly grace</a>
<a id='line_3199'>  And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.</a>
<a id='line_3200'></a>
<a id='line_3201'>    So spake our general Mother, and with eyes</a>

<a id='line_3204'>  On our first Father, half her swelling Breast</a>

<a id='line_3207'>  Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms</a>
<a id='line_3208'>  Smil'd with superior Love, as JUPITER</a>
<a id='line_3209'>  On JUNO smiles, when he impregns the Clouds</a>

<a id='line_3220'>  Among our other torments not the least,</a>
<a id='line_3221'>  Still unfulfill'd with pain of longing pines;</a>
<a id='line_3222'>  Yet let me not forget what I have gain'd</a>
<a id='line_3223'>  From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems:</a>
<a id='line_3224'>  One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call'd,</a>
<a id='line_3225'>  Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd'n?</a>
<a id='line_3226'>  Suspicious, reasonless.  Why should thir Lord</a>
<a id='line_3227'>  Envie them that? can it be sin to know,</a>
<a id='line_3228'>  Can it be death? and do they onely stand</a>
<a id='line_3229'>  By Ignorance, is that thir happie state,</a>
<a id='line_3230'>  The proof of thir obedience and thir faith?</a>
<a id='line_3231'>  O fair foundation laid whereon to build</a>
<a id='line_3232'>  Thir ruine!  Hence I will excite thir minds</a>
<a id='line_3233'>  With more desire to know, and to reject</a>
<a id='line_3234'>  Envious commands, invented with designe</a>
<a id='line_3235'>  To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt</a>
<a id='line_3236'>  Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such,</a>
<a id='line_3237'>  They taste and die: what likelier can ensue?</a>
<a id='line_3238'>  But first with narrow search I must walk round</a>
<a id='line_3239'>  This Garden, and no corner leave unspi'd;</a>
<a id='line_3240'>  A chance but chance may lead where I may meet</a>
<a id='line_3241'>  Some wandring Spirit of Heav'n, by Fountain side,</a>
<a id='line_3242'>  Or in thick shade retir'd, from him to draw</a>
<a id='line_3243'>  What further would be learnt.  Live while ye may,</a>
<a id='line_3244'>  Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return,</a>
<a id='line_3245'>  Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed.</a>
<a id='line_3246'></a>
<a id='line_3247'>    So saying, his proud step he scornful turn'd,</a>
<a id='line_3248'>  But with sly circumspection, and began</a>
<a id='line_3249'>  Through wood, through waste, o're hil, o're dale his roam.</a>
<a id='line_3250'>  Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav'n</a>
<a id='line_3251'>  With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun</a>
<a id='line_3252'>  Slowly descended, and with right aspect</a>
<a id='line_3253'>  Against the eastern Gate of Paradise</a>
<a id='line_3254'>  Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock</a>
<a id='line_3255'>  Of Alablaster, pil'd up to the Clouds,</a>
<a id='line_3256'>  Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent</a>
<a id='line_3257'>  Accessible from Earth, one entrance high;</a>
<a id='line_3258'>  The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung</a>
<a id='line_3259'>  Still as it rose, impossible to climbe.</a>
<a id='line_3260'>  Betwixt these rockie Pillars GABRIEL sat</a>
<a id='line_3261'>  Chief of th' Angelic Guards, awaiting night;</a>

<a id='line_3264'>  Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares</a>
<a id='line_3265'>  Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold.</a>
<a id='line_3266'>  Thither came URIEL, gliding through the Eeven</a>

<a id='line_3508'>  From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld</a>

<a id='line_3519'>  Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.</a>
<a id='line_3520'></a>
<a id='line_3521'>    So saying, on he led his radiant Files,</a>
<a id='line_3522'>  Daz'ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct</a>
<a id='line_3523'>  In search of whom they sought: him there they found</a>
<a id='line_3524'>  Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of EVE;</a>
<a id='line_3525'>  Assaying by his Devilish art to reach</a>
<a id='line_3526'>  The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge</a>
<a id='line_3527'>  Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams,</a>

<a id='line_3529'>  Th' animal Spirits that from pure blood arise</a>
<a id='line_3530'>  Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise</a>
<a id='line_3531'>  At least distemperd, discontented thoughts,</a>
<a id='line_3532'>  Vain hopes, vain aimes, inordinate desires</a>
<a id='line_3533'>  Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride.</a>
<a id='line_3534'>  Him thus intent ITHURIEL with his Spear</a>
<a id='line_3535'>  Touch'd lightly; for no falshood can endure</a>
<a id='line_3536'>  Touch of Celestial temper, but returns</a>
<a id='line_3537'>  Of force to its own likeness: up he starts</a>
<a id='line_3538'>  Discoverd and surpriz'd.  As when a spark</a>
<a id='line_3539'>  Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid</a>
<a id='line_3540'>  Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store</a>
<a id='line_3541'>  Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine</a>

<a id='line_3544'>  Back stept those two fair Angels half amaz'd</a>
<a id='line_3545'>  So sudden to behold the grieslie King;</a>
<a id='line_3546'>  Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon.</a>
<a id='line_3547'></a>
<a id='line_3548'>    Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg'd to Hell</a>
<a id='line_3549'>  Com'st thou, escap'd thy prison, and transform'd,</a>
<a id='line_3550'>  Why satst thou like an enemie in waite</a>
<a id='line_3551'>  Here watching at the head of these that sleep?</a>
<a id='line_3552'></a>
<a id='line_3553'>    Know ye not then said SATAN, filld with scorn,</a>
<a id='line_3554'>  Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate</a>
<a id='line_3555'>  For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare;</a>
<a id='line_3556'>  Not to know mee argues your selves unknown,</a>
<a id='line_3557'>  The lowest of your throng; or if ye know,</a>
<a id='line_3558'>  Why ask ye, and superfluous begin</a>
<a id='line_3559'>  Your message, like to end as much in vain?</a>
<a id='line_3560'>  To whom thus ZEPHON, answering scorn with scorn.</a>
<a id='line_3561'>  Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,</a>
<a id='line_3562'>  Or undiminisht brightness, to be known</a>
<a id='line_3563'>  As when thou stoodst in Heav'n upright and pure;</a>
<a id='line_3564'>  That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good,</a>
<a id='line_3565'>  Departed from thee, and thou resembl'st now</a>
<a id='line_3566'>  Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule.</a>
<a id='line_3567'>  But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account</a>
<a id='line_3568'>  To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep</a>
<a id='line_3569'>  This place inviolable, and these from harm.</a>
<a id='line_3570'></a>
<a id='line_3571'>    So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke</a>
<a id='line_3572'>  Severe in youthful beautie, added grace</a>
<a id='line_3573'>  Invincible: abasht the Devil stood,</a>
<a id='line_3574'>  And felt how awful goodness is, and saw</a>
<a id='line_3575'>  Vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin'd</a>
<a id='line_3576'>  His loss; but chiefly to find here observd</a>
<a id='line_3577'>  His lustre visibly impar'd; yet seemd</a>
<a id='line_3578'>  Undaunted.  If I must contend, said he,</a>
<a id='line_3579'>  Best with the best, the Sender not the sent,</a>
<a id='line_3580'>  Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn,</a>
<a id='line_3581'>  Or less be lost.  Thy fear, said ZEPHON bold,</a>
<a id='line_3582'>  Will save us trial what the least can doe</a>
<a id='line_3583'>  Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.</a>
<a id='line_3584'></a>
<a id='line_3585'>    The Fiend repli'd not, overcome with rage;</a>
<a id='line_3586'>  But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on,</a>
<a id='line_3587'>  Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie</a>
<a id='line_3588'>  He held it vain; awe from above had quelld</a>
<a id='line_3589'>  His heart, not else dismai'd.  Now drew they nigh</a>
<a id='line_3590'>  The western point, where those half-rounding guards</a>
<a id='line_3591'>  Just met, & closing stood in squadron joind</a>
<a id='line_3592'>  Awaiting next command.  To whom thir Chief</a>
<a id='line_3593'>  GABRIEL from the Front thus calld aloud.</a>
<a id='line_3594'></a>
<a id='line_3595'>    O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet</a>
<a id='line_3596'>  Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne</a>
<a id='line_3597'>  ITHURIEL and ZEPHON through the shade,</a>
<a id='line_3598'>  And with them comes a third of Regal port,</a>
<a id='line_3599'>  But faded splendor wan; who by his gate</a>
<a id='line_3600'>  And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,</a>
<a id='line_3601'>  Not likely to part hence without contest;</a>
<a id='line_3602'>  Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.</a>
<a id='line_3603'></a>
<a id='line_3604'>    He scarce had ended, when those two approachd</a>
<a id='line_3605'>  And brief related whom they brought, wher found,</a>
<a id='line_3606'>  How busied, in what form and posture coucht.</a>
<a id='line_3607'></a>
<a id='line_3608'>    To whom with stern regard thus GABRIEL spake.</a>
<a id='line_3609'>  Why hast thou, SATAN, broke the bounds prescrib'd</a>
<a id='line_3610'>  To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge</a>
<a id='line_3611'>  Of others, who approve not to transgress</a>
<a id='line_3612'>  By thy example, but have power and right</a>
<a id='line_3613'>  To question thy bold entrance on this place;</a>
<a id='line_3614'>  Imploi'd it seems to violate sleep, and those</a>
<a id='line_3615'>  Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss?</a>
<a id='line_3616'></a>
<a id='line_3617'>    To whom thus SATAN with contemptuous brow.</a>
<a id='line_3618'>  GABRIEL, thou hadst in Heav'n th' esteem of wise,</a>
<a id='line_3619'>  And such I held thee; but this question askt</a>
<a id='line_3620'>  Puts me in doubt.  Lives ther who loves his pain?</a>
<a id='line_3621'>  Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,</a>
<a id='line_3622'>  Though thither doomd?  Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt,</a>
<a id='line_3623'>  And boldly venture to whatever place</a>
<a id='line_3624'>  Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change</a>
<a id='line_3625'>  Torment with ease, & soonest recompence</a>
<a id='line_3626'>  Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;</a>
<a id='line_3627'>  To thee no reason; who knowst only good,</a>
<a id='line_3628'>  But evil hast not tri'd: and wilt object</a>
<a id='line_3629'>  His will who bound us? let him surer barr</a>
<a id='line_3630'>  His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay</a>
<a id='line_3631'>  In that dark durance: thus much what was askt.</a>
<a id='line_3632'>  The rest is true, they found me where they say;</a>
<a id='line_3633'>  But that implies not violence or harme.</a>
<a id='line_3634'></a>
<a id='line_3635'>    Thus hee in scorn.  The warlike Angel mov'd,</a>
<a id='line_3636'>  Disdainfully half smiling thus repli'd.</a>
<a id='line_3637'>  O loss of one in Heav'n to judge of wise,</a>
<a id='line_3638'>  Since SATAN fell, whom follie overthrew,</a>
<a id='line_3639'>  And now returns him from his prison scap't,</a>
<a id='line_3640'>  Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise</a>
<a id='line_3641'>  Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither</a>
<a id='line_3642'>  Unlicenc't from his bounds in Hell prescrib'd;</a>
<a id='line_3643'>  So wise he judges it to fly from pain</a>
<a id='line_3644'>  However, and to scape his punishment.</a>
<a id='line_3645'>  So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth,</a>
<a id='line_3646'>  Which thou incurr'st by flying, meet thy flight</a>
<a id='line_3647'>  Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,</a>
<a id='line_3648'>  Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain</a>
<a id='line_3649'>  Can equal anger infinite provok't.</a>
<a id='line_3650'>  But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee</a>
<a id='line_3651'>  Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them</a>
<a id='line_3652'>  Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they</a>
<a id='line_3653'>  Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief,</a>
<a id='line_3654'>  The first in flight from pain, had'st thou alleg'd</a>
<a id='line_3655'>  To thy deserted host this cause of flight,</a>
<a id='line_3656'>  Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.</a>
<a id='line_3657'></a>
<a id='line_3658'>    To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern.</a>
<a id='line_3659'>  Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain,</a>
<a id='line_3660'>  Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood</a>
<a id='line_3661'>  Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide</a>
<a id='line_3662'>  The blasting volied Thunder made all speed</a>
<a id='line_3663'>  And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear.</a>
<a id='line_3664'>  But still thy words at random, as before,</a>
<a id='line_3665'>  Argue thy inexperience what behooves</a>
<a id='line_3666'>  From hard assaies and ill successes past</a>
<a id='line_3667'>  A faithful Leader, not to hazard all</a>
<a id='line_3668'>  Through wayes of danger by himself untri'd.</a>
<a id='line_3669'>  I therefore, I alone first undertook</a>
<a id='line_3670'>  To wing the desolate Abyss, and spie</a>
<a id='line_3671'>  This new created World, whereof in Hell</a>
<a id='line_3672'>  Fame is not silent, here in hope to find</a>
<a id='line_3673'>  Better abode, and my afflicted Powers</a>
<a id='line_3674'>  To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire;</a>
<a id='line_3675'>  Though for possession put to try once more</a>
<a id='line_3676'>  What thou and thy gay Legions dare against;</a>
<a id='line_3677'>  Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord</a>
<a id='line_3678'>  High up in Heav'n, with songs to hymne his Throne,</a>

<a id='line_3680'></a>
<a id='line_3681'>    To whom the warriour Angel soon repli'd.</a>
<a id='line_3682'>  To say and strait unsay, pretending first</a>

<a id='line_3799'>  Knew never till this irksom night; methought</a>
<a id='line_3800'>  Close at mine ear one call'd me forth to walk</a>
<a id='line_3801'>  With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said,</a>
<a id='line_3802'>  Why sleepst thou EVE? now is the pleasant time,</a>
<a id='line_3803'>  The cool, the silent, save where silence yields</a>
<a id='line_3804'>  To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake</a>
<a id='line_3805'>  Tunes sweetest his love-labor'd song; now reignes</a>
<a id='line_3806'>  Full Orb'd the Moon, and with more pleasing light</a>
<a id='line_3807'>  Shadowie sets off the face of things; in vain,</a>
<a id='line_3808'>  If none regard; Heav'n wakes with all his eyes,</a>

<a id='line_3810'>  In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment</a>
<a id='line_3811'>  Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.</a>
<a id='line_3812'>  I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;</a>
<a id='line_3813'>  To find thee I directed then my walk;</a>
<a id='line_3814'>  And on, methought, alone I pass'd through ways</a>
<a id='line_3815'>  That brought me on a sudden to the Tree</a>
<a id='line_3816'>  Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem'd,</a>
<a id='line_3817'>  Much fairer to my Fancie then by day:</a>
<a id='line_3818'>  And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood</a>
<a id='line_3819'>  One shap'd & wing'd like one of those from Heav'n</a>
<a id='line_3820'>  By us oft seen; his dewie locks distill'd</a>
<a id='line_3821'>  Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gaz'd;</a>
<a id='line_3822'>  And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg'd,</a>
<a id='line_3823'>  Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet,</a>
<a id='line_3824'>  Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis'd?</a>
<a id='line_3825'>  Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste?</a>
<a id='line_3826'>  Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold</a>
<a id='line_3827'>  Longer thy offerd good, why else set here?</a>
<a id='line_3828'>  This said he paus'd not, but with ventrous Arme</a>
<a id='line_3829'>  He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil'd</a>
<a id='line_3830'>  At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold:</a>
<a id='line_3831'>  But he thus overjoy'd, O Fruit Divine,</a>
<a id='line_3832'>  Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt,</a>
<a id='line_3833'>  Forbidd'n here, it seems, as onely fit</a>
<a id='line_3834'>  For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:</a>
<a id='line_3835'>  And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more</a>
<a id='line_3836'>  Communicated, more abundant growes,</a>
<a id='line_3837'>  The Author not impair'd, but honourd more?</a>
<a id='line_3838'>  Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic EVE,</a>
<a id='line_3839'>  Partake thou also; happie though thou art,</a>
<a id='line_3840'>  Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be:</a>
<a id='line_3841'>  Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods</a>
<a id='line_3842'>  Thy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind,</a>
<a id='line_3843'>  But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes</a>
<a id='line_3844'>  Ascend to Heav'n, by merit thine, and see</a>
<a id='line_3845'>  What life the Gods live there, and such live thou.</a>
<a id='line_3846'>  So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,</a>
<a id='line_3847'>  Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part</a>
<a id='line_3848'>  Which he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell</a>
<a id='line_3849'>  So quick'nd appetite, that I, methought,</a>
<a id='line_3850'>  Could not but taste.  Forthwith up to the Clouds</a>
<a id='line_3851'>  With him I flew, and underneath beheld</a>
<a id='line_3852'>  The Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide</a>
<a id='line_3853'>  And various: wondring at my flight and change</a>
<a id='line_3854'>  To this high exaltation; suddenly</a>
<a id='line_3855'>  My Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down,</a>
<a id='line_3856'>  And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak'd</a>
<a id='line_3857'>  To find this but a dream!  Thus EVE her Night</a>
<a id='line_3858'>  Related, and thus ADAM answerd sad.</a>

<a id='line_3861'>  The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep</a>
<a id='line_3862'>  Affects me equally; nor can I like</a>
<a id='line_3863'>  This uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear;</a>
<a id='line_3864'>  Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,</a>
<a id='line_3865'>  Created pure.  But know that in the Soule</a>
<a id='line_3866'>  Are many lesser Faculties that serve</a>
<a id='line_3867'>  Reason as chief; among these Fansie next</a>
<a id='line_3868'>  Her office holds; of all external things,</a>
<a id='line_3869'>  Which the five watchful Senses represent,</a>
<a id='line_3870'>  She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes,</a>
<a id='line_3871'>  Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames</a>
<a id='line_3872'>  All what we affirm or what deny, and call</a>
<a id='line_3873'>  Our knowledge or opinion; then retires</a>
<a id='line_3874'>  Into her private Cell when Nature rests.</a>
<a id='line_3875'>  Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes</a>
<a id='line_3876'>  To imitate her; but misjoyning shapes,</a>
<a id='line_3877'>  Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams,</a>
<a id='line_3878'>  Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.</a>
<a id='line_3879'>  Som such resemblances methinks I find</a>
<a id='line_3880'>  Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream,</a>
<a id='line_3881'>  But with addition strange; yet be not sad.</a>
<a id='line_3882'>  Evil into the mind of God or Man</a>
<a id='line_3883'>  May come and go, so unapprov'd, and leave</a>
<a id='line_3884'>  No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope</a>
<a id='line_3885'>  That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream,</a>
<a id='line_3886'>  Waking thou never wilt consent to do.</a>
<a id='line_3887'>  Be not disheart'nd then, nor cloud those looks</a>
<a id='line_3888'>  That wont to be more chearful and serene</a>
<a id='line_3889'>  Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World,</a>
<a id='line_3890'>  And let us to our fresh imployments rise</a>
<a id='line_3891'>  Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours</a>
<a id='line_3892'>  That open now thir choicest bosom'd smells</a>
<a id='line_3893'>  Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store.</a>
<a id='line_3894'></a>
<a id='line_3895'>    So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard,</a>
<a id='line_3896'>  But silently a gentle tear let fall</a>
<a id='line_3897'>  From either eye, and wip'd them with her haire;</a>
<a id='line_3898'>  Two other precious drops that ready stood,</a>
<a id='line_3899'>  Each in thir chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell</a>
<a id='line_3900'>  Kiss'd as the gracious signs of sweet remorse</a>
<a id='line_3901'>  And pious awe, that feard to have offended.</a>
<a id='line_3902'></a>

<a id='line_3904'>  But first from under shadie arborous roof,</a>

<a id='line_5320'>  Emboweld with outragious noise the Air,</a>

<a id='line_5323'>  Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host</a>
<a id='line_5324'>  Level'd, with such impetuous furie smote,</a>
<a id='line_5325'>  That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand,</a>
<a id='line_5326'>  Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell</a>
<a id='line_5327'>  By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl'd;</a>
<a id='line_5328'>  The sooner for thir Arms, unarm'd they might</a>

<a id='line_5331'>  Foule dissipation follow'd and forc't rout;</a>
<a id='line_5332'>  Nor serv'd it to relax thir serried files.</a>
<a id='line_5333'>  What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse</a>
<a id='line_5334'>  Repeated, and indecent overthrow</a>
<a id='line_5335'>  Doubl'd, would render them yet more despis'd,</a>
<a id='line_5336'>  And to thir foes a laughter; for in view</a>
<a id='line_5337'>  Stood rankt of Seraphim another row</a>

<a id='line_5343'>    O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud?</a>
<a id='line_5344'>  Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee,</a>
<a id='line_5345'>  To entertain them fair with open Front</a>
<a id='line_5346'>  And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms</a>
<a id='line_5347'>  Of composition, strait they chang'd thir minds,</a>
<a id='line_5348'>  Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,</a>
<a id='line_5349'>  As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd</a>
<a id='line_5350'>  Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps</a>
<a id='line_5351'>  For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose</a>
<a id='line_5352'>  If our proposals once again were heard</a>
<a id='line_5353'>  We should compel them to a quick result.</a>
<a id='line_5354'></a>
<a id='line_5355'>    To whom thus BELIAL in like gamesom mood.</a>
<a id='line_5356'>  Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight,</a>
<a id='line_5357'>  Of hard contents, and full of force urg'd home,</a>
<a id='line_5358'>  Such as we might perceive amus'd them all,</a>
<a id='line_5359'>  And stumbl'd many, who receives them right,</a>
<a id='line_5360'>  Had need from head to foot well understand;</a>

<a id='line_5362'>  They shew us when our foes walk not upright.</a>
<a id='line_5363'></a>
<a id='line_5364'>    So they among themselves in pleasant veine</a>
<a id='line_5365'>  Stood scoffing, highthn'd in thir thoughts beyond</a>
<a id='line_5366'>  All doubt of Victorie, eternal might</a>
<a id='line_5367'>  To match with thir inventions they presum'd</a>
<a id='line_5368'>  So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn,</a>
<a id='line_5369'>  And all his Host derided, while they stood</a>
<a id='line_5370'>  A while in trouble; but they stood not long,</a>
<a id='line_5371'>  Rage prompted them at length, & found them arms</a>
<a id='line_5372'>  Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.</a>
<a id='line_5373'>  Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power</a>
<a id='line_5374'>  Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac'd)</a>
<a id='line_5375'>  Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills</a>
<a id='line_5376'>  (For Earth hath this variety from Heav'n</a>
<a id='line_5377'>  Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale)</a>
<a id='line_5378'>  Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew,</a>
<a id='line_5379'>  From thir foundations loosning to and fro</a>
<a id='line_5380'>  They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load,</a>
<a id='line_5381'>  Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops</a>
<a id='line_5382'>  Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze,</a>
<a id='line_5383'>  Be sure, and terrour seis'd the rebel Host,</a>
<a id='line_5384'>  When coming towards them so dread they saw</a>
<a id='line_5385'>  The bottom of the Mountains upward turn'd,</a>
<a id='line_5386'>  Till on those cursed Engins triple-row</a>
<a id='line_5387'>  They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence</a>
<a id='line_5388'>  Under the weight of Mountains buried deep,</a>
<a id='line_5389'>  Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads</a>
<a id='line_5390'>  Main Promontories flung, which in the Air</a>
<a id='line_5391'>  Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm'd,</a>
<a id='line_5392'>  Thir armor help'd thir harm, crush't in and brus'd</a>
<a id='line_5393'>  Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain</a>
<a id='line_5394'>  Implacable, and many a dolorous groan,</a>
<a id='line_5395'>  Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind</a>
<a id='line_5396'>  Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,</a>
<a id='line_5397'>  Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.</a>
<a id='line_5398'>  The rest in imitation to like Armes</a>

<a id='line_5563'>  Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe.</a>
<a id='line_5564'></a>

<a id='line_5571'>  Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host.</a>
<a id='line_5572'>  Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove,</a>
<a id='line_5573'>  Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles</a>

<a id='line_5577'>  Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent</a>
<a id='line_5578'>  Before him, such as in thir Soules infix'd</a>

<a id='line_5588'>  Distinct alike with multitude of eyes,</a>
<a id='line_5589'>  One Spirit in them rul'd, and every eye</a>
<a id='line_5590'>  Glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire</a>
<a id='line_5591'>  Among th' accurst, that witherd all thir strength,</a>
<a id='line_5592'>  And of thir wonted vigour left them draind,</a>
<a id='line_5593'>  Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall'n.</a>
<a id='line_5594'>  Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd</a>
<a id='line_5595'>  His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant</a>
<a id='line_5596'>  Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav'n:</a>
<a id='line_5597'>  The overthrown he rais'd, and as a Heard</a>
<a id='line_5598'>  Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd</a>
<a id='line_5599'>  Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu'd</a>

<a id='line_5604'>  Strook them with horror backward, but far worse</a>
<a id='line_5605'>  Urg'd them behind; headlong themselvs they threw</a>
<a id='line_5606'>  Down from the verge of Heav'n, Eternal wrauth</a>

<a id='line_5610'>  Heav'n ruining from Heav'n and would have fled</a>
<a id='line_5611'>  Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep</a>

<a id='line_5613'>  Nine dayes they fell; confounded CHAOS roard,</a>

<a id='line_5896'>  Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand</a>

<a id='line_5915'></a>
<a id='line_5916'>    Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light</a>

<a id='line_5950'></a>
<a id='line_5951'>    The Earth was form'd, but in the Womb as yet</a>

<a id='line_6426'>  Ordain'd for uses to his Lord best known.</a>
<a id='line_6427'>  The swiftness of those Circles attribute,</a>
<a id='line_6428'>  Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,</a>
<a id='line_6429'>  That to corporeal substances could adde</a>
<a id='line_6430'>  Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow,</a>

<a id='line_6444'>  By his attractive vertue and thir own</a>

<a id='line_6557'>  Least hee incenst at such eruption bold,</a>

<a id='line_6563'>  The dismal Gates, and barricado'd strong;</a>
<a id='line_6564'>  But long ere our approaching heard within</a>
<a id='line_6565'>  Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song,</a>
<a id='line_6566'>  Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage.</a>
<a id='line_6567'>  Glad we return'd up to the coasts of Light</a>
<a id='line_6568'>  Ere Sabbath Eev'ning: so we had in charge.</a>
<a id='line_6569'>  But thy relation now; for I attend,</a>
<a id='line_6570'>  Pleas'd with thy words no less then thou with mine.</a>
<a id='line_6571'></a>
<a id='line_6572'>    So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.</a>
<a id='line_6573'>  For Man to tell how human Life began</a>
<a id='line_6574'>  Is hard; for who himself beginning knew?</a>
<a id='line_6575'>  Desire with thee still longer to converse</a>
<a id='line_6576'>  Induc'd me.  As new wak't from soundest sleep</a>
<a id='line_6577'>  Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid</a>
<a id='line_6578'>  In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun</a>
<a id='line_6579'>  Soon dri'd, and on the reaking moisture fed.</a>
<a id='line_6580'>  Strait toward Heav'n my wondring Eyes I turnd,</a>
<a id='line_6581'>  And gaz'd a while the ample Skie, till rais'd</a>
<a id='line_6582'>  By quick instinctive motion up I sprung,</a>
<a id='line_6583'>  As thitherward endevoring, and upright</a>
<a id='line_6584'>  Stood on my feet; about me round I saw</a>
<a id='line_6585'>  Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines,</a>
<a id='line_6586'>  And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these,</a>
<a id='line_6587'>  Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk'd, or flew,</a>
<a id='line_6588'>  Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil'd,</a>
<a id='line_6589'>  With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow'd.</a>
<a id='line_6590'>  My self I then perus'd, and Limb by Limb</a>
<a id='line_6591'>  Survey'd, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran</a>
<a id='line_6592'>  With supple joints, as lively vigour led:</a>
<a id='line_6593'>  But who I was, or where, or from what cause,</a>
<a id='line_6594'>  Knew not; to speak I tri'd, and forthwith spake,</a>
<a id='line_6595'>  My Tongue obey'd and readily could name</a>
<a id='line_6596'>  What e're I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, faire Light,</a>
<a id='line_6597'>  And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and gay,</a>
<a id='line_6598'>  Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines,</a>
<a id='line_6599'>  And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,</a>
<a id='line_6600'>  Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here?</a>
<a id='line_6601'>  Not of my self; by some great Maker then,</a>
<a id='line_6602'>  In goodness and in power praeeminent;</a>
<a id='line_6603'>  Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,</a>
<a id='line_6604'>  From whom I have that thus I move and live,</a>
<a id='line_6605'>  And feel that I am happier then I know.</a>
<a id='line_6606'>  While thus I call'd, and stray'd I knew not whither,</a>
<a id='line_6607'>  From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld</a>
<a id='line_6608'>  This happie Light, when answer none return'd,</a>
<a id='line_6609'>  On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours</a>
<a id='line_6610'>  Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep</a>
<a id='line_6611'>  First found me, and with soft oppression seis'd</a>
<a id='line_6612'>  My droused sense, untroubl'd, though I thought</a>
<a id='line_6613'>  I then was passing to my former state</a>
<a id='line_6614'>  Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:</a>
<a id='line_6615'>  When suddenly stood at my Head a dream,</a>
<a id='line_6616'>  Whose inward apparition gently mov'd</a>
<a id='line_6617'>  My Fancy to believe I yet had being,</a>
<a id='line_6618'>  And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine,</a>
<a id='line_6619'>  And said, thy Mansion wants thee, ADAM, rise,</a>
<a id='line_6620'>  First Man, of Men innumerable ordain'd</a>
<a id='line_6621'>  First Father, call'd by thee I come thy Guide</a>
<a id='line_6622'>  To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar'd.</a>
<a id='line_6623'>  So saying, by the hand he took me rais'd,</a>
<a id='line_6624'>  And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire</a>
<a id='line_6625'>  Smooth sliding without step, last led me up</a>
<a id='line_6626'>  A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine,</a>
<a id='line_6627'>  A Circuit wide, enclos'd, with goodliest Trees</a>
<a id='line_6628'>  Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw</a>
<a id='line_6629'>  Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd.  Each Tree</a>
<a id='line_6630'>  Load'n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye</a>
<a id='line_6631'>  Tempting, stirr'd in me sudden appetite</a>
<a id='line_6632'>  To pluck and eate; whereat I wak'd, and found</a>
<a id='line_6633'>  Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream</a>
<a id='line_6634'>  Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun</a>
<a id='line_6635'>  My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide</a>
<a id='line_6636'>  Up hither, from among the Trees appeer'd,</a>
<a id='line_6637'>  Presence Divine.  Rejoycing, but with aw</a>
<a id='line_6638'>  In adoration at his feet I fell</a>
<a id='line_6639'>  Submiss: he rear'd me, & Whom thou soughtst I am,</a>
<a id='line_6640'>  Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest</a>
<a id='line_6641'>  Above, or round about thee or beneath.</a>
<a id='line_6642'>  This Paradise I give thee, count it thine</a>
<a id='line_6643'>  To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate:</a>
<a id='line_6644'>  Of every Tree that in the Garden growes</a>
<a id='line_6645'>  Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:</a>
<a id='line_6646'>  But of the Tree whose operation brings</a>
<a id='line_6647'>  Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set</a>
<a id='line_6648'>  The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith,</a>
<a id='line_6649'>  Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life,</a>
<a id='line_6650'>  Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste,</a>
<a id='line_6651'>  And shun the bitter consequence: for know,</a>
<a id='line_6652'>  The day thou eat'st thereof, my sole command</a>
<a id='line_6653'>  Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye;</a>
<a id='line_6654'>  From that day mortal, and this happie State</a>
<a id='line_6655'>  Shalt loose, expell'd from hence into a World</a>
<a id='line_6656'>  Of woe and sorrow.  Sternly he pronounc'd</a>
<a id='line_6657'>  The rigid interdiction, which resounds</a>
<a id='line_6658'>  Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice</a>
<a id='line_6659'>  Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect</a>
<a id='line_6660'>  Return'd and gratious purpose thus renew'd.</a>
<a id='line_6661'>  Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth</a>
<a id='line_6662'>  To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords</a>
<a id='line_6663'>  Possess it, and all things that therein live,</a>

<a id='line_6677'>  My sudden apprehension: but in these</a>

<a id='line_6690'>  Or all enjoying, what contentment find?</a>
<a id='line_6691'>  Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright,</a>

<a id='line_6693'></a>
<a id='line_6694'>    What call'st thou solitude, is not the Earth</a>

<a id='line_7455'>  Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more.</a>
<a id='line_7456'>  As one who long in populous City pent,</a>

<a id='line_7458'>  Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe</a>
<a id='line_7459'>  Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes</a>
<a id='line_7460'>  Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight,</a>
<a id='line_7461'>  The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine,</a>

<a id='line_7467'>  This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of EVE</a>
<a id='line_7468'>  Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme</a>
<a id='line_7469'>  Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine,</a>
<a id='line_7470'>  Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire</a>
<a id='line_7471'>  Of gesture or lest action overawd</a>
<a id='line_7472'>  His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd</a>
<a id='line_7473'>  His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:</a>
<a id='line_7474'>  That space the Evil one abstracted stood</a>

<a id='line_7476'>  Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd,</a>
<a id='line_7477'>  Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge;</a>
<a id='line_7478'>  But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes,</a>
<a id='line_7479'>  Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight,</a>
<a id='line_7480'>  And tortures him now more, the more he sees</a>
<a id='line_7481'>  Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon</a>
<a id='line_7482'>  Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts</a>
<a id='line_7483'>  Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.</a>
<a id='line_7484'></a>

<a id='line_7488'>  Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste</a>
<a id='line_7489'>  Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy,</a>
<a id='line_7490'>  Save what is in destroying, other joy</a>
<a id='line_7491'>  To me is lost.  Then let me not let pass</a>
<a id='line_7492'>  Occasion which now smiles, behold alone</a>

<a id='line_7494'>  Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh,</a>
<a id='line_7495'>  Whose higher intellectual more I shun,</a>
<a id='line_7496'>  And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb</a>
<a id='line_7497'>  Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould,</a>
<a id='line_7498'>  Foe not informidable, exempt from wound,</a>
<a id='line_7499'>  I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine</a>

<a id='line_7505'>  The way which to her ruin now I tend.</a>
<a id='line_7506'></a>
<a id='line_7507'>    So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd</a>
<a id='line_7508'>  In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward EVE</a>
<a id='line_7509'>  Address'd his way, not with indented wave,</a>
<a id='line_7510'>  Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare,</a>
<a id='line_7511'>  Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd</a>
<a id='line_7512'>  Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head</a>
<a id='line_7513'>  Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes;</a>
<a id='line_7514'>  With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect</a>
<a id='line_7515'>  Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass</a>
<a id='line_7516'>  Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape,</a>
<a id='line_7517'>  And lovely, never since of Serpent kind</a>
<a id='line_7518'>  Lovelier, not those that in ILLYRIA chang'd</a>
<a id='line_7519'>  HERMIONE and CADMUS, or the God</a>
<a id='line_7520'>  In EPIDAURUS; nor to which transformd</a>

<a id='line_7524'>  At first, as one who sought access, but feard</a>
<a id='line_7525'>  To interrupt, side-long he works his way.</a>
<a id='line_7526'>  As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought</a>
<a id='line_7527'>  Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind</a>
<a id='line_7528'>  Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile;</a>
<a id='line_7529'>  So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine</a>
<a id='line_7530'>  Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of EVE,</a>
<a id='line_7531'>  To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound</a>
<a id='line_7532'>  Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd</a>
<a id='line_7533'>  To such disport before her through the Field,</a>
<a id='line_7534'>  From every Beast, more duteous at her call,</a>

<a id='line_7537'>  But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd</a>
<a id='line_7538'>  His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck,</a>
<a id='line_7539'>  Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod.</a>
<a id='line_7540'>  His gentle dumb expression turnd at length</a>
<a id='line_7541'>  The Eye of EVE to mark his play; he glad</a>
<a id='line_7542'>  Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue</a>
<a id='line_7543'>  Organic, or impulse of vocal Air,</a>
<a id='line_7544'>  His fraudulent temptation thus began.</a>
<a id='line_7545'></a>
<a id='line_7546'>    Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps</a>

<a id='line_7566'>  Though at the voice much marveling; at length</a>
<a id='line_7567'>  Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake.</a>
<a id='line_7568'>  What may this mean?  Language of Man pronounc't</a>
<a id='line_7569'>  By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest?</a>
<a id='line_7570'>  The first at lest of these I thought deni'd</a>
<a id='line_7571'>  To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day</a>

<a id='line_7575'>  Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field</a>
<a id='line_7576'>  I knew, but not with human voice endu'd;</a>
<a id='line_7577'>  Redouble then this miracle, and say,</a>
<a id='line_7578'>  How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how</a>
<a id='line_7579'>  To me so friendly grown above the rest</a>
<a id='line_7580'>  Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?</a>
<a id='line_7581'>  Say, for such wonder claims attention due.</a>
<a id='line_7582'></a>
<a id='line_7583'>    To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd.</a>
<a id='line_7584'>  Empress of this fair World, resplendent EVE,</a>
<a id='line_7585'>  Easie to mee it is to tell thee all</a>
<a id='line_7586'>  What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd:</a>
<a id='line_7587'>  I was at first as other Beasts that graze</a>

<a id='line_7589'>  As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd</a>
<a id='line_7590'>  Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high:</a>
<a id='line_7591'>  Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd</a>
<a id='line_7592'>  A goodly Tree farr distant to behold</a>
<a id='line_7593'>  Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt,</a>
<a id='line_7594'>  Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze;</a>
<a id='line_7595'>  When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n,</a>
<a id='line_7596'>  Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense</a>
<a id='line_7597'>  Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats</a>
<a id='line_7598'>  Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn,</a>
<a id='line_7599'>  Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play.</a>
<a id='line_7600'>  To satisfie the sharp desire I had</a>
<a id='line_7601'>  Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd</a>
<a id='line_7602'>  Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once,</a>
<a id='line_7603'>  Powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent</a>
<a id='line_7604'>  Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene.</a>
<a id='line_7605'>  About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon,</a>
<a id='line_7606'>  For high from ground the branches would require</a>
<a id='line_7607'>  Thy utmost reach or ADAMS: Round the Tree</a>
<a id='line_7608'>  All other Beasts that saw, with like desire</a>
<a id='line_7609'>  Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.</a>
<a id='line_7610'>  Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung</a>
<a id='line_7611'>  Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill</a>
<a id='line_7612'>  I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour</a>
<a id='line_7613'>  At Feed or Fountain never had I found.</a>
<a id='line_7614'>  Sated at length, ere long I might perceave</a>
<a id='line_7615'>  Strange alteration in me, to degree</a>
<a id='line_7616'>  Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech</a>
<a id='line_7617'>  Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind.</a>
<a id='line_7618'>  Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep</a>

<a id='line_7765'>  Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak'd</a>
<a id='line_7766'>  An eager appetite, rais'd by the smell</a>
<a id='line_7767'>  So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire,</a>
<a id='line_7768'>  Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,</a>
<a id='line_7769'>  Sollicited her longing eye; yet first</a>
<a id='line_7770'>  Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd.</a>
<a id='line_7771'></a>
<a id='line_7772'>    Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits,</a>

<a id='line_7780'>  Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding</a>
<a id='line_7781'>  Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good</a>
<a id='line_7782'>  By thee communicated, and our want:</a>
<a id='line_7783'>  For good unknown, sure is not had, or had</a>
<a id='line_7784'>  And yet unknown, is as not had at all.</a>
<a id='line_7785'>  In plain then, what forbids he but to know,</a>
<a id='line_7786'>  Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?</a>
<a id='line_7787'>  Such prohibitions binde not.  But if Death</a>
<a id='line_7788'>  Bind us with after-bands, what profits then</a>
<a id='line_7789'>  Our inward freedom?  In the day we eate</a>
<a id='line_7790'>  Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die.</a>

<a id='line_7793'>  Irrational till then.  For us alone</a>
<a id='line_7794'>  Was death invented? or to us deni'd</a>
<a id='line_7795'>  This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd?</a>
<a id='line_7796'>  For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first</a>
<a id='line_7797'>  Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy</a>
<a id='line_7798'>  The good befall'n him, Author unsuspect,</a>
<a id='line_7799'>  Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile.</a>
<a id='line_7800'>  What fear I then, rather what know to feare</a>
<a id='line_7801'>  Under this ignorance of Good and Evil,</a>
<a id='line_7802'>  Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie?</a>
<a id='line_7803'>  Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine,</a>
<a id='line_7804'>  Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste,</a>

<a id='line_7806'>  To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind?</a>
<a id='line_7807'></a>
<a id='line_7808'>    So saying, her rash hand in evil hour</a>

<a id='line_7810'>  Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat</a>
<a id='line_7811'>  Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe,</a>
<a id='line_7812'>  That all was lost.  Back to the Thicket slunk</a>
<a id='line_7813'>  The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for EVE</a>

<a id='line_7819'>  Greedily she ingorg'd without restraint,</a>
<a id='line_7820'>  And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length,</a>
<a id='line_7821'>  And hight'nd as with Wine, jocond and boon,</a>
<a id='line_7822'>  Thus to her self she pleasingly began.</a>
<a id='line_7823'></a>
<a id='line_7824'>    O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees</a>

<a id='line_7840'>  And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high,</a>
<a id='line_7841'>  High and remote to see from thence distinct</a>
<a id='line_7842'>  Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps</a>
<a id='line_7843'>  May have diverted from continual watch</a>
<a id='line_7844'>  Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies</a>
<a id='line_7845'>  About him.  But to ADAM in what sort</a>
<a id='line_7846'>  Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known</a>
<a id='line_7847'>  As yet my change, and give him to partake</a>
<a id='line_7848'>  Full happiness with mee, or rather not,</a>
<a id='line_7849'>  But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power</a>
<a id='line_7850'>  Without Copartner? so to add what wants</a>
<a id='line_7851'>  In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love,</a>
<a id='line_7852'>  And render me more equal, and perhaps</a>
<a id='line_7853'>  A thing not undesireable, somtime</a>
<a id='line_7854'>  Superior; for inferior who is free?</a>
<a id='line_7855'>  This may be well: but what if God have seen,</a>
<a id='line_7856'>  And Death ensue? then I shall be no more,</a>
<a id='line_7857'>  And ADAM wedded to another EVE,</a>
<a id='line_7858'>  Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;</a>
<a id='line_7859'>  A death to think.  Confirm'd then I resolve,</a>
<a id='line_7860'>  ADAM shall share with me in bliss or woe:</a>

<a id='line_7875'>  Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill,</a>
<a id='line_7876'>  Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt;</a>

<a id='line_7896'>  Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect</a>
<a id='line_7897'>  To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;</a>
<a id='line_7898'>  And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise,</a>
<a id='line_7899'>  Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying,</a>
<a id='line_7900'>  Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become,</a>
<a id='line_7901'>  Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth</a>
<a id='line_7902'>  Endu'd with human voice and human sense,</a>

<a id='line_8373'>  Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?</a>
<a id='line_8374'></a>
<a id='line_8375'>    To whom thus ADAM sore beset repli'd.</a>
<a id='line_8376'>  O Heav'n! in evil strait this day I stand</a>
<a id='line_8377'>  Before my Judge, either to undergoe</a>
<a id='line_8378'>  My self the total Crime, or to accuse</a>

<a id='line_8380'>  Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines,</a>

<a id='line_8385'>  However insupportable, be all</a>
<a id='line_8386'>  Devolv'd; though should I hold my peace, yet thou</a>

<a id='line_8388'>  This Woman whom thou mad'st to be my help,</a>

<a id='line_8391'>  That from her hand I could suspect no ill,</a>
<a id='line_8392'>  And what she did, whatever in it self,</a>
<a id='line_8393'>  Her doing seem'd to justifie the deed;</a>
<a id='line_8394'>  Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate.</a>

<a id='line_8405'>  Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts</a>
<a id='line_8406'>  Were such as under Government well seem'd,</a>
<a id='line_8407'>  Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part</a>
<a id='line_8408'>  And person, had'st thou known thy self aright.</a>
<a id='line_8409'></a>
<a id='line_8410'>    So having said, he thus to EVE in few:</a>

<a id='line_8416'></a>
<a id='line_8417'>    The Serpent me beguil'd and I did eate.</a>
<a id='line_8418'></a>
<a id='line_8419'>    Which when the Lord God heard, without delay</a>
<a id='line_8420'>  To Judgement he proceeded on th' accus'd</a>

<a id='line_8426'>  Concern'd not Man (since he no further knew)</a>
<a id='line_8427'>  Nor alter'd his offence; yet God at last</a>

<a id='line_8430'>  And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.</a>
<a id='line_8431'></a>
<a id='line_8432'>    Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst</a>
<a id='line_8433'>  Above all Cattel, each Beast of the Field;</a>
<a id='line_8434'>  Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe,</a>
<a id='line_8435'>  And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life.</a>

<a id='line_8815'>  Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame</a>
<a id='line_8816'>  Cast on themselves from thir own mouths.  There stood</a>

<a id='line_9473'>    He ended, and the Son gave signal high</a>
<a id='line_9474'>  To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew</a>
<a id='line_9475'>  His Trumpet, heard in OREB since perhaps</a>
<a id='line_9476'>  When God descended, and perhaps once more</a>
<a id='line_9477'>  To sound at general Doom.  Th' Angelic blast</a>
<a id='line_9478'>  Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs</a>
<a id='line_9479'>  Of AMARANTIN Shade, Fountain or Spring,</a>
<a id='line_9480'>  By the waters of Life, where ere they sate</a>
<a id='line_9481'>  In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light</a>
<a id='line_9482'>  Hasted, resorting to the Summons high,</a>
<a id='line_9483'>  And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream</a>
<a id='line_9484'>  Th' Almighty thus pronounced his sovran Will.</a>
<a id='line_9485'></a>
<a id='line_9486'>    O Sons, like one of us Man is become</a>
<a id='line_9487'>  To know both Good and Evil, since his taste</a>
<a id='line_9488'>  Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast</a>
<a id='line_9489'>  His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got,</a>
<a id='line_9490'>  Happier, had it suffic'd him to have known</a>
<a id='line_9491'>  Good by it self, and Evil not at all.</a>
<a id='line_9492'>  He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite,</a>
<a id='line_9493'>  My motions in him, longer then they move,</a>
<a id='line_9494'>  His heart I know, how variable and vain</a>
<a id='line_9495'>  Self-left.  Least therefore his now bolder hand</a>
<a id='line_9496'>  Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat,</a>
<a id='line_9497'>  And live for ever, dream at least to live</a>
<a id='line_9498'>  Forever, to remove him I decree,</a>
<a id='line_9499'>  And send him from the Garden forth to Till</a>
<a id='line_9500'>  The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile.</a>
<a id='line_9501'></a>
<a id='line_9502'>    MICHAEL, this my behest have thou in charge,</a>

<a id='line_9510'>  To them and to thir Progenie from thence</a>
<a id='line_9511'>  Perpetual banishment.  Yet least they faint</a>
<a id='line_9512'>  At the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd,</a>
<a id='line_9513'>  For I behold them soft'nd and with tears</a>
<a id='line_9514'>  Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide.</a>
<a id='line_9515'>  If patiently thy bidding they obey,</a>
<a id='line_9516'>  Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale</a>
<a id='line_9517'>  To ADAM what shall come in future dayes,</a>
<a id='line_9518'>  As I shall thee enlighten, intermix</a>

<a id='line_9526'>  Least Paradise a receptacle prove</a>
<a id='line_9527'>  To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey,</a>
<a id='line_9528'>  With whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to delude.</a>
<a id='line_9529'></a>
<a id='line_9530'>    He ceas'd; and th' Archangelic Power prepar'd</a>
<a id='line_9531'>  For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright</a>
<a id='line_9532'>  Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each</a>
<a id='line_9533'>  Had, like a double JANUS, all thir shape</a>
<a id='line_9534'>  Spangl'd with eyes more numerous then those</a>
<a id='line_9535'>  Of ARGUS, and more wakeful then to drouze,</a>
<a id='line_9536'>  Charm'd with ARCADIAN Pipe, the Pastoral Reed</a>
<a id='line_9537'>  Of HERMES, or his opiate Rod.  Meanwhile</a>
<a id='line_9538'>  To resalute the World with sacred Light</a>
<a id='line_9539'>  LEUCOTHEA wak'd, and with fresh dews imbalmd</a>
<a id='line_9540'>  The Earth, when ADAM and first Matron EVE</a>

<a id='line_9543'>  Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt;</a>
<a id='line_9544'>  Which thus to EVE his welcome words renewd.</a>
<a id='line_9545'></a>
<a id='line_9546'>    EVE, easily may Faith admit, that all</a>
<a id='line_9547'>  The good which we enjoy, from Heav'n descends</a>
<a id='line_9548'>  But that from us ought should ascend to Heav'n</a>
<a id='line_9549'>  So prevalent as to concerne the mind</a>
<a id='line_9550'>  Of God high blest, or to incline his will,</a>
<a id='line_9551'>  Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer,</a>
<a id='line_9552'>  Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne</a>
<a id='line_9553'>  Ev'n to the Seat of God.  For since I saught</a>
<a id='line_9554'>  By Prayer th' offended Deitie to appease,</a>
<a id='line_9555'>  Kneel'd and before him humbl'd all my heart,</a>
<a id='line_9556'>  Methought I saw him placable and mild,</a>
<a id='line_9557'>  Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew</a>
<a id='line_9558'>  That I was heard with favour; peace returnd</a>
<a id='line_9559'>  Home to my brest, and to my memorie</a>
<a id='line_9560'>  His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe;</a>
<a id='line_9561'>  Which then not minded in dismay, yet now</a>
<a id='line_9562'>  Assures me that the bitterness of death</a>
<a id='line_9563'>  Is past, and we shall live.  Whence Haile to thee,</a>
<a id='line_9564'>  EVE rightly call'd, Mother of all Mankind,</a>
<a id='line_9565'>  Mother of all things living, since by thee</a>
<a id='line_9566'>  Man is to live, and all things live for Man.</a>
<a id='line_9567'></a>
<a id='line_9568'>    To whom thus EVE with sad demeanour meek.</a>
<a id='line_9569'>  Ill worthie I such title should belong</a>
<a id='line_9570'>  To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind</a>
<a id='line_9571'>  A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach</a>
<a id='line_9572'>  Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise:</a>
<a id='line_9573'>  But infinite in pardon was my Judge,</a>
<a id='line_9574'>  That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't</a>
<a id='line_9575'>  The sourse of life; next favourable thou,</a>
<a id='line_9576'>  Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf't,</a>
<a id='line_9577'>  Farr other name deserving.  But the Field</a>
<a id='line_9578'>  To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd,</a>
<a id='line_9579'>  Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn,</a>
<a id='line_9580'>  All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins</a>
<a id='line_9581'>  Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth,</a>
<a id='line_9582'>  I never from thy side henceforth to stray,</a>

<a id='line_9585'>  What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes?</a>
<a id='line_9586'>  Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content.</a>
<a id='line_9587'></a>
<a id='line_9588'>    So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd EVE, but Fate</a>
<a id='line_9589'>  Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest</a>
<a id='line_9590'>  On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd</a>

<a id='line_9594'>  Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods,</a>
<a id='line_9595'>  First Hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace,</a>
<a id='line_9596'>  Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde;</a>
<a id='line_9597'>  Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight.</a>
<a id='line_9598'>  ADAM observ'd, and with his Eye the chase</a>
<a id='line_9599'>  Pursuing, not unmov'd to EVE thus spake.</a>
<a id='line_9600'></a>
<a id='line_9601'>    O EVE, some furder change awaits us nigh,</a>
<a id='line_9602'>  Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews</a>
<a id='line_9603'>  Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn</a>
<a id='line_9604'>  Us haply too secure of our discharge</a>
<a id='line_9605'>  From penaltie, because from death releast</a>
<a id='line_9606'>  Some days; how long, and what till then our life,</a>
<a id='line_9607'>  Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust,</a>
<a id='line_9608'>  And thither must return and be no more.</a>
<a id='line_9609'>  VVhy else this double object in our sight</a>
<a id='line_9610'>  Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground</a>
<a id='line_9611'>  One way the self-same hour? why in the East</a>
<a id='line_9612'>  Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light</a>
<a id='line_9613'>  More orient in yon VVestern Cloud that draws</a>
<a id='line_9614'>  O're the blew Firmament a radiant white,</a>
<a id='line_9615'>  And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught.</a>
<a id='line_9616'></a>
<a id='line_9617'>    He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands</a>

<a id='line_9619'>  In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt,</a>
<a id='line_9620'>  A glorious Apparition, had not doubt</a>
<a id='line_9621'>  And carnal fear that day dimm'd ADAMS eye.</a>
<a id='line_9622'>  Not that more glorious, when the Angels met</a>
<a id='line_9623'>  JACOB in MAHANAIM, where he saw</a>
<a id='line_9624'>  The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright;</a>
<a id='line_9625'>  Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd</a>
<a id='line_9626'>  In DOTHAN, cover'd with a Camp of Fire,</a>
<a id='line_9627'>  Against the SYRIAN King, who to surprize</a>
<a id='line_9628'>  One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr,</a>
<a id='line_9629'>  Warr unproclam'd.  The Princely Hierarch</a>
<a id='line_9630'>  In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise</a>
<a id='line_9631'>  Possession of the Garden; hee alone,</a>
<a id='line_9632'>  To finde where ADAM shelterd, took his way,</a>
<a id='line_9633'>  Not unperceav'd of ADAM, who to EVE,</a>
<a id='line_9634'>  While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake.</a>
<a id='line_9635'></a>

<a id='line_9637'>  Of us will soon determin, or impose</a>
<a id='line_9638'>  New Laws to be observ'd; for I descrie</a>
<a id='line_9639'>  From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill</a>
<a id='line_9640'>  One of the heav'nly Host, and by his Gate</a>
<a id='line_9641'>  None of the meanest, some great Potentate</a>
<a id='line_9642'>  Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie</a>
<a id='line_9643'>  Invests him coming; yet not terrible,</a>
<a id='line_9644'>  That I should fear, nor sociably mild,</a>
<a id='line_9645'>  As RAPHAEL, that I should much confide,</a>
<a id='line_9646'>  But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend,</a>
<a id='line_9647'>  With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.</a>
<a id='line_9648'>  He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,</a>
<a id='line_9649'>  Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man</a>
<a id='line_9650'>  Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes</a>
<a id='line_9651'>  A militarie Vest of purple flowd</a>
<a id='line_9652'>  Livelier then MELIBOEAN, or the graine</a>
<a id='line_9653'>  Of SARRA, worn by Kings and Hero's old</a>
<a id='line_9654'>  In time of Truce; IRIS had dipt the wooff;</a>
<a id='line_9655'>  His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime</a>
<a id='line_9656'>  In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side</a>
<a id='line_9657'>  As in a glistering ZODIAC hung the Sword,</a>
<a id='line_9658'>  Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear.</a>
<a id='line_9659'>  ADAM bowd low, hee Kingly from his State</a>
<a id='line_9660'>  Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd.</a>
<a id='line_9661'></a>
<a id='line_9662'>    ADAM, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs:</a>
<a id='line_9663'>  Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death,</a>
<a id='line_9664'>  Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,</a>
<a id='line_9665'>  Defeated of his seisure many dayes</a>
<a id='line_9666'>  Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent,</a>
<a id='line_9667'>  And one bad act with many deeds well done</a>
<a id='line_9668'>  Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd</a>
<a id='line_9669'>  Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes;</a>
<a id='line_9670'>  But longer in this Paradise to dwell</a>
<a id='line_9671'>  Permits not; to remove thee I am come,</a>
<a id='line_9672'>  And send thee from the Garden forth to till</a>
<a id='line_9673'>  The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile.</a>

<a id='line_9679'>  Discover'd soon the place of her retire.</a>
<a id='line_9680'></a>
<a id='line_9681'>    O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death!</a>

<a id='line_9685'>  Quiet though sad, the respit of that day</a>
<a id='line_9686'>  That must be mortal to us both.  O flours,</a>
