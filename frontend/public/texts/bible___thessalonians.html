                    <a id='line_0'>The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the</a>
<a id='line_4'>Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ:</a>
<a id='line_5'>Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus</a>
<a id='line_6'>Christ.</a>
<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>1:2 We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in</a>
<a id='line_9'>our prayers; 1:3 Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and</a>
<a id='line_10'>labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the</a>
<a id='line_11'>sight of God and our Father; 1:4 Knowing, brethren beloved, your</a>
<a id='line_12'>election of God.</a>
<a id='line_13'></a>
<a id='line_14'>1:5 For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power,</a>
<a id='line_15'>and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner</a>
<a id='line_16'>of men we were among you for your sake.</a>
<a id='line_17'></a>
<a id='line_18'>1:6 And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received</a>
<a id='line_19'>the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_20'></a>
<a id='line_21'>1:7 So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and</a>
<a id='line_22'>Achaia.</a>
<a id='line_23'></a>
<a id='line_24'>1:8 For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in</a>
<a id='line_25'>Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward</a>
<a id='line_26'>is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.</a>
<a id='line_27'></a>
<a id='line_28'>1:9 For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had</a>
<a id='line_29'>unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and</a>
<a id='line_30'>true God; 1:10 And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised</a>
<a id='line_31'>from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.</a>
<a id='line_32'></a>
<a id='line_33'>2:1 For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it</a>
<a id='line_34'>was not in vain: 2:2 But even after that we had suffered before, and</a>
<a id='line_35'>were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in</a>
<a id='line_36'>our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>2:3 For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in</a>
<a id='line_39'>guile: 2:4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the</a>
<a id='line_40'>gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth</a>
<a id='line_41'>our hearts.</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>2:5 For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor</a>
<a id='line_44'>a cloke of covetousness; God is witness: 2:6 Nor of men sought we</a>
<a id='line_45'>glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been</a>
<a id='line_46'>burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.</a>
<a id='line_47'></a>
<a id='line_48'>2:7 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her</a>
<a id='line_49'>children: 2:8 So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing</a>
<a id='line_50'>to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our</a>
<a id='line_51'>own souls, because ye were dear unto us.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>2:9 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring</a>
<a id='line_54'>night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we</a>
<a id='line_55'>preached unto you the gospel of God.</a>
<a id='line_56'></a>
<a id='line_57'>2:10 Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and</a>
<a id='line_58'>unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe: 2:11 As ye</a>
<a id='line_59'>know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a</a>
<a id='line_60'>father doth his children, 2:12 That ye would walk worthy of God, who</a>
<a id='line_61'>hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.</a>
<a id='line_62'></a>
<a id='line_63'>2:13 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when</a>
<a id='line_64'>ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not</a>
<a id='line_65'>as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which</a>
<a id='line_66'>effectually worketh also in you that believe.</a>
<a id='line_67'></a>
<a id='line_68'>2:14 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which</a>
<a id='line_69'>in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things</a>
<a id='line_70'>of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews: 2:15 Who both</a>
<a id='line_71'>killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us;</a>
<a id='line_72'>and they please not God, and are contrary to all men: 2:16 Forbidding</a>
<a id='line_73'>us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their</a>
<a id='line_74'>sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>2:17 But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in</a>
<a id='line_77'>presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your</a>
<a id='line_78'>face with great desire.</a>
<a id='line_79'></a>
<a id='line_80'>2:18 Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and</a>
<a id='line_81'>again; but Satan hindered us.</a>
<a id='line_82'></a>
<a id='line_83'>2:19 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even</a>
<a id='line_84'>ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?  2:20 For</a>
<a id='line_85'>ye are our glory and joy.</a>
<a id='line_86'></a>
<a id='line_87'>3:1 Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to</a>
<a id='line_88'>be left at Athens alone; 3:2 And sent Timotheus, our brother, and</a>
<a id='line_89'>minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to</a>
<a id='line_90'>establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith: 3:3 That no</a>
<a id='line_91'>man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we</a>
<a id='line_92'>are appointed thereunto.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>3:4 For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we</a>
<a id='line_95'>should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.</a>
<a id='line_96'></a>
<a id='line_97'>3:5 For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know</a>
<a id='line_98'>your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our</a>
<a id='line_99'>labour be in vain.</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>3:6 But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good</a>
<a id='line_102'>tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance</a>
<a id='line_103'>of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you: 3:7</a>
<a id='line_104'>Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction</a>
<a id='line_105'>and distress by your faith: 3:8 For now we live, if ye stand fast in</a>
<a id='line_106'>the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'>3:9 For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the</a>
<a id='line_109'>joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; 3:10 Night and day</a>
<a id='line_110'>praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect</a>
<a id='line_111'>that which is lacking in your faith?  3:11 Now God himself and our</a>
<a id='line_112'>Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.</a>
<a id='line_113'></a>
<a id='line_114'>3:12 And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward</a>
<a id='line_115'>another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you: 3:13 To the end</a>
<a id='line_116'>he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even</a>
<a id='line_117'>our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his</a>
<a id='line_118'>saints.</a>
<a id='line_119'></a>
<a id='line_120'>4:1 Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the</a>
<a id='line_121'>Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to</a>
<a id='line_122'>please God, so ye would abound more and more.</a>
<a id='line_123'></a>
<a id='line_124'>4:2 For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_125'></a>
<a id='line_126'>4:3 For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye</a>
<a id='line_127'>should abstain from fornication: 4:4 That every one of you should know</a>
<a id='line_128'>how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; 4:5 Not in the</a>
<a id='line_129'>lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God: 4:6</a>
<a id='line_130'>That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because</a>
<a id='line_131'>that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned</a>
<a id='line_132'>you and testified.</a>
<a id='line_133'></a>
<a id='line_134'>4:7 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>4:8 He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath</a>
<a id='line_137'>also given unto us his holy Spirit.</a>
<a id='line_138'></a>
<a id='line_139'>4:9 But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you:</a>
<a id='line_140'>for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</a>
<a id='line_141'></a>
<a id='line_142'>4:10 And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all</a>
<a id='line_143'>Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and</a>
<a id='line_144'>more; 4:11 And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business,</a>
<a id='line_145'>and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you; 4:12 That ye may</a>
<a id='line_146'>walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack</a>
<a id='line_147'>of nothing.</a>
<a id='line_148'></a>
<a id='line_149'>4:13 But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning</a>
<a id='line_150'>them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have</a>
<a id='line_151'>no hope.</a>
<a id='line_152'></a>
<a id='line_153'>4:14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them</a>
<a id='line_154'>also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</a>
<a id='line_155'></a>
<a id='line_156'>4:15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which</a>
<a id='line_157'>are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent</a>
<a id='line_158'>them which are asleep.</a>
<a id='line_159'></a>
<a id='line_160'>4:16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with</a>
<a id='line_161'>the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in</a>
<a id='line_162'>Christ shall rise first: 4:17 Then we which are alive and remain shall</a>
<a id='line_163'>be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the</a>
<a id='line_164'>air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_165'></a>
<a id='line_166'>4:18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</a>
<a id='line_167'></a>
<a id='line_168'>5:1 But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I</a>
<a id='line_169'>write unto you.</a>
<a id='line_170'></a>
<a id='line_171'>5:2 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh</a>
<a id='line_172'>as a thief in the night.</a>
<a id='line_173'></a>
<a id='line_174'>5:3 For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction</a>
<a id='line_175'>cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall</a>
<a id='line_176'>not escape.</a>
<a id='line_177'></a>
<a id='line_178'>5:4 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should</a>
<a id='line_179'>overtake you as a thief.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>5:5 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we</a>
<a id='line_182'>are not of the night, nor of darkness.</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>5:6 Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be</a>
<a id='line_185'>sober.</a>
<a id='line_186'></a>
<a id='line_187'>5:7 For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken</a>
<a id='line_188'>are drunken in the night.</a>
<a id='line_189'></a>
<a id='line_190'>5:8 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the</a>
<a id='line_191'>breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of</a>
<a id='line_192'>salvation.</a>
<a id='line_193'></a>
<a id='line_194'>5:9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by</a>
<a id='line_195'>our Lord Jesus Christ, 5:10 Who died for us, that, whether we wake or</a>
<a id='line_196'>sleep, we should live together with him.</a>
<a id='line_197'></a>
<a id='line_198'>5:11 Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another,</a>
<a id='line_199'>even as also ye do.</a>
<a id='line_200'></a>
<a id='line_201'>5:12 And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among</a>
<a id='line_202'>you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; 5:13 And to</a>
<a id='line_203'>esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. And be at peace</a>
<a id='line_204'>among yourselves.</a>
<a id='line_205'></a>
<a id='line_206'>5:14 Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort</a>
<a id='line_207'>the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.</a>
<a id='line_208'></a>
<a id='line_209'>5:15 See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow</a>
<a id='line_210'>that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.</a>
<a id='line_211'></a>
<a id='line_212'>5:16 Rejoice evermore.</a>
<a id='line_213'></a>
<a id='line_214'>5:17 Pray without ceasing.</a>
<a id='line_215'></a>
<a id='line_216'>5:18 In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ</a>
<a id='line_217'>Jesus concerning you.</a>
<a id='line_218'></a>
<a id='line_219'>5:19 Quench not the Spirit.</a>
<a id='line_220'></a>
<a id='line_221'>5:20 Despise not prophesyings.</a>
<a id='line_222'></a>
<a id='line_223'>5:21 Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</a>
<a id='line_224'></a>
<a id='line_225'>5:22 Abstain from all appearance of evil.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>5:23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God</a>
<a id='line_228'>your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the</a>
<a id='line_229'>coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>5:24 Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.</a>
<a id='line_232'></a>
<a id='line_233'>5:25 Brethren, pray for us.</a>
<a id='line_234'></a>
<a id='line_235'>5:26 Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>5:27 I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the</a>
<a id='line_238'>holy brethren.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>5:28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</a>

<a id='line_245'>The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'></a>
<a id='line_248'>1:1 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the</a>
<a id='line_249'>Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: 1:2 Grace</a>
<a id='line_250'>unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_251'></a>
<a id='line_252'>1:3 We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet,</a>
<a id='line_253'>because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every</a>
<a id='line_254'>one of you all toward each other aboundeth; 1:4 So that we ourselves</a>
<a id='line_255'>glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all</a>
<a id='line_256'>your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure: 1:5 Which is a</a>
<a id='line_257'>manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be</a>
<a id='line_258'>counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer: 1:6</a>
<a id='line_259'>Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to</a>
<a id='line_260'>them that trouble you; 1:7 And to you who are troubled rest with us,</a>
<a id='line_261'>when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty</a>
<a id='line_262'>angels, 1:8 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not</a>
<a id='line_263'>God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: 1:9 Who</a>
<a id='line_264'>shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of</a>
<a id='line_265'>the Lord, and from the glory of his power; 1:10 When he shall come to</a>
<a id='line_266'>be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe</a>
<a id='line_267'>(because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.</a>
<a id='line_268'></a>
<a id='line_269'>1:11 Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count</a>
<a id='line_270'>you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his</a>
<a id='line_271'>goodness, and the work of faith with power: 1:12 That the name of our</a>
<a id='line_272'>Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to</a>
<a id='line_273'>the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_274'></a>
<a id='line_275'>2:1 Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus</a>
<a id='line_276'>Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, 2:2 That ye be not</a>
<a id='line_277'>soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word,</a>
<a id='line_278'>nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.</a>
<a id='line_279'></a>
<a id='line_280'>2:3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come,</a>
<a id='line_281'>except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be</a>
<a id='line_282'>revealed, the son of perdition; 2:4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself</a>
<a id='line_283'>above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God</a>
<a id='line_284'>sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.</a>
<a id='line_285'></a>
<a id='line_286'>2:5 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these</a>
<a id='line_287'>things?  2:6 And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be</a>
<a id='line_288'>revealed in his time.</a>
<a id='line_289'></a>
<a id='line_290'>2:7 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now</a>
<a id='line_291'>letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.</a>
<a id='line_292'></a>
<a id='line_293'>2:8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall</a>

<a id='line_295'>brightness of his coming: 2:9 Even him, whose coming is after the</a>
<a id='line_296'>working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, 2:10 And</a>
<a id='line_297'>with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish;</a>
<a id='line_298'>because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be</a>
<a id='line_299'>saved.</a>
<a id='line_300'></a>
<a id='line_301'>2:11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they</a>
<a id='line_302'>should believe a lie: 2:12 That they all might be damned who believed</a>
<a id='line_303'>not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</a>
<a id='line_304'></a>
<a id='line_305'>2:13 But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren</a>
<a id='line_306'>beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to</a>
<a id='line_307'>salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the</a>
<a id='line_308'>truth: 2:14 Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of</a>
<a id='line_309'>the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_310'></a>
<a id='line_311'>2:15 Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye</a>
<a id='line_312'>have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.</a>
<a id='line_313'></a>
<a id='line_314'>2:16 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father,</a>
<a id='line_315'>which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and</a>
<a id='line_316'>good hope through grace, 2:17 Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in</a>
<a id='line_317'>every good word and work.</a>
<a id='line_318'></a>
<a id='line_319'>3:1 Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have</a>
<a id='line_320'>free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you: 3:2 And that we</a>
<a id='line_321'>may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have</a>
<a id='line_322'>not faith.</a>
<a id='line_323'></a>
<a id='line_324'>3:3 But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you</a>
<a id='line_325'>from evil.</a>
<a id='line_326'></a>
<a id='line_327'>3:4 And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do</a>
<a id='line_328'>and will do the things which we command you.</a>
<a id='line_329'></a>
<a id='line_330'>3:5 And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the</a>
<a id='line_331'>patient waiting for Christ.</a>
<a id='line_332'></a>
<a id='line_333'>3:6 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus</a>
<a id='line_334'>Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh</a>
<a id='line_335'>disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.</a>
<a id='line_336'></a>
<a id='line_337'>3:7 For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not</a>
<a id='line_338'>ourselves disorderly among you; 3:8 Neither did we eat any man’s bread</a>
<a id='line_339'>for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we</a>
<a id='line_340'>might not be chargeable to any of you: 3:9 Not because we have not</a>
<a id='line_341'>power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.</a>
<a id='line_342'></a>
<a id='line_343'>3:10 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if</a>
<a id='line_344'>any would not work, neither should he eat.</a>
<a id='line_345'></a>
<a id='line_346'>3:11 For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly,</a>
<a id='line_347'>working not at all, but are busybodies.</a>
<a id='line_348'></a>
<a id='line_349'>3:12 Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus</a>
<a id='line_350'>Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</a>
<a id='line_351'></a>
<a id='line_352'>3:13 But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.</a>
<a id='line_353'></a>
<a id='line_354'>3:14 And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man,</a>
<a id='line_355'>and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.</a>
<a id='line_356'></a>
<a id='line_357'>3:15 Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</a>
<a id='line_358'></a>
<a id='line_359'>3:16 Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means.</a>
<a id='line_360'>The Lord be with you all.</a>
<a id='line_361'></a>
<a id='line_362'>3:17 The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in</a>
<a id='line_363'>every epistle: so I write.</a>
<a id='line_364'></a>
<a id='line_365'>3:18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</a>
