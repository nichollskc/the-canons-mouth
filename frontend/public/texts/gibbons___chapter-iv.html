<a id='line_6'>      The mildness of Marcus, which the rigid discipline of the Stoics</a>
<a id='line_7'>      was unable to eradicate, formed, at the same time, the most</a>
<a id='line_8'>      amiable, and the only defective part of his character. His</a>
<a id='line_9'>      excellent understanding was often deceived by the unsuspecting</a>
<a id='line_10'>      goodness of his heart. Artful men, who study the passions of</a>
<a id='line_11'>      princes, and conceal their own, approached his person in the</a>
<a id='line_12'>      disguise of philosophic sanctity, and acquired riches and honors</a>
<a id='line_13'>      by affecting to despise them. 1 His excessive indulgence to his</a>
<a id='line_14'>      brother, 105 his wife, and his son, exceeded the bounds of</a>
<a id='line_15'>      private virtue, and became a public injury, by the example and</a>
<a id='line_16'>      consequences of their vices.</a>

<a id='line_25'>      Faustina, the daughter of Pius and the wife of Marcus, has been</a>
<a id='line_26'>      as much celebrated for her gallantries as for her beauty. The</a>
<a id='line_27'>      grave simplicity of the philosopher was ill calculated to engage</a>
<a id='line_28'>      her wanton levity, or to fix that unbounded passion for variety,</a>
<a id='line_29'>      which often discovered personal merit in the meanest of mankind.</a>
<a id='line_30'>      2 The Cupid of the ancients was, in general, a very sensual</a>
<a id='line_31'>      deity; and the amours of an empress, as they exact on her side</a>
<a id='line_32'>      the plainest advances, are seldom susceptible of much sentimental</a>
<a id='line_33'>      delicacy. Marcus was the only man in the empire who seemed</a>
<a id='line_34'>      ignorant or insensible of the irregularities of Faustina; which,</a>
<a id='line_35'>      according to the prejudices of every age, reflected some disgrace</a>
<a id='line_36'>      on the injured husband. He promoted several of her lovers to</a>
<a id='line_37'>      posts of honor and profit, 3 and during a connection of thirty</a>
<a id='line_38'>      years, invariably gave her proofs of the most tender confidence,</a>
<a id='line_39'>      and of a respect which ended not with her life. In his</a>
<a id='line_40'>      Meditations, he thanks the gods, who had bestowed on him a wife</a>
<a id='line_41'>      so faithful, so gentle, and of such a wonderful simplicity of</a>
<a id='line_42'>      manners. 4 The obsequious senate, at his earnest request,</a>
<a id='line_43'>      declared her a goddess. She was represented in her temples, with</a>
<a id='line_44'>      the attributes of Juno, Venus, and Ceres; and it was decreed,</a>
<a id='line_45'>      that, on the day of their nuptials, the youth of either sex</a>
<a id='line_46'>      should pay their vows before the altar of their chaste patroness.</a>

<a id='line_65'>      all-accomplished character of Marcus.]</a>
<a id='line_66'></a>
<a id='line_67'>      The monstrous vices of the son have cast a shade on the purity of</a>
<a id='line_68'>      the father’s virtues. It has been objected to Marcus, that he</a>
<a id='line_69'>      sacrificed the happiness of millions to a fond partiality for a</a>
<a id='line_70'>      worthless boy; and that he chose a successor in his own family,</a>
<a id='line_71'>      rather than in the republic. Nothing however, was neglected by</a>
<a id='line_72'>      the anxious father, and by the men of virtue and learning whom he</a>
<a id='line_73'>      summoned to his assistance, to expand the narrow mind of young</a>
<a id='line_74'>      Commodus, to correct his growing vices, and to render him worthy</a>
<a id='line_75'>      of the throne for which he was designed. But the power of</a>
<a id='line_76'>      instruction is seldom of much efficacy, except in those happy</a>
<a id='line_77'>      dispositions where it is almost superfluous. The distasteful</a>
<a id='line_78'>      lesson of a grave philosopher was, in a moment, obliterated by</a>
<a id='line_79'>      the whisper of a profligate favorite; and Marcus himself blasted</a>
<a id='line_80'>      the fruits of this labored education, by admitting his son, at</a>
<a id='line_81'>      the age of fourteen or fifteen, to a full participation of the</a>
<a id='line_82'>      Imperial power. He lived but four years afterwards: but he lived</a>
<a id='line_83'>      long enough to repent a rash measure, which raised the impetuous</a>
<a id='line_84'>      youth above the restraint of reason and authority.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>      Most of the crimes which disturb the internal peace of society,</a>
<a id='line_87'>      are produced by the restraints which the necessary but unequal</a>
<a id='line_88'>      laws of property have imposed on the appetites of mankind, by</a>
<a id='line_89'>      confining to a few the possession of those objects that are</a>
<a id='line_90'>      coveted by many. Of all our passions and appetites, the love of</a>
<a id='line_91'>      power is of the most imperious and unsociable nature, since the</a>
<a id='line_92'>      pride of one man requires the submission of the multitude. In the</a>
<a id='line_93'>      tumult of civil discord, the laws of society lose their force,</a>
<a id='line_94'>      and their place is seldom supplied by those of humanity. The</a>
<a id='line_95'>      ardor of contention, the pride of victory, the despair of</a>
<a id='line_96'>      success, the memory of past injuries, and the fear of future</a>
<a id='line_97'>      dangers, all contribute to inflame the mind, and to silence the</a>
<a id='line_98'>      voice of pity. From such motives almost every page of history has</a>
<a id='line_99'>      been stained with civil blood; but these motives will not account</a>
<a id='line_100'>      for the unprovoked cruelties of Commodus, who had nothing to wish</a>
<a id='line_101'>      and every thing to enjoy. The beloved son of Marcus succeeded to</a>
<a id='line_102'>      his father, amidst the acclamations of the senate and armies; 6</a>
<a id='line_103'>      and when he ascended the throne, the happy youth saw round him</a>
<a id='line_104'>      neither competitor to remove, nor enemies to punish. In this</a>
<a id='line_105'>      calm, elevated station, it was surely natural that he should</a>
<a id='line_106'>      prefer the love of mankind to their detestation, the mild glories</a>
<a id='line_107'>      of his five predecessors to the ignominious fate of Nero and</a>
<a id='line_108'>      Domitian.</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>

<a id='line_115'></a>
<a id='line_116'>      Yet Commodus was not, as he has been represented, a tiger born</a>
<a id='line_117'>      with an insatiate thirst of human blood, and capable, from his</a>
<a id='line_118'>      infancy, of the most inhuman actions. 7 Nature had formed him of</a>
<a id='line_119'>      a weak rather than a wicked disposition. His simplicity and</a>
<a id='line_120'>      timidity rendered him the slave of his attendants, who gradually</a>
<a id='line_121'>      corrupted his mind. His cruelty, which at first obeyed the</a>
<a id='line_122'>      dictates of others, degenerated into habit, and at length became</a>
<a id='line_123'>      the ruling passion of his soul. 8</a>

<a id='line_128'></a>
<a id='line_129'>      Upon the death of his father, Commodus found himself embarrassed</a>
<a id='line_130'>      with the command of a great army, and the conduct of a difficult</a>
<a id='line_131'>      war against the Quadi and Marcomanni. 9 The servile and</a>
<a id='line_132'>      profligate youths whom Marcus had banished, soon regained their</a>
<a id='line_133'>      station and influence about the new emperor. They exaggerated the</a>
<a id='line_134'>      hardships and dangers of a campaign in the wild countries beyond</a>
<a id='line_135'>      the Danube; and they assured the indolent prince that the terror</a>
<a id='line_136'>      of his name, and the arms of his lieutenants, would be sufficient</a>
<a id='line_137'>      to complete the conquest of the dismayed barbarians, or to impose</a>
<a id='line_138'>      such conditions as were more advantageous than any conquest. By a</a>
<a id='line_139'>      dexterous application to his sensual appetites, they compared the</a>
<a id='line_140'>      tranquillity, the splendor, the refined pleasures of Rome, with</a>
<a id='line_141'>      the tumult of a Pannonian camp, which afforded neither leisure</a>
<a id='line_142'>      nor materials for luxury. 10 Commodus listened to the pleasing</a>
<a id='line_143'>      advice; but whilst he hesitated between his own inclination and</a>
<a id='line_144'>      the awe which he still retained for his father’s counsellors, the</a>
<a id='line_145'>      summer insensibly elapsed, and his triumphal entry into the</a>
<a id='line_146'>      capital was deferred till the autumn. His graceful person, 11</a>
<a id='line_147'>      popular address, and imagined virtues, attracted the public</a>
<a id='line_148'>      favor; the honorable peace which he had recently granted to the</a>
<a id='line_149'>      barbarians, diffused a universal joy; 12 his impatience to</a>
<a id='line_150'>      revisit Rome was fondly ascribed to the love of his country; and</a>
<a id='line_151'>      his dissolute course of amusements was faintly condemned in a</a>
<a id='line_152'>      prince of nineteen years of age.</a>

<a id='line_165'>      192, 193.] During the three first years of his reign, the forms,</a>
<a id='line_166'>      and even the spirit, of the old administration, were maintained</a>
<a id='line_167'>      by those faithful counsellors, to whom Marcus had recommended his</a>
<a id='line_168'>      son, and for whose wisdom and integrity Commodus still</a>
<a id='line_169'>      entertained a reluctant esteem. The young prince and his</a>
<a id='line_170'>      profligate favorites revelled in all the license of sovereign</a>
<a id='line_171'>      power; but his hands were yet unstained with blood; and he had</a>
<a id='line_172'>      even displayed a generosity of sentiment, which might perhaps</a>
<a id='line_173'>      have ripened into solid virtue. 13 A fatal incident decided his</a>

<a id='line_182'>      One evening, as the emperor was returning to the palace, through</a>
<a id='line_183'>      a dark and narrow portico in the amphitheatre, 14 an assassin,</a>
<a id='line_184'>      who waited his passage, rushed upon him with a drawn sword,</a>
<a id='line_185'>      loudly exclaiming, “_The senate sends you this_.” The menace</a>
<a id='line_186'>      prevented the deed; the assassin was seized by the guards, and</a>
<a id='line_187'>      immediately revealed the authors of the conspiracy. It had been</a>
<a id='line_188'>      formed, not in the state, but within the walls of the palace.</a>
<a id='line_189'>      Lucilla, the emperor’s sister, and widow of Lucius Verus,</a>
<a id='line_190'>      impatient of the second rank, and jealous of the reigning</a>
<a id='line_191'>      empress, had armed the murderer against her brother’s life. She</a>
<a id='line_192'>      had not ventured to communicate the black design to her second</a>
<a id='line_193'>      husband, Claudius Pompeiarus, a senator of distinguished merit</a>
<a id='line_194'>      and unshaken loyalty; but among the crowd of her lovers (for she</a>
<a id='line_195'>      imitated the manners of Faustina) she found men of desperate</a>
<a id='line_196'>      fortunes and wild ambition, who were prepared to serve her more</a>
<a id='line_197'>      violent, as well as her tender passions. The conspirators</a>
<a id='line_198'>      experienced the rigor of justice, and the abandoned princess was</a>
<a id='line_199'>      punished, first with exile, and afterwards with death. 15</a>

<a id='line_205'></a>
<a id='line_206'>      But the words of the assassin sunk deep into the mind of</a>
<a id='line_207'>      Commodus, and left an indelible impression of fear and hatred</a>
<a id='line_208'>      against the whole body of the senate. 151 Those whom he had</a>
<a id='line_209'>      dreaded as importunate ministers, he now suspected as secret</a>
<a id='line_210'>      enemies. The Delators, a race of men discouraged, and almost</a>
<a id='line_211'>      extinguished, under the former reigns, again became formidable,</a>
<a id='line_212'>      as soon as they discovered that the emperor was desirous of</a>
<a id='line_213'>      finding disaffection and treason in the senate. That assembly,</a>
<a id='line_214'>      whom Marcus had ever considered as the great council of the</a>
<a id='line_215'>      nation, was composed of the most distinguished of the Romans; and</a>
<a id='line_216'>      distinction of every kind soon became criminal. The possession of</a>
<a id='line_217'>      wealth stimulated the diligence of the informers; rigid virtue</a>
<a id='line_218'>      implied a tacit censure of the irregularities of Commodus;</a>
<a id='line_219'>      important services implied a dangerous superiority of merit; and</a>
<a id='line_220'>      the friendship of the father always insured the aversion of the</a>
<a id='line_221'>      son. Suspicion was equivalent to proof; trial to condemnation.</a>
<a id='line_222'>      The execution of a considerable senator was attended with the</a>
<a id='line_223'>      death of all who might lament or revenge his fate; and when</a>
<a id='line_224'>      Commodus had once tasted human blood, he became incapable of pity</a>
<a id='line_225'>      or remorse.</a>

<a id='line_232'>      Condianus; whose fraternal love has saved their names from</a>
<a id='line_233'>      oblivion, and endeared their memory to posterity. Their studies</a>
<a id='line_234'>      and their occupations, their pursuits and their pleasures, were</a>
<a id='line_235'>      still the same. In the enjoyment of a great estate, they never</a>
<a id='line_236'>      admitted the idea of a separate interest: some fragments are now</a>
<a id='line_237'>      extant of a treatise which they composed in common; 152 and in</a>
<a id='line_238'>      every action of life it was observed that their two bodies were</a>
<a id='line_239'>      animated by one soul. The Antonines, who valued their virtues,</a>
<a id='line_240'>      and delighted in their union, raised them, in the same year, to</a>
<a id='line_241'>      the consulship; and Marcus afterwards intrusted to their joint</a>
<a id='line_242'>      care the civil administration of Greece, and a great military</a>
<a id='line_243'>      command, in which they obtained a signal victory over the</a>
<a id='line_244'>      Germans. The kind cruelty of Commodus united them in death. 16</a>

<a id='line_261'>      estates of the nobles sacrificed to his avarice, he had</a>
<a id='line_262'>      accumulated an immense treasure. The Prætorian guards were under</a>
<a id='line_263'>      his immediate command; and his son, who already discovered a</a>
<a id='line_264'>      military genius, was at the head of the Illyrian legions.</a>
<a id='line_265'>      Perennis aspired to the empire; or what, in the eyes of Commodus,</a>
<a id='line_266'>      amounted to the same crime, he was capable of aspiring to it, had</a>
<a id='line_267'>      he not been prevented, surprised, and put to death. The fall of a</a>
<a id='line_268'>      minister is a very trifling incident in the general history of</a>
<a id='line_269'>      the empire; but it was hastened by an extraordinary circumstance,</a>
<a id='line_270'>      which proved how much the nerves of discipline were already</a>
<a id='line_271'>      relaxed. The legions of Britain, discontented with the</a>
<a id='line_272'>      administration of Perennis, formed a deputation of fifteen</a>
<a id='line_273'>      hundred select men, with instructions to march to Rome, and lay</a>
<a id='line_274'>      their complaints before the emperor. These military petitioners,</a>
<a id='line_275'>      by their own determined behaviour, by inflaming the divisions of</a>
<a id='line_276'>      the guards, by exaggerating the strength of the British army, and</a>
<a id='line_277'>      by alarming the fears of Commodus, exacted and obtained the</a>
<a id='line_278'>      minister’s death, as the only redress of their grievances. 17</a>
<a id='line_279'>      This presumption of a distant army, and their discovery of the</a>
<a id='line_280'>      weakness of government, was a sure presage of the most dreadful</a>
<a id='line_281'>      convulsions.</a>

<a id='line_314'>      troops: and the deserters, instead of seeking their safety in</a>
<a id='line_315'>      flight or concealment, infested the highways. Maternus, a private</a>
<a id='line_316'>      soldier, of a daring boldness above his station, collected these</a>
<a id='line_317'>      bands of robbers into a little army, set open the prisons,</a>
<a id='line_318'>      invited the slaves to assert their freedom, and plundered with</a>

<a id='line_322'>      roused from their supine indolence by the threatening commands of</a>
<a id='line_323'>      the emperor. Maternus found that he was encompassed, and foresaw</a>
<a id='line_324'>      that he must be overpowered. A great effort of despair was his</a>
<a id='line_325'>      last resource. He ordered his followers to disperse, to pass the</a>
<a id='line_326'>      Alps in small parties and various disguises, and to assemble at</a>

<a id='line_348'>      by birth; of a nation over whose stubborn, but servile temper,</a>
<a id='line_349'>      blows only could prevail. 20 He had been sent from his native</a>
<a id='line_350'>      country to Rome, in the capacity of a slave. As a slave he</a>
<a id='line_351'>      entered the Imperial palace, rendered himself useful to his</a>

<a id='line_355'>      Cleander was devoid of any ability or virtue which could inspire</a>

<a id='line_357'>      passion of his soul, and the great principle of his</a>
<a id='line_358'>      administration. The rank of Consul, of Patrician, of Senator, was</a>

<a id='line_378'>      in the most seasonable moments. To divert the public envy,</a>

<a id='line_382'>      liberality, would be less affected by the bloody scenes which</a>
<a id='line_383'>      were daily exhibited; that they would forget the death of</a>

<a id='line_394'>      He repealed the most odious of his acts; loaded his memory with</a>

<a id='line_419'>      by the riches and power of the minister, was considered as the</a>
<a id='line_420'>      immediate cause of the second. The popular discontent, after it</a>
<a id='line_421'>      had long circulated in whispers, broke out in the assembled</a>

<a id='line_424'>      in the suburbs, one of the emperor’s retirements, and demanded,</a>
<a id='line_425'>      with angry clamors, the head of the public enemy. Cleander, who</a>
<a id='line_426'>      commanded the Prætorian guards, 26 ordered a body of cavalry to</a>
<a id='line_427'>      sally forth, and disperse the seditious multitude. The multitude</a>
<a id='line_428'>      fled with precipitation towards the city; several were slain, and</a>
<a id='line_429'>      many more were trampled to death; but when the cavalry entered</a>
<a id='line_430'>      the streets, their pursuit was checked by a shower of stones and</a>
<a id='line_431'>      darts from the roofs and windows of the houses. The foot guards,</a>
<a id='line_432'>      27 who had been long jealous of the prerogatives and insolence of</a>
<a id='line_433'>      the Prætorian cavalry, embraced the party of the people. The</a>
<a id='line_434'>      tumult became a regular engagement, and threatened a general</a>
<a id='line_435'>      massacre. The Prætorians, at length, gave way, oppressed with</a>
<a id='line_436'>      numbers; and the tide of popular fury returned with redoubled</a>
<a id='line_437'>      violence against the gates of the palace, where Commodus lay,</a>
<a id='line_438'>      dissolved in luxury, and alone unconscious of the civil war. It</a>
<a id='line_439'>      was death to approach his person with the unwelcome news. He</a>
<a id='line_440'>      would have perished in this supine security, had not two women,</a>
<a id='line_441'>      his eldest sister Fadilla, and Marcia, the most favored of his</a>

<a id='line_785'>      night was now far spent; with the dawn of day, and the</a>
<a id='line_786'>      commencement of the new year, the senators expected a summons to</a>
<a id='line_787'>      attend an ignominious ceremony. 461 In spite of all</a>
<a id='line_788'>      remonstrances, even of those of his creatures who yet preserved</a>
<a id='line_789'>      any regard for prudence or decency, Commodus had resolved to pass</a>
<a id='line_790'>      the night in the gladiators’ school, and from thence to take</a>
<a id='line_791'>      possession of the consulship, in the habit and with the</a>
<a id='line_792'>      attendance of that infamous crew. On a sudden, before the break</a>
<a id='line_793'>      of day, the senate was called together in the temple of Concord,</a>
<a id='line_794'>      to meet the guards, and to ratify the election of a new emperor.</a>
<a id='line_795'>      For a few minutes they sat in silent suspense, doubtful of their</a>
<a id='line_796'>      unexpected deliverance, and suspicious of the cruel artifices of</a>

<a id='line_798'>      was no more, they resigned themselves to all the transports of</a>
<a id='line_799'>      joy and indignation. Pertinax, who modestly represented the</a>

<a id='line_805'>      eternal infamy. The names of tyrant, of gladiator, of public</a>
