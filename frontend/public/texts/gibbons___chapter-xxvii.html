<a id='line_5'>     Eugenius.—Death Of Theodosius.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>      The fame of Gratian, before he had accomplished the twentieth</a>
<a id='line_8'>      year of his age, was equal to that of the most celebrated</a>
<a id='line_9'>      princes. His gentle and amiable disposition endeared him to his</a>
<a id='line_10'>      private friends, the graceful affability of his manners engaged</a>
<a id='line_11'>      the affection of the people: the men of letters, who enjoyed the</a>
<a id='line_12'>      liberality, acknowledged the taste and eloquence, of their</a>
<a id='line_13'>      sovereign; his valor and dexterity in arms were equally applauded</a>
<a id='line_14'>      by the soldiers; and the clergy considered the humble piety of</a>
<a id='line_15'>      Gratian as the first and most useful of his virtues. The victory</a>
<a id='line_16'>      of Colmar had delivered the West from a formidable invasion; and</a>
<a id='line_17'>      the grateful provinces of the East ascribed the merits of</a>
<a id='line_18'>      Theodosius to the author of his greatness, and of the public</a>
<a id='line_19'>      safety. Gratian survived those memorable events only four or five</a>
<a id='line_20'>      years; but he survived his reputation; and, before he fell a</a>
<a id='line_21'>      victim to rebellion, he had lost, in a great measure, the respect</a>
<a id='line_22'>      and confidence of the Roman world.</a>
<a id='line_23'></a>
<a id='line_24'>      The remarkable alteration of his character or conduct may not be</a>
<a id='line_25'>      imputed to the arts of flattery, which had besieged the son of</a>
<a id='line_26'>      Valentinian from his infancy; nor to the headstrong passions</a>
<a id='line_27'>      which the that gentle youth appears to have escaped. A more</a>
<a id='line_28'>      attentive view of the life of Gratian may perhaps suggest the</a>
<a id='line_29'>      true cause of the disappointment of the public hopes. His</a>
<a id='line_30'>      apparent virtues, instead of being the hardy productions of</a>
<a id='line_31'>      experience and adversity, were the premature and artificial</a>
<a id='line_32'>      fruits of a royal education. The anxious tenderness of his father</a>
<a id='line_33'>      was continually employed to bestow on him those advantages, which</a>
<a id='line_34'>      he might perhaps esteem the more highly, as he himself had been</a>
<a id='line_35'>      deprived of them; and the most skilful masters of every science,</a>
<a id='line_36'>      and of every art, had labored to form the mind and body of the</a>
<a id='line_37'>      young prince. 1 The knowledge which they painfully communicated</a>
<a id='line_38'>      was displayed with ostentation, and celebrated with lavish</a>
<a id='line_39'>      praise. His soft and tractable disposition received the fair</a>
<a id='line_40'>      impression of their judicious precepts, and the absence of</a>
<a id='line_41'>      passion might easily be mistaken for the strength of reason. His</a>
<a id='line_42'>      preceptors gradually rose to the rank and consequence of</a>
<a id='line_43'>      ministers of state: 2 and, as they wisely dissembled their secret</a>
<a id='line_44'>      authority, he seemed to act with firmness, with propriety, and</a>
<a id='line_45'>      with judgment, on the most important occasions of his life and</a>
<a id='line_46'>      reign. But the influence of this elaborate instruction did not</a>
<a id='line_47'>      penetrate beyond the surface; and the skilful preceptors, who so</a>
<a id='line_48'>      accurately guided the steps of their royal pupil, could not</a>
<a id='line_49'>      infuse into his feeble and indolent character the vigorous and</a>
<a id='line_50'>      independent principle of action which renders the laborious</a>
<a id='line_51'>      pursuit of glory essentially necessary to the happiness, and</a>
<a id='line_52'>      almost to the existence, of the hero. As soon as time and</a>
<a id='line_53'>      accident had removed those faithful counsellors from the throne,</a>
<a id='line_54'>      the emperor of the West insensibly descended to the level of his</a>
<a id='line_55'>      natural genius; abandoned the reins of government to the</a>
<a id='line_56'>      ambitious hands which were stretched forwards to grasp them; and</a>
<a id='line_57'>      amused his leisure with the most frivolous gratifications. A</a>
<a id='line_58'>      public sale of favor and injustice was instituted, both in the</a>
<a id='line_59'>      court and in the provinces, by the worthless delegates of his</a>
<a id='line_60'>      power, whose merit it was made sacrilege to question. 3 The</a>
<a id='line_61'>      conscience of the credulous prince was directed by saints and</a>
<a id='line_62'>      bishops; 4 who procured an Imperial edict to punish, as a capital</a>
<a id='line_63'>      offence, the violation, the neglect, or even the ignorance, of</a>
<a id='line_64'>      the divine law. 5 Among the various arts which had exercised the</a>
<a id='line_65'>      youth of Gratian, he had applied himself, with singular</a>
<a id='line_66'>      inclination and success, to manage the horse, to draw the bow,</a>
<a id='line_67'>      and to dart the javelin; and these qualifications, which might be</a>
<a id='line_68'>      useful to a soldier, were prostituted to the viler purposes of</a>
<a id='line_69'>      hunting. Large parks were enclosed for the Imperial pleasures,</a>
<a id='line_70'>      and plentifully stocked with every species of wild beasts; and</a>
<a id='line_71'>      Gratian neglected the duties, and even the dignity, of his rank,</a>
<a id='line_72'>      to consume whole days in the vain display of his dexterity and</a>
<a id='line_73'>      boldness in the chase. The pride and wish of the Roman emperor to</a>
<a id='line_74'>      excel in an art, in which he might be surpassed by the meanest of</a>
<a id='line_75'>      his slaves, reminded the numerous spectators of the examples of</a>
<a id='line_76'>      Nero and Commodus, but the chaste and temperate Gratian was a</a>
<a id='line_77'>      stranger to their monstrous vices; and his hands were stained</a>
<a id='line_78'>      only with the blood of animals. 6 The behavior of Gratian, which</a>
<a id='line_79'>      degraded his character in the eyes of mankind, could not have</a>
<a id='line_80'>      disturbed the security of his reign, if the army had not been</a>
<a id='line_81'>      provoked to resent their peculiar injuries. As long as the young</a>
<a id='line_82'>      emperor was guided by the instructions of his masters, he</a>
<a id='line_83'>      professed himself the friend and pupil of the soldiers; many of</a>
<a id='line_84'>      his hours were spent in the familiar conversation of the camp;</a>
<a id='line_85'>      and the health, the comforts, the rewards, the honors, of his</a>
<a id='line_86'>      faithful troops, appeared to be the objects of his attentive</a>
<a id='line_87'>      concern. But, after Gratian more freely indulged his prevailing</a>
<a id='line_88'>      taste for hunting and shooting, he naturally connected himself</a>
<a id='line_89'>      with the most dexterous ministers of his favorite amusement. A</a>
<a id='line_90'>      body of the Alani was received into the military and domestic</a>
<a id='line_91'>      service of the palace; and the admirable skill, which they were</a>
<a id='line_92'>      accustomed to display in the unbounded plains of Scythia, was</a>
<a id='line_93'>      exercised, on a more narrow theatre, in the parks and enclosures</a>
<a id='line_94'>      of Gaul. Gratian admired the talents and customs of these</a>
<a id='line_95'>      favorite guards, to whom alone he intrusted the defence of his</a>
<a id='line_96'>      person; and, as if he meant to insult the public opinion, he</a>
<a id='line_97'>      frequently showed himself to the soldiers and people, with the</a>
<a id='line_98'>      dress and arms, the long bow, the sounding quiver, and the fur</a>
<a id='line_99'>      garments of a Scythian warrior. The unworthy spectacle of a Roman</a>
<a id='line_100'>      prince, who had renounced the dress and manners of his country,</a>
<a id='line_101'>      filled the minds of the legions with grief and indignation. 7</a>
<a id='line_102'>      Even the Germans, so strong and formidable in the armies of the</a>
<a id='line_103'>      empire, affected to disdain the strange and horrid appearance of</a>
<a id='line_104'>      the savages of the North, who, in the space of a few years, had</a>
<a id='line_105'>      wandered from the banks of the Volga to those of the Seine. A</a>
<a id='line_106'>      loud and licentious murmur was echoed through the camps and</a>
<a id='line_107'>      garrisons of the West; and as the mild indolence of Gratian</a>
<a id='line_108'>      neglected to extinguish the first symptoms of discontent, the</a>
<a id='line_109'>      want of love and respect was not supplied by the influence of</a>
<a id='line_110'>      fear. But the subversion of an established government is always a</a>
<a id='line_111'>      work of some real, and of much apparent, difficulty; and the</a>
<a id='line_112'>      throne of Gratian was protected by the sanctions of custom, law,</a>
<a id='line_113'>      religion, and the nice balance of the civil and military powers,</a>
<a id='line_114'>      which had been established by the policy of Constantine. It is</a>
<a id='line_115'>      not very important to inquire from what cause the revolt of</a>
<a id='line_116'>      Britain was produced. Accident is commonly the parent of</a>
<a id='line_117'>      disorder; the seeds of rebellion happened to fall on a soil which</a>
<a id='line_118'>      was supposed to be more fruitful than any other in tyrants and</a>
<a id='line_119'>      usurpers; 8 the legions of that sequestered island had been long</a>
<a id='line_120'>      famous for a spirit of presumption and arrogance; 9 and the name</a>
<a id='line_121'>      of Maximus was proclaimed, by the tumultuary, but unanimous</a>
<a id='line_122'>      voice, both of the soldiers and of the provincials. The emperor,</a>
<a id='line_123'>      or the rebel,—for this title was not yet ascertained by</a>
<a id='line_124'>      fortune,—was a native of Spain, the countryman, the</a>
<a id='line_125'>      fellow-soldier, and the rival of Theodosius whose elevation he</a>
<a id='line_126'>      had not seen without some emotions of envy and resentment: the</a>
<a id='line_127'>      events of his life had long since fixed him in Britain; and I</a>
<a id='line_128'>      should not be unwilling to find some evidence for the marriage,</a>
<a id='line_129'>      which he is said to have contracted with the daughter of a</a>
<a id='line_130'>      wealthy lord of Caernarvonshire. 10 But this provincial rank</a>
<a id='line_131'>      might justly be considered as a state of exile and obscurity; and</a>
<a id='line_132'>      if Maximus had obtained any civil or military office, he was not</a>
<a id='line_133'>      invested with the authority either of governor or general. 11 His</a>
<a id='line_134'>      abilities, and even his integrity, are acknowledged by the</a>
<a id='line_135'>      partial writers of the age; and the merit must indeed have been</a>
<a id='line_136'>      conspicuous that could extort such a confession in favor of the</a>
<a id='line_137'>      vanquished enemy of Theodosius. The discontent of Maximus might</a>
<a id='line_138'>      incline him to censure the conduct of his sovereign, and to</a>
<a id='line_139'>      encourage, perhaps, without any views of ambition, the murmurs of</a>
<a id='line_140'>      the troops. But in the midst of the tumult, he artfully, or</a>
<a id='line_141'>      modestly, refused to ascend the throne; and some credit appears</a>
<a id='line_142'>      to have been given to his own positive declaration, that he was</a>
<a id='line_143'>      compelled to accept the dangerous present of the Imperial purple.</a>

<a id='line_154'>      was at length invested with the consulship, (A.D. 379.) He</a>
<a id='line_155'>      expressed his gratitude in a servile and insipid piece of</a>
<a id='line_156'>      flattery, (Actio Gratiarum, p. 699-736,) which has survived more</a>

<a id='line_178'>      “licet incruentus;” and perhaps Philostorgius (l. x. c. 10, and</a>
<a id='line_179'>      Godefroy, p. 41) had guarded with some similar reserve, the</a>

<a id='line_216'>      adversary of his rival.]</a>
<a id='line_217'></a>
<a id='line_218'>      But there was danger likewise in refusing the empire; and from</a>
<a id='line_219'>      the moment that Maximus had violated his allegiance to his lawful</a>
<a id='line_220'>      sovereign, he could not hope to reign, or even to live, if he</a>
<a id='line_221'>      confined his moderate ambition within the narrow limits of</a>
<a id='line_222'>      Britain. He boldly and wisely resolved to prevent the designs of</a>
<a id='line_223'>      Gratian; the youth of the island crowded to his standard, and he</a>
<a id='line_224'>      invaded Gaul with a fleet and army, which were long afterwards</a>
<a id='line_225'>      remembered, as the emigration of a considerable part of the</a>
<a id='line_226'>      British nation. 13 The emperor, in his peaceful residence of</a>
<a id='line_227'>      Paris, was alarmed by their hostile approach; and the darts which</a>
<a id='line_228'>      he idly wasted on lions and bears, might have been employed more</a>
<a id='line_229'>      honorably against the rebels. But his feeble efforts announced</a>
<a id='line_230'>      his degenerate spirit and desperate situation; and deprived him</a>
<a id='line_231'>      of the resources, which he still might have found, in the support</a>
<a id='line_232'>      of his subjects and allies. The armies of Gaul, instead of</a>
<a id='line_233'>      opposing the march of Maximus, received him with joyful and loyal</a>
<a id='line_234'>      acclamations; and the shame of the desertion was transferred from</a>
<a id='line_235'>      the people to the prince. The troops, whose station more</a>
<a id='line_236'>      immediately attached them to the service of the palace, abandoned</a>
<a id='line_237'>      the standard of Gratian the first time that it was displayed in</a>
<a id='line_238'>      the neighborhood of Paris. The emperor of the West fled towards</a>
<a id='line_239'>      Lyons, with a train of only three hundred horse; and, in the</a>
<a id='line_240'>      cities along the road, where he hoped to find refuge, or at least</a>
<a id='line_241'>      a passage, he was taught, by cruel experience, that every gate is</a>
<a id='line_242'>      shut against the unfortunate. Yet he might still have reached, in</a>
<a id='line_243'>      safety, the dominions of his brother; and soon have returned with</a>
<a id='line_244'>      the forces of Italy and the East; if he had not suffered himself</a>
<a id='line_245'>      to be fatally deceived by the perfidious governor of the Lyonnese</a>
<a id='line_246'>      province. Gratian was amused by protestations of doubtful</a>
<a id='line_247'>      fidelity, and the hopes of a support, which could not be</a>
<a id='line_248'>      effectual; till the arrival of Andragathius, the general of the</a>
<a id='line_249'>      cavalry of Maximus, put an end to his suspense. That resolute</a>
<a id='line_250'>      officer executed, without remorse, the orders or the intention of</a>

<a id='line_316'>      proceeded, in a firm and equal tone, to offer Theodosius the</a>
<a id='line_317'>      alternative of peace, or war. The speech of the ambassador</a>
<a id='line_318'>      concluded with a spirited declaration, that although Maximus, as</a>
<a id='line_319'>      a Roman, and as the father of his people, would choose rather to</a>
<a id='line_320'>      employ his forces in the common defence of the republic, he was</a>
<a id='line_321'>      armed and prepared, if his friendship should be rejected, to</a>
<a id='line_322'>      dispute, in a field of battle, the empire of the world. An</a>
<a id='line_323'>      immediate and peremptory answer was required; but it was</a>
<a id='line_324'>      extremely difficult for Theodosius to satisfy, on this important</a>
<a id='line_325'>      occasion, either the feelings of his own mind, or the</a>
<a id='line_326'>      expectations of the public. The imperious voice of honor and</a>
<a id='line_327'>      gratitude called aloud for revenge. From the liberality of</a>
<a id='line_328'>      Gratian, he had received the Imperial diadem; his patience would</a>
<a id='line_329'>      encourage the odious suspicion, that he was more deeply sensible</a>
<a id='line_330'>      of former injuries, than of recent obligations; and if he</a>
<a id='line_331'>      accepted the friendship, he must seem to share the guilt, of the</a>
<a id='line_332'>      assassin. Even the principles of justice, and the interest of</a>
<a id='line_333'>      society, would receive a fatal blow from the impunity of Maximus;</a>
<a id='line_334'>      and the example of successful usurpation would tend to dissolve</a>
<a id='line_335'>      the artificial fabric of government, and once more to replunge</a>
<a id='line_336'>      the empire in the crimes and calamities of the preceding age.</a>
<a id='line_337'>      But, as the sentiments of gratitude and honor should invariably</a>
<a id='line_338'>      regulate the conduct of an individual, they may be overbalanced</a>
<a id='line_339'>      in the mind of a sovereign, by the sense of superior duties; and</a>
<a id='line_340'>      the maxims both of justice and humanity must permit the escape of</a>
<a id='line_341'>      an atrocious criminal, if an innocent people would be involved in</a>
<a id='line_342'>      the consequences of his punishment. The assassin of Gratian had</a>
<a id='line_343'>      usurped, but he actually possessed, the most warlike provinces of</a>
<a id='line_344'>      the empire: the East was exhausted by the misfortunes, and even</a>
<a id='line_345'>      by the success, of the Gothic war; and it was seriously to be</a>
<a id='line_346'>      apprehended, that, after the vital strength of the republic had</a>
<a id='line_347'>      been wasted in a doubtful and destructive contest, the feeble</a>
<a id='line_348'>      conqueror would remain an easy prey to the Barbarians of the</a>
<a id='line_349'>      North. These weighty considerations engaged Theodosius to</a>
<a id='line_350'>      dissemble his resentment, and to accept the alliance of the</a>
<a id='line_351'>      tyrant. But he stipulated, that Maximus should content himself</a>
<a id='line_352'>      with the possession of the countries beyond the Alps. The brother</a>
<a id='line_353'>      of Gratian was confirmed and secured in the sovereignty of Italy,</a>

<a id='line_355'>      were inserted in the treaty, to protect the memory, and the laws,</a>

<a id='line_369'></a>
<a id='line_370'>      The contempt of Gratian for the Roman soldiers had exposed him to</a>

<a id='line_372'>      for the Christian clergy was rewarded by the applause and</a>

<a id='line_375'>      19 The orthodox bishops bewailed his death, and their own</a>

<a id='line_377'>      that Gratian had committed the sceptre of the East to the hands</a>
<a id='line_378'>      of a prince, whose humble faith and fervent zeal, were supported</a>
<a id='line_379'>      by the spirit and abilities of a more vigorous character. Among</a>
<a id='line_380'>      the benefactors of the church, the fame of Constantine has been</a>
<a id='line_381'>      rivalled by the glory of Theodosius. If Constantine had the</a>
<a id='line_382'>      advantage of erecting the standard of the cross, the emulation of</a>
<a id='line_383'>      his successor assumed the merit of subduing the Arian heresy, and</a>
<a id='line_384'>      of abolishing the worship of idols in the Roman world. Theodosius</a>
<a id='line_385'>      was the first of the emperors baptized in the true faith of the</a>
<a id='line_386'>      Trinity. Although he was born of a Christian family, the maxims,</a>
<a id='line_387'>      or at least the practice, of the age, encouraged him to delay the</a>
<a id='line_388'>      ceremony of his initiation; till he was admonished of the danger</a>
<a id='line_389'>      of delay, by the serious illness which threatened his life,</a>
<a id='line_390'>      towards the end of the first year of his reign. Before he again</a>
<a id='line_391'>      took the field against the Goths, he received the sacrament of</a>
<a id='line_392'>      baptism 20 from Acholius, the orthodox bishop of Thessalonica: 21</a>
<a id='line_393'>      and, as the emperor ascended from the holy font, still glowing</a>
<a id='line_394'>      with the warm feelings of regeneration, he dictated a solemn</a>
<a id='line_395'>      edict, which proclaimed his own faith, and prescribed the</a>
<a id='line_396'>      religion of his subjects. “It is our pleasure (such is the</a>
<a id='line_397'>      Imperial style) that all the nations, which are governed by our</a>
<a id='line_398'>      clemency and moderation, should steadfastly adhere to the</a>
<a id='line_399'>      religion which was taught by St. Peter to the Romans; which</a>
<a id='line_400'>      faithful tradition has preserved; and which is now professed by</a>
<a id='line_401'>      the pontiff Damasus, and by Peter, bishop of Alexandria, a man of</a>
<a id='line_402'>      apostolic holiness. According to the discipline of the apostles,</a>
<a id='line_403'>      and the doctrine of the gospel, let us believe the sole deity of</a>
<a id='line_404'>      the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; under an equal majesty,</a>
<a id='line_405'>      and a pious Trinity. We authorize the followers of this doctrine</a>
<a id='line_406'>      to assume the title of Catholic Christians; and as we judge, that</a>
<a id='line_407'>      all others are extravagant madmen, we brand them with the</a>
<a id='line_408'>      infamous name of Heretics; and declare that their conventicles</a>
<a id='line_409'>      shall no longer usurp the respectable appellation of churches.</a>
<a id='line_410'>      Besides the condemnation of divine justice, they must expect to</a>
<a id='line_411'>      suffer the severe penalties, which our authority, guided by</a>
<a id='line_412'>      heavenly wisdom, shall think proper to inflict upon them.” 22 The</a>
<a id='line_413'>      faith of a soldier is commonly the fruit of instruction, rather</a>
<a id='line_414'>      than of inquiry; but as the emperor always fixed his eyes on the</a>
<a id='line_415'>      visible landmarks of orthodoxy, which he had so prudently</a>
<a id='line_416'>      constituted, his religious opinions were never affected by the</a>
<a id='line_417'>      specious texts, the subtle arguments, and the ambiguous creeds of</a>
<a id='line_418'>      the Arian doctors. Once indeed he expressed a faint inclination</a>
<a id='line_419'>      to converse with the eloquent and learned Eunomius, who lived in</a>
<a id='line_420'>      retirement at a small distance from Constantinople. But the</a>
<a id='line_421'>      dangerous interview was prevented by the prayers of the empress</a>
<a id='line_422'>      Flaccilla, who trembled for the salvation of her husband; and the</a>
<a id='line_423'>      mind of Theodosius was confirmed by a theological argument,</a>
<a id='line_424'>      adapted to the rudest capacity. He had lately bestowed on his</a>
<a id='line_425'>      eldest son, Arcadius, the name and honors of Augustus, and the</a>
<a id='line_426'>      two princes were seated on a stately throne to receive the homage</a>
<a id='line_427'>      of their subjects. A bishop, Amphilochius of Iconium, approached</a>
<a id='line_428'>      the throne, and after saluting, with due reverence, the person of</a>
<a id='line_429'>      his sovereign, he accosted the royal youth with the same familiar</a>
<a id='line_430'>      tenderness which he might have used towards a plebeian child.</a>
<a id='line_431'>      Provoked by this insolent behavior, the monarch gave orders, that</a>
<a id='line_432'>      the rustic priest should be instantly driven from his presence.</a>
<a id='line_433'>      But while the guards were forcing him to the door, the dexterous</a>
<a id='line_434'>      polemic had time to execute his design, by exclaiming, with a</a>
<a id='line_435'>      loud voice, “Such is the treatment, O emperor! which the King of</a>
<a id='line_436'>      heaven has prepared for those impious men, who affect to worship</a>
<a id='line_437'>      the Father, but refuse to acknowledge the equal majesty of his</a>
<a id='line_438'>      divine Son.” Theodosius immediately embraced the bishop of</a>
<a id='line_439'>      Iconium, and never forgot the important lesson, which he had</a>

<a id='line_502'>      their zeal, instead of being subdued, derived strength and vigor</a>
<a id='line_503'>      from oppression, they seized the first moments of imperfect</a>
<a id='line_504'>      freedom, which they had acquired by the death of Valens, to form</a>
<a id='line_505'>      themselves into a regular congregation, under the conduct of an</a>
<a id='line_506'>      episcopal pastor. Two natives of Cappadocia, Basil, and Gregory</a>
<a id='line_507'>      Nazianzen, 27 were distinguished above all their contemporaries,</a>
<a id='line_508'>      28 by the rare union of profane eloquence and of orthodox piety.</a>
<a id='line_509'></a>
<a id='line_510'>      These orators, who might sometimes be compared, by themselves,</a>
<a id='line_511'>      and by the public, to the most celebrated of the ancient Greeks,</a>
<a id='line_512'>      were united by the ties of the strictest friendship. They had</a>
<a id='line_513'>      cultivated, with equal ardor, the same liberal studies in the</a>
<a id='line_514'>      schools of Athens; they had retired, with equal devotion, to the</a>
<a id='line_515'>      same solitude in the deserts of Pontus; and every spark of</a>
<a id='line_516'>      emulation, or envy, appeared to be totally extinguished in the</a>
<a id='line_517'>      holy and ingenuous breasts of Gregory and Basil. But the</a>
<a id='line_518'>      exaltation of Basil, from a private life to the archiepiscopal</a>
<a id='line_519'>      throne of Caesarea, discovered to the world, and perhaps to</a>
<a id='line_520'>      himself, the pride of his character; and the first favor which he</a>
<a id='line_521'>      condescended to bestow on his friend, was received, and perhaps</a>
<a id='line_522'>      was intended, as a cruel insult. 29 Instead of employing the</a>
<a id='line_523'>      superior talents of Gregory in some useful and conspicuous</a>
<a id='line_524'>      station, the haughty prelate selected, among the fifty bishoprics</a>
<a id='line_525'>      of his extensive province, the wretched village of Sasima, 30</a>
<a id='line_526'>      without water, without verdure, without society, situate at the</a>
<a id='line_527'>      junction of three highways, and frequented only by the incessant</a>
<a id='line_528'>      passage of rude and clamorous wagoners. Gregory submitted with</a>
<a id='line_529'>      reluctance to this humiliating exile; he was ordained bishop of</a>
<a id='line_530'>      Sasima; but he solemnly protests, that he never consummated his</a>
<a id='line_531'>      spiritual marriage with this disgusting bride. He afterwards</a>
<a id='line_532'>      consented to undertake the government of his native church of</a>
<a id='line_533'>      Nazianzus, 31 of which his father had been bishop above</a>
<a id='line_534'>      five-and-forty years. But as he was still conscious that he</a>
<a id='line_535'>      deserved another audience, and another theatre, he accepted, with</a>
<a id='line_536'>      no unworthy ambition, the honorable invitation, which was</a>
<a id='line_537'>      addressed to him from the orthodox party of Constantinople. On</a>
<a id='line_538'>      his arrival in the capital, Gregory was entertained in the house</a>
<a id='line_539'>      of a pious and charitable kinsman; the most spacious room was</a>
<a id='line_540'>      consecrated to the uses of religious worship; and the name of</a>
<a id='line_541'>      Anastasia was chosen to express the resurrection of the Nicene</a>
<a id='line_542'>      faith. This private conventicle was afterwards converted into a</a>
<a id='line_543'>      magnificent church; and the credulity of the succeeding age was</a>
<a id='line_544'>      prepared to believe the miracles and visions, which attested the</a>
<a id='line_545'>      presence, or at least the protection, of the Mother of God. 32</a>
<a id='line_546'>      The pulpit of the Anastasia was the scene of the labors and</a>
<a id='line_547'>      triumphs of Gregory Nazianzen; and, in the space of two years, he</a>
<a id='line_548'>      experienced all the spiritual adventures which constitute the</a>
<a id='line_549'>      prosperous or adverse fortunes of a missionary. 33 The Arians,</a>
<a id='line_550'>      who were provoked by the boldness of his enterprise, represented</a>
<a id='line_551'>      his doctrine, as if he had preached three distinct and equal</a>
<a id='line_552'>      Deities; and the devout populace was excited to suppress, by</a>
<a id='line_553'>      violence and tumult, the irregular assemblies of the Athanasian</a>
<a id='line_554'>      heretics. From the cathedral of St. Sophia there issued a motley</a>
<a id='line_555'>      crowd “of common beggars, who had forfeited their claim to pity;</a>
<a id='line_556'>      of monks, who had the appearance of goats or satyrs; and of</a>
<a id='line_557'>      women, more terrible than so many Jezebels.” The doors of the</a>
<a id='line_558'>      Anastasia were broke open; much mischief was perpetrated, or</a>
<a id='line_559'>      attempted, with sticks, stones, and firebrands; and as a man lost</a>
<a id='line_560'>      his life in the affray, Gregory, who was summoned the next</a>
<a id='line_561'>      morning before the magistrate, had the satisfaction of supposing,</a>
<a id='line_562'>      that he publicly confessed the name of Christ. After he was</a>
<a id='line_563'>      delivered from the fear and danger of a foreign enemy, his infant</a>
<a id='line_564'>      church was disgraced and distracted by intestine faction. A</a>
<a id='line_565'>      stranger who assumed the name of Maximus, 34 and the cloak of a</a>
<a id='line_566'>      Cynic philosopher, insinuated himself into the confidence of</a>
<a id='line_567'>      Gregory; deceived and abused his favorable opinion; and forming a</a>
<a id='line_568'>      secret connection with some bishops of Egypt, attempted, by a</a>
<a id='line_569'>      clandestine ordination, to supplant his patron in the episcopal</a>
<a id='line_570'>      seat of Constantinople. These mortifications might sometimes</a>
<a id='line_571'>      tempt the Cappadocian missionary to regret his obscure solitude.</a>
<a id='line_572'>      But his fatigues were rewarded by the daily increase of his fame</a>
<a id='line_573'>      and his congregation; and he enjoyed the pleasure of observing,</a>
<a id='line_574'>      that the greater part of his numerous audience retired from his</a>
<a id='line_575'>      sermons satisfied with the eloquence of the preacher, 35 or</a>

<a id='line_657'>      hopes were speedily accomplished; and the emperor, as soon as he</a>
<a id='line_658'>      had finished the operations of the campaign, made his public</a>
<a id='line_659'>      entry into the capital at the head of a victorious army. The next</a>
<a id='line_660'>      day after his arrival, he summoned Damophilus to his presence,</a>
<a id='line_661'>      and offered that Arian prelate the hard alternative of</a>
<a id='line_662'>      subscribing the Nicene creed, or of instantly resigning, to the</a>
<a id='line_663'>      orthodox believers, the use and possession of the episcopal</a>
<a id='line_664'>      palace, the cathedral of St. Sophia, and all the churches of</a>
<a id='line_665'>      Constantinople. The zeal of Damophilus, which in a Catholic saint</a>
<a id='line_666'>      would have been justly applauded, embraced, without hesitation, a</a>
<a id='line_667'>      life of poverty and exile, 37 and his removal was immediately</a>
<a id='line_668'>      followed by the purification of the Imperial city. The Arians</a>
<a id='line_669'>      might complain, with some appearance of justice, that an</a>
<a id='line_670'>      inconsiderable congregation of sectaries should usurp the hundred</a>
<a id='line_671'>      churches, which they were insufficient to fill; whilst the far</a>
<a id='line_672'>      greater part of the people was cruelly excluded from every place</a>
<a id='line_673'>      of religious worship. Theodosius was still inexorable; but as the</a>
<a id='line_674'>      angels who protected the Catholic cause were only visible to the</a>
<a id='line_675'>      eyes of faith, he prudently reenforced those heavenly legions</a>
<a id='line_676'>      with the more effectual aid of temporal and carnal weapons; and</a>
<a id='line_677'>      the church of St. Sophia was occupied by a large body of the</a>
<a id='line_678'>      Imperial guards. If the mind of Gregory was susceptible of pride,</a>
<a id='line_679'>      he must have felt a very lively satisfaction, when the emperor</a>
<a id='line_680'>      conducted him through the streets in solemn triumph; and, with</a>
<a id='line_681'>      his own hand, respectfully placed him on the archiepiscopal</a>
<a id='line_682'>      throne of Constantinople. But the saint (who had not subdued the</a>
<a id='line_683'>      imperfections of human virtue) was deeply affected by the</a>
<a id='line_684'>      mortifying consideration, that his entrance into the fold was</a>
<a id='line_685'>      that of a wolf, rather than of a shepherd; that the glittering</a>
<a id='line_686'>      arms which surrounded his person, were necessary for his safety;</a>
<a id='line_687'>      and that he alone was the object of the imprecations of a great</a>
<a id='line_688'>      party, whom, as men and citizens, it was impossible for him to</a>
<a id='line_689'>      despise. He beheld the innumerable multitude of either sex, and</a>
<a id='line_690'>      of every age, who crowded the streets, the windows, and the roofs</a>
<a id='line_691'>      of the houses; he heard the tumultuous voice of rage, grief,</a>
<a id='line_692'>      astonishment, and despair; and Gregory fairly confesses, that on</a>
<a id='line_693'>      the memorable day of his installation, the capital of the East</a>
<a id='line_694'>      wore the appearance of a city taken by storm, and in the hands of</a>
<a id='line_695'>      a Barbarian conqueror. 38 About six weeks afterwards, Theodosius</a>
<a id='line_696'>      declared his resolution of expelling from all the churches of his</a>
<a id='line_697'>      dominions the bishops and their clergy who should obstinately</a>
<a id='line_698'>      refuse to believe, or at least to profess, the doctrine of the</a>
<a id='line_699'>      council of Nice. His lieutenant, Sapor, was armed with the ample</a>
<a id='line_700'>      powers of a general law, a special commission, and a military</a>
<a id='line_701'>      force; 39 and this ecclesiastical revolution was conducted with</a>
<a id='line_702'>      so much discretion and vigor, that the religion of the emperor</a>
<a id='line_703'>      was established, without tumult or bloodshed, in all the</a>
<a id='line_704'>      provinces of the East. The writings of the Arians, if they had</a>
<a id='line_705'>      been permitted to exist, 40 would perhaps contain the lamentable</a>
<a id='line_706'>      story of the persecution, which afflicted the church under the</a>
<a id='line_707'>      reign of the impious Theodosius; and the sufferings of their holy</a>
<a id='line_708'>      confessors might claim the pity of the disinterested reader. Yet</a>
<a id='line_709'>      there is reason to imagine, that the violence of zeal and revenge</a>
<a id='line_710'>      was, in some measure, eluded by the want of resistance; and that,</a>
<a id='line_711'>      in their adversity, the Arians displayed much less firmness than</a>
<a id='line_712'>      had been exerted by the orthodox party under the reigns of</a>
<a id='line_713'>      Constantius and Valens. The moral character and conduct of the</a>
<a id='line_714'>      hostile sects appear to have been governed by the same common</a>
<a id='line_715'>      principles of nature and religion: but a very material</a>
<a id='line_716'>      circumstance may be discovered, which tended to distinguish the</a>
<a id='line_717'>      degrees of their theological faith. Both parties, in the schools,</a>
<a id='line_718'>      as well as in the temples, acknowledged and worshipped the divine</a>
<a id='line_719'>      majesty of Christ; and, as we are always prone to impute our own</a>
<a id='line_720'>      sentiments and passions to the Deity, it would be deemed more</a>
<a id='line_721'>      prudent and respectful to exaggerate, than to circumscribe, the</a>
<a id='line_722'>      adorable perfections of the Son of God. The disciple of</a>
<a id='line_723'>      Athanasius exulted in the proud confidence, that he had entitled</a>
<a id='line_724'>      himself to the divine favor; while the follower of Arius must</a>
<a id='line_725'>      have been tormented by the secret apprehension, that he was</a>
<a id='line_726'>      guilty, perhaps, of an unpardonable offence, by the scanty</a>
<a id='line_727'>      praise, and parsimonious honors, which he bestowed on the Judge</a>
<a id='line_728'>      of the World. The opinions of Arianism might satisfy a cold and</a>
<a id='line_729'>      speculative mind: but the doctrine of the Nicene creed, most</a>
<a id='line_730'>      powerfully recommended by the merits of faith and devotion, was</a>
<a id='line_731'>      much better adapted to become popular and successful in a</a>

<a id='line_756'>      The hope, that truth and wisdom would be found in the assemblies</a>
<a id='line_757'>      of the orthodox clergy, induced the emperor to convene, at</a>
<a id='line_758'>      Constantinople, a synod of one hundred and fifty bishops, who</a>
<a id='line_759'>      proceeded, without much difficulty or delay, to complete the</a>
<a id='line_760'>      theological system which had been established in the council of</a>
<a id='line_761'>      Nice. The vehement disputes of the fourth century had been</a>
<a id='line_762'>      chiefly employed on the nature of the Son of God; and the various</a>
<a id='line_763'>      opinions which were embraced, concerning the Second, were</a>
<a id='line_764'>      extended and transferred, by a natural analogy, to the Third</a>
<a id='line_765'>      person of the Trinity. 41 Yet it was found, or it was thought,</a>
<a id='line_766'>      necessary, by the victorious adversaries of Arianism, to explain</a>
<a id='line_767'>      the ambiguous language of some respectable doctors; to confirm</a>
<a id='line_768'>      the faith of the Catholics; and to condemn an unpopular and</a>
<a id='line_769'>      inconsistent sect of Macedonians; who freely admitted that the</a>
<a id='line_770'>      Son was consubstantial to the Father, while they were fearful of</a>
<a id='line_771'>      seeming to acknowledge the existence of Three Gods. A final and</a>
<a id='line_772'>      unanimous sentence was pronounced to ratify the equal Deity of</a>
<a id='line_773'>      the Holy Ghost: the mysterious doctrine has been received by all</a>
<a id='line_774'>      the nations, and all the churches of the Christian world; and</a>
<a id='line_775'>      their grateful reverence has assigned to the bishops of</a>
<a id='line_776'>      Theodosius the second rank among the general councils. 42 Their</a>
<a id='line_777'>      knowledge of religious truth may have been preserved by</a>
<a id='line_778'>      tradition, or it may have been communicated by inspiration; but</a>
<a id='line_779'>      the sober evidence of history will not allow much weight to the</a>
<a id='line_780'>      personal authority of the Fathers of Constantinople. In an age</a>
<a id='line_781'>      when the ecclesiastics had scandalously degenerated from the</a>
<a id='line_782'>      model of apostolic purity, the most worthless and corrupt were</a>
<a id='line_783'>      always the most eager to frequent, and disturb, the episcopal</a>
<a id='line_784'>      assemblies. The conflict and fermentation of so many opposite</a>
<a id='line_785'>      interests and tempers inflamed the passions of the bishops: and</a>
<a id='line_786'>      their ruling passions were, the love of gold, and the love of</a>
<a id='line_787'>      dispute. Many of the same prelates who now applauded the orthodox</a>
<a id='line_788'>      piety of Theodosius, had repeatedly changed, with prudent</a>
<a id='line_789'>      flexibility, their creeds and opinions; and in the various</a>
<a id='line_790'>      revolutions of the church and state, the religion of their</a>
<a id='line_791'>      sovereign was the rule of their obsequious faith. When the</a>
<a id='line_792'>      emperor suspended his prevailing influence, the turbulent synod</a>
<a id='line_793'>      was blindly impelled by the absurd or selfish motives of pride,</a>
<a id='line_794'>      hatred, or resentment. The death of Meletius, which happened at</a>
<a id='line_795'>      the council of Constantinople, presented the most favorable</a>
<a id='line_796'>      opportunity of terminating the schism of Antioch, by suffering</a>
<a id='line_797'>      his aged rival, Paulinus, peaceably to end his days in the</a>
<a id='line_798'>      episcopal chair. The faith and virtues of Paulinus were</a>
<a id='line_799'>      unblemished. But his cause was supported by the Western churches;</a>
<a id='line_800'>      and the bishops of the synod resolved to perpetuate the mischiefs</a>
<a id='line_801'>      of discord, by the hasty ordination of a perjured candidate, 43</a>
<a id='line_802'>      rather than to betray the imagined dignity of the East, which had</a>
<a id='line_803'>      been illustrated by the birth and death of the Son of God. Such</a>
<a id='line_804'>      unjust and disorderly proceedings forced the gravest members of</a>
<a id='line_805'>      the assembly to dissent and to secede; and the clamorous majority</a>

<a id='line_856'>      people, and the approbation of the emperor. But Gregory soon</a>
<a id='line_857'>      became the victim of malice and envy. The bishops of the East,</a>
<a id='line_858'>      his strenuous adherents, provoked by his moderation in the</a>
<a id='line_859'>      affairs of Antioch, abandoned him, without support, to the</a>

<a id='line_862'>      prohibited the licentious practice of episcopal translations. The</a>

<a id='line_865'>      and he publicly offered, not without some mixture of indignation,</a>
<a id='line_866'>      to renounce the government of a church which had been restored,</a>
<a id='line_867'>      and almost created, by his labors. His resignation was accepted</a>
<a id='line_868'>      by the synod, and by the emperor, with more readiness than he</a>
<a id='line_869'>      seems to have expected. At the time when he might have hoped to</a>

<a id='line_901'></a>
<a id='line_902'>      It was not enough that Theodosius had suppressed the insolent</a>

<a id='line_904'>      injuries which the Catholics sustained from the zeal of</a>
<a id='line_905'>      Constantius and Valens. The orthodox emperor considered every</a>
<a id='line_906'>      heretic as a rebel against the supreme powers of heaven and of</a>
<a id='line_907'>      earth; and each of those powers might exercise their peculiar</a>
<a id='line_908'>      jurisdiction over the soul and body of the guilty. The decrees of</a>
<a id='line_909'>      the council of Constantinople had ascertained the true standard</a>
<a id='line_910'>      of the faith; and the ecclesiastics, who governed the conscience</a>
<a id='line_911'>      of Theodosius, suggested the most effectual methods of</a>
<a id='line_912'>      persecution. In the space of fifteen years, he promulgated at</a>
<a id='line_913'>      least fifteen severe edicts against the heretics; 48 more</a>
<a id='line_914'>      especially against those who rejected the doctrine of the</a>
<a id='line_915'>      Trinity; and to deprive them of every hope of escape, he sternly</a>
<a id='line_916'>      enacted, that if any laws or rescripts should be alleged in their</a>
<a id='line_917'>      favor, the judges should consider them as the illegal productions</a>
<a id='line_918'>      either of fraud or forgery. The penal statutes were directed</a>
<a id='line_919'>      against the ministers, the assemblies, and the persons of the</a>
<a id='line_920'>      heretics; and the passions of the legislator were expressed in</a>
<a id='line_921'>      the language of declamation and invective. I. The heretical</a>
<a id='line_922'>      teachers, who usurped the sacred titles of Bishops, or</a>
<a id='line_923'>      Presbyters, were not only excluded from the privileges and</a>
<a id='line_924'>      emoluments so liberally granted to the orthodox clergy, but they</a>
<a id='line_925'>      were exposed to the heavy penalties of exile and confiscation, if</a>
<a id='line_926'>      they presumed to preach the doctrine, or to practise the rites,</a>
<a id='line_927'>      of their accursed sects. A fine of ten pounds of gold (above four</a>
<a id='line_928'>      hundred pounds sterling) was imposed on every person who should</a>
<a id='line_929'>      dare to confer, or receive, or promote, an heretical ordination:</a>
<a id='line_930'>      and it was reasonably expected, that if the race of pastors could</a>
<a id='line_931'>      be extinguished, their helpless flocks would be compelled, by</a>
<a id='line_932'>      ignorance and hunger, to return within the pale of the Catholic</a>
<a id='line_933'>      church. II. The rigorous prohibition of conventicles was</a>
<a id='line_934'>      carefully extended to every possible circumstance, in which the</a>
<a id='line_935'>      heretics could assemble with the intention of worshipping God and</a>
<a id='line_936'>      Christ according to the dictates of their conscience. Their</a>
<a id='line_937'>      religious meetings, whether public or secret, by day or by night,</a>
<a id='line_938'>      in cities or in the country, were equally proscribed by the</a>
<a id='line_939'>      edicts of Theodosius; and the building, or ground, which had been</a>
<a id='line_940'>      used for that illegal purpose, was forfeited to the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_941'>      domain. III. It was supposed, that the error of the heretics</a>
<a id='line_942'>      could proceed only from the obstinate temper of their minds; and</a>
<a id='line_943'>      that such a temper was a fit object of censure and punishment.</a>
<a id='line_944'>      The anathemas of the church were fortified by a sort of civil</a>
<a id='line_945'>      excommunication; which separated them from their fellow-citizens,</a>
<a id='line_946'>      by a peculiar brand of infamy; and this declaration of the</a>
<a id='line_947'>      supreme magistrate tended to justify, or at least to excuse, the</a>
<a id='line_948'>      insults of a fanatic populace. The sectaries were gradually</a>
<a id='line_949'>      disqualified from the possession of honorable or lucrative</a>
<a id='line_950'>      employments; and Theodosius was satisfied with his own justice,</a>
<a id='line_951'>      when he decreed, that, as the Eunomians distinguished the nature</a>
<a id='line_952'>      of the Son from that of the Father, they should be incapable of</a>
<a id='line_953'>      making their wills or of receiving any advantage from</a>
<a id='line_954'>      testamentary donations. The guilt of the Manichaean heresy was</a>
<a id='line_955'>      esteemed of such magnitude, that it could be expiated only by the</a>
<a id='line_956'>      death of the offender; and the same capital punishment was</a>
<a id='line_957'>      inflicted on the Audians, or Quartodecimans, 49 who should dare</a>
<a id='line_958'>      to perpetrate the atrocious crime of celebrating on an improper</a>
<a id='line_959'>      day the festival of Easter. Every Roman might exercise the right</a>

<a id='line_962'>      reign of Theodosius. Yet we are assured, that the execution of</a>
<a id='line_963'>      his penal edicts was seldom enforced; and that the pious emperor</a>

<a id='line_1008'>      the effects of his criminal intercourse with the daughter of</a>
<a id='line_1009'>      Euchrocia had been suppressed, by means still more odious and</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      criminal. But an accurate, or rather a candid, inquiry will</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      discover, that if the Priscillianists violated the laws of</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      nature, it was not by the licentiousness, but by the austerity,</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      of their lives. They absolutely condemned the use of the</a>
<a id='line_1014'>      marriage-bed; and the peace of families was often disturbed by</a>
<a id='line_1015'>      indiscreet separations. They enjoyed, or recommended, a total</a>
<a id='line_1016'>      abstinence from all animal food; and their continual prayers,</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      fasts, and vigils, inculcated a rule of strict and perfect</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      devotion. The speculative tenets of the sect, concerning the</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      person of Christ, and the nature of the human soul, were derived</a>
<a id='line_1020'>      from the Gnostic and Manichaean system; and this vain philosophy,</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      which had been transported from Egypt to Spain, was ill adapted</a>
<a id='line_1022'>      to the grosser spirits of the West. The obscure disciples of</a>
<a id='line_1023'>      Priscillian suffered languished, and gradually disappeared: his</a>
<a id='line_1024'>      tenets were rejected by the clergy and people, but his death was</a>
<a id='line_1025'>      the subject of a long and vehement controversy; while some</a>
<a id='line_1026'>      arraigned, and others applauded, the justice of his sentence. It</a>
<a id='line_1027'>      is with pleasure that we can observe the humane inconsistency of</a>
<a id='line_1028'>      the most illustrious saints and bishops, Ambrose of Milan, 57 and</a>
<a id='line_1029'>      Martin of Tours, 58 who, on this occasion, asserted the cause of</a>
<a id='line_1030'>      toleration. They pitied the unhappy men, who had been executed at</a>
<a id='line_1031'>      Treves; they refused to hold communion with their episcopal</a>
<a id='line_1032'>      murderers; and if Martin deviated from that generous resolution,</a>
<a id='line_1033'>      his motives were laudable, and his repentance was exemplary. The</a>
<a id='line_1034'>      bishops of Tours and Milan pronounced, without hesitation, the</a>
<a id='line_1035'>      eternal damnation of heretics; but they were surprised, and</a>
<a id='line_1036'>      shocked, by the bloody image of their temporal death, and the</a>
<a id='line_1037'>      honest feelings of nature resisted the artificial prejudices of</a>
<a id='line_1038'>      theology. The humanity of Ambrose and Martin was confirmed by the</a>
<a id='line_1039'>      scandalous irregularity of the proceedings against Priscillian</a>
<a id='line_1040'>      and his adherents. The civil and ecclesiastical ministers had</a>
<a id='line_1041'>      transgressed the limits of their respective provinces. The</a>
<a id='line_1042'>      secular judge had presumed to receive an appeal, and to pronounce</a>
<a id='line_1043'>      a definitive sentence, in a matter of faith, and episcopal</a>
<a id='line_1044'>      jurisdiction. The bishops had disgraced themselves, by exercising</a>
<a id='line_1045'>      the functions of accusers in a criminal prosecution. The cruelty</a>
<a id='line_1046'>      of Ithacius, 59 who beheld the tortures, and solicited the death,</a>
<a id='line_1047'>      of the heretics, provoked the just indignation of mankind; and</a>
<a id='line_1048'>      the vices of that profligate bishop were admitted as a proof,</a>
<a id='line_1049'>      that his zeal was instigated by the sordid motives of interest.</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      Since the death of Priscillian, the rude attempts of persecution</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      have been refined and methodized in the holy office, which</a>
<a id='line_1052'>      assigns their distinct parts to the ecclesiastical and secular</a>
<a id='line_1053'>      powers. The devoted victim is regularly delivered by the priest</a>

<a id='line_1113'>      palm of episcopal vigor and ability was justly claimed by the</a>
<a id='line_1114'>      intrepid Ambrose. 61 He was descended from a noble family of</a>
<a id='line_1115'>      Romans; his father had exercised the important office of</a>
<a id='line_1116'>      Prætorian præfect of Gaul; and the son, after passing through</a>

<a id='line_1118'>      gradation of civil honors, the station of consular of Liguria, a</a>
<a id='line_1119'>      province which included the Imperial residence of Milan. At the</a>
<a id='line_1120'>      age of thirty-four, and before he had received the sacrament of</a>
<a id='line_1121'>      baptism, Ambrose, to his own surprise, and to that of the world,</a>

<a id='line_1123'>      Without the least mixture, as it is said, of art or intrigue, the</a>
<a id='line_1124'>      whole body of the people unanimously saluted him with the</a>

<a id='line_1126'>      acclamations were ascribed to a praeternatural impulse; and the</a>

<a id='line_1128'>      office, for which he was not prepared by the habits and</a>
<a id='line_1129'>      occupations of his former life. But the active force of his</a>
<a id='line_1130'>      genius soon qualified him to exercise, with zeal and prudence,</a>
<a id='line_1131'>      the duties of his ecclesiastical jurisdiction; and while he</a>
<a id='line_1132'>      cheerfully renounced the vain and splendid trappings of temporal</a>
<a id='line_1133'>      greatness, he condescended, for the good of the church, to direct</a>
<a id='line_1134'>      the conscience of the emperors, and to control the administration</a>

<a id='line_1174'>      religion; and she proposed to the archbishop, as a moderate and</a>
<a id='line_1175'>      reasonable concession, that he should resign the use of a single</a>
<a id='line_1176'>      church, either in the city or the suburbs of Milan. But the</a>
<a id='line_1177'>      conduct of Ambrose was governed by very different principles. 63</a>
<a id='line_1178'>      The palaces of the earth might indeed belong to Caesar; but the</a>

<a id='line_1182'>      temporal as well as spiritual, were confined to the true</a>
<a id='line_1183'>      believers; and the mind of Ambrose was satisfied, that his own</a>
<a id='line_1184'>      theological opinions were the standard of truth and orthodoxy.</a>
<a id='line_1185'>      The archbishop, who refused to hold any conference, or</a>

<a id='line_1188'>      the impious sacrilege; and Justina, who resented the refusal as</a>
<a id='line_1189'>      an act of insolence and rebellion, hastily determined to exert</a>
<a id='line_1190'>      the Imperial prerogative of her son. As she desired to perform</a>
<a id='line_1191'>      her public devotions on the approaching festival of Easter,</a>
<a id='line_1192'>      Ambrose was ordered to appear before the council. He obeyed the</a>
<a id='line_1193'>      summons with the respect of a faithful subject, but he was</a>
<a id='line_1194'>      followed, without his consent, by an innumerable people; they</a>

<a id='line_1200'>      of the capital. But the promises which Ambrose received and</a>

<a id='line_1206'>      afterwards, the new, Basilica, for the immediate reception of the</a>

<a id='line_1209'>      found necessary to defend them. by a strong guard, from the</a>

<a id='line_1229'>      measures of the court served only to expose the magnitude of the</a>
<a id='line_1230'>      evil. A fine of two hundred pounds of gold was imposed on the</a>

<a id='line_1232'>      signified, in the name of the emperor, to all the officers, and</a>

<a id='line_1257'>      the dispute: and it might be expected from the Arian principles,</a>
<a id='line_1258'>      and barbarous manners, of these foreign mercenaries, that they</a>
<a id='line_1259'>      would not entertain any scruples in the execution of the most</a>
<a id='line_1260'>      sanguinary orders. They were encountered, on the sacred</a>

<a id='line_1263'>      and a master, whether it was to invade the house of God, that</a>
<a id='line_1264'>      they had implored the hospitable protection of the republic. The</a>
<a id='line_1265'>      suspense of the Barbarians allowed some hours for a more</a>

<a id='line_1270'>      Valentinian could never forgive the triumph of Ambrose; and the</a>
<a id='line_1271'>      royal youth uttered a passionate exclamation, that his own</a>

<a id='line_1285'>      to excuse the resistance of the Catholics. By the influence of</a>
<a id='line_1286'>      Justina, an edict of toleration was promulgated in all the</a>
<a id='line_1287'>      provinces which were subject to the court of Milan; the free</a>
<a id='line_1288'>      exercise of their religion was granted to those who professed the</a>

<a id='line_1290'>      should infringe this sacred and salutary constitution, should be</a>
<a id='line_1291'>      capitally punished, as the enemies of the public peace. 65 The</a>
<a id='line_1292'>      character and language of the archbishop of Milan may justify the</a>
<a id='line_1293'>      suspicion, that his conduct soon afforded a reasonable ground, or</a>

<a id='line_1296'>      a law which he strangely represents as a law of blood and</a>
<a id='line_1297'>      tyranny. A sentence of easy and honorable banishment was</a>
<a id='line_1298'>      pronounced, which enjoined Ambrose to depart from Milan without</a>
<a id='line_1299'>      delay; whilst it permitted him to choose the place of his exile,</a>
<a id='line_1300'>      and the number of his companions. But the authority of the</a>
<a id='line_1301'>      saints, who have preached and practised the maxims of passive</a>
<a id='line_1302'>      loyalty, appeared to Ambrose of less moment than the extreme and</a>
<a id='line_1303'>      pressing danger of the church. He boldly refused to obey; and his</a>
<a id='line_1304'>      refusal was supported by the unanimous consent of his faithful</a>
<a id='line_1305'>      people. 66 They guarded by turns the person of their archbishop;</a>
<a id='line_1306'>      the gates of the cathedral and the episcopal palace were strongly</a>
<a id='line_1307'>      secured; and the Imperial troops, who had formed the blockade,</a>
<a id='line_1308'>      were unwilling to risk the attack, of that impregnable fortress.</a>
<a id='line_1309'>      The numerous poor, who had been relieved by the liberality of</a>
<a id='line_1310'>      Ambrose, embraced the fair occasion of signalizing their zeal and</a>
<a id='line_1311'>      gratitude; and as the patience of the multitude might have been</a>
<a id='line_1312'>      exhausted by the length and uniformity of nocturnal vigils, he</a>
<a id='line_1313'>      prudently introduced into the church of Milan the useful</a>
<a id='line_1314'>      institution of a loud and regular psalmody. While he maintained</a>
<a id='line_1315'>      this arduous contest, he was instructed, by a dream, to open the</a>
<a id='line_1316'>      earth in a place where the remains of two martyrs, Gervasius and</a>
<a id='line_1317'>      Protasius, 67 had been deposited above three hundred years.</a>
<a id='line_1318'>      Immediately under the pavement of the church two perfect</a>
<a id='line_1319'>      skeletons were found, 68 with the heads separated from their</a>
<a id='line_1320'>      bodies, and a plentiful effusion of blood. The holy relics were</a>
<a id='line_1321'>      presented, in solemn pomp, to the veneration of the people; and</a>
<a id='line_1322'>      every circumstance of this fortunate discovery was admirably</a>
<a id='line_1323'>      adapted to promote the designs of Ambrose. The bones of the</a>
<a id='line_1324'>      martyrs, their blood, their garments, were supposed to contain a</a>
<a id='line_1325'>      healing power; and the praeternatural influence was communicated</a>
<a id='line_1326'>      to the most distant objects, without losing any part of its</a>
<a id='line_1327'>      original virtue. The extraordinary cure of a blind man, 69 and</a>
<a id='line_1328'>      the reluctant confessions of several daemoniacs, appeared to</a>
<a id='line_1329'>      justify the faith and sanctity of Ambrose; and the truth of those</a>

<a id='line_1386'>      considered his actual forces as the instruments only of his</a>

<a id='line_1388'>      destruction. The wealth which he extorted 72 from the oppressed</a>
<a id='line_1389'>      provinces of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, was employed in levying</a>
<a id='line_1390'>      and maintaining a formidable army of Barbarians, collected, for</a>
<a id='line_1391'>      the most part, from the fiercest nations of Germany. The conquest</a>
<a id='line_1392'>      of Italy was the object of his hopes and preparations: and he</a>
<a id='line_1393'>      secretly meditated the ruin of an innocent youth, whose</a>
<a id='line_1394'>      government was abhorred and despised by his Catholic subjects.</a>
<a id='line_1395'>      But as Maximus wished to occupy, without resistance, the passes</a>
<a id='line_1396'>      of the Alps, he received, with perfidious smiles, Domninus of</a>
<a id='line_1397'>      Syria, the ambassador of Valentinian, and pressed him to accept</a>
<a id='line_1398'>      the aid of a considerable body of troops, for the service of a</a>
<a id='line_1399'>      Pannonian war. The penetration of Ambrose had discovered the</a>
<a id='line_1400'>      snares of an enemy under the professions of friendship; 73 but</a>
<a id='line_1401'>      the Syrian Domninus was corrupted, or deceived, by the liberal</a>
<a id='line_1402'>      favor of the court of Treves; and the council of Milan</a>
<a id='line_1403'>      obstinately rejected the suspicion of danger, with a blind</a>
<a id='line_1404'>      confidence, which was the effect, not of courage, but of fear.</a>
<a id='line_1405'>      The march of the auxiliaries was guided by the ambassador; and</a>
<a id='line_1406'>      they were admitted, without distrust, into the fortresses of the</a>
<a id='line_1407'>      Alps. But the crafty tyrant followed, with hasty and silent</a>
<a id='line_1408'>      footsteps, in the rear; and, as he diligently intercepted all</a>
<a id='line_1409'>      intelligence of his motions, the gleam of armor, and the dust</a>
<a id='line_1410'>      excited by the troops of cavalry, first announced the hostile</a>
<a id='line_1411'>      approach of a stranger to the gates of Milan. In this extremity,</a>
<a id='line_1412'>      Justina and her son might accuse their own imprudence, and the</a>
<a id='line_1413'>      perfidious arts of Maximus; but they wanted time, and force, and</a>
<a id='line_1414'>      resolution, to stand against the Gauls and Germans, either in the</a>
<a id='line_1415'>      field, or within the walls of a large and disaffected city.</a>
<a id='line_1416'>      Flight was their only hope, Aquileia their only refuge; and as</a>
<a id='line_1417'>      Maximus now displayed his genuine character, the brother of</a>
<a id='line_1418'>      Gratian might expect the same fate from the hands of the same</a>
<a id='line_1419'>      assassin. Maximus entered Milan in triumph; and if the wise</a>
<a id='line_1420'>      archbishop refused a dangerous and criminal connection with the</a>
<a id='line_1421'>      usurper, he might indirectly contribute to the success of his</a>
<a id='line_1422'>      arms, by inculcating, from the pulpit, the duty of resignation,</a>
<a id='line_1423'>      rather than that of resistance. 74 The unfortunate Justina</a>
<a id='line_1424'>      reached Aquileia in safety; but she distrusted the strength of</a>
<a id='line_1425'>      the fortifications: she dreaded the event of a siege; and she</a>
<a id='line_1426'>      resolved to implore the protection of the great Theodosius, whose</a>

<a id='line_1456'>      contempt or indifference, as he speedily made a visit to that</a>

<a id='line_1458'>      After the first tender expressions of friendship and sympathy,</a>
<a id='line_1459'>      the pious emperor of the East gently admonished Justina, that the</a>

<a id='line_1461'>      in the next; and that the public profession of the Nicene faith</a>

<a id='line_1463'>      her son, by the satisfaction which it must occasion both on earth</a>
<a id='line_1464'>      and in heaven. The momentous question of peace or war was</a>
<a id='line_1465'>      referred, by Theodosius, to the deliberation of his council; and</a>
<a id='line_1466'>      the arguments which might be alleged on the side of honor and</a>
<a id='line_1467'>      justice, had acquired, since the death of Gratian, a considerable</a>
<a id='line_1468'>      degree of additional weight. The persecution of the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_1469'>      family, to which Theodosius himself had been indebted for his</a>
<a id='line_1470'>      fortune, was now aggravated by recent and repeated injuries.</a>
<a id='line_1471'>      Neither oaths nor treaties could restrain the boundless ambition</a>
<a id='line_1472'>      of Maximus; and the delay of vigorous and decisive measures,</a>
<a id='line_1473'>      instead of prolonging the blessings of peace, would expose the</a>
<a id='line_1474'>      Eastern empire to the danger of a hostile invasion. The</a>
<a id='line_1475'>      Barbarians, who had passed the Danube, had lately assumed the</a>
<a id='line_1476'>      character of soldiers and subjects, but their native fierceness</a>
<a id='line_1477'>      was yet untamed: and the operations of a war, which would</a>
<a id='line_1478'>      exercise their valor, and diminish their numbers, might tend to</a>
<a id='line_1479'>      relieve the provinces from an intolerable oppression.</a>
<a id='line_1480'>      Notwithstanding these specious and solid reasons, which were</a>
<a id='line_1481'>      approved by a majority of the council, Theodosius still hesitated</a>
<a id='line_1482'>      whether he should draw the sword in a contest which could no</a>
<a id='line_1483'>      longer admit any terms of reconciliation; and his magnanimous</a>
<a id='line_1484'>      character was not disgraced by the apprehensions which he felt</a>
<a id='line_1485'>      for the safety of his infant sons, and the welfare of his</a>
<a id='line_1486'>      exhausted people. In this moment of anxious doubt, while the fate</a>
<a id='line_1487'>      of the Roman world depended on the resolution of a single man,</a>
<a id='line_1488'>      the charms of the princess Galla most powerfully pleaded the</a>
<a id='line_1489'>      cause of her brother Valentinian. 75 The heart of Theodosius wa</a>
<a id='line_1490'>      softened by the tears of beauty; his affections were insensibly</a>
<a id='line_1491'>      engaged by the graces of youth and innocence: the art of Justina</a>
<a id='line_1492'>      managed and directed the impulse of passion; and the celebration</a>
<a id='line_1493'>      of the royal nuptials was the assurance and signal of the civil</a>
<a id='line_1494'>      war. The unfeeling critics, who consider every amorous weakness</a>
<a id='line_1495'>      as an indelible stain on the memory of a great and orthodox</a>
<a id='line_1496'>      emperor, are inclined, on this occasion, to dispute the</a>
<a id='line_1497'>      suspicious evidence of the historian Zosimus. For my own part, I</a>
<a id='line_1498'>      shall frankly confess, that I am willing to find, or even to</a>

<a id='line_1502'>      complacency, a gentle hero, who may be supposed to receive his</a>
<a id='line_1503'>      armor from the hands of love. The alliance of the Persian king</a>
<a id='line_1504'>      was secured by the faith of treaties; the martial Barbarians were</a>
<a id='line_1505'>      persuaded to follow the standard, or to respect the frontiers, of</a>
<a id='line_1506'>      an active and liberal monarch; and the dominions of Theodosius,</a>
<a id='line_1507'>      from the Euphrates to the Adriatic, resounded with the</a>
<a id='line_1508'>      preparations of war both by land and sea. The skilful disposition</a>
<a id='line_1509'>      of the forces of the East seemed to multiply their numbers, and</a>
<a id='line_1510'>      distracted the attention of Maximus. He had reason to fear, that</a>
<a id='line_1511'>      a chosen body of troops, under the command of the intrepid</a>

<a id='line_1514'>      the centre of Gaul. A powerful fleet was equipped in the harbors</a>

<a id='line_1543'>      of the West, was easily decided in the term of two months, 76 and</a>
<a id='line_1544'>      within the space of two hundred miles. The superior genius of the</a>
<a id='line_1545'>      emperor of the East might prevail over the feeble Maximus, who,</a>
<a id='line_1546'>      in this important crisis, showed himself destitute of military</a>
<a id='line_1547'>      skill, or personal courage; but the abilities of Theodosius were</a>
<a id='line_1548'>      seconded by the advantage which he possessed of a numerous and</a>
<a id='line_1549'>      active cavalry. The Huns, the Alani, and, after their example,</a>
<a id='line_1550'>      the Goths themselves, were formed into squadrons of archers; who</a>
<a id='line_1551'>      fought on horseback, and confounded the steady valor of the Gauls</a>
<a id='line_1552'>      and Germans, by the rapid motions of a Tartar war. After the</a>
<a id='line_1553'>      fatigue of a long march, in the heat of summer, they spurred</a>
<a id='line_1554'>      their foaming horses into the waters of the Save, swam the river</a>
<a id='line_1555'>      in the presence of the enemy, and instantly charged and routed</a>
<a id='line_1556'>      the troops who guarded the high ground on the opposite side.</a>
<a id='line_1557'>      Marcellinus, the tyrant’s brother, advanced to support them with</a>
<a id='line_1558'>      the select cohorts, which were considered as the hope and</a>
<a id='line_1559'>      strength of the army. The action, which had been interrupted by</a>
<a id='line_1560'>      the approach of night, was renewed in the morning; and, after a</a>
<a id='line_1561'>      sharp conflict, the surviving remnant of the bravest soldiers of</a>
<a id='line_1562'>      Maximus threw down their arms at the feet of the conqueror.</a>
<a id='line_1563'>      Without suspending his march, to receive the loyal acclamations</a>
<a id='line_1564'>      of the citizens of Aemona, Theodosius pressed forwards to</a>
<a id='line_1565'>      terminate the war by the death or captivity of his rival, who</a>
<a id='line_1566'>      fled before him with the diligence of fear. From the summit of</a>
<a id='line_1567'>      the Julian Alps, he descended with such incredible speed into the</a>
<a id='line_1568'>      plain of Italy, that he reached Aquileia on the evening of the</a>
<a id='line_1569'>      first day; and Maximus, who found himself encompassed on all</a>
<a id='line_1570'>      sides, had scarcely time to shut the gates of the city. But the</a>
<a id='line_1571'>      gates could not long resist the effort of a victorious enemy; and</a>
<a id='line_1572'>      the despair, the disaffection, the indifference of the soldiers</a>
<a id='line_1573'>      and people, hastened the downfall of the wretched Maximus. He was</a>
<a id='line_1574'>      dragged from his throne, rudely stripped of the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_1575'>      ornaments, the robe, the diadem, and the purple slippers; and</a>
<a id='line_1576'>      conducted, like a malefactor, to the camp and presence of</a>
<a id='line_1577'>      Theodosius, at a place about three miles from Aquileia. The</a>
<a id='line_1578'>      behavior of the emperor was not intended to insult, and he showed</a>
<a id='line_1579'>      disposition to pity and forgive, the tyrant of the West, who had</a>
<a id='line_1580'>      never been his personal enemy, and was now become the object of</a>
<a id='line_1581'>      his contempt. Our sympathy is the most forcibly excited by the</a>
<a id='line_1582'>      misfortunes to which we are exposed; and the spectacle of a proud</a>
<a id='line_1583'>      competitor, now prostrate at his feet, could not fail of</a>
<a id='line_1584'>      producing very serious and solemn thoughts in the mind of the</a>
<a id='line_1585'>      victorious emperor. But the feeble emotion of involuntary pity</a>
<a id='line_1586'>      was checked by his regard for public justice, and the memory of</a>
<a id='line_1587'>      Gratian; and he abandoned the victim to the pious zeal of the</a>
<a id='line_1588'>      soldiers, who drew him out of the Imperial presence, and</a>
<a id='line_1589'>      instantly separated his head from his body. The intelligence of</a>
<a id='line_1590'>      his defeat and death was received with sincere or well-dissembled</a>

<a id='line_1595'>      with less difficulty and bloodshed than he might naturally</a>

<a id='line_1618'>      subject of a sincere and ample panegyric. The wisdom of his laws,</a>
<a id='line_1619'>      and the success of his arms, rendered his administration</a>
<a id='line_1620'>      respectable in the eyes both of his subjects and of his enemies.</a>
<a id='line_1621'>      He loved and practised the virtues of domestic life, which seldom</a>
<a id='line_1622'>      hold their residence in the palaces of kings. Theodosius was</a>
<a id='line_1623'>      chaste and temperate; he enjoyed, without excess, the sensual and</a>
<a id='line_1624'>      social pleasures of the table; and the warmth of his amorous</a>
<a id='line_1625'>      passions was never diverted from their lawful objects. The proud</a>
<a id='line_1626'>      titles of Imperial greatness were adorned by the tender names of</a>
<a id='line_1627'>      a faithful husband, an indulgent father; his uncle was raised, by</a>
<a id='line_1628'>      his affectionate esteem, to the rank of a second parent:</a>
<a id='line_1629'>      Theodosius embraced, as his own, the children of his brother and</a>
<a id='line_1630'>      sister; and the expressions of his regard were extended to the</a>
<a id='line_1631'>      most distant and obscure branches of his numerous kindred. His</a>
<a id='line_1632'>      familiar friends were judiciously selected from among those</a>
<a id='line_1633'>      persons, who, in the equal intercourse of private life, had</a>
<a id='line_1634'>      appeared before his eyes without a mask; the consciousness of</a>
<a id='line_1635'>      personal and superior merit enabled him to despise the accidental</a>
<a id='line_1636'>      distinction of the purple; and he proved by his conduct, that he</a>
<a id='line_1637'>      had forgotten all the injuries, while he most gratefully</a>
<a id='line_1638'>      remembered all the favors and services, which he had received</a>
<a id='line_1639'>      before he ascended the throne of the Roman empire. The serious or</a>
<a id='line_1640'>      lively tone of his conversation was adapted to the age, the rank,</a>
<a id='line_1641'>      or the character of his subjects, whom he admitted into his</a>
<a id='line_1642'>      society; and the affability of his manners displayed the image of</a>
<a id='line_1643'>      his mind. Theodosius respected the simplicity of the good and</a>
<a id='line_1644'>      virtuous: every art, every talent, of a useful, or even of an</a>
<a id='line_1645'>      innocent nature, was rewarded by his judicious liberality; and,</a>
<a id='line_1646'>      except the heretics, whom he persecuted with implacable hatred,</a>
<a id='line_1647'>      the diffusive circle of his benevolence was circumscribed only by</a>
<a id='line_1648'>      the limits of the human race. The government of a mighty empire</a>
<a id='line_1649'>      may assuredly suffice to occupy the time, and the abilities, of a</a>
<a id='line_1650'>      mortal: yet the diligent prince, without aspiring to the</a>
<a id='line_1651'>      unsuitable reputation of profound learning, always reserved some</a>
<a id='line_1652'>      moments of his leisure for the instructive amusement of reading.</a>
<a id='line_1653'>      History, which enlarged his experience, was his favorite study.</a>
<a id='line_1654'>      The annals of Rome, in the long period of eleven hundred years,</a>
<a id='line_1655'>      presented him with a various and splendid picture of human life:</a>
<a id='line_1656'>      and it has been particularly observed, that whenever he perused</a>
<a id='line_1657'>      the cruel acts of Cinna, of Marius, or of Sylla, he warmly</a>
<a id='line_1658'>      expressed his generous detestation of those enemies of humanity</a>
<a id='line_1659'>      and freedom. His disinterested opinion of past events was</a>
<a id='line_1660'>      usefully applied as the rule of his own actions; and Theodosius</a>
<a id='line_1661'>      has deserved the singular commendation, that his virtues always</a>
<a id='line_1662'>      seemed to expand with his fortune: the season of his prosperity</a>
<a id='line_1663'>      was that of his moderation; and his clemency appeared the most</a>
<a id='line_1664'>      conspicuous after the danger and success of a civil war. The</a>
<a id='line_1665'>      Moorish guards of the tyrant had been massacred in the first heat</a>
<a id='line_1666'>      of the victory, and a small number of the most obnoxious</a>
<a id='line_1667'>      criminals suffered the punishment of the law. But the emperor</a>
<a id='line_1668'>      showed himself much more attentive to relieve the innocent than</a>
<a id='line_1669'>      to chastise the guilty. The oppressed subjects of the West, who</a>
<a id='line_1670'>      would have deemed themselves happy in the restoration of their</a>
<a id='line_1671'>      lands, were astonished to receive a sum of money equivalent to</a>
<a id='line_1672'>      their losses; and the liberality of the conqueror supported the</a>

<a id='line_1749'>      approached of the tenth year of his reign; a festival more</a>
<a id='line_1750'>      grateful to the soldiers, who received a liberal donative, than</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      to the subjects, whose voluntary offerings had been long since</a>
<a id='line_1752'>      converted into an extraordinary and oppressive burden. The edicts</a>
<a id='line_1753'>      of taxation interrupted the repose, and pleasures, of Antioch;</a>
<a id='line_1754'>      and the tribunal of the magistrate was besieged by a suppliant</a>
<a id='line_1755'>      crowd; who, in pathetic, but, at first, in respectful language,</a>
<a id='line_1756'>      solicited the redress of their grievances. They were gradually</a>
<a id='line_1757'>      incensed by the pride of their haughty rulers, who treated their</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      complaints as a criminal resistance; their satirical wit</a>
<a id='line_1759'>      degenerated into sharp and angry invectives; and, from the</a>
<a id='line_1760'>      subordinate powers of government, the invectives of the people</a>
<a id='line_1761'>      insensibly rose to attack the sacred character of the emperor</a>
<a id='line_1762'>      himself. Their fury, provoked by a feeble opposition, discharged</a>
<a id='line_1763'>      itself on the images of the Imperial family, which were erected,</a>
<a id='line_1764'>      as objects of public veneration, in the most conspicuous places</a>
<a id='line_1765'>      of the city. The statues of Theodosius, of his father, of his</a>
<a id='line_1766'>      wife Flaccilla, of his two sons, Arcadius and Honorius, were</a>
<a id='line_1767'>      insolently thrown down from their pedestals, broken in pieces, or</a>
<a id='line_1768'>      dragged with contempt through the streets; and the indignities</a>
<a id='line_1769'>      which were offered to the representations of Imperial majesty,</a>
<a id='line_1770'>      sufficiently declared the impious and treasonable wishes of the</a>
<a id='line_1771'>      populace. The tumult was almost immediately suppressed by the</a>
<a id='line_1772'>      arrival of a body of archers: and Antioch had leisure to reflect</a>
<a id='line_1773'>      on the nature and consequences of her crime. 84 According to the</a>
<a id='line_1774'>      duty of his office, the governor of the province despatched a</a>
<a id='line_1775'>      faithful narrative of the whole transaction: while the trembling</a>
<a id='line_1776'>      citizens intrusted the confession of their crime, and the</a>
<a id='line_1777'>      assurances of their repentance, to the zeal of Flavian, their</a>
<a id='line_1778'>      bishop, and to the eloquence of the senator Hilarius, the friend,</a>
<a id='line_1779'>      and most probably the disciple, of Libanius; whose genius, on</a>
<a id='line_1780'>      this melancholy occasion, was not useless to his country. 85 But</a>
<a id='line_1781'>      the two capitals, Antioch and Constantinople, were separated by</a>
<a id='line_1782'>      the distance of eight hundred miles; and, notwithstanding the</a>
<a id='line_1783'>      diligence of the Imperial posts, the guilty city was severely</a>
<a id='line_1784'>      punished by a long and dreadful interval of suspense. Every rumor</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      agitated the hopes and fears of the Antiochians, and they heard</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      with terror, that their sovereign, exasperated by the insult</a>
<a id='line_1787'>      which had been offered to his own statues, and more especially,</a>
<a id='line_1788'>      to those of his beloved wife, had resolved to level with the</a>
<a id='line_1789'>      ground the offending city; and to massacre, without distinction</a>
<a id='line_1790'>      of age or sex, the criminal inhabitants; 86 many of whom were</a>
<a id='line_1791'>      actually driven, by their apprehensions, to seek a refuge in the</a>
<a id='line_1792'>      mountains of Syria, and the adjacent desert. At length,</a>
<a id='line_1793'>      twenty-four days after the sedition, the general Hellebicus and</a>
<a id='line_1794'>      Caesarius, master of the offices, declared the will of the</a>
<a id='line_1795'>      emperor, and the sentence of Antioch. That proud capital was</a>
<a id='line_1796'>      degraded from the rank of a city; and the metropolis of the East,</a>
<a id='line_1797'>      stripped of its lands, its privileges, and its revenues, was</a>
<a id='line_1798'>      subjected, under the humiliating denomination of a village, to</a>
<a id='line_1799'>      the jurisdiction of Laodicea. 87 The baths, the Circus, and the</a>
<a id='line_1800'>      theatres were shut: and, that every source of plenty and pleasure</a>
<a id='line_1801'>      might at the same time be intercepted, the distribution of corn</a>
<a id='line_1802'>      was abolished, by the severe instructions of Theodosius. His</a>
<a id='line_1803'>      commissioners then proceeded to inquire into the guilt of</a>
<a id='line_1804'>      individuals; of those who had perpetrated, and of those who had</a>
<a id='line_1805'>      not prevented, the destruction of the sacred statues. The</a>
<a id='line_1806'>      tribunal of Hellebicus and Caesarius, encompassed with armed</a>
<a id='line_1807'>      soldiers, was erected in the midst of the Forum. The noblest, and</a>
<a id='line_1808'>      most wealthy, of the citizens of Antioch appeared before them in</a>
<a id='line_1809'>      chains; the examination was assisted by the use of torture, and</a>
<a id='line_1810'>      their sentence was pronounced or suspended, according to the</a>
<a id='line_1811'>      judgment of these extraordinary magistrates. The houses of the</a>
<a id='line_1812'>      criminals were exposed to sale, their wives and children were</a>
<a id='line_1813'>      suddenly reduced, from affluence and luxury, to the most abject</a>
<a id='line_1814'>      distress; and a bloody execution was expected to conclude the</a>
<a id='line_1815'>      horrors of the day, 88 which the preacher of Antioch, the</a>
<a id='line_1816'>      eloquent Chrysostom, has represented as a lively image of the</a>
<a id='line_1817'>      last and universal judgment of the world. But the ministers of</a>
<a id='line_1818'>      Theodosius performed, with reluctance, the cruel task which had</a>
<a id='line_1819'>      been assigned them; they dropped a gentle tear over the</a>
<a id='line_1820'>      calamities of the people; and they listened with reverence to the</a>
<a id='line_1821'>      pressing solicitations of the monks and hermits, who descended in</a>
<a id='line_1822'>      swarms from the mountains. 89 Hellebicus and Caesarius were</a>
<a id='line_1823'>      persuaded to suspend the execution of their sentence; and it was</a>
<a id='line_1824'>      agreed that the former should remain at Antioch, while the latter</a>
<a id='line_1825'>      returned, with all possible speed, to Constantinople; and</a>
<a id='line_1826'>      presumed once more to consult the will of his sovereign. The</a>
<a id='line_1827'>      resentment of Theodosius had already subsided; the deputies of</a>
<a id='line_1828'>      the people, both the bishop and the orator, had obtained a</a>
<a id='line_1829'>      favorable audience; and the reproaches of the emperor were the</a>
<a id='line_1830'>      complaints of injured friendship, rather than the stern menaces</a>
<a id='line_1831'>      of pride and power. A free and general pardon was granted to the</a>
<a id='line_1832'>      city and citizens of Antioch; the prison doors were thrown open;</a>
<a id='line_1833'>      the senators, who despaired of their lives, recovered the</a>
<a id='line_1834'>      possession of their houses and estates; and the capital of the</a>
<a id='line_1835'>      East was restored to the enjoyment of her ancient dignity and</a>
<a id='line_1836'>      splendor. Theodosius condescended to praise the senate of</a>
<a id='line_1837'>      Constantinople, who had generously interceded for their</a>
<a id='line_1838'>      distressed brethren: he rewarded the eloquence of Hilarius with</a>
<a id='line_1839'>      the government of Palestine; and dismissed the bishop of Antioch</a>
<a id='line_1840'>      with the warmest expressions of his respect and gratitude. A</a>
<a id='line_1841'>      thousand new statues arose to the clemency of Theodosius; the</a>
<a id='line_1842'>      applause of his subjects was ratified by the approbation of his</a>
<a id='line_1843'>      own heart; and the emperor confessed, that, if the exercise of</a>
<a id='line_1844'>      justice is the most important duty, the indulgence of mercy is</a>
<a id='line_1845'>      the most exquisite pleasure, of a sovereign. 90</a>

<a id='line_1887'>      The sedition of Thessalonica is ascribed to a more shameful</a>

<a id='line_1889'>      That great city, the metropolis of all the Illyrian provinces,</a>
<a id='line_1890'>      had been protected from the dangers of the Gothic war by strong</a>
<a id='line_1891'>      fortifications and a numerous garrison. Botheric, the general of</a>
<a id='line_1892'>      those troops, and, as it should seem from his name, a Barbarian,</a>
<a id='line_1893'>      had among his slaves a beautiful boy, who excited the impure</a>
<a id='line_1894'>      desires of one of the charioteers of the Circus. The insolent and</a>
<a id='line_1895'>      brutal lover was thrown into prison by the order of Botheric; and</a>
<a id='line_1896'>      he sternly rejected the importunate clamors of the multitude,</a>
<a id='line_1897'>      who, on the day of the public games, lamented the absence of</a>
<a id='line_1898'>      their favorite; and considered the skill of a charioteer as an</a>
<a id='line_1899'>      object of more importance than his virtue. The resentment of the</a>
<a id='line_1900'>      people was imbittered by some previous disputes; and, as the</a>
<a id='line_1901'>      strength of the garrison had been drawn away for the service of</a>
<a id='line_1902'>      the Italian war, the feeble remnant, whose numbers were reduced</a>
<a id='line_1903'>      by desertion, could not save the unhappy general from their</a>
<a id='line_1904'>      licentious fury. Botheric, and several of his principal officers,</a>
<a id='line_1905'>      were inhumanly murdered; their mangled bodies were dragged about</a>
<a id='line_1906'>      the streets; and the emperor, who then resided at Milan, was</a>
<a id='line_1907'>      surprised by the intelligence of the audacious and wanton cruelty</a>
<a id='line_1908'>      of the people of Thessalonica. The sentence of a dispassionate</a>
<a id='line_1909'>      judge would have inflicted a severe punishment on the authors of</a>
<a id='line_1910'>      the crime; and the merit of Botheric might contribute to</a>
<a id='line_1911'>      exasperate the grief and indignation of his master.</a>
<a id='line_1912'></a>
<a id='line_1913'>      The fiery and choleric temper of Theodosius was impatient of the</a>
<a id='line_1914'>      dilatory forms of a judicial inquiry; and he hastily resolved,</a>
<a id='line_1915'>      that the blood of his lieutenant should be expiated by the blood</a>
<a id='line_1916'>      of the guilty people. Yet his mind still fluctuated between the</a>
<a id='line_1917'>      counsels of clemency and of revenge; the zeal of the bishops had</a>
<a id='line_1918'>      almost extorted from the reluctant emperor the promise of a</a>
<a id='line_1919'>      general pardon; his passion was again inflamed by the flattering</a>
<a id='line_1920'>      suggestions of his minister Rufinus; and, after Theodosius had</a>
<a id='line_1921'>      despatched the messengers of death, he attempted, when it was too</a>
<a id='line_1922'>      late, to prevent the execution of his orders. The punishment of a</a>
<a id='line_1923'>      Roman city was blindly committed to the undistinguishing sword of</a>
<a id='line_1924'>      the Barbarians; and the hostile preparations were concerted with</a>
<a id='line_1925'>      the dark and perfidious artifice of an illegal conspiracy. The</a>
<a id='line_1926'>      people of Thessalonica were treacherously invited, in the name of</a>
<a id='line_1927'>      their sovereign, to the games of the Circus; and such was their</a>
<a id='line_1928'>      insatiate avidity for those amusements, that every consideration</a>
<a id='line_1929'>      of fear, or suspicion, was disregarded by the numerous</a>
<a id='line_1930'>      spectators. As soon as the assembly was complete, the soldiers,</a>
<a id='line_1931'>      who had secretly been posted round the Circus, received the</a>
<a id='line_1932'>      signal, not of the races, but of a general massacre. The</a>
<a id='line_1933'>      promiscuous carnage continued three hours, without discrimination</a>
<a id='line_1934'>      of strangers or natives, of age or sex, of innocence or guilt;</a>
<a id='line_1935'>      the most moderate accounts state the number of the slain at seven</a>
<a id='line_1936'>      thousand; and it is affirmed by some writers that more than</a>
<a id='line_1937'>      fifteen thousand victims were sacrificed to the names of</a>
<a id='line_1938'>      Botheric. A foreign merchant, who had probably no concern in his</a>
<a id='line_1939'>      murder, offered his own life, and all his wealth, to supply the</a>
<a id='line_1940'>      place of one of his two sons; but, while the father hesitated</a>
<a id='line_1941'>      with equal tenderness, while he was doubtful to choose, and</a>
<a id='line_1942'>      unwilling to condemn, the soldiers determined his suspense, by</a>
<a id='line_1943'>      plunging their daggers at the same moment into the breasts of the</a>
<a id='line_1944'>      defenceless youths. The apology of the assassins, that they were</a>
<a id='line_1945'>      obliged to produce the prescribed number of heads, serves only to</a>
<a id='line_1946'>      increase, by an appearance of order and design, the horrors of</a>
<a id='line_1947'>      the massacre, which was executed by the commands of Theodosius.</a>
<a id='line_1948'>      The guilt of the emperor is aggravated by his long and frequent</a>
<a id='line_1949'>      residence at Thessalonica. The situation of the unfortunate city,</a>
<a id='line_1950'>      the aspect of the streets and buildings, the dress and faces of</a>
<a id='line_1951'>      the inhabitants, were familiar, and even present, to his</a>
<a id='line_1952'>      imagination; and Theodosius possessed a quick and lively sense of</a>
<a id='line_1953'>      the existence of the people whom he destroyed. 91</a>

<a id='line_2027'>      represented, in a private letter, the enormity of the crime;</a>

<a id='line_2035'>      Christ, or to receive the holy eucharist with those hands that</a>
<a id='line_2036'>      were still polluted with the blood of an innocent people. The</a>
<a id='line_2037'>      emperor was deeply affected by his own reproaches, and by those</a>
<a id='line_2038'>      of his spiritual father; and after he had bewailed the</a>
<a id='line_2039'>      mischievous and irreparable consequences of his rash fury, he</a>
<a id='line_2040'>      proceeded, in the accustomed manner, to perform his devotions in</a>
<a id='line_2041'>      the great church of Milan. He was stopped in the porch by the</a>
<a id='line_2042'>      archbishop; who, in the tone and language of an ambassador of</a>
<a id='line_2043'>      Heaven, declared to his sovereign, that private contrition was</a>
<a id='line_2044'>      not sufficient to atone for a public fault, or to appease the</a>
<a id='line_2045'>      justice of the offended Deity. Theodosius humbly represented,</a>
<a id='line_2046'>      that if he had contracted the guilt of homicide, David, the man</a>
<a id='line_2047'>      after God’s own heart, had been guilty, not only of murder, but</a>
<a id='line_2048'>      of adultery. “You have imitated David in his crime, imitate then</a>
<a id='line_2049'>      his repentance,” was the reply of the undaunted Ambrose. The</a>
<a id='line_2050'>      rigorous conditions of peace and pardon were accepted; and the</a>
<a id='line_2051'>      public penance of the emperor Theodosius has been recorded as one</a>
<a id='line_2052'>      of the most honorable events in the annals of the church.</a>
<a id='line_2053'>      According to the mildest rules of ecclesiastical discipline,</a>
<a id='line_2054'>      which were established in the fourth century, the crime of</a>
<a id='line_2055'>      homicide was expiated by the penitence of twenty years: 97 and as</a>
<a id='line_2056'>      it was impossible, in the period of human life, to purge the</a>
<a id='line_2057'>      accumulated guilt of the massacre of Thessalonica, the murderer</a>
<a id='line_2058'>      should have been excluded from the holy communion till the hour</a>
<a id='line_2059'>      of his death. But the archbishop, consulting the maxims of</a>
<a id='line_2060'>      religious policy, granted some indulgence to the rank of his</a>
<a id='line_2061'>      illustrious penitent, who humbled in the dust the pride of the</a>
<a id='line_2062'>      diadem; and the public edification might be admitted as a weighty</a>
<a id='line_2063'>      reason to abridge the duration of his punishment. It was</a>
<a id='line_2064'>      sufficient, that the emperor of the Romans, stripped of the</a>
<a id='line_2065'>      ensigns of royalty, should appear in a mournful and suppliant</a>
<a id='line_2066'>      posture; and that, in the midst of the church of Milan, he should</a>
<a id='line_2067'>      humbly solicit, with sighs and tears, the pardon of his sins. 98</a>
<a id='line_2068'>      In this spiritual cure, Ambrose employed the various methods of</a>
<a id='line_2069'>      mildness and severity. After a delay of about eight months,</a>
<a id='line_2070'>      Theodosius was restored to the communion of the faithful; and the</a>
<a id='line_2071'>      edict which interposes a salutary interval of thirty days between</a>

<a id='line_2073'>      fruits of his repentance. 99 Posterity has applauded the virtuous</a>
<a id='line_2074'>      firmness of the archbishop; and the example of Theodosius may</a>
<a id='line_2075'>      prove the beneficial influence of those principles, which could</a>

<a id='line_2124'></a>
<a id='line_2125'>      After the defeat and death of the tyrant of Gaul, the Roman world</a>
<a id='line_2126'>      was in the possession of Theodosius. He derived from the choice</a>
<a id='line_2127'>      of Gratian his honorable title to the provinces of the East: he</a>
<a id='line_2128'>      had acquired the West by the right of conquest; and the three</a>
<a id='line_2129'>      years which he spent in Italy were usefully employed to restore</a>
<a id='line_2130'>      the authority of the laws, and to correct the abuses which had</a>
<a id='line_2131'>      prevailed with impunity under the usurpation of Maximus, and the</a>
<a id='line_2132'>      minority of Valentinian. The name of Valentinian was regularly</a>
<a id='line_2133'>      inserted in the public acts: but the tender age, and doubtful</a>
<a id='line_2134'>      faith, of the son of Justina, appeared to require the prudent</a>
<a id='line_2135'>      care of an orthodox guardian; and his specious ambition might</a>
<a id='line_2136'>      have excluded the unfortunate youth, without a struggle, and</a>
<a id='line_2137'>      almost without a murmur, from the administration, and even from</a>
<a id='line_2138'>      the inheritance, of the empire. If Theodosius had consulted the</a>
<a id='line_2139'>      rigid maxims of interest and policy, his conduct would have been</a>
<a id='line_2140'>      justified by his friends; but the generosity of his behavior on</a>
<a id='line_2141'>      this memorable occasion has extorted the applause of his most</a>
<a id='line_2142'>      inveterate enemies. He seated Valentinian on the throne of Milan;</a>
<a id='line_2143'>      and, without stipulating any present or future advantages,</a>
<a id='line_2144'>      restored him to the absolute dominion of all the provinces, from</a>
<a id='line_2145'>      which he had been driven by the arms of Maximus. To the</a>
<a id='line_2146'>      restitution of his ample patrimony, Theodosius added the free and</a>
<a id='line_2147'>      generous gift of the countries beyond the Alps, which his</a>

<a id='line_2152'>      in the peaceful possession of the East, insensibly relapsed into</a>
<a id='line_2153'>      his former habits of luxury and indolence. Theodosius discharged</a>
<a id='line_2154'>      his obligation to the brother, he indulged his conjugal</a>
<a id='line_2155'>      tenderness to the sister, of Valentinian; and posterity, which</a>

<a id='line_2166'>      pernicious attachment to the Arian sect, which Valentinian had</a>
<a id='line_2167'>      imbibed from her example and instructions, was soon erased by the</a>
<a id='line_2168'>      lessons of a more orthodox education. His growing zeal for the</a>
<a id='line_2169'>      faith of Nice, and his filial reverence for the character and</a>
<a id='line_2170'>      authority of Ambrose, disposed the Catholics to entertain the</a>
<a id='line_2171'>      most favorable opinion of the virtues of the young emperor of the</a>
<a id='line_2172'>      West. 103 They applauded his chastity and temperance, his</a>
<a id='line_2173'>      contempt of pleasure, his application to business, and his tender</a>
<a id='line_2174'>      affection for his two sisters; which could not, however, seduce</a>
<a id='line_2175'>      his impartial equity to pronounce an unjust sentence against the</a>
<a id='line_2176'>      meanest of his subjects. But this amiable youth, before he had</a>
<a id='line_2177'>      accomplished the twentieth year of his age, was oppressed by</a>
<a id='line_2178'>      domestic treason; and the empire was again involved in the</a>
<a id='line_2179'>      horrors of a civil war. Arbogastes, 104 a gallant soldier of the</a>
<a id='line_2180'>      nation of the Franks, held the second rank in the service of</a>
<a id='line_2181'>      Gratian. On the death of his master he joined the standard of</a>
<a id='line_2182'>      Theodosius; contributed, by his valor and military conduct, to</a>
<a id='line_2183'>      the destruction of the tyrant; and was appointed, after the</a>
<a id='line_2184'>      victory, master-general of the armies of Gaul. His real merit,</a>
<a id='line_2185'>      and apparent fidelity, had gained the confidence both of the</a>
<a id='line_2186'>      prince and people; his boundless liberality corrupted the</a>
<a id='line_2187'>      allegiance of the troops; and, whilst he was universally esteemed</a>
<a id='line_2188'>      as the pillar of the state, the bold and crafty Barbarian was</a>
<a id='line_2189'>      secretly determined either to rule, or to ruin, the empire of the</a>
<a id='line_2190'>      West. The important commands of the army were distributed among</a>
<a id='line_2191'>      the Franks; the creatures of Arbogastes were promoted to all the</a>
<a id='line_2192'>      honors and offices of the civil government; the progress of the</a>
<a id='line_2193'>      conspiracy removed every faithful servant from the presence of</a>
<a id='line_2194'>      Valentinian; and the emperor, without power and without</a>
<a id='line_2195'>      intelligence, insensibly sunk into the precarious and dependent</a>
<a id='line_2196'>      condition of a captive. 105 The indignation which he expressed,</a>
<a id='line_2197'>      though it might arise only from the rash and impatient temper of</a>
<a id='line_2198'>      youth, may be candidly ascribed to the generous spirit of a</a>
<a id='line_2199'>      prince, who felt that he was not unworthy to reign. He secretly</a>
<a id='line_2200'>      invited the archbishop of Milan to undertake the office of a</a>
<a id='line_2201'>      mediator; as the pledge of his sincerity, and the guardian of his</a>
<a id='line_2202'>      safety. He contrived to apprise the emperor of the East of his</a>
<a id='line_2203'>      helpless situation, and he declared, that, unless Theodosius</a>
<a id='line_2204'>      could speedily march to his assistance, he must attempt to escape</a>
<a id='line_2205'>      from the palace, or rather prison, of Vienna in Gaul, where he</a>
<a id='line_2206'>      had imprudently fixed his residence in the midst of the hostile</a>
<a id='line_2207'>      faction. But the hopes of relief were distant, and doubtful: and,</a>
<a id='line_2208'>      as every day furnished some new provocation, the emperor, without</a>
<a id='line_2209'>      strength or counsel, too hastily resolved to risk an immediate</a>
<a id='line_2210'>      contest with his powerful general. He received Arbogastes on the</a>
<a id='line_2211'>      throne; and, as the count approached with some appearance of</a>
<a id='line_2212'>      respect, delivered to him a paper, which dismissed him from all</a>
<a id='line_2213'>      his employments. “My authority,” replied Arbogastes, with</a>
<a id='line_2214'>      insulting coolness, “does not depend on the smile or the frown of</a>
<a id='line_2215'>      a monarch;” and he contemptuously threw the paper on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_2216'>      The indignant monarch snatched at the sword of one of the guards,</a>
<a id='line_2217'>      which he struggled to draw from its scabbard; and it was not</a>
<a id='line_2218'>      without some degree of violence that he was prevented from using</a>
<a id='line_2219'>      the deadly weapon against his enemy, or against himself. A few</a>
<a id='line_2220'>      days after this extraordinary quarrel, in which he had exposed</a>
<a id='line_2221'>      his resentment and his weakness, the unfortunate Valentinian was</a>

<a id='line_2223'>      disguise the manifest guilt of Arbogastes, and to persuade the</a>
<a id='line_2224'>      world, that the death of the young emperor had been the voluntary</a>
<a id='line_2225'>      effect of his own despair. 106 His body was conducted with decent</a>

<a id='line_2396'>      This narrow theatre of the war, circumscribed by the Alps and the</a>

<a id='line_2398'>      skill; the spirit of Arbogastes would have disdained a pardon;</a>
<a id='line_2399'>      his guilt extinguished the hope of a negotiation; and Theodosius</a>
<a id='line_2400'>      was impatient to satisfy his glory and revenge, by the</a>
<a id='line_2401'>      chastisement of the assassins of Valentinian. Without weighing</a>
<a id='line_2402'>      the natural and artificial obstacles that opposed his efforts,</a>
<a id='line_2403'>      the emperor of the East immediately attacked the fortifications</a>
<a id='line_2404'>      of his rivals, assigned the post of honorable danger to the</a>
<a id='line_2405'>      Goths, and cherished a secret wish, that the bloody conflict</a>
<a id='line_2406'>      might diminish the pride and numbers of the conquerors. Ten</a>
<a id='line_2407'>      thousand of those auxiliaries, and Bacurius, general of the</a>
<a id='line_2408'>      Iberians, died bravely on the field of battle. But the victory</a>
<a id='line_2409'>      was not purchased by their blood; the Gauls maintained their</a>
<a id='line_2410'>      advantage; and the approach of night protected the disorderly</a>
<a id='line_2411'>      flight, or retreat, of the troops of Theodosius. The emperor</a>
<a id='line_2412'>      retired to the adjacent hills; where he passed a disconsolate</a>
<a id='line_2413'>      night, without sleep, without provisions, and without hopes; 119</a>
<a id='line_2414'>      except that strong assurance, which, under the most desperate</a>
<a id='line_2415'>      circumstances, the independent mind may derive from the contempt</a>
<a id='line_2416'>      of fortune and of life. The triumph of Eugenius was celebrated by</a>
<a id='line_2417'>      the insolent and dissolute joy of his camp; whilst the active and</a>
<a id='line_2418'>      vigilant Arbogastes secretly detached a considerable body of</a>
<a id='line_2419'>      troops to occupy the passes of the mountains, and to encompass</a>
<a id='line_2420'>      the rear of the Eastern army. The dawn of day discovered to the</a>
<a id='line_2421'>      eyes of Theodosius the extent and the extremity of his danger;</a>
<a id='line_2422'>      but his apprehensions were soon dispelled, by a friendly message</a>
<a id='line_2423'>      from the leaders of those troops who expressed their inclination</a>
<a id='line_2424'>      to desert the standard of the tyrant. The honorable and lucrative</a>
<a id='line_2425'>      rewards, which they stipulated as the price of their perfidy,</a>
<a id='line_2426'>      were granted without hesitation; and as ink and paper could not</a>
<a id='line_2427'>      easily be procured, the emperor subscribed, on his own tablets,</a>
<a id='line_2428'>      the ratification of the treaty. The spirit of his soldiers was</a>
<a id='line_2429'>      revived by this seasonable reenforcement; and they again marched,</a>
<a id='line_2430'>      with confidence, to surprise the camp of a tyrant, whose</a>
<a id='line_2431'>      principal officers appeared to distrust, either the justice or</a>
<a id='line_2432'>      the success of his arms. In the heat of the battle, a violent</a>
<a id='line_2433'>      tempest, 120 such as is often felt among the Alps, suddenly arose</a>
<a id='line_2434'>      from the East. The army of Theodosius was sheltered by their</a>
<a id='line_2435'>      position from the impetuosity of the wind, which blew a cloud of</a>
<a id='line_2436'>      dust in the faces of the enemy, disordered their ranks, wrested</a>
<a id='line_2437'>      their weapons from their hands, and diverted, or repelled, their</a>
<a id='line_2438'>      ineffectual javelins. This accidental advantage was skilfully</a>
<a id='line_2439'>      improved, the violence of the storm was magnified by the</a>
<a id='line_2440'>      superstitious terrors of the Gauls; and they yielded without</a>
<a id='line_2441'>      shame to the invisible powers of heaven, who seemed to militate</a>
<a id='line_2442'>      on the side of the pious emperor. His victory was decisive; and</a>
<a id='line_2443'>      the deaths of his two rivals were distinguished only by the</a>
<a id='line_2444'>      difference of their characters. The rhetorician Eugenius, who had</a>
<a id='line_2445'>      almost acquired the dominion of the world, was reduced to implore</a>
<a id='line_2446'>      the mercy of the conqueror; and the unrelenting soldiers</a>
<a id='line_2447'>      separated his head from his body as he lay prostrate at the feet</a>
<a id='line_2448'>      of Theodosius. Arbogastes, after the loss of a battle, in which</a>
<a id='line_2449'>      he had discharged the duties of a soldier and a general, wandered</a>
<a id='line_2450'>      several days among the mountains. But when he was convinced that</a>
<a id='line_2451'>      his cause was desperate, and his escape impracticable, the</a>
<a id='line_2452'>      intrepid Barbarian imitated the example of the ancient Romans,</a>
<a id='line_2453'>      and turned his sword against his own breast. The fate of the</a>
<a id='line_2454'>      empire was determined in a narrow corner of Italy; and the</a>
<a id='line_2455'>      legitimate successor of the house of Valentinian embraced the</a>
<a id='line_2456'>      archbishop of Milan, and graciously received the submission of</a>
<a id='line_2457'>      the provinces of the West. Those provinces were involved in the</a>
<a id='line_2458'>      guilt of rebellion; while the inflexible courage of Ambrose alone</a>
<a id='line_2459'>      had resisted the claims of successful usurpation. With a manly</a>
<a id='line_2460'>      freedom, which might have been fatal to any other subject, the</a>

<a id='line_2630'>      laying aside both their cuirasses and their helmets. The heavy</a>
<a id='line_2631'>      weapons of their ancestors, the short sword, and the formidable</a>
<a id='line_2632'>      pilum, which had subdued the world, insensibly dropped from their</a>
<a id='line_2633'>      feeble hands. As the use of the shield is incompatible with that</a>
<a id='line_2634'>      of the bow, they reluctantly marched into the field; condemned to</a>
