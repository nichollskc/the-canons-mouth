<a id='line_6'>     Solitude Of The Greeks.</a>
<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>      A ray of historic light seems to beam from the darkness of the</a>
<a id='line_9'>      tenth century. We open with curiosity and respect the royal</a>
<a id='line_10'>      volumes of Constantine Porphyrogenitus, 1 which he composed at a</a>
<a id='line_11'>      mature age for the instruction of his son, and which promise to</a>
<a id='line_12'>      unfold the state of the eastern empire, both in peace and war,</a>
<a id='line_13'>      both at home and abroad. In the first of these works he minutely</a>
<a id='line_14'>      describes the pompous ceremonies of the church and palace of</a>
<a id='line_15'>      Constantinople, according to his own practice, and that of his</a>
<a id='line_16'>      predecessors. 2 In the second, he attempts an accurate survey of</a>
<a id='line_17'>      the provinces, the themes, as they were then denominated, both of</a>
<a id='line_18'>      Europe and Asia. 3 The system of Roman tactics, the discipline</a>
<a id='line_19'>      and order of the troops, and the military operations by land and</a>
<a id='line_20'>      sea, are explained in the third of these didactic collections,</a>
<a id='line_21'>      which may be ascribed to Constantine or his father Leo. 4 In the</a>
<a id='line_22'>      fourth, of the administration of the empire, he reveals the</a>
<a id='line_23'>      secrets of the Byzantine policy, in friendly or hostile</a>
<a id='line_24'>      intercourse with the nations of the earth. The literary labors of</a>
<a id='line_25'>      the age, the practical systems of law, agriculture, and history,</a>
<a id='line_26'>      might redound to the benefit of the subject and the honor of the</a>
<a id='line_27'>      Macedonian princes. The sixty books of the Basilics, 5 the code</a>
<a id='line_28'>      and pandects of civil jurisprudence, were gradually framed in the</a>
<a id='line_29'>      three first reigns of that prosperous dynasty. The art of</a>
<a id='line_30'>      agriculture had amused the leisure, and exercised the pens, of</a>
<a id='line_31'>      the best and wisest of the ancients; and their chosen precepts</a>
<a id='line_32'>      are comprised in the twenty books of the Geoponics 6 of</a>
<a id='line_33'>      Constantine. At his command, the historical examples of vice and</a>
<a id='line_34'>      virtue were methodized in fifty-three books, 7 and every citizen</a>
<a id='line_35'>      might apply, to his contemporaries or himself, the lesson or the</a>
<a id='line_36'>      warning of past times. From the august character of a legislator,</a>
<a id='line_37'>      the sovereign of the East descends to the more humble office of a</a>
<a id='line_38'>      teacher and a scribe; and if his successors and subjects were</a>
<a id='line_39'>      regardless of his paternal cares, we may inherit and enjoy the</a>
<a id='line_40'>      everlasting legacy.</a>

<a id='line_100'>      A closer survey will indeed reduce the value of the gift, and the</a>
<a id='line_101'>      gratitude of posterity: in the possession of these Imperial</a>
<a id='line_102'>      treasures we may still deplore our poverty and ignorance; and the</a>
<a id='line_103'>      fading glories of their authors will be obliterated by</a>
<a id='line_104'>      indifference or contempt. The Basilics will sink to a broken</a>
<a id='line_105'>      copy, a partial and mutilated version, in the Greek language, of</a>
<a id='line_106'>      the laws of Justinian; but the sense of the old civilians is</a>
<a id='line_107'>      often superseded by the influence of bigotry: and the absolute</a>
<a id='line_108'>      prohibition of divorce, concubinage, and interest for money,</a>
<a id='line_109'>      enslaves the freedom of trade and the happiness of private life.</a>
<a id='line_110'>      In the historical book, a subject of Constantine might admire the</a>
<a id='line_111'>      inimitable virtues of Greece and Rome: he might learn to what a</a>
<a id='line_112'>      pitch of energy and elevation the human character had formerly</a>
<a id='line_113'>      aspired. But a contrary effect must have been produced by a new</a>
<a id='line_114'>      edition of the lives of the saints, which the great logothete, or</a>
<a id='line_115'>      chancellor of the empire, was directed to prepare; and the dark</a>
<a id='line_116'>      fund of superstition was enriched by the fabulous and florid</a>
<a id='line_117'>      legends of Simon the Metaphrast. 8 The merits and miracles of the</a>
<a id='line_118'>      whole calendar are of less account in the eyes of a sage, than</a>
<a id='line_119'>      the toil of a single husbandman, who multiplies the gifts of the</a>
<a id='line_120'>      Creator, and supplies the food of his brethren. Yet the royal</a>
<a id='line_121'>      authors of the Geoponics were more seriously employed in</a>
<a id='line_122'>      expounding the precepts of the destroying art, which had been</a>
<a id='line_123'>      taught since the days of Xenophon, 9 as the art of heroes and</a>
<a id='line_124'>      kings. But the Tactics of Leo and Constantine are mingled with</a>
<a id='line_125'>      the baser alloy of the age in which they lived. It was destitute</a>
<a id='line_126'>      of original genius; they implicitly transcribe the rules and</a>
<a id='line_127'>      maxims which had been confirmed by victories. It was unskilled in</a>
<a id='line_128'>      the propriety of style and method; they blindly confound the most</a>
<a id='line_129'>      distant and discordant institutions, the phalanx of Sparta and</a>
<a id='line_130'>      that of Macedon, the legions of Cato and Trajan, of Augustus and</a>
<a id='line_131'>      Theodosius. Even the use, or at least the importance, of these</a>
<a id='line_132'>      military rudiments may be fairly questioned: their general theory</a>
<a id='line_133'>      is dictated by reason; but the merit, as well as difficulty,</a>
<a id='line_134'>      consists in the application. The discipline of a soldier is</a>
<a id='line_135'>      formed by exercise rather than by study: the talents of a</a>
<a id='line_136'>      commander are appropriated to those calm, though rapid, minds,</a>
<a id='line_137'>      which nature produces to decide the fate of armies and nations:</a>
<a id='line_138'>      the former is the habit of a life, the latter the glance of a</a>
<a id='line_139'>      moment; and the battles won by lessons of tactics may be numbered</a>
<a id='line_140'>      with the epic poems created from the rules of criticism. The book</a>
<a id='line_141'>      of ceremonies is a recital, tedious yet imperfect, of the</a>
<a id='line_142'>      despicable pageantry which had infected the church and state</a>
<a id='line_143'>      since the gradual decay of the purity of the one and the power of</a>
<a id='line_144'>      the other. A review of the themes or provinces might promise such</a>
<a id='line_145'>      authentic and useful information, as the curiosity of government</a>
<a id='line_146'>      only can obtain, instead of traditionary fables on the origin of</a>
<a id='line_147'>      the cities, and malicious epigrams on the vices of their</a>
<a id='line_148'>      inhabitants. 10 Such information the historian would have been</a>
<a id='line_149'>      pleased to record; nor should his silence be condemned if the</a>
<a id='line_150'>      most interesting objects, the population of the capital and</a>
<a id='line_151'>      provinces, the amount of the taxes and revenues, the numbers of</a>
<a id='line_152'>      subjects and strangers who served under the Imperial standard,</a>
<a id='line_153'>      have been unnoticed by Leo the philosopher, and his son</a>
<a id='line_154'>      Constantine. His treatise of the public administration is stained</a>
<a id='line_155'>      with the same blemishes; yet it is discriminated by peculiar</a>
<a id='line_156'>      merit; the antiquities of the nations may be doubtful or</a>
<a id='line_157'>      fabulous; but the geography and manners of the Barbaric world are</a>
<a id='line_158'>      delineated with curious accuracy. Of these nations, the Franks</a>
<a id='line_159'>      alone were qualified to observe in their turn, and to describe,</a>
<a id='line_160'>      the metropolis of the East. The ambassador of the great Otho, a</a>
<a id='line_161'>      bishop of Cremona, has painted the state of Constantinople about</a>
<a id='line_162'>      the middle of the tenth century: his style is glowing, his</a>
<a id='line_163'>      narrative lively, his observation keen; and even the prejudices</a>
<a id='line_164'>      and passions of Liutprand are stamped with an original character</a>
<a id='line_165'>      of freedom and genius. 11 From this scanty fund of foreign and</a>
<a id='line_166'>      domestic materials, I shall investigate the form and substance of</a>
<a id='line_167'>      the Byzantine empire; the provinces and wealth, the civil</a>
<a id='line_168'>      government and military force, the character and literature, of</a>
<a id='line_169'>      the Greeks in a period of six hundred years, from the reign of</a>
<a id='line_170'>      Heraclius to his successful invasion of the Franks or Latins.</a>

<a id='line_174'>      biographer of the saints indulged himself in a loose paraphrase</a>
<a id='line_175'>      of the sense or nonsense of more ancient acts. His Greek rhetoric</a>
<a id='line_176'>      is again paraphrased in the Latin version of Surius, and scarcely</a>
<a id='line_177'>      a thread can be now visible of the original texture.]</a>

<a id='line_206'>      After the final division between the sons of Theodosius, the</a>
<a id='line_207'>      swarms of Barbarians from Scythia and Germany over-spread the</a>
<a id='line_208'>      provinces and extinguished the empire of ancient Rome. The</a>
<a id='line_209'>      weakness of Constantinople was concealed by extent of dominion:</a>
<a id='line_210'>      her limits were inviolate, or at least entire; and the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_211'>      Justinian was enlarged by the splendid acquisition of Africa and</a>
<a id='line_212'>      Italy. But the possession of these new conquests was transient</a>
<a id='line_213'>      and precarious; and almost a moiety of the Eastern empire was</a>
<a id='line_214'>      torn away by the arms of the Saracens. Syria and Egypt were</a>
<a id='line_215'>      oppressed by the Arabian caliphs; and, after the reduction of</a>
<a id='line_216'>      Africa, their lieutenants invaded and subdued the Roman province</a>
<a id='line_217'>      which had been changed into the Gothic monarchy of Spain. The</a>
<a id='line_218'>      islands of the Mediterranean were not inaccessible to their naval</a>
<a id='line_219'>      powers; and it was from their extreme stations, the harbors of</a>
<a id='line_220'>      Crete and the fortresses of Cilicia, that the faithful or rebel</a>
<a id='line_221'>      emirs insulted the majesty of the throne and capital. The</a>
<a id='line_222'>      remaining provinces, under the obedience of the emperors, were</a>
<a id='line_223'>      cast into a new mould; and the jurisdiction of the presidents,</a>
<a id='line_224'>      the consulars, and the counts were superseded by the institution</a>
<a id='line_225'>      of the themes, 12 or military governments, which prevailed under</a>
<a id='line_226'>      the successors of Heraclius, and are described by the pen of the</a>
<a id='line_227'>      royal author. Of the twenty-nine themes, twelve in Europe and</a>
<a id='line_228'>      seventeen in Asia, the origin is obscure, the etymology doubtful</a>
<a id='line_229'>      or capricious: the limits were arbitrary and fluctuating; but</a>
<a id='line_230'>      some particular names, that sound the most strangely to our ear,</a>
<a id='line_231'>      were derived from the character and attributes of the troops that</a>
<a id='line_232'>      were maintained at the expense, and for the guard, of the</a>
<a id='line_233'>      respective divisions. The vanity of the Greek princes most</a>
<a id='line_234'>      eagerly grasped the shadow of conquest and the memory of lost</a>
<a id='line_235'>      dominion. A new Mesopotamia was created on the western side of</a>
<a id='line_236'>      the Euphrates: the appellation and praetor of Sicily were</a>
<a id='line_237'>      transferred to a narrow slip of Calabria; and a fragment of the</a>
<a id='line_238'>      duchy of Beneventum was promoted to the style and title of the</a>
<a id='line_239'>      theme of Lombardy. In the decline of the Arabian empire, the</a>
<a id='line_240'>      successors of Constantine might indulge their pride in more solid</a>
<a id='line_241'>      advantages. The victories of Nicephorus, John Zimisces, and Basil</a>
<a id='line_242'>      the Second, revived the fame, and enlarged the boundaries, of the</a>
<a id='line_243'>      Roman name: the province of Cilicia, the metropolis of Antioch,</a>
<a id='line_244'>      the islands of Crete and Cyprus, were restored to the allegiance</a>
<a id='line_245'>      of Christ and Caesar: one third of Italy was annexed to the</a>
<a id='line_246'>      throne of Constantinople: the kingdom of Bulgaria was destroyed;</a>

<a id='line_304'>      and festivals diverted many hands and many days from the temporal</a>

<a id='line_342'>      Bulgaria. The strangers of old, Cadmus, and Danaus, and Pelops,</a>
<a id='line_343'>      had planted in that fruitful soil the seeds of policy and</a>
<a id='line_344'>      learning; but the savages of the north eradicated what yet</a>
<a id='line_345'>      remained of their sickly and withered roots. In this irruption,</a>
<a id='line_346'>      the country and the inhabitants were transformed; the Grecian</a>
<a id='line_347'>      blood was contaminated; and the proudest nobles of Peloponnesus</a>
<a id='line_348'>      were branded with the names of foreigners and slaves. By the</a>
<a id='line_349'>      diligence of succeeding princes, the land was in some measure</a>
<a id='line_350'>      purified from the Barbarians; and the humble remnant was bound by</a>
<a id='line_351'>      an oath of obedience, tribute, and military service, which they</a>
<a id='line_352'>      often renewed and often violated. The siege of Patras was formed</a>
<a id='line_353'>      by a singular concurrence of the Sclavonians of Peloponnesus and</a>
<a id='line_354'>      the Saracens of Africa. In their last distress, a pious fiction</a>
<a id='line_355'>      of the approach of the praetor of Corinth revived the courage of</a>
<a id='line_356'>      the citizens. Their sally was bold and successful; the strangers</a>
<a id='line_357'>      embarked, the rebels submitted, and the glory of the day was</a>
<a id='line_358'>      ascribed to a phantom or a stranger, who fought in the foremost</a>
<a id='line_359'>      ranks under the character of St. Andrew the Apostle. The shrine</a>
<a id='line_360'>      which contained his relics was decorated with the trophies of</a>
<a id='line_361'>      victory, and the captive race was forever devoted to the service</a>
<a id='line_362'>      and vassalage of the metropolitan church of Patras. By the revolt</a>
<a id='line_363'>      of two Sclavonian tribes, in the neighborhood of Helos and</a>
<a id='line_364'>      Lacedaemon, the peace of the peninsula was often disturbed. They</a>
<a id='line_365'>      sometimes insulted the weakness, and sometimes resisted the</a>
<a id='line_366'>      oppression, of the Byzantine government, till at length the</a>
<a id='line_367'>      approach of their hostile brethren extorted a golden bull to</a>
<a id='line_368'>      define the rites and obligations of the Ezzerites and Milengi,</a>
<a id='line_369'>      whose annual tribute was defined at twelve hundred pieces of</a>
<a id='line_370'>      gold. From these strangers the Imperial geographer has accurately</a>
<a id='line_371'>      distinguished a domestic, and perhaps original, race, who, in</a>
<a id='line_372'>      some degree, might derive their blood from the much-injured</a>
<a id='line_373'>      Helots. The liberality of the Romans, and especially of Augustus,</a>
<a id='line_374'>      had enfranchised the maritime cities from the dominion of Sparta;</a>
<a id='line_375'>      and the continuance of the same benefit ennobled them with the</a>
<a id='line_376'>      title of Eleuthero, or Free-Laconians. 16 In the time of</a>
<a id='line_377'>      Constantine Porphyrogenitus, they had acquired the name of</a>
<a id='line_378'>      Mainotes, under which they dishonor the claim of liberty by the</a>
<a id='line_379'>      inhuman pillage of all that is shipwrecked on their rocky shores.</a>
<a id='line_380'>      Their territory, barren of corn, but fruitful of olives, extended</a>
<a id='line_381'>      to the Cape of Malea: they accepted a chief or prince from the</a>
<a id='line_382'>      Byzantine praetor, and a light tribute of four hundred pieces of</a>
<a id='line_383'>      gold was the badge of their immunity, rather than of their</a>
<a id='line_384'>      dependence. The freemen of Laconia assumed the character of</a>
<a id='line_385'>      Romans, and long adhered to the religion of the Greeks. By the</a>
<a id='line_386'>      zeal of the emperor Basil, they were baptized in the faith of</a>
<a id='line_387'>      Christ: but the altars of Venus and Neptune had been crowned by</a>
<a id='line_388'>      these rustic votaries five hundred years after they were</a>
<a id='line_389'>      proscribed in the Roman world. In the theme of Peloponnesus, 17</a>
<a id='line_390'>      forty cities were still numbered, and the declining state of</a>
<a id='line_391'>      Sparta, Argos, and Corinth, may be suspended in the tenth</a>
<a id='line_392'>      century, at an equal distance, perhaps, between their antique</a>
<a id='line_393'>      splendor and their present desolation. The duty of military</a>
<a id='line_394'>      service, either in person or by substitute, was imposed on the</a>
<a id='line_395'>      lands or benefices of the province; a sum of five pieces of gold</a>

<a id='line_439'>      two former of which had flourished in Greece since the days of</a>
<a id='line_440'>      Homer; and the last was introduced perhaps as early as the reign</a>
<a id='line_441'>      of Justinian. These arts, which were exercised at Corinth,</a>
<a id='line_442'>      Thebes, and Argos, afforded food and occupation to a numerous</a>
<a id='line_443'>      people: the men, women, and children were distributed according</a>

<a id='line_445'>      slaves, their masters, who directed the work and enjoyed the</a>
<a id='line_446'>      profit, were of a free and honorable condition. The gifts which a</a>

<a id='line_448'>      Basil, her adopted son, were doubtless fabricated in the Grecian</a>

<a id='line_451'>      overspread the floor of a new church, erected in the triple name</a>
<a id='line_452'>      of Christ, of Michael the archangel, and of the prophet Elijah.</a>
<a id='line_453'>      She gave six hundred pieces of silk and linen, of various use and</a>
<a id='line_454'>      denomination: the silk was painted with the Tyrian dye, and</a>
<a id='line_455'>      adorned by the labors of the needle; and the linen was so</a>
<a id='line_456'>      exquisitely fine, that an entire piece might be rolled in the</a>
<a id='line_457'>      hollow of a cane. 20 In his description of the Greek</a>
<a id='line_458'>      manufactures, an historian of Sicily discriminates their price,</a>
<a id='line_459'>      according to the weight and quality of the silk, the closeness of</a>
<a id='line_460'>      the texture, the beauty of the colors, and the taste and</a>
<a id='line_461'>      materials of the embroidery. A single, or even a double or treble</a>
<a id='line_462'>      thread was thought sufficient for ordinary sale; but the union of</a>
<a id='line_463'>      six threads composed a piece of stronger and more costly</a>
<a id='line_464'>      workmanship. Among the colors, he celebrates, with affectation of</a>
<a id='line_465'>      eloquence, the fiery blaze of the scarlet, and the softer lustre</a>
<a id='line_466'>      of the green. The embroidery was raised either in silk or gold:</a>
<a id='line_467'>      the more simple ornament of stripes or circles was surpassed by</a>
<a id='line_468'>      the nicer imitation of flowers: the vestments that were</a>
<a id='line_469'>      fabricated for the palace or the altar often glittered with</a>
<a id='line_470'>      precious stones; and the figures were delineated in strings of</a>
<a id='line_471'>      Oriental pearls. 21 Till the twelfth century, Greece alone, of</a>
<a id='line_472'>      all the countries of Christendom, was possessed of the insect who</a>
<a id='line_473'>      is taught by nature, and of the workmen who are instructed by</a>
<a id='line_474'>      art, to prepare this elegant luxury. But the secret had been</a>
<a id='line_475'>      stolen by the dexterity and diligence of the Arabs: the caliphs</a>
<a id='line_476'>      of the East and West scorned to borrow from the unbelievers their</a>
<a id='line_477'>      furniture and apparel; and two cities of Spain, Almeria and</a>
<a id='line_478'>      Lisbon, were famous for the manufacture, the use, and, perhaps,</a>
<a id='line_479'>      the exportation, of silk. It was first introduced into Sicily by</a>
<a id='line_480'>      the Normans; and this emigration of trade distinguishes the</a>
<a id='line_481'>      victory of Roger from the uniform and fruitless hostilities of</a>
<a id='line_482'>      every age. After the sack of Corinth, Athens, and Thebes, his</a>
<a id='line_483'>      lieutenant embarked with a captive train of weavers and</a>
<a id='line_484'>      artificers of both sexes, a trophy glorious to their master, and</a>
<a id='line_485'>      disgraceful to the Greek emperor. 22 The king of Sicily was not</a>
<a id='line_486'>      insensible of the value of the present; and, in the restitution</a>
<a id='line_487'>      of the prisoners, he excepted only the male and female</a>
<a id='line_488'>      manufacturers of Thebes and Corinth, who labor, says the</a>
<a id='line_489'>      Byzantine historian, under a barbarous lord, like the old</a>
<a id='line_490'>      Eretrians in the service of Darius. 23 A stately edifice, in the</a>
<a id='line_491'>      palace of Palermo, was erected for the use of this industrious</a>
<a id='line_492'>      colony; 24 and the art was propagated by their children and</a>
<a id='line_493'>      disciples to satisfy the increasing demand of the western world.</a>
<a id='line_494'>      The decay of the looms of Sicily may be ascribed to the troubles</a>
<a id='line_495'>      of the island, and the competition of the Italian cities. In the</a>
<a id='line_496'>      year thirteen hundred and fourteen, Lucca alone, among her sister</a>

<a id='line_565'>      discharged into the Imperial reservoir a copious and perennial</a>
<a id='line_566'>      stream. The separation of the branches from the trunk increased</a>
<a id='line_567'>      the relative magnitude of Constantinople; and the maxims of</a>
<a id='line_568'>      despotism contracted the state to the capital, the capital to the</a>
<a id='line_569'>      palace, and the palace to the royal person. A Jewish traveller,</a>
<a id='line_570'>      who visited the East in the twelfth century, is lost in his</a>
<a id='line_571'>      admiration of the Byzantine riches. “It is here,” says Benjamin</a>
<a id='line_572'>      of Tudela, “in the queen of cities, that the tributes of the</a>
<a id='line_573'>      Greek empire are annually deposited and the lofty towers are</a>
<a id='line_574'>      filled with precious magazines of silk, purple, and gold. It is</a>
<a id='line_575'>      said, that Constantinople pays each day to her sovereign twenty</a>
<a id='line_576'>      thousand pieces of gold; which are levied on the shops, taverns,</a>
<a id='line_577'>      and markets, on the merchants of Persia and Egypt, of Russia and</a>
<a id='line_578'>      Hungary, of Italy and Spain, who frequent the capital by sea and</a>

<a id='line_580'>      doubtless respectable; but as the three hundred and sixty-five</a>
<a id='line_581'>      days would produce a yearly income exceeding seven millions</a>

<a id='line_583'>      festivals of the Greek calendar. The mass of treasure that was</a>
<a id='line_584'>      saved by Theodora and Basil the Second will suggest a splendid,</a>
<a id='line_585'>      though indefinite, idea of their supplies and resources. The</a>
<a id='line_586'>      mother of Michael, before she retired to a cloister, attempted to</a>
<a id='line_587'>      check or expose the prodigality of her ungrateful son, by a free</a>

<a id='line_592'>      than his valor and fortune: his victorious armies were paid and</a>
<a id='line_593'>      rewarded without breaking into the mass of two hundred thousand</a>
<a id='line_594'>      pounds of gold, (about eight millions sterling,) which he had</a>

<a id='line_627'>      yet, with the revolving seasons, they were led by taste or</a>

<a id='line_630'>      festival of the vintage: their leisure was amused by the exercise</a>
<a id='line_631'>      of the chase and the calmer occupation of fishing, and in the</a>
<a id='line_632'>      summer heats, they were shaded from the sun, and refreshed by the</a>
<a id='line_633'>      cooling breezes from the sea. The coasts and islands of Asia and</a>
<a id='line_634'>      Europe were covered with their magnificent villas; but, instead</a>
<a id='line_635'>      of the modest art which secretly strives to hide itself and to</a>

<a id='line_637'>      gardens served only to expose the riches of the lord, and the</a>

<a id='line_644'>      cathedral of St. Sophia, and the gardens, which descended by many</a>
<a id='line_645'>      a terrace to the shores of the Propontis. The primitive edifice</a>

<a id='line_650'>      by an unquestionable preeminence of strength, size, and</a>
<a id='line_651'>      magnificence. 33 But the toil and treasure of so many ages had</a>
<a id='line_652'>      produced a vast and irregular pile: each separate building was</a>
<a id='line_653'>      marked with the character of the times and of the founder; and</a>
<a id='line_654'>      the want of space might excuse the reigning monarch, who</a>
<a id='line_655'>      demolished, perhaps with secret satisfaction, the works of his</a>
<a id='line_656'>      predecessors. The economy of the emperor Theophilus allowed a</a>
<a id='line_657'>      more free and ample scope for his domestic luxury and splendor. A</a>
<a id='line_658'>      favorite ambassador, who had astonished the Abbassides themselves</a>
<a id='line_659'>      by his pride and liberality, presented on his return the model of</a>
<a id='line_660'>      a palace, which the caliph of Bagdad had recently constructed on</a>
<a id='line_661'>      the banks of the Tigris. The model was instantly copied and</a>
<a id='line_662'>      surpassed: the new buildings of Theophilus 34 were accompanied</a>
<a id='line_663'>      with gardens, and with five churches, one of which was</a>
<a id='line_664'>      conspicuous for size and beauty: it was crowned with three domes,</a>
<a id='line_665'>      the roof of gilt brass reposed on columns of Italian marble, and</a>
<a id='line_666'>      the walls were incrusted with marbles of various colors. In the</a>
<a id='line_667'>      face of the church, a semicircular portico, of the figure and</a>
<a id='line_668'>      name of the Greek sigma, was supported by fifteen columns of</a>
<a id='line_669'>      Phrygian marble, and the subterraneous vaults were of a similar</a>
<a id='line_670'>      construction. The square before the sigma was decorated with a</a>
<a id='line_671'>      fountain, and the margin of the basin was lined and encompassed</a>
<a id='line_672'>      with plates of silver. In the beginning of each season, the</a>
<a id='line_673'>      basin, instead of water, was replenished with the most exquisite</a>
<a id='line_674'>      fruits, which were abandoned to the populace for the</a>
<a id='line_675'>      entertainment of the prince. He enjoyed this tumultuous spectacle</a>
<a id='line_676'>      from a throne resplendent with gold and gems, which was raised by</a>
<a id='line_677'>      a marble staircase to the height of a lofty terrace. Below the</a>
<a id='line_678'>      throne were seated the officers of his guards, the magistrates,</a>
<a id='line_679'>      the chiefs of the factions of the circus; the inferior steps were</a>
<a id='line_680'>      occupied by the people, and the place below was covered with</a>
<a id='line_681'>      troops of dancers, singers, and pantomimes. The square was</a>
<a id='line_682'>      surrounded by the hall of justice, the arsenal, and the various</a>
<a id='line_683'>      offices of business and pleasure; and the purple chamber was</a>
<a id='line_684'>      named from the annual distribution of robes of scarlet and purple</a>
<a id='line_685'>      by the hand of the empress herself. The long series of the</a>
<a id='line_686'>      apartments was adapted to the seasons, and decorated with marble</a>
<a id='line_687'>      and porphyry, with painting, sculpture, and mosaics, with a</a>
<a id='line_688'>      profusion of gold, silver, and precious stones. His fanciful</a>
<a id='line_689'>      magnificence employed the skill and patience of such artists as</a>
<a id='line_690'>      the times could afford: but the taste of Athens would have</a>
<a id='line_691'>      despised their frivolous and costly labors; a golden tree, with</a>
<a id='line_692'>      its leaves and branches, which sheltered a multitude of birds</a>
<a id='line_693'>      warbling their artificial notes, and two lions of massy gold, and</a>
<a id='line_694'>      of natural size, who looked and roared like their brethren of the</a>
<a id='line_695'>      forest. The successors of Theophilus, of the Basilian and</a>
<a id='line_696'>      Comnenian dynasties, were not less ambitious of leaving some</a>
<a id='line_697'>      memorial of their residence; and the portion of the palace most</a>
<a id='line_698'>      splendid and august was dignified with the title of the golden</a>
<a id='line_699'>      triclinium. 35 With becoming modesty, the rich and noble Greeks</a>
<a id='line_700'>      aspired to imitate their sovereign, and when they passed through</a>
<a id='line_701'>      the streets on horseback, in their robes of silk and embroidery,</a>
<a id='line_702'>      they were mistaken by the children for kings. 36 A matron of</a>
<a id='line_703'>      Peloponnesus, 37 who had cherished the infant fortunes of Basil</a>
<a id='line_704'>      the Macedonian, was excited by tenderness or vanity to visit the</a>
<a id='line_705'>      greatness of her adopted son. In a journey of five hundred miles</a>
<a id='line_706'>      from Patras to Constantinople, her age or indolence declined the</a>
<a id='line_707'>      fatigue of a horse or carriage: the soft litter or bed of</a>
<a id='line_708'>      Danielis was transported on the shoulders of ten robust slaves;</a>
<a id='line_709'>      and as they were relieved at easy distances, a band of three</a>
<a id='line_710'>      hundred were selected for the performance of this service. She</a>
<a id='line_711'>      was entertained in the Byzantine palace with filial reverence,</a>
<a id='line_712'>      and the honors of a queen; and whatever might be the origin of</a>
<a id='line_713'>      her wealth, her gifts were not unworthy of the regal dignity. I</a>
<a id='line_714'>      have already described the fine and curious manufactures of</a>
<a id='line_715'>      Peloponnesus, of linen, silk, and woollen; but the most</a>
<a id='line_716'>      acceptable of her presents consisted in three hundred beautiful</a>
<a id='line_717'>      youths, of whom one hundred were eunuchs; 38 “for she was not</a>
<a id='line_718'>      ignorant,” says the historian, “that the air of the palace is</a>
<a id='line_719'>      more congenial to such insects, than a shepherd’s dairy to the</a>
<a id='line_720'>      flies of the summer.” During her lifetime, she bestowed the</a>
<a id='line_721'>      greater part of her estates in Peloponnesus, and her testament</a>
<a id='line_722'>      instituted Leo, the son of Basil, her universal heir. After the</a>
<a id='line_723'>      payment of the legacies, fourscore villas or farms were added to</a>
<a id='line_724'>      the Imperial domain; and three thousand slaves of Danielis were</a>
<a id='line_725'>      enfranchised by their new lord, and transplanted as a colony to</a>
<a id='line_726'>      the Italian coast. From this example of a private matron, we may</a>
<a id='line_727'>      estimate the wealth and magnificence of the emperors. Yet our</a>
<a id='line_728'>      enjoyments are confined by a narrow circle; and, whatsoever may</a>

<a id='line_792'>      of Augustus and Emperor (Sebastos and Autocrator,) and the union</a>
<a id='line_793'>      produces the sonorous title of Sebastocrator. He was exalted</a>
<a id='line_794'>      above the Caesar on the first step of the throne: the public</a>
<a id='line_795'>      acclamations repeated his name; and he was only distinguished</a>
<a id='line_796'>      from the sovereign by some peculiar ornaments of the head and</a>
<a id='line_797'>      feet. The emperor alone could assume the purple or red buskins,</a>
<a id='line_798'>      and the close diadem or tiara, which imitated the fashion of the</a>
<a id='line_799'>      Persian kings. 40 It was a high pyramidal cap of cloth or silk,</a>
<a id='line_800'>      almost concealed by a profusion of pearls and jewels: the crown</a>
<a id='line_801'>      was formed by a horizontal circle and two arches of gold: at the</a>
<a id='line_802'>      summit, the point of their intersection, was placed a globe or</a>
<a id='line_803'>      cross, and two strings or lappets of pearl depended on either</a>
<a id='line_804'>      cheek. Instead of red, the buskins of the Sebastocrator and</a>
<a id='line_805'>      Caesar were green; and on their open coronets or crowns, the</a>
<a id='line_806'>      precious gems were more sparingly distributed. Beside and below</a>
<a id='line_807'>      the Caesar the fancy of Alexius created the Panhypersebastos and</a>
<a id='line_808'>      the Protosebastos, whose sound and signification will satisfy a</a>

<a id='line_810'>      simple name of Augustus; and this sacred and primitive title of</a>
<a id='line_811'>      the Roman prince was degraded to the kinsmen and servants of the</a>

<a id='line_814'>      science of words is accessible to the meanest capacity; and this</a>

<a id='line_842'>      their heads to the first honors of the state. 1. In a monarchy,</a>
<a id='line_843'>      which refers every object to the person of the prince, the care</a>
<a id='line_844'>      and ceremonies of the palace form the most respectable</a>
<a id='line_845'>      department. The Curopalata, 41 so illustrious in the age of</a>
<a id='line_846'>      Justinian, was supplanted by the Protovestiare, whose primitive</a>
<a id='line_847'>      functions were limited to the custody of the wardrobe. From</a>
<a id='line_848'>      thence his jurisdiction was extended over the numerous menials of</a>
<a id='line_849'>      pomp and luxury; and he presided with his silver wand at the</a>
<a id='line_850'>      public and private audience. 2. In the ancient system of</a>
<a id='line_851'>      Constantine, the name of Logothete, or accountant, was applied to</a>
<a id='line_852'>      the receivers of the finances: the principal officers were</a>
<a id='line_853'>      distinguished as the Logothetes of the domain, of the posts, the</a>
<a id='line_854'>      army, the private and public treasure; and the great Logothete,</a>
<a id='line_855'>      the supreme guardian of the laws and revenues, is compared with</a>
<a id='line_856'>      the chancellor of the Latin monarchies. 42 His discerning eye</a>
<a id='line_857'>      pervaded the civil administration; and he was assisted, in due</a>
<a id='line_858'>      subordination, by the eparch or praefect of the city, the first</a>
<a id='line_859'>      secretary, and the keepers of the privy seal, the archives, and</a>
<a id='line_860'>      the red or purple ink which was reserved for the sacred signature</a>
<a id='line_861'>      of the emperor alone. 43 The introductor and interpreter of</a>
<a id='line_862'>      foreign ambassadors were the great Chiauss 44 and the Dragoman,</a>
<a id='line_863'>      45 two names of Turkish origin, and which are still familiar to</a>
<a id='line_864'>      the Sublime Porte. 3. From the humble style and service of</a>
<a id='line_865'>      guards, the Domestics insensibly rose to the station of generals;</a>
<a id='line_866'>      the military themes of the East and West, the legions of Europe</a>
<a id='line_867'>      and Asia, were often divided, till the great Domestic was finally</a>
<a id='line_868'>      invested with the universal and absolute command of the land</a>
<a id='line_869'>      forces. The Protostrator, in his original functions, was the</a>
<a id='line_870'>      assistant of the emperor when he mounted on horseback: he</a>
<a id='line_871'>      gradually became the lieutenant of the great Domestic in the</a>
<a id='line_872'>      field; and his jurisdiction extended over the stables, the</a>
<a id='line_873'>      cavalry, and the royal train of hunting and hawking. The</a>
<a id='line_874'>      Stratopedarch was the great judge of the camp: the Protospathaire</a>
<a id='line_875'>      commanded the guards; the Constable, 46 the great Aeteriarch, and</a>
<a id='line_876'>      the Acolyth, were the separate chiefs of the Franks, the</a>
<a id='line_877'>      Barbarians, and the Varangi, or English, the mercenary strangers,</a>
<a id='line_878'>      who, at the decay of the national spirit, formed the nerve of the</a>
<a id='line_879'>      Byzantine armies. 4. The naval powers were under the command of</a>
<a id='line_880'>      the great Duke; in his absence they obeyed the great Drungaire of</a>
<a id='line_881'>      the fleet; and, in his place, the Emir, or Admiral, a name of</a>
<a id='line_882'>      Saracen extraction, 47 but which has been naturalized in all the</a>

<a id='line_959'>      of his master Otho. Yet his sincerity cannot disguise the</a>
<a id='line_960'>      abasement of his first audience. When he approached the throne,</a>
<a id='line_961'>      the birds of the golden tree began to warble their notes, which</a>
<a id='line_962'>      were accompanied by the roarings of the two lions of gold. With</a>

<a id='line_965'>      arose, but in the short interval, the throne had been hoisted</a>
<a id='line_966'>      from the floor to the ceiling, the Imperial figure appeared in</a>
<a id='line_967'>      new and more gorgeous apparel, and the interview was concluded in</a>

<a id='line_974'>      was conducted by the formal officers to the hospitable palace</a>

<a id='line_976'>      jealous keepers prohibited all social intercourse either with</a>
<a id='line_977'>      strangers or natives. At his first audience, he offered the gifts</a>
<a id='line_978'>      of his master, slaves, and golden vases, and costly armor. The</a>
<a id='line_979'>      ostentatious payment of the officers and troops displayed before</a>
<a id='line_980'>      his eyes the riches of the empire: he was entertained at a royal</a>
<a id='line_981'>      banquet, 51 in which the ambassadors of the nations were</a>
<a id='line_982'>      marshalled by the esteem or contempt of the Greeks: from his own</a>
<a id='line_983'>      table, the emperor, as the most signal favor, sent the plates</a>
<a id='line_984'>      which he had tasted; and his favorites were dismissed with a robe</a>

<a id='line_1005'>      clergy. The task of applause was not abandoned to the rude and</a>
<a id='line_1006'>      spontaneous voices of the crowd. The most convenient stations</a>
<a id='line_1007'>      were occupied by the bands of the blue and green factions of the</a>
<a id='line_1008'>      circus; and their furious conflicts, which had shaken the</a>

<a id='line_1011'>      emperor; their poets and musicians directed the choir, and long</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      life 53 and victory were the burden of every song. The same</a>

<a id='line_1076'>      The princes of the North, of the nations, says Constantine,</a>
<a id='line_1077'>      without faith or fame, were ambitious of mingling their blood</a>
<a id='line_1078'>      with the blood of the Caesars, by their marriage with a royal</a>

<a id='line_1082'>      most decent reasons for refusing these insolent and unreasonable</a>
<a id='line_1083'>      demands. Every animal, says the discreet emperor, is prompted by</a>

<a id='line_1085'>      to the purity of descent preserves the harmony of public and</a>
<a id='line_1086'>      private life; but the mixture of foreign blood is the fruitful</a>
<a id='line_1087'>      source of disorder and discord. Such had ever been the opinion</a>
<a id='line_1088'>      and practice of the sage Romans: their jurisprudence proscribed</a>
<a id='line_1089'>      the marriage of a citizen and a stranger: in the days of freedom</a>
<a id='line_1090'>      and virtue, a senator would have scorned to match his daughter</a>
<a id='line_1091'>      with a king: the glory of Mark Antony was sullied by an Egyptian</a>
<a id='line_1092'>      wife: 59 and the emperor Titus was compelled, by popular censure,</a>
<a id='line_1093'>      to dismiss with reluctance the reluctant Berenice. 60 This</a>
<a id='line_1094'>      perpetual interdict was ratified by the fabulous sanction of the</a>
<a id='line_1095'>      great Constantine. The ambassadors of the nations, more</a>
<a id='line_1096'>      especially of the unbelieving nations, were solemnly admonished,</a>
<a id='line_1097'>      that such strange alliances had been condemned by the founder of</a>
<a id='line_1098'>      the church and city. The irrevocable law was inscribed on the</a>
<a id='line_1099'>      altar of St. Sophia; and the impious prince who should stain the</a>
<a id='line_1100'>      majesty of the purple was excluded from the civil and</a>
<a id='line_1101'>      ecclesiastical communion of the Romans. If the ambassadors were</a>
<a id='line_1102'>      instructed by any false brethren in the Byzantine history, they</a>
<a id='line_1103'>      might produce three memorable examples of the violation of this</a>
<a id='line_1104'>      imaginary law: the marriage of Leo, or rather of his father</a>
<a id='line_1105'>      Constantine the Fourth, with the daughter of the king of the</a>
<a id='line_1106'>      Chozars, the nuptials of the granddaughter of Romanus with a</a>
<a id='line_1107'>      Bulgarian prince, and the union of Bertha of France or Italy with</a>
<a id='line_1108'>      young Romanus, the son of Constantine Porphyrogenitus himself. To</a>
<a id='line_1109'>      these objections three answers were prepared, which solved the</a>
<a id='line_1110'>      difficulty and established the law. I.</a>
<a id='line_1111'></a>
<a id='line_1112'>      The deed and the guilt of Constantine Copronymus were</a>
<a id='line_1113'>      acknowledged. The Isaurian heretic, who sullied the baptismal</a>
<a id='line_1114'>      font, and declared war against the holy images, had indeed</a>
<a id='line_1115'>      embraced a Barbarian wife. By this impious alliance he</a>
<a id='line_1116'>      accomplished the measure of his crimes, and was devoted to the</a>
<a id='line_1117'>      just censure of the church and of posterity. II. Romanus could</a>
<a id='line_1118'>      not be alleged as a legitimate emperor; he was a plebeian</a>
<a id='line_1119'>      usurper, ignorant of the laws, and regardless of the honor, of</a>
<a id='line_1120'>      the monarchy. His son Christopher, the father of the bride, was</a>
<a id='line_1121'>      the third in rank in the college of princes, at once the subject</a>
<a id='line_1122'>      and the accomplice of a rebellious parent. The Bulgarians were</a>
<a id='line_1123'>      sincere and devout Christians; and the safety of the empire, with</a>
<a id='line_1124'>      the redemption of many thousand captives, depended on this</a>
<a id='line_1125'>      preposterous alliance. Yet no consideration could dispense from</a>
<a id='line_1126'>      the law of Constantine: the clergy, the senate, and the people,</a>
<a id='line_1127'>      disapproved the conduct of Romanus; and he was reproached, both</a>
<a id='line_1128'>      in his life and death, as the author of the public disgrace. III.</a>
<a id='line_1129'>      For the marriage of his own son with the daughter of Hugo, king</a>
<a id='line_1130'>      of Italy, a more honorable defence is contrived by the wise</a>
<a id='line_1131'>      Porphyrogenitus. Constantine, the great and holy, esteemed the</a>
<a id='line_1132'>      fidelity and valor of the Franks; 61 and his prophetic spirit</a>
<a id='line_1133'>      beheld the vision of their future greatness. They alone were</a>
<a id='line_1134'>      excepted from the general prohibition: Hugo, king of France, was</a>
<a id='line_1135'>      the lineal descendant of Charlemagne; 62 and his daughter Bertha</a>
<a id='line_1136'>      inherited the prerogatives of her family and nation. The voice of</a>
<a id='line_1137'>      truth and malice insensibly betrayed the fraud or error of the</a>
<a id='line_1138'>      Imperial court. The patrimonial estate of Hugo was reduced from</a>
<a id='line_1139'>      the monarchy of France to the simple county of Arles; though it</a>
<a id='line_1140'>      was not denied, that, in the confusion of the times, he had</a>
<a id='line_1141'>      usurped the sovereignty of Provence, and invaded the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_1142'>      Italy. His father was a private noble; and if Bertha derived her</a>
<a id='line_1143'>      female descent from the Carlovingian line, every step was</a>
<a id='line_1144'>      polluted with illegitimacy or vice. The grandmother of Hugo was</a>
<a id='line_1145'>      the famous Valdrada, the concubine, rather than the wife, of the</a>
<a id='line_1146'>      second Lothair; whose adultery, divorce, and second nuptials, had</a>
<a id='line_1147'>      provoked against him the thunders of the Vatican. His mother, as</a>
<a id='line_1148'>      she was styled, the great Bertha, was successively the wife of</a>
<a id='line_1149'>      the count of Arles and of the marquis of Tuscany: France and</a>
<a id='line_1150'>      Italy were scandalized by her gallantries; and, till the age of</a>
<a id='line_1151'>      threescore, her lovers, of every degree, were the zealous</a>
<a id='line_1152'>      servants of her ambition. The example of maternal incontinence</a>
<a id='line_1153'>      was copied by the king of Italy; and the three favorite</a>
<a id='line_1154'>      concubines of Hugo were decorated with the classic names of</a>
<a id='line_1155'>      Venus, Juno, and Semele. 63 The daughter of Venus was granted to</a>
<a id='line_1156'>      the solicitations of the Byzantine court: her name of Bertha was</a>
<a id='line_1157'>      changed to that of Eudoxia; and she was wedded, or rather</a>
<a id='line_1158'>      betrothed, to young Romanus, the future heir of the empire of the</a>
<a id='line_1159'>      East. The consummation of this foreign alliance was suspended by</a>
<a id='line_1160'>      the tender age of the two parties; and, at the end of five years,</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      the union was dissolved by the death of the virgin spouse. The</a>
<a id='line_1162'>      second wife of the emperor Romanus was a maiden of plebeian, but</a>
<a id='line_1163'>      of Roman, birth; and their two daughters, Theophano and Anne,</a>
<a id='line_1164'>      were given in marriage to the princes of the earth. The eldest</a>
<a id='line_1165'>      was bestowed, as the pledge of peace, on the eldest son of the</a>
<a id='line_1166'>      great Otho, who had solicited this alliance with arms and</a>
<a id='line_1167'>      embassies. It might legally be questioned how far a Saxon was</a>
<a id='line_1168'>      entitled to the privilege of the French nation; but every scruple</a>
<a id='line_1169'>      was silenced by the fame and piety of a hero who had restored the</a>
<a id='line_1170'>      empire of the West. After the death of her father-in-law and</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      husband, Theophano governed Rome, Italy, and Germany, during the</a>
<a id='line_1172'>      minority of her son, the third Otho; and the Latins have praised</a>
<a id='line_1173'>      the virtues of an empress, who sacrificed to a superior duty the</a>
<a id='line_1174'>      remembrance of her country. 64 In the nuptials of her sister</a>
<a id='line_1175'>      Anne, every prejudice was lost, and every consideration of</a>
<a id='line_1176'>      dignity was superseded, by the stronger argument of necessity and</a>
<a id='line_1177'>      fear. A Pagan of the North, Wolodomir, great prince of Russia,</a>
<a id='line_1178'>      aspired to a daughter of the Roman purple; and his claim was</a>
<a id='line_1179'>      enforced by the threats of war, the promise of conversion, and</a>
<a id='line_1180'>      the offer of a powerful succor against a domestic rebel. A victim</a>
<a id='line_1181'>      of her religion and country, the Grecian princess was torn from</a>
<a id='line_1182'>      the palace of her fathers, and condemned to a savage reign, and a</a>
<a id='line_1183'>      hopeless exile on the banks of the Borysthenes, or in the</a>
<a id='line_1184'>      neighborhood of the Polar circle. 65 Yet the marriage of Anne was</a>
<a id='line_1185'>      fortunate and fruitful: the daughter of her grandson Joroslaus</a>
<a id='line_1186'>      was recommended by her Imperial descent; and the king of France,</a>

<a id='line_1335'>      Punic wars, the sphere of action had not been enlarged; and the</a>
<a id='line_1336'>      science of naval architecture appears to have declined. The art</a>

<a id='line_1338'>      or six, or ten, ranges of oars, rising above, or falling behind,</a>
<a id='line_1339'>      each other, was unknown to the ship-builders of Constantinople,</a>

<a id='line_1341'>      73 or light galleys of the Byzantine empire, were content with</a>
<a id='line_1342'>      two tier of oars; each tier was composed of five-and-twenty</a>
<a id='line_1343'>      benches; and two rowers were seated on each bench, who plied</a>
<a id='line_1344'>      their oars on either side of the vessel. To these we must add the</a>
<a id='line_1345'>      captain or centurion, who, in time of action, stood erect with</a>
<a id='line_1346'>      his armor-bearer on the poop, two steersmen at the helm, and two</a>
<a id='line_1347'>      officers at the prow, the one to manage the anchor, the other to</a>
<a id='line_1348'>      point and play against the enemy the tube of liquid fire. The</a>
<a id='line_1349'>      whole crew, as in the infancy of the art, performed the double</a>
<a id='line_1350'>      service of mariners and soldiers; they were provided with</a>
<a id='line_1351'>      defensive and offensive arms, with bows and arrows, which they</a>
<a id='line_1352'>      used from the upper deck, with long pikes, which they pushed</a>
<a id='line_1353'>      through the portholes of the lower tier. Sometimes, indeed, the</a>
<a id='line_1354'>      ships of war were of a larger and more solid construction; and</a>
<a id='line_1355'>      the labors of combat and navigation were more regularly divided</a>
<a id='line_1356'>      between seventy soldiers and two hundred and thirty mariners. But</a>
<a id='line_1357'>      for the most part they were of the light and manageable size; and</a>
<a id='line_1358'>      as the Cape of Malea in Peloponnesus was still clothed with its</a>
<a id='line_1359'>      ancient terrors, an Imperial fleet was transported five miles</a>
<a id='line_1360'>      over land across the Isthmus of Corinth. 74 The principles of</a>
<a id='line_1361'>      maritime tactics had not undergone any change since the time of</a>
<a id='line_1362'>      Thucydides: a squadron of galleys still advanced in a crescent,</a>
<a id='line_1363'>      charged to the front, and strove to impel their sharp beaks</a>
<a id='line_1364'>      against the feeble sides of their antagonists. A machine for</a>
<a id='line_1365'>      casting stones and darts was built of strong timbers, in the</a>
<a id='line_1366'>      midst of the deck; and the operation of boarding was effected by</a>
<a id='line_1367'>      a crane that hoisted baskets of armed men. The language of</a>
<a id='line_1368'>      signals, so clear and copious in the naval grammar of the</a>
<a id='line_1369'>      moderns, was imperfectly expressed by the various positions and</a>
<a id='line_1370'>      colors of a commanding flag. In the darkness of the night, the</a>
<a id='line_1371'>      same orders to chase, to attack, to halt, to retreat, to break,</a>
<a id='line_1372'>      to form, were conveyed by the lights of the leading galley. By</a>
<a id='line_1373'>      land, the fire-signals were repeated from one mountain to</a>
<a id='line_1374'>      another; a chain of eight stations commanded a space of five</a>
<a id='line_1375'>      hundred miles; and Constantinople in a few hours was apprised of</a>
<a id='line_1376'>      the hostile motions of the Saracens of Tarsus. 75 Some estimate</a>
<a id='line_1377'>      may be formed of the power of the Greek emperors, by the curious</a>
<a id='line_1378'>      and minute detail of the armament which was prepared for the</a>
<a id='line_1379'>      reduction of Crete. A fleet of one hundred and twelve galleys,</a>
<a id='line_1380'>      and seventy-five vessels of the Pamphylian style, was equipped in</a>
<a id='line_1381'>      the capital, the islands of the Aegean Sea, and the seaports of</a>
<a id='line_1382'>      Asia, Macedonia, and Greece. It carried thirty-four thousand</a>

<a id='line_1484'>      reasonable consideration, that the weight of the front could not</a>
<a id='line_1485'>      be increased by any pressure of the hindmost horses. If the ranks</a>
<a id='line_1486'>      of the infantry or cavalry were sometimes doubled, this cautious</a>
<a id='line_1487'>      array betrayed a secret distrust of the courage of the troops,</a>
<a id='line_1488'>      whose numbers might swell the appearance of the line, but of whom</a>
<a id='line_1489'>      only a chosen band would dare to encounter the spears and swords</a>
<a id='line_1490'>      of the Barbarians. The order of battle must have varied according</a>
<a id='line_1491'>      to the ground, the object, and the adversary; but their ordinary</a>
<a id='line_1492'>      disposition, in two lines and a reserve, presented a succession</a>
<a id='line_1493'>      of hopes and resources most agreeable to the temper as well as</a>
<a id='line_1494'>      the judgment of the Greeks. 79 In case of a repulse, the first</a>
<a id='line_1495'>      line fell back into the intervals of the second; and the reserve,</a>
<a id='line_1496'>      breaking into two divisions, wheeled round the flanks to improve</a>
<a id='line_1497'>      the victory or cover the retreat. Whatever authority could enact</a>
<a id='line_1498'>      was accomplished, at least in theory, by the camps and marches,</a>
<a id='line_1499'>      the exercises and evolutions, the edicts and books, of the</a>
<a id='line_1500'>      Byzantine monarch. 80 Whatever art could produce from the forge,</a>
<a id='line_1501'>      the loom, or the laboratory, was abundantly supplied by the</a>
<a id='line_1502'>      riches of the prince, and the industry of his numerous workmen.</a>
<a id='line_1503'>      But neither authority nor art could frame the most important</a>
<a id='line_1504'>      machine, the soldier himself; and if the ceremonies of</a>
<a id='line_1505'>      Constantine always suppose the safe and triumphal return of the</a>
<a id='line_1506'>      emperor, 81 his tactics seldom soar above the means of escaping a</a>
<a id='line_1507'>      defeat, and procrastinating the war. 82 Notwithstanding some</a>
<a id='line_1508'>      transient success, the Greeks were sunk in their own esteem and</a>
<a id='line_1509'>      that of their neighbors. A cold hand and a loquacious tongue was</a>
<a id='line_1510'>      the vulgar description of the nation: the author of the tactics</a>
<a id='line_1511'>      was besieged in his capital; and the last of the Barbarians, who</a>

<a id='line_1513'>      exhibit the medals of gold and silver which they had extorted</a>

<a id='line_1516'>      degree by the influence of religion; but the religion of the</a>
<a id='line_1517'>      Greeks could only teach them to suffer and to yield. The emperor</a>
<a id='line_1518'>      Nicephorus, who restored for a moment the discipline and glory of</a>
<a id='line_1519'>      the Roman name, was desirous of bestowing the honors of martyrdom</a>
<a id='line_1520'>      on the Christians who lost their lives in a holy war against the</a>
<a id='line_1521'>      infidels. But this political law was defeated by the opposition</a>

<a id='line_1573'>      the standard of their lord: but the Mussulman people of Syria and</a>
<a id='line_1574'>      Cilicia, of Africa and Spain, was awakened by the trumpet which</a>

<a id='line_1580'>      offensive and defensive arms were similar in strength and temper</a>
<a id='line_1581'>      to those of the Romans, whom they far excelled in the management</a>
<a id='line_1582'>      of the horse and the bow: the massy silver of their belts, their</a>

<a id='line_1584'>      prosperous nation; and except some black archers of the South,</a>
<a id='line_1585'>      the Arabs disdained the naked bravery of their ancestors. Instead</a>
<a id='line_1586'>      of wagons, they were attended by a long train of camels, mules,</a>
<a id='line_1587'>      and asses: the multitude of these animals, whom they bedecked</a>
<a id='line_1588'>      with flags and streamers, appeared to swell the pomp and</a>
<a id='line_1589'>      magnitude of their host; and the horses of the enemy were often</a>
<a id='line_1590'>      disordered by the uncouth figure and odious smell of the camels</a>
<a id='line_1591'>      of the East. Invincible by their patience of thirst and heat,</a>
<a id='line_1592'>      their spirits were frozen by a winter’s cold, and the</a>
<a id='line_1593'>      consciousness of their propensity to sleep exacted the most</a>
<a id='line_1594'>      rigorous precautions against the surprises of the night. Their</a>
<a id='line_1595'>      order of battle was a long square of two deep and solid lines;</a>
<a id='line_1596'>      the first of archers, the second of cavalry. In their engagements</a>
<a id='line_1597'>      by sea and land, they sustained with patient firmness the fury of</a>
<a id='line_1598'>      the attack, and seldom advanced to the charge till they could</a>
<a id='line_1599'>      discern and oppress the lassitude of their foes. But if they were</a>
<a id='line_1600'>      repulsed and broken, they knew not how to rally or renew the</a>
<a id='line_1601'>      combat; and their dismay was heightened by the superstitious</a>
<a id='line_1602'>      prejudice, that God had declared himself on the side of their</a>
<a id='line_1603'>      enemies. The decline and fall of the caliphs countenanced this</a>

<a id='line_1605'>      Christians, some obscure prophecies 86 which prognosticated their</a>

<a id='line_1661'>      beginning of the tenth century, the family of Charlemagne had</a>

<a id='line_1732'>      cavalry; 91 and in all perilous emergencies, their warriors were</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      so conscious of their ignorance, that they chose to dismount from</a>
<a id='line_1734'>      their horses and fight on foot. Unpractised in the use of pikes,</a>
<a id='line_1735'>      or of missile weapons, they were encumbered by the length of</a>
<a id='line_1736'>      their swords, the weight of their armor, the magnitude of their</a>
<a id='line_1737'>      shields, and, if I may repeat the satire of the meagre Greeks, by</a>
<a id='line_1738'>      their unwieldy intemperance. Their independent spirit disdained</a>
<a id='line_1739'>      the yoke of subordination, and abandoned the standard of their</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      chief, if he attempted to keep the field beyond the term of their</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      stipulation or service. On all sides they were open to the snares</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      of an enemy less brave but more artful than themselves. They</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      might be bribed, for the Barbarians were venal; or surprised in</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      the night, for they neglected the precautions of a close</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      encampment or vigilant sentinels. The fatigues of a summer’s</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      campaign exhausted their strength and patience, and they sunk in</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      despair if their voracious appetite was disappointed of a</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      plentiful supply of wine and of food. This general character of</a>
<a id='line_1749'>      the Franks was marked with some national and local shades, which</a>
<a id='line_1750'>      I should ascribe to accident rather than to climate, but which</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      were visible both to natives and to foreigners. An ambassador of</a>

<a id='line_1755'>      their backs to an enemy. 92 It was the glory of the nobles of</a>

<a id='line_1826'>      the proper and public style of the Roman government, the</a>
<a id='line_1827'>      consecrated idiom of the palace and senate of Constantinople, of</a>
<a id='line_1828'>      the campus and tribunals of the East. 97 But this foreign dialect</a>
<a id='line_1829'>      was unknown to the people and soldiers of the Asiatic provinces,</a>
<a id='line_1830'>      it was imperfectly understood by the greater part of the</a>

<a id='line_1832'>      short conflict, nature and habit prevailed over the obsolete</a>
<a id='line_1833'>      institutions of human power: for the general benefit of his</a>
<a id='line_1834'>      subjects, Justinian promulgated his novels in the two languages:</a>
<a id='line_1835'>      the several parts of his voluminous jurisprudence were</a>
<a id='line_1836'>      successively translated; 98 the original was forgotten, the</a>

<a id='line_1838'>      deserved indeed the preference, obtained a legal, as well as</a>
<a id='line_1839'>      popular establishment in the Byzantine monarchy. The birth and</a>

<a id='line_1974'>      by the strangers of the East; and this occult science was</a>
<a id='line_1975'>      magnified by vulgar credulity, which modestly supposes that all</a>
<a id='line_1976'>      knowledge superior to its own must be the effect of inspiration</a>
<a id='line_1977'>      or magic. At the pressing entreaty of the Caesar, his friend, the</a>
<a id='line_1978'>      celebrated Photius, 107 renounced the freedom of a secular and</a>
<a id='line_1979'>      studious life, ascended the patriarchal throne, and was</a>
<a id='line_1980'>      alternately excommunicated and absolved by the synods of the East</a>
<a id='line_1981'>      and West. By the confession even of priestly hatred, no art or</a>
<a id='line_1982'>      science, except poetry, was foreign to this universal scholar,</a>
<a id='line_1983'>      who was deep in thought, indefatigable in reading, and eloquent</a>
<a id='line_1984'>      in diction. Whilst he exercised the office of protospathaire or</a>
<a id='line_1985'>      captain of the guards, Photius was sent ambassador to the caliph</a>
<a id='line_1986'>      of Bagdad. 108 The tedious hours of exile, perhaps of</a>
<a id='line_1987'>      confinement, were beguiled by the hasty composition of his</a>
<a id='line_1988'>      Library, a living monument of erudition and criticism. Two</a>
<a id='line_1989'>      hundred and fourscore writers, historians, orators, philosophers,</a>
<a id='line_1990'>      theologians, are reviewed without any regular method: he abridges</a>
<a id='line_1991'>      their narrative or doctrine, appreciates their style and</a>
<a id='line_1992'>      character, and judges even the fathers of the church with a</a>
<a id='line_1993'>      discreet freedom, which often breaks through the superstition of</a>
<a id='line_1994'>      the times. The emperor Basil, who lamented the defects of his own</a>
<a id='line_1995'>      education, intrusted to the care of Photius his son and</a>
<a id='line_1996'>      successor, Leo the philosopher; and the reign of that prince and</a>
<a id='line_1997'>      of his son Constantine Porphyrogenitus forms one of the most</a>
<a id='line_1998'>      prosperous aeras of the Byzantine literature. By their</a>
<a id='line_1999'>      munificence the treasures of antiquity were deposited in the</a>
<a id='line_2000'>      Imperial library; by their pens, or those of their associates,</a>
<a id='line_2001'>      they were imparted in such extracts and abridgments as might</a>
<a id='line_2002'>      amuse the curiosity, without oppressing the indolence, of the</a>
<a id='line_2003'>      public. Besides the Basilics, or code of laws, the arts of</a>
<a id='line_2004'>      husbandry and war, of feeding or destroying the human species,</a>
<a id='line_2005'>      were propagated with equal diligence; and the history of Greece</a>
<a id='line_2006'>      and Rome was digested into fifty-three heads or titles, of which</a>
<a id='line_2007'>      two only (of embassies, and of virtues and vices) have escaped</a>
<a id='line_2008'>      the injuries of time. In every station, the reader might</a>
<a id='line_2009'>      contemplate the image of the past world, apply the lesson or</a>

<a id='line_2012'>      works of the Byzantine Greeks, who, by the assiduous study of the</a>
<a id='line_2013'>      ancients, have deserved, in some measure, the remembrance and</a>
<a id='line_2014'>      gratitude of the moderns. The scholars of the present age may</a>
<a id='line_2015'>      still enjoy the benefit of the philosophical commonplace book of</a>
<a id='line_2016'>      Stobaeus, the grammatical and historical lexicon of Suidas, the</a>
<a id='line_2017'>      Chiliads of Tzetzes, which comprise six hundred narratives in</a>
<a id='line_2018'>      twelve thousand verses, and the commentaries on Homer of</a>
<a id='line_2019'>      Eustathius, archbishop of Thessalonica, who, from his horn of</a>
<a id='line_2020'>      plenty, has poured the names and authorities of four hundred</a>
<a id='line_2021'>      writers. From these originals, and from the numerous tribe of</a>
<a id='line_2022'>      scholiasts and critics, 109 some estimate may be formed of the</a>
<a id='line_2023'>      literary wealth of the twelfth century: Constantinople was</a>
<a id='line_2024'>      enlightened by the genius of Homer and Demosthenes, of Aristotle</a>
<a id='line_2025'>      and Plato: and in the enjoyment or neglect of our present riches,</a>
<a id='line_2026'>      we must envy the generation that could still peruse the history</a>
<a id='line_2027'>      of Theopompus, the orations of Hyperides, the comedies of</a>
<a id='line_2028'>      Menander, 110 and the odes of Alcaeus and Sappho. The frequent</a>
