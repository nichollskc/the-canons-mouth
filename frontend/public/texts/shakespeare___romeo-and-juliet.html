<a id='line_93'>Two households, both alike in dignity,</a>
<a id='line_94'>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</a>
<a id='line_95'>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</a>
<a id='line_96'>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</a>
<a id='line_97'>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</a>
<a id='line_98'>A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;</a>
<a id='line_99'>Whose misadventur’d piteous overthrows</a>
<a id='line_100'>Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.</a>

<a id='line_103'>Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,</a>

<a id='line_134'>But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>SAMPSON.</a>
<a id='line_137'>A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</a>
<a id='line_138'></a>
<a id='line_139'>GREGORY.</a>
<a id='line_140'>To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou</a>
<a id='line_141'>art moved, thou runn’st away.</a>
<a id='line_142'></a>
<a id='line_143'>SAMPSON.</a>
<a id='line_144'>A dog of that house shall move me to stand.</a>
<a id='line_145'>I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.</a>

<a id='line_147'>GREGORY.</a>
<a id='line_148'>That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.</a>
<a id='line_149'></a>
<a id='line_150'>SAMPSON.</a>
<a id='line_151'>True, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to</a>
<a id='line_152'>the wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and</a>
<a id='line_153'>thrust his maids to the wall.</a>
<a id='line_154'></a>
<a id='line_155'>GREGORY.</a>

<a id='line_160'>men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>GREGORY.</a>
<a id='line_163'>The heads of the maids?</a>
<a id='line_164'></a>
<a id='line_165'>SAMPSON.</a>
<a id='line_166'>Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense</a>
<a id='line_167'>thou wilt.</a>
<a id='line_168'></a>
<a id='line_169'>GREGORY.</a>
<a id='line_170'>They must take it in sense that feel it.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>SAMPSON.</a>
<a id='line_173'>Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I am a</a>
<a id='line_174'>pretty piece of flesh.</a>
<a id='line_175'></a>
<a id='line_176'>GREGORY.</a>
<a id='line_177'>’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John.</a>
<a id='line_178'>Draw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues.</a>

<a id='line_195'>Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>GREGORY.</a>
<a id='line_198'>I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.</a>
<a id='line_199'></a>
<a id='line_200'>SAMPSON.</a>
<a id='line_201'>Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to</a>
<a id='line_202'>them if they bear it.</a>

<a id='line_204'>ABRAM.</a>
<a id='line_205'>Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</a>

<a id='line_217'>No.</a>
<a id='line_218'></a>
<a id='line_219'>SAMPSON.</a>
<a id='line_220'>No sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.</a>

<a id='line_307'>That quench the fire of your pernicious rage</a>
<a id='line_308'>With purple fountains issuing from your veins,</a>
<a id='line_309'>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands</a>
<a id='line_310'>Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground</a>
<a id='line_311'>And hear the sentence of your moved prince.</a>
<a id='line_312'>Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,</a>
<a id='line_313'>By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,</a>
<a id='line_314'>Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,</a>
<a id='line_315'>And made Verona’s ancient citizens</a>
<a id='line_316'>Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,</a>
<a id='line_317'>To wield old partisans, in hands as old,</a>
<a id='line_318'>Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.</a>

<a id='line_334'></a>
<a id='line_335'>BENVOLIO.</a>
<a id='line_336'>Here were the servants of your adversary</a>
<a id='line_337'>And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.</a>
<a id='line_338'>I drew to part them, in the instant came</a>
<a id='line_339'>The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,</a>
<a id='line_340'>Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,</a>
<a id='line_341'>He swung about his head, and cut the winds,</a>
<a id='line_342'>Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.</a>
<a id='line_343'>While we were interchanging thrusts and blows</a>
<a id='line_344'>Came more and more, and fought on part and part,</a>
<a id='line_345'>Till the Prince came, who parted either part.</a>
<a id='line_346'></a>
<a id='line_347'>LADY MONTAGUE.</a>
<a id='line_348'>O where is Romeo, saw you him today?</a>
<a id='line_349'>Right glad I am he was not at this fray.</a>
<a id='line_350'></a>
<a id='line_351'>BENVOLIO.</a>
<a id='line_352'>Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun</a>
<a id='line_353'>Peer’d forth the golden window of the east,</a>
<a id='line_354'>A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,</a>
<a id='line_355'>Where underneath the grove of sycamore</a>
<a id='line_356'>That westward rooteth from this city side,</a>
<a id='line_357'>So early walking did I see your son.</a>
<a id='line_358'>Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,</a>
<a id='line_359'>And stole into the covert of the wood.</a>
<a id='line_360'>I, measuring his affections by my own,</a>
<a id='line_361'>Which then most sought where most might not be found,</a>
<a id='line_362'>Being one too many by my weary self,</a>
<a id='line_363'>Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,</a>
<a id='line_364'>And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.</a>
<a id='line_365'></a>
<a id='line_366'>MONTAGUE.</a>
<a id='line_367'>Many a morning hath he there been seen,</a>
<a id='line_368'>With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,</a>
<a id='line_369'>Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;</a>
<a id='line_370'>But all so soon as the all-cheering sun</a>
<a id='line_371'>Should in the farthest east begin to draw</a>
<a id='line_372'>The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,</a>
<a id='line_373'>Away from light steals home my heavy son,</a>
<a id='line_374'>And private in his chamber pens himself,</a>
<a id='line_375'>Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out</a>
<a id='line_376'>And makes himself an artificial night.</a>
<a id='line_377'>Black and portentous must this humour prove,</a>
<a id='line_378'>Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</a>
<a id='line_379'></a>
<a id='line_380'>BENVOLIO.</a>
<a id='line_381'>My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</a>
<a id='line_382'></a>
<a id='line_383'>MONTAGUE.</a>
<a id='line_384'>I neither know it nor can learn of him.</a>
<a id='line_385'></a>
<a id='line_386'>BENVOLIO.</a>
<a id='line_387'>Have you importun’d him by any means?</a>
<a id='line_388'></a>
<a id='line_389'>MONTAGUE.</a>
<a id='line_390'>Both by myself and many other friends;</a>
<a id='line_391'>But he, his own affections’ counsellor,</a>
<a id='line_392'>Is to himself—I will not say how true—</a>
<a id='line_393'>But to himself so secret and so close,</a>
<a id='line_394'>So far from sounding and discovery,</a>
<a id='line_395'>As is the bud bit with an envious worm</a>

<a id='line_795'>On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;</a>
<a id='line_796'>That shall she, marry; I remember it well.</a>
<a id='line_797'>’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;</a>
<a id='line_798'>And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—,</a>
<a id='line_799'>Of all the days of the year, upon that day:</a>
<a id='line_800'>For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,</a>
<a id='line_801'>Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;</a>
<a id='line_802'>My lord and you were then at Mantua:</a>
<a id='line_803'>Nay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,</a>
<a id='line_804'>When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple</a>
<a id='line_805'>Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,</a>
<a id='line_806'>To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!</a>
<a id='line_807'>Shake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow,</a>
<a id='line_808'>To bid me trudge.</a>
<a id='line_809'>And since that time it is eleven years;</a>
<a id='line_810'>For then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood</a>

<a id='line_812'>For even the day before she broke her brow,</a>
<a id='line_813'>And then my husband,—God be with his soul!</a>

<a id='line_1029'>O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.</a>
<a id='line_1030'>She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes</a>
<a id='line_1031'>In shape no bigger than an agate-stone</a>
<a id='line_1032'>On the fore-finger of an alderman,</a>
<a id='line_1033'>Drawn with a team of little atomies</a>
<a id='line_1034'>Over men’s noses as they lie asleep:</a>
<a id='line_1035'>Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;</a>
<a id='line_1036'>The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;</a>
<a id='line_1037'>Her traces, of the smallest spider’s web;</a>
<a id='line_1038'>The collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;</a>
<a id='line_1039'>Her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;</a>
<a id='line_1040'>Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,</a>
<a id='line_1041'>Not half so big as a round little worm</a>
<a id='line_1042'>Prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:</a>
<a id='line_1043'>Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,</a>
<a id='line_1044'>Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,</a>
<a id='line_1045'>Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.</a>
<a id='line_1046'>And in this state she gallops night by night</a>
<a id='line_1047'>Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;</a>
<a id='line_1048'>O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;</a>
<a id='line_1049'>O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;</a>
<a id='line_1050'>O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,</a>
<a id='line_1051'>Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,</a>
<a id='line_1052'>Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:</a>
<a id='line_1053'>Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,</a>
<a id='line_1054'>And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;</a>
<a id='line_1055'>And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,</a>
<a id='line_1056'>Tickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,</a>
<a id='line_1057'>Then dreams he of another benefice:</a>
<a id='line_1058'>Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,</a>
<a id='line_1059'>And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,</a>
<a id='line_1060'>Of breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,</a>
<a id='line_1061'>Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon</a>
<a id='line_1062'>Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;</a>
<a id='line_1063'>And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,</a>
<a id='line_1064'>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab</a>
<a id='line_1065'>That plats the manes of horses in the night;</a>
<a id='line_1066'>And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,</a>
<a id='line_1067'>Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:</a>

<a id='line_3354'> Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and Paris.</a>
<a id='line_3355'></a>
<a id='line_3356'>CAPULET.</a>
<a id='line_3357'>Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily</a>
<a id='line_3358'>That we have had no time to move our daughter.</a>
<a id='line_3359'>Look you, she lov’d her kinsman Tybalt dearly,</a>
<a id='line_3360'>And so did I. Well, we were born to die.</a>
<a id='line_3361'>’Tis very late; she’ll not come down tonight.</a>
<a id='line_3362'>I promise you, but for your company,</a>
<a id='line_3363'>I would have been abed an hour ago.</a>
<a id='line_3364'></a>
<a id='line_3365'>PARIS.</a>
<a id='line_3366'>These times of woe afford no tune to woo.</a>
<a id='line_3367'>Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.</a>
<a id='line_3368'></a>
<a id='line_3369'>LADY CAPULET.</a>
<a id='line_3370'>I will, and know her mind early tomorrow;</a>
<a id='line_3371'>Tonight she’s mew’d up to her heaviness.</a>
<a id='line_3372'></a>
<a id='line_3373'>CAPULET.</a>
<a id='line_3374'>Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender</a>
<a id='line_3375'>Of my child’s love. I think she will be rul’d</a>
<a id='line_3376'>In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.</a>
<a id='line_3377'>Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,</a>
<a id='line_3378'>Acquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,</a>
<a id='line_3379'>And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,</a>
<a id='line_3380'>But, soft, what day is this?</a>
<a id='line_3381'></a>
<a id='line_3382'>PARIS.</a>
<a id='line_3383'>Monday, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_3384'></a>
<a id='line_3385'>CAPULET.</a>
<a id='line_3386'>Monday! Ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,</a>
<a id='line_3387'>A Thursday let it be; a Thursday, tell her,</a>
<a id='line_3388'>She shall be married to this noble earl.</a>
<a id='line_3389'>Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?</a>
<a id='line_3390'>We’ll keep no great ado,—a friend or two,</a>
<a id='line_3391'>For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,</a>
<a id='line_3392'>It may be thought we held him carelessly,</a>
<a id='line_3393'>Being our kinsman, if we revel much.</a>
<a id='line_3394'>Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,</a>
<a id='line_3395'>And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?</a>
<a id='line_3396'></a>
<a id='line_3397'>PARIS.</a>
<a id='line_3398'>My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.</a>
<a id='line_3399'></a>
<a id='line_3400'>CAPULET.</a>
<a id='line_3401'>Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.</a>
<a id='line_3402'>Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,</a>
<a id='line_3403'>Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.</a>
<a id='line_3404'>Farewell, my lord.—Light to my chamber, ho!</a>
<a id='line_3405'>Afore me, it is so very very late that we</a>
<a id='line_3406'>May call it early by and by. Good night.</a>

<a id='line_3414'>JULIET.</a>
<a id='line_3415'>Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.</a>
<a id='line_3416'>It was the nightingale, and not the lark,</a>
<a id='line_3417'>That pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;</a>
<a id='line_3418'>Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.</a>

<a id='line_3421'>ROMEO.</a>
<a id='line_3422'>It was the lark, the herald of the morn,</a>
<a id='line_3423'>No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks</a>
<a id='line_3424'>Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.</a>
<a id='line_3425'>Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day</a>
<a id='line_3426'>Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.</a>
<a id='line_3427'>I must be gone and live, or stay and die.</a>
<a id='line_3428'></a>
<a id='line_3429'>JULIET.</a>
<a id='line_3430'>Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I.</a>
<a id='line_3431'>It is some meteor that the sun exhales</a>

<a id='line_3433'>And light thee on thy way to Mantua.</a>

<a id='line_3440'>’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.</a>
<a id='line_3441'>Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat</a>
<a id='line_3442'>The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.</a>
<a id='line_3443'>I have more care to stay than will to go.</a>
<a id='line_3444'>Come, death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so.</a>
<a id='line_3445'>How is’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.</a>
<a id='line_3446'></a>
<a id='line_3447'>JULIET.</a>
<a id='line_3448'>It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away.</a>
<a id='line_3449'>It is the lark that sings so out of tune,</a>
<a id='line_3450'>Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.</a>
<a id='line_3451'>Some say the lark makes sweet division;</a>
<a id='line_3452'>This doth not so, for she divideth us.</a>
<a id='line_3453'>Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes.</a>
<a id='line_3454'>O, now I would they had chang’d voices too,</a>
<a id='line_3455'>Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,</a>

<a id='line_3994'>The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade</a>
<a id='line_3995'>To paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,</a>
<a id='line_3996'>Like death when he shuts up the day of life.</a>
<a id='line_3997'>Each part depriv’d of supple government,</a>
<a id='line_3998'>Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death.</a>
<a id='line_3999'>And in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death</a>
<a id='line_4000'>Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,</a>

<a id='line_5174'>At the prefixed hour of her waking</a>
<a id='line_5175'>Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,</a>

<a id='line_5181'>She wakes; and I entreated her come forth</a>
<a id='line_5182'>And bear this work of heaven with patience.</a>
<a id='line_5183'>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;</a>
<a id='line_5184'>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</a>
<a id='line_5185'>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.</a>
<a id='line_5186'>All this I know; and to the marriage</a>
<a id='line_5187'>Her Nurse is privy. And if ought in this</a>
<a id='line_5188'>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</a>
<a id='line_5189'>Be sacrific’d, some hour before his time,</a>
<a id='line_5190'>Unto the rigour of severest law.</a>
<a id='line_5191'></a>
<a id='line_5192'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_5193'>We still have known thee for a holy man.</a>
<a id='line_5194'>Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?</a>
<a id='line_5195'></a>
<a id='line_5196'>BALTHASAR.</a>
<a id='line_5197'>I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,</a>
<a id='line_5198'>And then in post he came from Mantua</a>
<a id='line_5199'>To this same place, to this same monument.</a>
<a id='line_5200'>This letter he early bid me give his father,</a>
<a id='line_5201'>And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,</a>
<a id='line_5202'>If I departed not, and left him there.</a>
<a id='line_5203'></a>
<a id='line_5204'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_5205'>Give me the letter, I will look on it.</a>
<a id='line_5206'>Where is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?</a>
<a id='line_5207'>Sirrah, what made your master in this place?</a>
<a id='line_5208'></a>
<a id='line_5209'>PAGE.</a>
<a id='line_5210'>He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,</a>
<a id='line_5211'>And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.</a>
<a id='line_5212'>Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,</a>
<a id='line_5213'>And by and by my master drew on him,</a>
<a id='line_5214'>And then I ran away to call the watch.</a>
<a id='line_5215'></a>
<a id='line_5216'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_5217'>This letter doth make good the Friar’s words,</a>
<a id='line_5218'>Their course of love, the tidings of her death.</a>
<a id='line_5219'>And here he writes that he did buy a poison</a>
<a id='line_5220'>Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal</a>
<a id='line_5221'>Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.</a>
<a id='line_5222'>Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,</a>
<a id='line_5223'>See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,</a>
<a id='line_5224'>That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!</a>
<a id='line_5225'>And I, for winking at your discords too,</a>
<a id='line_5226'>Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.</a>
<a id='line_5227'></a>
<a id='line_5228'>CAPULET.</a>
<a id='line_5229'>O brother Montague, give me thy hand.</a>
<a id='line_5230'>This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more</a>
<a id='line_5231'>Can I demand.</a>
<a id='line_5232'></a>
<a id='line_5233'>MONTAGUE.</a>
<a id='line_5234'>But I can give thee more,</a>
<a id='line_5235'>For I will raise her statue in pure gold,</a>
<a id='line_5236'>That whiles Verona by that name is known,</a>
<a id='line_5237'>There shall no figure at such rate be set</a>
<a id='line_5238'>As that of true and faithful Juliet.</a>
<a id='line_5239'></a>
<a id='line_5240'>CAPULET.</a>
<a id='line_5241'>As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,</a>
<a id='line_5242'>Poor sacrifices of our enmity.</a>
<a id='line_5243'></a>
<a id='line_5244'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_5245'>A glooming peace this morning with it brings;</a>
<a id='line_5246'>The sun for sorrow will not show his head.</a>
<a id='line_5247'>Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things.</a>
<a id='line_5248'>Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished,</a>
<a id='line_5249'>For never was a story of more woe</a>
<a id='line_5250'>Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</a>
