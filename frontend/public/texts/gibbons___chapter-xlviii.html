                    <a id='line_0'>Chapter XLVIII: Succession And Characters Of The Greek</a>
<a id='line_1'>      Emperors.—Part I.</a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>     Plan Of The Two Last Volumes.—Succession And Characters Of The</a>
<a id='line_4'>     Greek Emperors Of Constantinople, From The Time Of Heraclius To</a>
<a id='line_5'>     The Latin Conquest.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>      I have now deduced from Trajan to Constantine, from Constantine</a>
<a id='line_8'>      to Heraclius, the regular series of the Roman emperors; and</a>
<a id='line_9'>      faithfully exposed the prosperous and adverse fortunes of their</a>
<a id='line_10'>      reigns. Five centuries of the decline and fall of the empire have</a>
<a id='line_11'>      already elapsed; but a period of more than eight hundred years</a>
<a id='line_12'>      still separates me from the term of my labors, the taking of</a>
<a id='line_13'>      Constantinople by the Turks. Should I persevere in the same</a>
<a id='line_14'>      course, should I observe the same measure, a prolix and slender</a>
<a id='line_15'>      thread would be spun through many a volume, nor would the patient</a>
<a id='line_16'>      reader find an adequate reward of instruction or amusement. At</a>
<a id='line_17'>      every step, as we sink deeper in the decline and fall of the</a>
<a id='line_18'>      Eastern empire, the annals of each succeeding reign would impose</a>
<a id='line_19'>      a more ungrateful and melancholy task. These annals must continue</a>
<a id='line_20'>      to repeat a tedious and uniform tale of weakness and misery; the</a>
<a id='line_21'>      natural connection of causes and events would be broken by</a>
<a id='line_22'>      frequent and hasty transitions, and a minute accumulation of</a>
<a id='line_23'>      circumstances must destroy the light and effect of those general</a>
<a id='line_24'>      pictures which compose the use and ornament of a remote history.</a>
<a id='line_25'>      From the time of Heraclius, the Byzantine theatre is contracted</a>
<a id='line_26'>      and darkened: the line of empire, which had been defined by the</a>
<a id='line_27'>      laws of Justinian and the arms of Belisarius, recedes on all</a>
<a id='line_28'>      sides from our view; the Roman name, the proper subject of our</a>
<a id='line_29'>      inquiries, is reduced to a narrow corner of Europe, to the lonely</a>
<a id='line_30'>      suburbs of Constantinople; and the fate of the Greek empire has</a>
<a id='line_31'>      been compared to that of the Rhine, which loses itself in the</a>
<a id='line_32'>      sands, before its waters can mingle with the ocean. The scale of</a>
<a id='line_33'>      dominion is diminished to our view by the distance of time and</a>
<a id='line_34'>      place; nor is the loss of external splendor compensated by the</a>
<a id='line_35'>      nobler gifts of virtue and genius. In the last moments of her</a>
<a id='line_36'>      decay, Constantinople was doubtless more opulent and populous</a>
<a id='line_37'>      than Athens at her most flourishing aera, when a scanty sum of</a>
<a id='line_38'>      six thousand talents, or twelve hundred thousand pounds sterling</a>
<a id='line_39'>      was possessed by twenty-one thousand male citizens of an adult</a>
<a id='line_40'>      age. But each of these citizens was a freeman, who dared to</a>
<a id='line_41'>      assert the liberty of his thoughts, words, and actions, whose</a>
<a id='line_42'>      person and property were guarded by equal law; and who exercised</a>
<a id='line_43'>      his independent vote in the government of the republic. Their</a>
<a id='line_44'>      numbers seem to be multiplied by the strong and various</a>
<a id='line_45'>      discriminations of character; under the shield of freedom, on the</a>
<a id='line_46'>      wings of emulation and vanity, each Athenian aspired to the level</a>
<a id='line_47'>      of the national dignity; from this commanding eminence, some</a>
<a id='line_48'>      chosen spirits soared beyond the reach of a vulgar eye; and the</a>
<a id='line_49'>      chances of superior merit in a great and populous kingdom, as</a>
<a id='line_50'>      they are proved by experience, would excuse the computation of</a>
<a id='line_51'>      imaginary millions. The territories of Athens, Sparta, and their</a>
<a id='line_52'>      allies, do not exceed a moderate province of France or England;</a>
<a id='line_53'>      but after the trophies of Salamis and Platea, they expand in our</a>
<a id='line_54'>      fancy to the gigantic size of Asia, which had been trampled under</a>
<a id='line_55'>      the feet of the victorious Greeks. But the subjects of the</a>
<a id='line_56'>      Byzantine empire, who assume and dishonor the names both of</a>
<a id='line_57'>      Greeks and Romans, present a dead uniformity of abject vices,</a>
<a id='line_58'>      which are neither softened by the weakness of humanity, nor</a>
<a id='line_59'>      animated by the vigor of memorable crimes. The freemen of</a>
<a id='line_60'>      antiquity might repeat with generous enthusiasm the sentence of</a>
<a id='line_61'>      Homer, “that on the first day of his servitude, the captive is</a>
<a id='line_62'>      deprived of one half of his manly virtue.” But the poet had only</a>
<a id='line_63'>      seen the effects of civil or domestic slavery, nor could he</a>
<a id='line_64'>      foretell that the second moiety of manhood must be annihilated by</a>
<a id='line_65'>      the spiritual despotism which shackles not only the actions, but</a>
<a id='line_66'>      even the thoughts, of the prostrate votary. By this double yoke,</a>
<a id='line_67'>      the Greeks were oppressed under the successors of Heraclius; the</a>
<a id='line_68'>      tyrant, a law of eternal justice, was degraded by the vices of</a>
<a id='line_69'>      his subjects; and on the throne, in the camp, in the schools, we</a>
<a id='line_70'>      search, perhaps with fruitless diligence, the names and</a>
<a id='line_71'>      characters that may deserve to be rescued from oblivion. Nor are</a>
<a id='line_72'>      the defects of the subject compensated by the skill and variety</a>
<a id='line_73'>      of the painters. Of a space of eight hundred years, the four</a>
<a id='line_74'>      first centuries are overspread with a cloud interrupted by some</a>
<a id='line_75'>      faint and broken rays of historic light: in the lives of the</a>
<a id='line_76'>      emperors, from Maurice to Alexius, Basil the Macedonian has alone</a>
<a id='line_77'>      been the theme of a separate work; and the absence, or loss, or</a>
<a id='line_78'>      imperfection of contemporary evidence, must be poorly supplied by</a>
<a id='line_79'>      the doubtful authority of more recent compilers. The four last</a>
<a id='line_80'>      centuries are exempt from the reproach of penury; and with the</a>
<a id='line_81'>      Comnenian family, the historic muse of Constantinople again</a>
<a id='line_82'>      revives, but her apparel is gaudy, her motions are without</a>
<a id='line_83'>      elegance or grace. A succession of priests, or courtiers, treads</a>
<a id='line_84'>      in each other’s footsteps in the same path of servitude and</a>
<a id='line_85'>      superstition: their views are narrow, their judgment is feeble or</a>
<a id='line_86'>      corrupt; and we close the volume of copious barrenness, still</a>
<a id='line_87'>      ignorant of the causes of events, the characters of the actors,</a>
<a id='line_88'>      and the manners of the times which they celebrate or deplore. The</a>
<a id='line_89'>      observation which has been applied to a man, may be extended to a</a>
<a id='line_90'>      whole people, that the energy of the sword is communicated to the</a>
<a id='line_91'>      pen; and it will be found by experience, that the tone of history</a>
<a id='line_92'>      will rise or fall with the spirit of the age.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>      From these considerations, I should have abandoned without regret</a>
<a id='line_95'>      the Greek slaves and their servile historians, had I not</a>
<a id='line_96'>      reflected that the fate of the Byzantine monarchy is passively</a>
<a id='line_97'>      connected with the most splendid and important revolutions which</a>
<a id='line_98'>      have changed the state of the world. The space of the lost</a>
<a id='line_99'>      provinces was immediately replenished with new colonies and</a>
<a id='line_100'>      rising kingdoms: the active virtues of peace and war deserted</a>
<a id='line_101'>      from the vanquished to the victorious nations; and it is in their</a>
<a id='line_102'>      origin and conquests, in their religion and government, that we</a>
<a id='line_103'>      must explore the causes and effects of the decline and fall of</a>
<a id='line_104'>      the Eastern empire. Nor will this scope of narrative, the riches</a>
<a id='line_105'>      and variety of these materials, be incompatible with the unity of</a>
<a id='line_106'>      design and composition. As, in his daily prayers, the Mussulman</a>
<a id='line_107'>      of Fez or Delhi still turns his face towards the temple of Mecca,</a>
<a id='line_108'>      the historian’s eye shall be always fixed on the city of</a>
<a id='line_109'>      Constantinople. The excursive line may embrace the wilds of</a>
<a id='line_110'>      Arabia and Tartary, but the circle will be ultimately reduced to</a>
<a id='line_111'>      the decreasing limit of the Roman monarchy.</a>
<a id='line_112'></a>
<a id='line_113'>      On this principle I shall now establish the plan of the last two</a>
<a id='line_114'>      volumes of the present work. The first chapter will contain, in a</a>
<a id='line_115'>      regular series, the emperors who reigned at Constantinople during</a>
<a id='line_116'>      a period of six hundred years, from the days of Heraclius to the</a>
<a id='line_117'>      Latin conquest; a rapid abstract, which may be supported by a</a>
<a id='line_118'>      general appeal to the order and text of the original historians.</a>
<a id='line_119'>      In this introduction, I shall confine myself to the revolutions</a>
<a id='line_120'>      of the throne, the succession of families, the personal</a>
<a id='line_121'>      characters of the Greek princes, the mode of their life and</a>
<a id='line_122'>      death, the maxims and influence of their domestic government, and</a>
<a id='line_123'>      the tendency of their reign to accelerate or suspend the downfall</a>
<a id='line_124'>      of the Eastern empire. Such a chronological review will serve to</a>
<a id='line_125'>      illustrate the various argument of the subsequent chapters; and</a>
<a id='line_126'>      each circumstance of the eventful story of the Barbarians will</a>
<a id='line_127'>      adapt itself in a proper place to the Byzantine annals. The</a>
<a id='line_128'>      internal state of the empire, and the dangerous heresy of the</a>
<a id='line_129'>      Paulicians, which shook the East and enlightened the West, will</a>
<a id='line_130'>      be the subject of two separate chapters; but these inquiries must</a>
<a id='line_131'>      be postponed till our further progress shall have opened the view</a>
<a id='line_132'>      of the world in the ninth and tenth centuries of the Christian</a>
<a id='line_133'>      area. After this foundation of Byzantine history, the following</a>
<a id='line_134'>      nations will pass before our eyes, and each will occupy the space</a>
<a id='line_135'>      to which it may be entitled by greatness or merit, or the degree</a>
<a id='line_136'>      of connection with the Roman world and the present age. I. The</a>
<a id='line_137'>      Franks; a general appellation which includes all the Barbarians</a>
<a id='line_138'>      of France, Italy, and Germany, who were united by the sword and</a>
<a id='line_139'>      sceptre of Charlemagne. The persecution of images and their</a>
<a id='line_140'>      votaries separated Rome and Italy from the Byzantine throne, and</a>
<a id='line_141'>      prepared the restoration of the Roman empire in the West. II. The</a>
<a id='line_142'>      Arabs or Saracens. Three ample chapters will be devoted to this</a>
<a id='line_143'>      curious and interesting object. In the first, after a picture of</a>
<a id='line_144'>      the country and its inhabitants, I shall investigate the</a>
<a id='line_145'>      character of Mahomet; the character, religion, and success of the</a>
<a id='line_146'>      prophet. In the second, I shall lead the Arabs to the conquest of</a>
<a id='line_147'>      Syria, Egypt, and Africa, the provinces of the Roman empire; nor</a>
<a id='line_148'>      can I check their victorious career till they have overthrown the</a>
<a id='line_149'>      monarchies of Persia and Spain. In the third, I shall inquire how</a>
<a id='line_150'>      Constantinople and Europe were saved by the luxury and arts, the</a>
<a id='line_151'>      division and decay, of the empire of the caliphs. A single</a>
<a id='line_152'>      chapter will include, III. The Bulgarians, IV. Hungarians, and,</a>
<a id='line_153'>      V. Russians, who assaulted by sea or by land the provinces and</a>
<a id='line_154'>      the capital; but the last of these, so important in their present</a>
<a id='line_155'>      greatness, will excite some curiosity in their origin and</a>
<a id='line_156'>      infancy. VI. The Normans; or rather the private adventurers of</a>
<a id='line_157'>      that warlike people, who founded a powerful kingdom in Apulia and</a>
<a id='line_158'>      Sicily, shook the throne of Constantinople, displayed the</a>
<a id='line_159'>      trophies of chivalry, and almost realized the wonders of romance.</a>
<a id='line_160'></a>
<a id='line_161'>      VII. The Latins; the subjects of the pope, the nations of the</a>
<a id='line_162'>      West, who enlisted under the banner of the cross for the recovery</a>
<a id='line_163'>      or relief of the holy sepulchre. The Greek emperors were</a>
<a id='line_164'>      terrified and preserved by the myriads of pilgrims who marched to</a>
<a id='line_165'>      Jerusalem with Godfrey of Bouillon and the peers of Christendom.</a>
<a id='line_166'>      The second and third crusades trod in the footsteps of the first:</a>
<a id='line_167'>      Asia and Europe were mingled in a sacred war of two hundred</a>
<a id='line_168'>      years; and the Christian powers were bravely resisted, and</a>
<a id='line_169'>      finally expelled by Saladin and the Mamelukes of Egypt. In these</a>
<a id='line_170'>      memorable crusades, a fleet and army of French and Venetians were</a>
<a id='line_171'>      diverted from Syria to the Thracian Bosphorus: they assaulted the</a>
<a id='line_172'>      capital, they subverted the Greek monarchy: and a dynasty of</a>
<a id='line_173'>      Latin princes was seated near threescore years on the throne of</a>
<a id='line_174'>      Constantine. VII. The Greeks themselves, during this period of</a>
<a id='line_175'>      captivity and exile, must be considered as a foreign nation; the</a>
<a id='line_176'>      enemies, and again the sovereigns of Constantinople. Misfortune</a>
<a id='line_177'>      had rekindled a spark of national virtue; and the Imperial series</a>
<a id='line_178'>      may be continued with some dignity from their restoration to the</a>
<a id='line_179'>      Turkish conquest. IX. The Moguls and Tartars. By the arms of</a>
<a id='line_180'>      Zingis and his descendants, the globe was shaken from China to</a>
<a id='line_181'>      Poland and Greece: the sultans were overthrown: the caliphs fell,</a>
<a id='line_182'>      and the Caesars trembled on their throne. The victories of Timour</a>
<a id='line_183'>      suspended above fifty years the final ruin of the Byzantine</a>
<a id='line_184'>      empire. X. I have already noticed the first appearance of the</a>
<a id='line_185'>      Turks; and the names of the fathers, of Seljuk and Othman,</a>
<a id='line_186'>      discriminate the two successive dynasties of the nation, which</a>
<a id='line_187'>      emerged in the eleventh century from the Scythian wilderness. The</a>
<a id='line_188'>      former established a splendid and potent kingdom from the banks</a>
<a id='line_189'>      of the Oxus to Antioch and Nice; and the first crusade was</a>
<a id='line_190'>      provoked by the violation of Jerusalem and the danger of</a>
<a id='line_191'>      Constantinople. From an humble origin, the Ottomans arose, the</a>
<a id='line_192'>      scourge and terror of Christendom. Constantinople was besieged</a>
<a id='line_193'>      and taken by Mahomet II., and his triumph annihilates the</a>
<a id='line_194'>      remnant, the image, the title, of the Roman empire in the East.</a>
<a id='line_195'>      The schism of the Greeks will be connected with their last</a>
<a id='line_196'>      calamities, and the restoration of learning in the Western world.</a>
<a id='line_197'></a>
<a id='line_198'>      I shall return from the captivity of the new, to the ruins of</a>
<a id='line_199'>      ancient Rome; and the venerable name, the interesting theme, will</a>
<a id='line_200'>      shed a ray of glory on the conclusion of my labors.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>      The emperor Heraclius had punished a tyrant and ascended his</a>
<a id='line_203'>      throne; and the memory of his reign is perpetuated by the</a>
<a id='line_204'>      transient conquest, and irreparable loss, of the Eastern</a>
<a id='line_205'>      provinces. After the death of Eudocia, his first wife, he</a>
<a id='line_206'>      disobeyed the patriarch, and violated the laws, by his second</a>
<a id='line_207'>      marriage with his niece Martina; and the superstition of the</a>
<a id='line_208'>      Greeks beheld the judgment of Heaven in the diseases of the</a>
<a id='line_209'>      father and the deformity of his offspring. But the opinion of an</a>
<a id='line_210'>      illegitimate birth is sufficient to distract the choice, and</a>
<a id='line_211'>      loosen the obedience, of the people: the ambition of Martina was</a>
<a id='line_212'>      quickened by maternal love, and perhaps by the envy of a</a>
<a id='line_213'>      step-mother; and the aged husband was too feeble to withstand the</a>
<a id='line_214'>      arts of conjugal allurements. Constantine, his eldest son,</a>
<a id='line_215'>      enjoyed in a mature age the title of Augustus; but the weakness</a>
<a id='line_216'>      of his constitution required a colleague and a guardian, and he</a>
<a id='line_217'>      yielded with secret reluctance to the partition of the empire.</a>
<a id='line_218'>      The senate was summoned to the palace to ratify or attest the</a>
<a id='line_219'>      association of Heracleonas, the son of Martina: the imposition of</a>
<a id='line_220'>      the diadem was consecrated by the prayer and blessing of the</a>
<a id='line_221'>      patriarch; the senators and patricians adored the majesty of the</a>
<a id='line_222'>      great emperor and the partners of his reign; and as soon as the</a>
<a id='line_223'>      doors were thrown open, they were hailed by the tumultuary but</a>
<a id='line_224'>      important voice of the soldiers. After an interval of five</a>
<a id='line_225'>      months, the pompous ceremonies which formed the essence of the</a>
<a id='line_226'>      Byzantine state were celebrated in the cathedral and the</a>
<a id='line_227'>      hippodrome; the concord of the royal brothers was affectedly</a>
<a id='line_228'>      displayed by the younger leaning on the arm of the elder; and the</a>
<a id='line_229'>      name of Martina was mingled in the reluctant or venal</a>
<a id='line_230'>      acclamations of the people. Heraclius survived this association</a>
<a id='line_231'>      about two years: his last testimony declared his two sons the</a>
<a id='line_232'>      equal heirs of the Eastern empire, and commanded them to honor</a>
<a id='line_233'>      his widow Martina as their mother and their sovereign.</a>
<a id='line_234'></a>
<a id='line_235'>      When Martina first appeared on the throne with the name and</a>
<a id='line_236'>      attributes of royalty, she was checked by a firm, though</a>
<a id='line_237'>      respectful, opposition; and the dying embers of freedom were</a>
<a id='line_238'>      kindled by the breath of superstitious prejudice. “We reverence,”</a>
<a id='line_239'>      exclaimed the voice of a citizen, “we reverence the mother of our</a>
<a id='line_240'>      princes; but to those princes alone our obedience is due; and</a>
<a id='line_241'>      Constantine, the elder emperor, is of an age to sustain, in his</a>
<a id='line_242'>      own hands, the weight of the sceptre. Your sex is excluded by</a>
<a id='line_243'>      nature from the toils of government. How could you combat, how</a>
<a id='line_244'>      could you answer, the Barbarians, who, with hostile or friendly</a>
<a id='line_245'>      intentions, may approach the royal city? May Heaven avert from</a>
<a id='line_246'>      the Roman republic this national disgrace, which would provoke</a>
<a id='line_247'>      the patience of the slaves of Persia!” Martina descended from the</a>
<a id='line_248'>      throne with indignation, and sought a refuge in the female</a>
<a id='line_249'>      apartment of the palace. The reign of Constantine the Third</a>
<a id='line_250'>      lasted only one hundred and three days: he expired in the</a>
<a id='line_251'>      thirtieth year of his age, and, although his life had been a long</a>
<a id='line_252'>      malady, a belief was entertained that poison had been the means,</a>
<a id='line_253'>      and his cruel step-mother the author, of his untimely fate.</a>
<a id='line_254'>      Martina reaped indeed the harvest of his death, and assumed the</a>
<a id='line_255'>      government in the name of the surviving emperor; but the</a>
<a id='line_256'>      incestuous widow of Heraclius was universally abhorred; the</a>
<a id='line_257'>      jealousy of the people was awakened, and the two orphans whom</a>
<a id='line_258'>      Constantine had left became the objects of the public care. It</a>
<a id='line_259'>      was in vain that the son of Martina, who was no more than fifteen</a>
<a id='line_260'>      years of age, was taught to declare himself the guardian of his</a>
<a id='line_261'>      nephews, one of whom he had presented at the baptismal font: it</a>
<a id='line_262'>      was in vain that he swore on the wood of the true cross, to</a>
<a id='line_263'>      defend them against all their enemies. On his death-bed, the late</a>
<a id='line_264'>      emperor had despatched a trusty servant to arm the troops and</a>
<a id='line_265'>      provinces of the East in the defence of his helpless children:</a>
<a id='line_266'>      the eloquence and liberality of Valentin had been successful, and</a>
<a id='line_267'>      from his camp of Chalcedon, he boldly demanded the punishment of</a>
<a id='line_268'>      the assassins, and the restoration of the lawful heir. The</a>
<a id='line_269'>      license of the soldiers, who devoured the grapes and drank the</a>
<a id='line_270'>      wine of their Asiatic vineyards, provoked the citizens of</a>
<a id='line_271'>      Constantinople against the domestic authors of their calamities,</a>
<a id='line_272'>      and the dome of St. Sophia reechoed, not with prayers and hymns,</a>
<a id='line_273'>      but with the clamors and imprecations of an enraged multitude. At</a>
<a id='line_274'>      their imperious command, Heracleonas appeared in the pulpit with</a>
<a id='line_275'>      the eldest of the royal orphans; Constans alone was saluted as</a>
<a id='line_276'>      emperor of the Romans, and a crown of gold, which had been taken</a>
<a id='line_277'>      from the tomb of Heraclius, was placed on his head, with the</a>
<a id='line_278'>      solemn benediction of the patriarch.</a>
<a id='line_279'></a>
<a id='line_280'>      But in the tumult of joy and indignation, the church was</a>
<a id='line_281'>      pillaged, the sanctuary was polluted by a promiscuous crowd of</a>
<a id='line_282'>      Jews and Barbarians; and the Monothelite Pyrrhus, a creature of</a>
<a id='line_283'>      the empress, after dropping a protestation on the altar, escaped</a>
<a id='line_284'>      by a prudent flight from the zeal of the Catholics. A more</a>
<a id='line_285'>      serious and bloody task was reserved for the senate, who derived</a>
<a id='line_286'>      a temporary strength from the consent of the soldiers and people.</a>
<a id='line_287'></a>
<a id='line_288'>      The spirit of Roman freedom revived the ancient and awful</a>
<a id='line_289'>      examples of the judgment of tyrants, and the Imperial culprits</a>
<a id='line_290'>      were deposed and condemned as the authors of the death of</a>
<a id='line_291'>      Constantine. But the severity of the conscript fathers was</a>
<a id='line_292'>      stained by the indiscriminate punishment of the innocent and the</a>
<a id='line_293'>      guilty: Martina and Heracleonas were sentenced to the amputation,</a>
<a id='line_294'>      the former of her tongue, the latter of his nose; and after this</a>
<a id='line_295'>      cruel execution, they consumed the remainder of their days in</a>
<a id='line_296'>      exile and oblivion. The Greeks who were capable of reflection</a>
<a id='line_297'>      might find some consolation for their servitude, by observing the</a>
<a id='line_298'>      abuse of power when it was lodged for a moment in the hands of an</a>
<a id='line_299'>      aristocracy.</a>
<a id='line_300'></a>
<a id='line_301'>      We shall imagine ourselves transported five hundred years</a>
<a id='line_302'>      backwards to the age of the Antonines, if we listen to the</a>
<a id='line_303'>      oration which Constans II. pronounced in the twelfth year of his</a>
<a id='line_304'>      age before the Byzantine senate. After returning his thanks for</a>
<a id='line_305'>      the just punishment of the assassins, who had intercepted the</a>
<a id='line_306'>      fairest hopes of his father’s reign, “By the divine Providence,”</a>
<a id='line_307'>      said the young emperor, “and by your righteous decree, Martina</a>
<a id='line_308'>      and her incestuous progeny have been cast headlong from the</a>
<a id='line_309'>      throne. Your majesty and wisdom have prevented the Roman state</a>
<a id='line_310'>      from degenerating into lawless tyranny. I therefore exhort and</a>
<a id='line_311'>      beseech you to stand forth as the counsellors and judges of the</a>
<a id='line_312'>      common safety.” The senators were gratified by the respectful</a>
<a id='line_313'>      address and liberal donative of their sovereign; but these</a>
<a id='line_314'>      servile Greeks were unworthy and regardless of freedom; and in</a>
<a id='line_315'>      his mind, the lesson of an hour was quickly erased by the</a>
<a id='line_316'>      prejudices of the age and the habits of despotism. He retained</a>
<a id='line_317'>      only a jealous fear lest the senate or people should one day</a>
<a id='line_318'>      invade the right of primogeniture, and seat his brother</a>
<a id='line_319'>      Theodosius on an equal throne. By the imposition of holy orders,</a>
<a id='line_320'>      the grandson of Heraclius was disqualified for the purple; but</a>
<a id='line_321'>      this ceremony, which seemed to profane the sacraments of the</a>
<a id='line_322'>      church, was insufficient to appease the suspicions of the tyrant,</a>
<a id='line_323'>      and the death of the deacon Theodosius could alone expiate the</a>
<a id='line_324'>      crime of his royal birth. 1111 His murder was avenged by the</a>
<a id='line_325'>      imprecations of the people, and the assassin, in the fullness of</a>
<a id='line_326'>      power, was driven from his capital into voluntary and perpetual</a>
<a id='line_327'>      exile. Constans embarked for Greece and, as if he meant to retort</a>
<a id='line_328'>      the abhorrence which he deserved he is said, from the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_329'>      galley, to have spit against the walls of his native city. After</a>
<a id='line_330'>      passing the winter at Athens, he sailed to Tarentum in Italy,</a>
<a id='line_331'>      visited Rome, 1112 and concluded a long pilgrimage of disgrace</a>
<a id='line_332'>      and sacrilegious rapine, by fixing his residence at Syracuse. But</a>
<a id='line_333'>      if Constans could fly from his people, he could not fly from</a>
<a id='line_334'>      himself. The remorse of his conscience created a phantom who</a>
<a id='line_335'>      pursued him by land and sea, by day and by night; and the</a>
<a id='line_336'>      visionary Theodosius, presenting to his lips a cup of blood,</a>
<a id='line_337'>      said, or seemed to say, “Drink, brother, drink;” a sure emblem of</a>
<a id='line_338'>      the aggravation of his guilt, since he had received from the</a>
<a id='line_339'>      hands of the deacon the mystic cup of the blood of Christ. Odious</a>
<a id='line_340'>      to himself and to mankind, Constans perished by domestic, perhaps</a>
<a id='line_341'>      by episcopal, treason, in the capital of Sicily. A servant who</a>
<a id='line_342'>      waited in the bath, after pouring warm water on his head, struck</a>
<a id='line_343'>      him violently with the vase. He fell, stunned by the blow, and</a>
<a id='line_344'>      suffocated by the water; and his attendants, who wondered at the</a>
<a id='line_345'>      tedious delay, beheld with indifference the corpse of their</a>
<a id='line_346'>      lifeless emperor. The troops of Sicily invested with the purple</a>
<a id='line_347'>      an obscure youth, whose inimitable beauty eluded, and it might</a>
<a id='line_348'>      easily elude, the declining art of the painters and sculptors of</a>

<a id='line_359'></a>
<a id='line_360'>      Constans had left in the Byzantine palace three sons, the eldest</a>
<a id='line_361'>      of whom had been clothed in his infancy with the purple. When the</a>
<a id='line_362'>      father summoned them to attend his person in Sicily, these</a>
<a id='line_363'>      precious hostages were detained by the Greeks, and a firm refusal</a>
<a id='line_364'>      informed him that they were the children of the state. The news</a>
<a id='line_365'>      of his murder was conveyed with almost supernatural speed from</a>
<a id='line_366'>      Syracuse to Constantinople; and Constantine, the eldest of his</a>
<a id='line_367'>      sons, inherited his throne without being the heir of the public</a>
<a id='line_368'>      hatred. His subjects contributed, with zeal and alacrity, to</a>
<a id='line_369'>      chastise the guilt and presumption of a province which had</a>
<a id='line_370'>      usurped the rights of the senate and people; the young emperor</a>
<a id='line_371'>      sailed from the Hellespont with a powerful fleet; and the legions</a>
<a id='line_372'>      of Rome and Carthage were assembled under his standard in the</a>
<a id='line_373'>      harbor of Syracuse. The defeat of the Sicilian tyrant was easy,</a>
<a id='line_374'>      his punishment just, and his beauteous head was exposed in the</a>
<a id='line_375'>      hippodrome: but I cannot applaud the clemency of a prince, who,</a>
<a id='line_376'>      among a crowd of victims, condemned the son of a patrician, for</a>
<a id='line_377'>      deploring with some bitterness the execution of a virtuous</a>
<a id='line_378'>      father. The youth was castrated: he survived the operation, and</a>
<a id='line_379'>      the memory of this indecent cruelty is preserved by the elevation</a>
<a id='line_380'>      of Germanus to the rank of a patriarch and saint. After pouring</a>
<a id='line_381'>      this bloody libation on his father’s tomb, Constantine returned</a>
<a id='line_382'>      to his capital; and the growth of his young beard during the</a>
<a id='line_383'>      Sicilian voyage was announced, by the familiar surname of</a>
<a id='line_384'>      Pogonatus, to the Grecian world. But his reign, like that of his</a>
<a id='line_385'>      predecessor, was stained with fraternal discord. On his two</a>
<a id='line_386'>      brothers, Heraclius and Tiberius, he had bestowed the title of</a>
<a id='line_387'>      Augustus; an empty title, for they continued to languish, without</a>
<a id='line_388'>      trust or power, in the solitude of the palace. At their secret</a>
<a id='line_389'>      instigation, the troops of the Anatolian theme or province</a>
<a id='line_390'>      approached the city on the Asiatic side, demanded for the royal</a>
<a id='line_391'>      brothers the partition or exercise of sovereignty, and supported</a>
<a id='line_392'>      their seditious claim by a theological argument. They were</a>
<a id='line_393'>      Christians, (they cried,) and orthodox Catholics; the sincere</a>
<a id='line_394'>      votaries of the holy and undivided Trinity. Since there are three</a>
<a id='line_395'>      equal persons in heaven, it is reasonable there should be three</a>
<a id='line_396'>      equal persons upon earth. The emperor invited these learned</a>
<a id='line_397'>      divines to a friendly conference, in which they might propose</a>
<a id='line_398'>      their arguments to the senate: they obeyed the summons, but the</a>
<a id='line_399'>      prospect of their bodies hanging on the gibbet in the suburb of</a>
<a id='line_400'>      Galata reconciled their companions to the unity of the reign of</a>
<a id='line_401'>      Constantine. He pardoned his brothers, and their names were still</a>
<a id='line_402'>      pronounced in the public acclamations: but on the repetition or</a>
<a id='line_403'>      suspicion of a similar offence, the obnoxious princes were</a>
<a id='line_404'>      deprived of their titles and noses, 1113 in the presence of the</a>
<a id='line_405'>      Catholic bishops who were assembled at Constantinople in the</a>
<a id='line_406'>      sixth general synod. In the close of his life, Pogonatus was</a>
<a id='line_407'>      anxious only to establish the right of primogeniture: the heir of</a>
<a id='line_408'>      his two sons, Justinian and Heraclius, was offered on the shrine</a>
<a id='line_409'>      of St. Peter, as a symbol of their spiritual adoption by the</a>
<a id='line_410'>      pope; but the elder was alone exalted to the rank of Augustus,</a>

<a id='line_420'>      After the decease of his father, the inheritance of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_421'>      world devolved to Justinian II.; and the name of a triumphant</a>
<a id='line_422'>      lawgiver was dishonored by the vices of a boy, who imitated his</a>
<a id='line_423'>      namesake only in the expensive luxury of building. His passions</a>
<a id='line_424'>      were strong; his understanding was feeble; and he was intoxicated</a>
<a id='line_425'>      with a foolish pride, that his birth had given him the command of</a>
<a id='line_426'>      millions, of whom the smallest community would not have chosen</a>
<a id='line_427'>      him for their local magistrate. His favorite ministers were two</a>
<a id='line_428'>      beings the least susceptible of human sympathy, a eunuch and a</a>
<a id='line_429'>      monk: to the one he abandoned the palace, to the other the</a>
<a id='line_430'>      finances; the former corrected the emperor’s mother with a</a>
<a id='line_431'>      scourge, the latter suspended the insolvent tributaries, with</a>
<a id='line_432'>      their heads downwards, over a slow and smoky fire. Since the days</a>
<a id='line_433'>      of Commodus and Caracalla, the cruelty of the Roman princes had</a>
<a id='line_434'>      most commonly been the effect of their fear; but Justinian, who</a>
<a id='line_435'>      possessed some vigor of character, enjoyed the sufferings, and</a>
<a id='line_436'>      braved the revenge, of his subjects, about ten years, till the</a>
<a id='line_437'>      measure was full, of his crimes and of their patience. In a dark</a>
<a id='line_438'>      dungeon, Leontius, a general of reputation, had groaned above</a>
<a id='line_439'>      three years, with some of the noblest and most deserving of the</a>
<a id='line_440'>      patricians: he was suddenly drawn forth to assume the government</a>
<a id='line_441'>      of Greece; and this promotion of an injured man was a mark of the</a>
<a id='line_442'>      contempt rather than of the confidence of his prince. As he was</a>
<a id='line_443'>      followed to the port by the kind offices of his friends, Leontius</a>
<a id='line_444'>      observed, with a sigh, that he was a victim adorned for</a>
<a id='line_445'>      sacrifice, and that inevitable death would pursue his footsteps.</a>
<a id='line_446'>      They ventured to reply, that glory and empire might be the</a>
<a id='line_447'>      recompense of a generous resolution; that every order of men</a>
<a id='line_448'>      abhorred the reign of a monster; and that the hands of two</a>
<a id='line_449'>      hundred thousand patriots expected only the voice of a leader.</a>
<a id='line_450'>      The night was chosen for their deliverance; and in the first</a>
<a id='line_451'>      effort of the conspirators, the praefect was slain, and the</a>
<a id='line_452'>      prisons were forced open: the emissaries of Leontius proclaimed</a>
<a id='line_453'>      in every street, “Christians, to St. Sophia!” and the seasonable</a>
<a id='line_454'>      text of the patriarch, “This is the day of the Lord!” was the</a>
<a id='line_455'>      prelude of an inflammatory sermon. From the church the people</a>
<a id='line_456'>      adjourned to the hippodrome: Justinian, in whose cause not a</a>
<a id='line_457'>      sword had been drawn, was dragged before these tumultuary judges,</a>
<a id='line_458'>      and their clamors demanded the instant death of the tyrant. But</a>
<a id='line_459'>      Leontius, who was already clothed with the purple, cast an eye of</a>
<a id='line_460'>      pity on the prostrate son of his own benefactor and of so many</a>
<a id='line_461'>      emperors. The life of Justinian was spared; the amputation of his</a>
<a id='line_462'>      nose, perhaps of his tongue, was imperfectly performed: the happy</a>
<a id='line_463'>      flexibility of the Greek language could impose the name of</a>
<a id='line_464'>      Rhinotmetus; and the mutilated tyrant was banished to Chersonae</a>
<a id='line_465'>      in Crim-Tartary, a lonely settlement, where corn, wine, and oil,</a>
<a id='line_466'>      were imported as foreign luxuries.</a>
<a id='line_467'></a>
<a id='line_468'>      On the edge of the Scythian wilderness, Justinian still cherished</a>
<a id='line_469'>      the pride of his birth, and the hope of his restoration. After</a>
<a id='line_470'>      three years’ exile, he received the pleasing intelligence that</a>
<a id='line_471'>      his injury was avenged by a second revolution, and that Leontius</a>
<a id='line_472'>      in his turn had been dethroned and mutilated by the rebel</a>
<a id='line_473'>      Apsimar, who assumed the more respectable name of Tiberius. But</a>
<a id='line_474'>      the claim of lineal succession was still formidable to a plebeian</a>
<a id='line_475'>      usurper; and his jealousy was stimulated by the complaints and</a>
<a id='line_476'>      charges of the Chersonites, who beheld the vices of the tyrant in</a>
<a id='line_477'>      the spirit of the exile. With a band of followers, attached to</a>
<a id='line_478'>      his person by common hope or common despair, Justinian fled from</a>
<a id='line_479'>      the inhospitable shore to the horde of the Chozars, who pitched</a>
<a id='line_480'>      their tents between the Tanais and Borysthenes. The khan</a>
<a id='line_481'>      entertained with pity and respect the royal suppliant:</a>
<a id='line_482'>      Phanagoria, once an opulent city, on the Asiatic side of the lake</a>
<a id='line_483'>      Moeotis, was assigned for his residence; and every Roman</a>
<a id='line_484'>      prejudice was stifled in his marriage with the sister of the</a>
<a id='line_485'>      Barbarian, who seems, however, from the name of Theodora, to have</a>
<a id='line_486'>      received the sacrament of baptism. But the faithless Chozar was</a>
<a id='line_487'>      soon tempted by the gold of Constantinople: and had not the</a>
<a id='line_488'>      design been revealed by the conjugal love of Theodora, her</a>
<a id='line_489'>      husband must have been assassinated or betrayed into the power of</a>
<a id='line_490'>      his enemies. After strangling, with his own hands, the two</a>
<a id='line_491'>      emissaries of the khan, Justinian sent back his wife to her</a>
<a id='line_492'>      brother, and embarked on the Euxine in search of new and more</a>
<a id='line_493'>      faithful allies. His vessel was assaulted by a violent tempest;</a>
<a id='line_494'>      and one of his pious companions advised him to deserve the mercy</a>
<a id='line_495'>      of God by a vow of general forgiveness, if he should be restored</a>
<a id='line_496'>      to the throne. “Of forgiveness?” replied the intrepid tyrant:</a>
<a id='line_497'>      “may I perish this instant—may the Almighty whelm me in the</a>
<a id='line_498'>      waves—if I consent to spare a single head of my enemies!” He</a>
<a id='line_499'>      survived this impious menace, sailed into the mouth of the</a>
<a id='line_500'>      Danube, trusted his person in the royal village of the</a>
<a id='line_501'>      Bulgarians, and purchased the aid of Terbelis, a pagan conqueror,</a>
<a id='line_502'>      by the promise of his daughter and a fair partition of the</a>
<a id='line_503'>      treasures of the empire. The Bulgarian kingdom extended to the</a>
<a id='line_504'>      confines of Thrace; and the two princes besieged Constantinople</a>
<a id='line_505'>      at the head of fifteen thousand horse. Apsimar was dismayed by</a>

<a id='line_510'>      hereditary sovereign excited the pity of the multitude, ever</a>

<a id='line_520'></a>
<a id='line_521'>      In rewarding his allies, and recalling his wife, Justinian</a>
<a id='line_522'>      displayed some sense of honor and gratitude; 1114 and Terbelis</a>
<a id='line_523'>      retired, after sweeping away a heap of gold coin, which he</a>
<a id='line_524'>      measured with his Scythian whip. But never was vow more</a>
<a id='line_525'>      religiously performed than the sacred oath of revenge which he</a>
<a id='line_526'>      had sworn amidst the storms of the Euxine. The two usurpers (for</a>
<a id='line_527'>      I must reserve the name of tyrant for the conqueror) were dragged</a>
<a id='line_528'>      into the hippodrome, the one from his prison, the other from his</a>
<a id='line_529'>      palace. Before their execution, Leontius and Apsimar were cast</a>
<a id='line_530'>      prostrate in chains beneath the throne of the emperor; and</a>
<a id='line_531'>      Justinian, planting a foot on each of their necks, contemplated</a>
<a id='line_532'>      above an hour the chariot-race, while the inconstant people</a>
<a id='line_533'>      shouted, in the words of the Psalmist, “Thou shalt trample on the</a>
<a id='line_534'>      asp and basilisk, and on the lion and dragon shalt thou set thy</a>
<a id='line_535'>      foot!” The universal defection which he had once experienced</a>
<a id='line_536'>      might provoke him to repeat the wish of Caligula, that the Roman</a>
<a id='line_537'>      people had but one head. Yet I shall presume to observe, that</a>
<a id='line_538'>      such a wish is unworthy of an ingenious tyrant, since his revenge</a>
<a id='line_539'>      and cruelty would have been extinguished by a single blow,</a>
<a id='line_540'>      instead of the slow variety of tortures which Justinian inflicted</a>
<a id='line_541'>      on the victims of his anger. His pleasures were inexhaustible:</a>
<a id='line_542'>      neither private virtue nor public service could expiate the guilt</a>
<a id='line_543'>      of active, or even passive, obedience to an established</a>
<a id='line_544'>      government; and, during the six years of his new reign, he</a>
<a id='line_545'>      considered the axe, the cord, and the rack, as the only</a>
<a id='line_546'>      instruments of royalty. But his most implacable hatred was</a>
<a id='line_547'>      pointed against the Chersonites, who had insulted his exile and</a>
<a id='line_548'>      violated the laws of hospitality. Their remote situation afforded</a>
<a id='line_549'>      some means of defence, or at least of escape; and a grievous tax</a>
<a id='line_550'>      was imposed on Constantinople, to supply the preparations of a</a>
<a id='line_551'>      fleet and army. “All are guilty, and all must perish,” was the</a>
<a id='line_552'>      mandate of Justinian; and the bloody execution was intrusted to</a>
<a id='line_553'>      his favorite Stephen, who was recommended by the epithet of the</a>
<a id='line_554'>      savage. Yet even the savage Stephen imperfectly accomplished the</a>
<a id='line_555'>      intentions of his sovereign. The slowness of his attack allowed</a>
<a id='line_556'>      the greater part of the inhabitants to withdraw into the country;</a>
<a id='line_557'>      and the minister of vengeance contented himself with reducing the</a>
<a id='line_558'>      youth of both sexes to a state of servitude, with roasting alive</a>
<a id='line_559'>      seven of the principal citizens, with drowning twenty in the sea,</a>
<a id='line_560'>      and with reserving forty-two in chains to receive their doom from</a>
<a id='line_561'>      the mouth of the emperor. In their return, the fleet was driven</a>
<a id='line_562'>      on the rocky shores of Anatolia; and Justinian applauded the</a>
<a id='line_563'>      obedience of the Euxine, which had involved so many thousands of</a>
<a id='line_564'>      his subjects and enemies in a common shipwreck: but the tyrant</a>
<a id='line_565'>      was still insatiate of blood; and a second expedition was</a>
<a id='line_566'>      commanded to extirpate the remains of the proscribed colony. In</a>
<a id='line_567'>      the short interval, the Chersonites had returned to their city,</a>
<a id='line_568'>      and were prepared to die in arms; the khan of the Chozars had</a>
<a id='line_569'>      renounced the cause of his odious brother; the exiles of every</a>
<a id='line_570'>      province were assembled in Tauris; and Bardanes, under the name</a>
<a id='line_571'>      of Philippicus, was invested with the purple. The Imperial</a>
<a id='line_572'>      troops, unwilling and unable to perpetrate the revenge of</a>
<a id='line_573'>      Justinian, escaped his displeasure by abjuring his allegiance:</a>
<a id='line_574'>      the fleet, under their new sovereign, steered back a more</a>
<a id='line_575'>      auspicious course to the harbors of Sinope and Constantinople;</a>
<a id='line_576'>      and every tongue was prompt to pronounce, every hand to execute,</a>
<a id='line_577'>      the death of the tyrant. Destitute of friends, he was deserted by</a>
<a id='line_578'>      his Barbarian guards; and the stroke of the assassin was praised</a>
<a id='line_579'>      as an act of patriotism and Roman virtue. His son Tiberius had</a>
<a id='line_580'>      taken refuge in a church; his aged grandmother guarded the door;</a>
<a id='line_581'>      and the innocent youth, suspending round his neck the most</a>
<a id='line_582'>      formidable relics, embraced with one hand the altar, with the</a>
<a id='line_583'>      other the wood of the true cross. But the popular fury that dares</a>
<a id='line_584'>      to trample on superstition, is deaf to the cries of humanity; and</a>
<a id='line_585'>      the race of Heraclius was extinguished after a reign of one</a>

<a id='line_591'>      Between the fall of the Heraclian and the rise of the Isaurian</a>
<a id='line_592'>      dynasty, a short interval of six years is divided into three</a>
<a id='line_593'>      reigns. Bardanes, or Philippicus, was hailed at Constantinople as</a>
<a id='line_594'>      a hero who had delivered his country from a tyrant; and he might</a>
<a id='line_595'>      taste some moments of happiness in the first transports of</a>
<a id='line_596'>      sincere and universal joy. Justinian had left behind him an ample</a>
<a id='line_597'>      treasure, the fruit of cruelty and rapine: but this useful fund</a>
<a id='line_598'>      was soon and idly dissipated by his successor. On the festival of</a>
<a id='line_599'>      his birthday, Philippicus entertained the multitude with the</a>
<a id='line_600'>      games of the hippodrome; from thence he paraded through the</a>
<a id='line_601'>      streets with a thousand banners and a thousand trumpets;</a>
<a id='line_602'>      refreshed himself in the baths of Zeuxippus, and returning to the</a>
<a id='line_603'>      palace, entertained his nobles with a sumptuous banquet. At the</a>
<a id='line_604'>      meridian hour he withdrew to his chamber, intoxicated with</a>
<a id='line_605'>      flattery and wine, and forgetful that his example had made every</a>
<a id='line_606'>      subject ambitious, and that every ambitious subject was his</a>
<a id='line_607'>      secret enemy. Some bold conspirators introduced themselves in the</a>
<a id='line_608'>      disorder of the feast; and the slumbering monarch was surprised,</a>
<a id='line_609'>      bound, blinded, and deposed, before he was sensible of his</a>
<a id='line_610'>      danger. Yet the traitors were deprived of their reward; and the</a>
<a id='line_611'>      free voice of the senate and people promoted Artemius from the</a>
<a id='line_612'>      office of secretary to that of emperor: he assumed the title of</a>
<a id='line_613'>      Anastasius the Second, and displayed in a short and troubled</a>
<a id='line_614'>      reign the virtues both of peace and war. But after the extinction</a>
<a id='line_615'>      of the Imperial line, the rule of obedience was violated, and</a>
<a id='line_616'>      every change diffused the seeds of new revolutions. In a mutiny</a>
<a id='line_617'>      of the fleet, an obscure and reluctant officer of the revenue was</a>
<a id='line_618'>      forcibly invested with the purple: after some months of a naval</a>
<a id='line_619'>      war, Anastasius resigned the sceptre; and the conqueror,</a>
<a id='line_620'>      Theodosius the Third, submitted in his turn to the superior</a>
<a id='line_621'>      ascendant of Leo, the general and emperor of the Oriental troops.</a>
<a id='line_622'>      His two predecessors were permitted to embrace the ecclesiastical</a>
<a id='line_623'>      profession: the restless impatience of Anastasius tempted him to</a>
<a id='line_624'>      risk and to lose his life in a treasonable enterprise; but the</a>
<a id='line_625'>      last days of Theodosius were honorable and secure. The single</a>
<a id='line_626'>      sublime word, “Health,” which he inscribed on his tomb, expresses</a>
<a id='line_627'>      the confidence of philosophy or religion; and the fame of his</a>
<a id='line_628'>      miracles was long preserved among the people of Ephesus. This</a>
<a id='line_629'>      convenient shelter of the church might sometimes impose a lesson</a>
<a id='line_630'>      of clemency; but it may be questioned whether it is for the</a>
<a id='line_631'>      public interest to diminish the perils of unsuccessful ambition.</a>
<a id='line_632'></a>
<a id='line_633'>      I have dwelt on the fall of a tyrant; I shall briefly represent</a>
<a id='line_634'>      the founder of a new dynasty, who is known to posterity by the</a>
<a id='line_635'>      invectives of his enemies, and whose public and private life is</a>
<a id='line_636'>      involved in the ecclesiastical story of the Iconoclasts. Yet in</a>
<a id='line_637'>      spite of the clamors of superstition, a favorable prejudice for</a>
<a id='line_638'>      the character of Leo the Isaurian may be reasonably drawn from</a>
<a id='line_639'>      the obscurity of his birth, and the duration of his reign.—I. In</a>
<a id='line_640'>      an age of manly spirit, the prospect of an Imperial reward would</a>
<a id='line_641'>      have kindled every energy of the mind, and produced a crowd of</a>
<a id='line_642'>      competitors as deserving as they were desirous to reign. Even in</a>
<a id='line_643'>      the corruption and debility of the modern Greeks, the elevation</a>
<a id='line_644'>      of a plebeian from the last to the first rank of society,</a>
<a id='line_645'>      supposes some qualifications above the level of the multitude. He</a>
<a id='line_646'>      would probably be ignorant and disdainful of speculative science;</a>
<a id='line_647'>      and, in the pursuit of fortune, he might absolve himself from the</a>
<a id='line_648'>      obligations of benevolence and justice; but to his character we</a>
<a id='line_649'>      may ascribe the useful virtues of prudence and fortitude, the</a>
<a id='line_650'>      knowledge of mankind, and the important art of gaining their</a>
<a id='line_651'>      confidence and directing their passions. It is agreed that Leo</a>
<a id='line_652'>      was a native of Isauria, and that Conon was his primitive name.</a>
<a id='line_653'>      The writers, whose awkward satire is praise, describe him as an</a>
<a id='line_654'>      itinerant pedler, who drove an ass with some paltry merchandise</a>
<a id='line_655'>      to the country fairs; and foolishly relate that he met on the</a>
<a id='line_656'>      road some Jewish fortune-tellers, who promised him the Roman</a>
<a id='line_657'>      empire, on condition that he should abolish the worship of idols.</a>
<a id='line_658'>      A more probable account relates the migration of his father from</a>
<a id='line_659'>      Asia Minor to Thrace, where he exercised the lucrative trade of a</a>
<a id='line_660'>      grazier; and he must have acquired considerable wealth, since the</a>
<a id='line_661'>      first introduction of his son was procured by a supply of five</a>
<a id='line_662'>      hundred sheep to the Imperial camp. His first service was in the</a>
<a id='line_663'>      guards of Justinian, where he soon attracted the notice, and by</a>
<a id='line_664'>      degrees the jealousy, of the tyrant. His valor and dexterity were</a>
<a id='line_665'>      conspicuous in the Colchian war: from Anastasius he received the</a>
<a id='line_666'>      command of the Anatolian legions, and by the suffrage of the</a>
<a id='line_667'>      soldiers he was raised to the empire with the general applause of</a>
<a id='line_668'>      the Roman world.—II. In this dangerous elevation, Leo the Third</a>
<a id='line_669'>      supported himself against the envy of his equals, the discontent</a>
<a id='line_670'>      of a powerful faction, and the assaults of his foreign and</a>
<a id='line_671'>      domestic enemies. The Catholics, who accuse his religious</a>
<a id='line_672'>      innovations, are obliged to confess that they were undertaken</a>
<a id='line_673'>      with temper and conducted with firmness. Their silence respects</a>
<a id='line_674'>      the wisdom of his administration and the purity of his manners.</a>
<a id='line_675'>      After a reign of twenty-four years, he peaceably expired in the</a>
<a id='line_676'>      palace of Constantinople; and the purple which he had acquired</a>
<a id='line_677'>      was transmitted by the right of inheritance to the third</a>

<a id='line_689'>      In a long reign of thirty-four years, the son and successor of</a>
<a id='line_690'>      Leo, Constantine the Fifth, surnamed Copronymus, attacked with</a>
<a id='line_691'>      less temperate zeal the images or idols of the church. Their</a>
<a id='line_692'>      votaries have exhausted the bitterness of religious gall, in</a>
<a id='line_693'>      their portrait of this spotted panther, this antichrist, this</a>
<a id='line_694'>      flying dragon of the serpent’s seed, who surpassed the vices of</a>
<a id='line_695'>      Elagabalus and Nero. His reign was a long butchery of whatever</a>
<a id='line_696'>      was most noble, or holy, or innocent, in his empire. In person,</a>
<a id='line_697'>      the emperor assisted at the execution of his victims, surveyed</a>
<a id='line_698'>      their agonies, listened to their groans, and indulged, without</a>
<a id='line_699'>      satiating, his appetite for blood: a plate of noses was accepted</a>
<a id='line_700'>      as a grateful offering, and his domestics were often scourged or</a>
<a id='line_701'>      mutilated by the royal hand. His surname was derived from his</a>
<a id='line_702'>      pollution of his baptismal font. The infant might be excused; but</a>
<a id='line_703'>      the manly pleasures of Copronymus degraded him below the level of</a>
<a id='line_704'>      a brute; his lust confounded the eternal distinctions of sex and</a>
<a id='line_705'>      species, and he seemed to extract some unnatural delight from the</a>
<a id='line_706'>      objects most offensive to human sense. In his religion the</a>
<a id='line_707'>      Iconoclast was a Heretic, a Jew, a Mahometan, a Pagan, and an</a>
<a id='line_708'>      Atheist; and his belief of an invisible power could be discovered</a>
<a id='line_709'>      only in his magic rites, human victims, and nocturnal sacrifices</a>
<a id='line_710'>      to Venus and the daemons of antiquity. His life was stained with</a>
<a id='line_711'>      the most opposite vices, and the ulcers which covered his body,</a>
<a id='line_712'>      anticipated before his death the sentiment of hell-tortures. Of</a>
<a id='line_713'>      these accusations, which I have so patiently copied, a part is</a>
<a id='line_714'>      refuted by its own absurdity; and in the private anecdotes of the</a>
<a id='line_715'>      life of the princes, the lie is more easy as the detection is</a>
<a id='line_716'>      more difficult. Without adopting the pernicious maxim, that where</a>
<a id='line_717'>      much is alleged, something must be true, I can however discern,</a>
<a id='line_718'>      that Constantine the Fifth was dissolute and cruel. Calumny is</a>
<a id='line_719'>      more prone to exaggerate than to invent; and her licentious</a>
<a id='line_720'>      tongue is checked in some measure by the experience of the age</a>
<a id='line_721'>      and country to which she appeals. Of the bishops and monks, the</a>
<a id='line_722'>      generals and magistrates, who are said to have suffered under his</a>
<a id='line_723'>      reign, the numbers are recorded, the names were conspicuous, the</a>
<a id='line_724'>      execution was public, the mutilation visible and permanent. 1116</a>
<a id='line_725'>      The Catholics hated the person and government of Copronymus; but</a>
<a id='line_726'>      even their hatred is a proof of their oppression. They dissembled</a>
<a id='line_727'>      the provocations which might excuse or justify his rigor, but</a>
<a id='line_728'>      even these provocations must gradually inflame his resentment and</a>
<a id='line_729'>      harden his temper in the use or the abuse of despotism. Yet the</a>
<a id='line_730'>      character of the fifth Constantine was not devoid of merit, nor</a>
<a id='line_731'>      did his government always deserve the curses or the contempt of</a>
<a id='line_732'>      the Greeks. From the confession of his enemies, I am informed of</a>
<a id='line_733'>      the restoration of an ancient aqueduct, of the redemption of two</a>
<a id='line_734'>      thousand five hundred captives, of the uncommon plenty of the</a>
<a id='line_735'>      times, and of the new colonies with which he repeopled</a>
<a id='line_736'>      Constantinople and the Thracian cities. They reluctantly praise</a>
<a id='line_737'>      his activity and courage; he was on horseback in the field at the</a>
<a id='line_738'>      head of his legions; and, although the fortune of his arms was</a>
<a id='line_739'>      various, he triumphed by sea and land, on the Euphrates and the</a>
<a id='line_740'>      Danube, in civil and Barbarian war. Heretical praise must be cast</a>
<a id='line_741'>      into the scale to counterbalance the weight of orthodox</a>
<a id='line_742'>      invective. The Iconoclasts revered the virtues of the prince:</a>
<a id='line_743'>      forty years after his death they still prayed before the tomb of</a>
<a id='line_744'>      the saint. A miraculous vision was propagated by fanaticism or</a>
<a id='line_745'>      fraud: and the Christian hero appeared on a milk-white steed,</a>
<a id='line_746'>      brandishing his lance against the Pagans of Bulgaria: “An absurd</a>
<a id='line_747'>      fable,” says the Catholic historian, “since Copronymus is chained</a>

<a id='line_763'>      urged by the officious zeal of his subjects; and the emperor,</a>
<a id='line_764'>      conscious of his decay, complied, after a prudent hesitation,</a>
<a id='line_765'>      with their unanimous wishes. The royal infant, at the age of five</a>
<a id='line_766'>      years, was crowned with his mother Irene; and the national</a>
<a id='line_767'>      consent was ratified by every circumstance of pomp and solemnity,</a>
<a id='line_768'>      that could dazzle the eyes or bind the conscience of the Greeks.</a>
<a id='line_769'>      An oath of fidelity was administered in the palace, the church,</a>
<a id='line_770'>      and the hippodrome, to the several orders of the state, who</a>
<a id='line_771'>      adjured the holy names of the Son, and mother of God. “Be</a>
<a id='line_772'>      witness, O Christ! that we will watch over the safety of</a>
<a id='line_773'>      Constantine the son of Leo, expose our lives in his service, and</a>
<a id='line_774'>      bear true allegiance to his person and posterity.” They pledged</a>
<a id='line_775'>      their faith on the wood of the true cross, and the act of their</a>
<a id='line_776'>      engagement was deposited on the altar of St. Sophia. The first to</a>
<a id='line_777'>      swear, and the first to violate their oath, were the five sons of</a>
<a id='line_778'>      Copronymus by a second marriage; and the story of these princes</a>
<a id='line_779'>      is singular and tragic. The right of primogeniture excluded them</a>
<a id='line_780'>      from the throne; the injustice of their elder brother defrauded</a>
<a id='line_781'>      them of a legacy of about two millions sterling; some vain titles</a>
<a id='line_782'>      were not deemed a sufficient compensation for wealth and power;</a>
<a id='line_783'>      and they repeatedly conspired against their nephew, before and</a>
<a id='line_784'>      after the death of his father. Their first attempt was pardoned;</a>
<a id='line_785'>      for the second offence 1118 they were condemned to the</a>
<a id='line_786'>      ecclesiastical state; and for the third treason, Nicephorus, the</a>
<a id='line_787'>      eldest and most guilty, was deprived of his eyes, and his four</a>
<a id='line_788'>      brothers, Christopher, Nicetas, Anthemeus, and Eudoxas, were</a>
<a id='line_789'>      punished, as a milder sentence, by the amputation of their</a>
<a id='line_790'>      tongues. After five years’ confinement, they escaped to the</a>
<a id='line_791'>      church of St. Sophia, and displayed a pathetic spectacle to the</a>
<a id='line_792'>      people. “Countrymen and Christians,” cried Nicephorus for himself</a>
<a id='line_793'>      and his mute brethren, “behold the sons of your emperor, if you</a>
<a id='line_794'>      can still recognize our features in this miserable state. A life,</a>
<a id='line_795'>      an imperfect life, is all that the malice of our enemies has</a>
<a id='line_796'>      spared. It is now threatened, and we now throw ourselves on your</a>
<a id='line_797'>      compassion.” The rising murmur might have produced a revolution,</a>
<a id='line_798'>      had it not been checked by the presence of a minister, who</a>
<a id='line_799'>      soothed the unhappy princes with flattery and hope, and gently</a>
<a id='line_800'>      drew them from the sanctuary to the palace. They were speedily</a>
<a id='line_801'>      embarked for Greece, and Athens was allotted for the place of</a>
<a id='line_802'>      their exile. In this calm retreat, and in their helpless</a>
<a id='line_803'>      condition, Nicephorus and his brothers were tormented by the</a>
<a id='line_804'>      thirst of power, and tempted by a Sclavonian chief, who offered</a>
<a id='line_805'>      to break their prison, and to lead them in arms, and in the</a>
<a id='line_806'>      purple, to the gates of Constantinople. But the Athenian people,</a>
<a id='line_807'>      ever zealous in the cause of Irene, prevented her justice or</a>
<a id='line_808'>      cruelty; and the five sons of Copronymus were plunged in eternal</a>

<a id='line_821'>      old, whose sole fortune must have consisted in her personal</a>
<a id='line_822'>      accomplishments. The nuptials of Leo and Irene were celebrated</a>
<a id='line_823'>      with royal pomp; she soon acquired the love and confidence of a</a>
<a id='line_824'>      feeble husband, and in his testament he declared the empress</a>
<a id='line_825'>      guardian of the Roman world, and of their son Constantine the</a>
<a id='line_826'>      Sixth, who was no more than ten years of age. During his</a>
<a id='line_827'>      childhood, Irene most ably and assiduously discharged, in her</a>
<a id='line_828'>      public administration, the duties of a faithful mother; and her</a>
<a id='line_829'>      zeal in the restoration of images has deserved the name and</a>
<a id='line_830'>      honors of a saint, which she still occupies in the Greek</a>
<a id='line_831'>      calendar. But the emperor attained the maturity of youth; the</a>
<a id='line_832'>      maternal yoke became more grievous; and he listened to the</a>
<a id='line_833'>      favorites of his own age, who shared his pleasures, and were</a>
<a id='line_834'>      ambitious of sharing his power. Their reasons convinced him of</a>
<a id='line_835'>      his right, their praises of his ability, to reign; and he</a>
<a id='line_836'>      consented to reward the services of Irene by a perpetual</a>
<a id='line_837'>      banishment to the Isle of Sicily. But her vigilance and</a>
<a id='line_838'>      penetration easily disconcerted their rash projects: a similar,</a>
<a id='line_839'>      or more severe, punishment was retaliated on themselves and their</a>
<a id='line_840'>      advisers; and Irene inflicted on the ungrateful prince the</a>
<a id='line_841'>      chastisement of a boy. After this contest, the mother and the son</a>
<a id='line_842'>      were at the head of two domestic factions; and instead of mild</a>
<a id='line_843'>      influence and voluntary obedience, she held in chains a captive</a>
<a id='line_844'>      and an enemy. The empress was overthrown by the abuse of victory;</a>
<a id='line_845'>      the oath of fidelity, which she exacted to herself alone, was</a>
<a id='line_846'>      pronounced with reluctant murmurs; and the bold refusal of the</a>
<a id='line_847'>      Armenian guards encouraged a free and general declaration, that</a>
<a id='line_848'>      Constantine the Sixth was the lawful emperor of the Romans. In</a>
<a id='line_849'>      this character he ascended his hereditary throne, and dismissed</a>
<a id='line_850'>      Irene to a life of solitude and repose. But her haughty spirit</a>
<a id='line_851'>      condescended to the arts of dissimulation: she flattered the</a>
<a id='line_852'>      bishops and eunuchs, revived the filial tenderness of the prince,</a>
<a id='line_853'>      regained his confidence, and betrayed his credulity. The</a>
<a id='line_854'>      character of Constantine was not destitute of sense or spirit;</a>
<a id='line_855'>      but his education had been studiously neglected; and the</a>
<a id='line_856'>      ambitious mother exposed to the public censure the vices which</a>
<a id='line_857'>      she had nourished, and the actions which she had secretly</a>
<a id='line_858'>      advised: his divorce and second marriage offended the prejudices</a>
<a id='line_859'>      of the clergy, and by his imprudent rigor he forfeited the</a>
<a id='line_860'>      attachment of the Armenian guards. A powerful conspiracy was</a>
<a id='line_861'>      formed for the restoration of Irene; and the secret, though</a>
<a id='line_862'>      widely diffused, was faithfully kept above eight months, till the</a>
<a id='line_863'>      emperor, suspicious of his danger, escaped from Constantinople,</a>
<a id='line_864'>      with the design of appealing to the provinces and armies. By this</a>
<a id='line_865'>      hasty flight, the empress was left on the brink of the precipice;</a>
<a id='line_866'>      yet before she implored the mercy of her son, Irene addressed a</a>
<a id='line_867'>      private epistle to the friends whom she had placed about his</a>
<a id='line_868'>      person, with a menace, that unless they accomplished, she would</a>
<a id='line_869'>      reveal, their treason. Their fear rendered them intrepid; they</a>
<a id='line_870'>      seized the emperor on the Asiatic shore, and he was transported</a>
<a id='line_871'>      to the porphyry apartment of the palace, where he had first seen</a>
<a id='line_872'>      the light. In the mind of Irene, ambition had stifled every</a>
<a id='line_873'>      sentiment of humanity and nature; and it was decreed in her</a>
<a id='line_874'>      bloody council, that Constantine should be rendered incapable of</a>
<a id='line_875'>      the throne: her emissaries assaulted the sleeping prince, and</a>
<a id='line_876'>      stabbed their daggers with such violence and precipitation into</a>
<a id='line_877'>      his eyes as if they meant to execute a mortal sentence. An</a>
<a id='line_878'>      ambiguous passage of Theophanes persuaded the annalist of the</a>
<a id='line_879'>      church that death was the immediate consequence of this barbarous</a>
<a id='line_880'>      execution. The Catholics have been deceived or subdued by the</a>
<a id='line_881'>      authority of Baronius; and Protestant zeal has reechoed the words</a>

<a id='line_883'>      patroness of images. 1119 Yet the blind son of Irene survived</a>
<a id='line_884'>      many years, oppressed by the court and forgotten by the world;</a>
<a id='line_885'>      the Isaurian dynasty was silently extinguished; and the memory of</a>
<a id='line_886'>      Constantine was recalled only by the nuptials of his daughter</a>

<a id='line_898'>      of fire so vast and so remote, could sympathize with the atoms of</a>
<a id='line_899'>      a revolving planet. On earth, the crime of Irene was left five</a>
<a id='line_900'>      years unpunished; her reign was crowned with external splendor;</a>
<a id='line_901'>      and if she could silence the voice of conscience, she neither</a>
<a id='line_902'>      heard nor regarded the reproaches of mankind. The Roman world</a>
<a id='line_903'>      bowed to the government of a female; and as she moved through the</a>
<a id='line_904'>      streets of Constantinople, the reins of four milk-white steeds</a>
<a id='line_905'>      were held by as many patricians, who marched on foot before the</a>
<a id='line_906'>      golden chariot of their queen. But these patricians were for the</a>
<a id='line_907'>      most part eunuchs; and their black ingratitude justified, on this</a>
<a id='line_908'>      occasion, the popular hatred and contempt. Raised, enriched,</a>
<a id='line_909'>      intrusted with the first dignities of the empire, they basely</a>
<a id='line_910'>      conspired against their benefactress; the great treasurer</a>
<a id='line_911'>      Nicephorus was secretly invested with the purple; her successor</a>
<a id='line_912'>      was introduced into the palace, and crowned at St. Sophia by the</a>
<a id='line_913'>      venal patriarch. In their first interview, she recapitulated with</a>
<a id='line_914'>      dignity the revolutions of her life, gently accused the perfidy</a>
<a id='line_915'>      of Nicephorus, insinuated that he owed his life to her</a>
<a id='line_916'>      unsuspicious clemency, and for the throne and treasures which she</a>
<a id='line_917'>      resigned, solicited a decent and honorable retreat. His avarice</a>
<a id='line_918'>      refused this modest compensation; and, in her exile of the Isle</a>
<a id='line_919'>      of Lesbos, the empress earned a scanty subsistence by the labors</a>
<a id='line_920'>      of her distaff.</a>
<a id='line_921'></a>
<a id='line_922'>      Many tyrants have reigned undoubtedly more criminal than</a>
<a id='line_923'>      Nicephorus, but none perhaps have more deeply incurred the</a>
<a id='line_924'>      universal abhorrence of their people. His character was stained</a>
<a id='line_925'>      with the three odious vices of hypocrisy, ingratitude, and</a>
<a id='line_926'>      avarice: his want of virtue was not redeemed by any superior</a>
<a id='line_927'>      talents, nor his want of talents by any pleasing qualifications.</a>
<a id='line_928'>      Unskilful and unfortunate in war, Nicephorus was vanquished by</a>
<a id='line_929'>      the Saracens, and slain by the Bulgarians; and the advantage of</a>
<a id='line_930'>      his death overbalanced, in the public opinion, the destruction of</a>
<a id='line_931'>      a Roman army. 1011 His son and heir Stauracius escaped from the</a>
<a id='line_932'>      field with a mortal wound; yet six months of an expiring life</a>
<a id='line_933'>      were sufficient to refute his indecent, though popular</a>
<a id='line_934'>      declaration, that he would in all things avoid the example of his</a>
<a id='line_935'>      father. On the near prospect of his decease, Michael, the great</a>
<a id='line_936'>      master of the palace, and the husband of his sister Procopia, was</a>
<a id='line_937'>      named by every person of the palace and city, except by his</a>
<a id='line_938'>      envious brother. Tenacious of a sceptre now falling from his</a>
<a id='line_939'>      hand, he conspired against the life of his successor, and</a>
<a id='line_940'>      cherished the idea of changing to a democracy the Roman empire.</a>
<a id='line_941'>      But these rash projects served only to inflame the zeal of the</a>
<a id='line_942'>      people and to remove the scruples of the candidate: Michael the</a>
<a id='line_943'>      First accepted the purple, and before he sunk into the grave the</a>
<a id='line_944'>      son of Nicephorus implored the clemency of his new sovereign. Had</a>
<a id='line_945'>      Michael in an age of peace ascended an hereditary throne, he</a>
<a id='line_946'>      might have reigned and died the father of his people: but his</a>
<a id='line_947'>      mild virtues were adapted to the shade of private life, nor was</a>
<a id='line_948'>      he capable of controlling the ambition of his equals, or of</a>
<a id='line_949'>      resisting the arms of the victorious Bulgarians. While his want</a>
<a id='line_950'>      of ability and success exposed him to the contempt of the</a>
<a id='line_951'>      soldiers, the masculine spirit of his wife Procopia awakened</a>
<a id='line_952'>      their indignation. Even the Greeks of the ninth century were</a>
<a id='line_953'>      provoked by the insolence of a female, who, in the front of the</a>
<a id='line_954'>      standards, presumed to direct their discipline and animate their</a>
<a id='line_955'>      valor; and their licentious clamors advised the new Semiramis to</a>
<a id='line_956'>      reverence the majesty of a Roman camp. After an unsuccessful</a>
<a id='line_957'>      campaign, the emperor left, in their winter-quarters of Thrace, a</a>
<a id='line_958'>      disaffected army under the command of his enemies; and their</a>
<a id='line_959'>      artful eloquence persuaded the soldiers to break the dominion of</a>
<a id='line_960'>      the eunuchs, to degrade the husband of Procopia, and to assert</a>
<a id='line_961'>      the right of a military election. They marched towards the</a>
<a id='line_962'>      capital: yet the clergy, the senate, and the people of</a>
<a id='line_963'>      Constantinople, adhered to the cause of Michael; and the troops</a>
<a id='line_964'>      and treasures of Asia might have protracted the mischiefs of</a>
<a id='line_965'>      civil war. But his humanity (by the ambitious it will be termed</a>
<a id='line_966'>      his weakness) protested that not a drop of Christian blood should</a>
<a id='line_967'>      be shed in his quarrel, and his messengers presented the</a>
<a id='line_968'>      conquerors with the keys of the city and the palace. They were</a>
<a id='line_969'>      disarmed by his innocence and submission; his life and his eyes</a>
<a id='line_970'>      were spared; and the Imperial monk enjoyed the comforts of</a>
<a id='line_971'>      solitude and religion above thirty-two years after he had been</a>

<a id='line_987'>      husband of Procopia, the crown was presented to the same Leo, the</a>
<a id='line_988'>      first in military rank and the secret author of the mutiny. As he</a>
<a id='line_989'>      affected to hesitate, “With this sword,” said his companion</a>
<a id='line_990'>      Michael, “I will open the gates of Constantinople to your</a>
<a id='line_991'>      Imperial sway; or instantly plunge it into your bosom, if you</a>
<a id='line_992'>      obstinately resist the just desires of your fellow-soldiers.” The</a>
<a id='line_993'>      compliance of the Armenian was rewarded with the empire, and he</a>
<a id='line_994'>      reigned seven years and a half under the name of Leo the Fifth.</a>

<a id='line_998'>      dangerous to the innocent, it was always formidable to the</a>
<a id='line_999'>      guilty. His religious inconstancy was taxed by the epithet of</a>

<a id='line_1001'>      saint and confessors, that the life of the Iconoclast was useful</a>

<a id='line_1016'>      solemn day, the twenty-fifth of December, had been fixed for the</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      execution: she urged, that the anniversary of the Savior’s birth</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      would be profaned by this inhuman spectacle, and Leo consented</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      with reluctance to a decent respite. But on the vigil of the</a>
<a id='line_1020'>      feast his sleepless anxiety prompted him to visit at the dead of</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      night the chamber in which his enemy was confined: he beheld him</a>
<a id='line_1022'>      released from his chain, and stretched on his jailer’s bed in a</a>
<a id='line_1023'>      profound slumber. Leo was alarmed at these signs of security and</a>
<a id='line_1024'>      intelligence; but though he retired with silent steps, his</a>
<a id='line_1025'>      entrance and departure were noticed by a slave who lay concealed</a>
<a id='line_1026'>      in a corner of the prison. Under the pretence of requesting the</a>
<a id='line_1027'>      spiritual aid of a confessor, Michael informed the conspirators,</a>
<a id='line_1028'>      that their lives depended on his discretion, and that a few hours</a>
<a id='line_1029'>      were left to assure their own safety, by the deliverance of their</a>
<a id='line_1030'>      friend and country. On the great festivals, a chosen band of</a>
<a id='line_1031'>      priests and chanters was admitted into the palace by a private</a>
<a id='line_1032'>      gate to sing matins in the chapel; and Leo, who regulated with</a>
<a id='line_1033'>      the same strictness the discipline of the choir and of the camp,</a>
<a id='line_1034'>      was seldom absent from these early devotions. In the</a>
<a id='line_1035'>      ecclesiastical habit, but with their swords under their robes,</a>
<a id='line_1036'>      the conspirators mingled with the procession, lurked in the</a>
<a id='line_1037'>      angles of the chapel, and expected, as the signal of murder, the</a>
<a id='line_1038'>      intonation of the first psalm by the emperor himself. The</a>
<a id='line_1039'>      imperfect light, and the uniformity of dress, might have favored</a>
<a id='line_1040'>      his escape, whilst their assault was pointed against a harmless</a>
<a id='line_1041'>      priest; but they soon discovered their mistake, and encompassed</a>
<a id='line_1042'>      on all sides the royal victim. Without a weapon and without a</a>
<a id='line_1043'>      friend, he grasped a weighty cross, and stood at bay against the</a>
<a id='line_1044'>      hunters of his life; but as he asked for mercy, “This is the</a>
<a id='line_1045'>      hour, not of mercy, but of vengeance,” was the inexorable reply.</a>
<a id='line_1046'>      The stroke of a well-aimed sword separated from his body the</a>
<a id='line_1047'>      right arm and the cross, and Leo the Armenian was slain at the</a>
<a id='line_1048'>      foot of the altar. A memorable reverse of fortune was displayed</a>
<a id='line_1049'>      in Michael the Second, who from a defect in his speech was</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      surnamed the Stammerer. He was snatched from the fiery furnace to</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      the sovereignty of an empire; and as in the tumult a smith could</a>
<a id='line_1052'>      not readily be found, the fetters remained on his legs several</a>
<a id='line_1053'>      hours after he was seated on the throne of the Caesars. The royal</a>
<a id='line_1054'>      blood which had been the price of his elevation, was unprofitably</a>
<a id='line_1055'>      spent: in the purple he retained the ignoble vices of his origin;</a>
<a id='line_1056'>      and Michael lost his provinces with as supine indifference as if</a>
<a id='line_1057'>      they had been the inheritance of his fathers. His title was</a>
<a id='line_1058'>      disputed by Thomas, the last of the military triumvirate, who</a>
<a id='line_1059'>      transported into Europe fourscore thousand Barbarians from the</a>
<a id='line_1060'>      banks of the Tigris and the shores of the Caspian. He formed the</a>
<a id='line_1061'>      siege of Constantinople; but the capital was defended with</a>
<a id='line_1062'>      spiritual and carnal weapons; a Bulgarian king assaulted the camp</a>
<a id='line_1063'>      of the Orientals, and Thomas had the misfortune, or the weakness,</a>
<a id='line_1064'>      to fall alive into the power of the conqueror. The hands and feet</a>
<a id='line_1065'>      of the rebel were amputated; he was placed on an ass, and, amidst</a>
<a id='line_1066'>      the insults of the people, was led through the streets, which he</a>
<a id='line_1067'>      sprinkled with his blood. The depravation of manners, as savage</a>
<a id='line_1068'>      as they were corrupt, is marked by the presence of the emperor</a>
<a id='line_1069'>      himself. Deaf to the lamentation of a fellow-soldier, he</a>
<a id='line_1070'>      incessantly pressed the discovery of more accomplices, till his</a>
<a id='line_1071'>      curiosity was checked by the question of an honest or guilty</a>
<a id='line_1072'>      minister: “Would you give credit to an enemy against the most</a>
<a id='line_1073'>      faithful of your friends?” After the death of his first wife, the</a>
<a id='line_1074'>      emperor, at the request of the senate, drew from her monastery</a>
<a id='line_1075'>      Euphrosyne, the daughter of Constantine the Sixth. Her august</a>
<a id='line_1076'>      birth might justify a stipulation in the marriage-contract, that</a>
<a id='line_1077'>      her children should equally share the empire with their elder</a>
<a id='line_1078'>      brother. But the nuptials of Michael and Euphrosyne were barren;</a>
<a id='line_1079'>      and she was content with the title of mother of Theophilus, his</a>
<a id='line_1080'>      son and successor.</a>
<a id='line_1081'></a>
<a id='line_1082'>      The character of Theophilus is a rare example in which religious</a>
<a id='line_1083'>      zeal has allowed, and perhaps magnified, the virtues of a heretic</a>
<a id='line_1084'>      and a persecutor. His valor was often felt by the enemies, and</a>
<a id='line_1085'>      his justice by the subjects, of the monarchy; but the valor of</a>
<a id='line_1086'>      Theophilus was rash and fruitless, and his justice arbitrary and</a>
<a id='line_1087'>      cruel. He displayed the banner of the cross against the Saracens;</a>
<a id='line_1088'>      but his five expeditions were concluded by a signal overthrow:</a>
<a id='line_1089'>      Amorium, the native city of his ancestors, was levelled with the</a>
<a id='line_1090'>      ground and from his military toils he derived only the surname of</a>
<a id='line_1091'>      the Unfortunate. The wisdom of a sovereign is comprised in the</a>
<a id='line_1092'>      institution of laws and the choice of magistrates, and while he</a>
<a id='line_1093'>      seems without action, his civil government revolves round his</a>
<a id='line_1094'>      centre with the silence and order of the planetary system. But</a>
<a id='line_1095'>      the justice of Theophilus was fashioned on the model of the</a>
<a id='line_1096'>      Oriental despots, who, in personal and irregular acts of</a>
<a id='line_1097'>      authority, consult the reason or passion of the moment, without</a>
<a id='line_1098'>      measuring the sentence by the law, or the penalty by the offense.</a>
<a id='line_1099'>      A poor woman threw herself at the emperor’s feet to complain of a</a>
<a id='line_1100'>      powerful neighbor, the brother of the empress, who had raised his</a>
<a id='line_1101'>      palace-wall to such an inconvenient height, that her humble</a>
<a id='line_1102'>      dwelling was excluded from light and air! On the proof of the</a>
<a id='line_1103'>      fact, instead of granting, like an ordinary judge, sufficient or</a>
<a id='line_1104'>      ample damages to the plaintiff, the sovereign adjudged to her use</a>
<a id='line_1105'>      and benefit the palace and the ground. Nor was Theophilus content</a>
<a id='line_1106'>      with this extravagant satisfaction: his zeal converted a civil</a>
<a id='line_1107'>      trespass into a criminal act; and the unfortunate patrician was</a>
<a id='line_1108'>      stripped and scourged in the public place of Constantinople. For</a>
<a id='line_1109'>      some venial offenses, some defect of equity or vigilance, the</a>
<a id='line_1110'>      principal ministers, a praefect, a quaestor, a captain of the</a>
<a id='line_1111'>      guards, were banished or mutilated, or scalded with boiling</a>
<a id='line_1112'>      pitch, or burnt alive in the hippodrome; and as these dreadful</a>
<a id='line_1113'>      examples might be the effects of error or caprice, they must have</a>
<a id='line_1114'>      alienated from his service the best and wisest of the citizens.</a>
<a id='line_1115'>      But the pride of the monarch was flattered in the exercise of</a>
<a id='line_1116'>      power, or, as he thought, of virtue; and the people, safe in</a>
<a id='line_1117'>      their obscurity, applauded the danger and debasement of their</a>
<a id='line_1118'>      superiors. This extraordinary rigor was justified, in some</a>
<a id='line_1119'>      measure, by its salutary consequences; since, after a scrutiny of</a>
<a id='line_1120'>      seventeen days, not a complaint or abuse could be found in the</a>
<a id='line_1121'>      court or city; and it might be alleged that the Greeks could be</a>
<a id='line_1122'>      ruled only with a rod of iron, and that the public interest is</a>
<a id='line_1123'>      the motive and law of the supreme judge. Yet in the crime, or the</a>
<a id='line_1124'>      suspicion, of treason, that judge is of all others the most</a>
<a id='line_1125'>      credulous and partial. Theophilus might inflict a tardy vengeance</a>
<a id='line_1126'>      on the assassins of Leo and the saviors of his father; but he</a>
<a id='line_1127'>      enjoyed the fruits of their crime; and his jealous tyranny</a>
<a id='line_1128'>      sacrificed a brother and a prince to the future safety of his</a>
<a id='line_1129'>      life. A Persian of the race of the Sassanides died in poverty and</a>
<a id='line_1130'>      exile at Constantinople, leaving an only son, the issue of a</a>
<a id='line_1131'>      plebeian marriage. At the age of twelve years, the royal birth of</a>
<a id='line_1132'>      Theophobus was revealed, and his merit was not unworthy of his</a>
<a id='line_1133'>      birth. He was educated in the Byzantine palace, a Christian and a</a>
<a id='line_1134'>      soldier; advanced with rapid steps in the career of fortune and</a>
<a id='line_1135'>      glory; received the hand of the emperor’s sister; and was</a>
<a id='line_1136'>      promoted to the command of thirty thousand Persians, who, like</a>
<a id='line_1137'>      his father, had fled from the Mahometan conquerors. These troops,</a>
<a id='line_1138'>      doubly infected with mercenary and fanatic vices, were desirous</a>
<a id='line_1139'>      of revolting against their benefactor, and erecting the standard</a>
<a id='line_1140'>      of their native king but the loyal Theophobus rejected their</a>
<a id='line_1141'>      offers, disconcerted their schemes, and escaped from their hands</a>
<a id='line_1142'>      to the camp or palace of his royal brother. A generous confidence</a>
<a id='line_1143'>      might have secured a faithful and able guardian for his wife and</a>
<a id='line_1144'>      his infant son, to whom Theophilus, in the flower of his age, was</a>
<a id='line_1145'>      compelled to leave the inheritance of the empire. But his</a>
<a id='line_1146'>      jealousy was exasperated by envy and disease; he feared the</a>
<a id='line_1147'>      dangerous virtues which might either support or oppress their</a>
<a id='line_1148'>      infancy and weakness; and the dying emperor demanded the head of</a>
<a id='line_1149'>      the Persian prince. With savage delight he recognized the</a>
<a id='line_1150'>      familiar features of his brother: “Thou art no longer</a>
<a id='line_1151'>      Theophobus,” he said; and, sinking on his couch, he added, with a</a>
<a id='line_1152'>      faltering voice, “Soon, too soon, I shall be no more Theophilus!”</a>

<a id='line_1157'>      Chapter XLVIII: Succession And Characters Of The Greek</a>
<a id='line_1158'>      Emperors.—Part III.</a>
<a id='line_1159'></a>
<a id='line_1160'>      The Russians, who have borrowed from the Greeks the greatest part</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      of their civil and ecclesiastical policy, preserved, till the</a>
<a id='line_1162'>      last century, a singular institution in the marriage of the Czar.</a>
<a id='line_1163'>      They collected, not the virgins of every rank and of every</a>
<a id='line_1164'>      province, a vain and romantic idea, but the daughters of the</a>
<a id='line_1165'>      principal nobles, who awaited in the palace the choice of their</a>
<a id='line_1166'>      sovereign. It is affirmed, that a similar method was adopted in</a>
<a id='line_1167'>      the nuptials of Theophilus. With a golden apple in his hand, he</a>
<a id='line_1168'>      slowly walked between two lines of contending beauties: his eye</a>
<a id='line_1169'>      was detained by the charms of Icasia, and in the awkwardness of a</a>
<a id='line_1170'>      first declaration, the prince could only observe, that, in this</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      world, women had been the cause of much evil; “And surely, sir,”</a>
<a id='line_1172'>      she pertly replied, “they have likewise been the occasion of much</a>
<a id='line_1173'>      good.” This affectation of unseasonable wit displeased the</a>
<a id='line_1174'>      Imperial lover: he turned aside in disgust; Icasia concealed her</a>
<a id='line_1175'>      mortification in a convent; and the modest silence of Theodora</a>
<a id='line_1176'>      was rewarded with the golden apple. She deserved the love, but</a>
<a id='line_1177'>      did not escape the severity, of her lord. From the palace garden</a>
<a id='line_1178'>      he beheld a vessel deeply laden, and steering into the port: on</a>
<a id='line_1179'>      the discovery that the precious cargo of Syrian luxury was the</a>
<a id='line_1180'>      property of his wife, he condemned the ship to the flames, with a</a>
<a id='line_1181'>      sharp reproach, that her avarice had degraded the character of an</a>
<a id='line_1182'>      empress into that of a merchant. Yet his last choice intrusted</a>
<a id='line_1183'>      her with the guardianship of the empire and her son Michael, who</a>
<a id='line_1184'>      was left an orphan in the fifth year of his age. The restoration</a>
<a id='line_1185'>      of images, and the final extirpation of the Iconoclasts, has</a>
<a id='line_1186'>      endeared her name to the devotion of the Greeks; but in the</a>
<a id='line_1187'>      fervor of religious zeal, Theodora entertained a grateful regard</a>
<a id='line_1188'>      for the memory and salvation of her husband. After thirteen years</a>
<a id='line_1189'>      of a prudent and frugal administration, she perceived the decline</a>
<a id='line_1190'>      of her influence; but the second Irene imitated only the virtues</a>
<a id='line_1191'>      of her predecessor. Instead of conspiring against the life or</a>
<a id='line_1192'>      government of her son, she retired, without a struggle, though</a>
<a id='line_1193'>      not without a murmur, to the solitude of private life, deploring</a>
<a id='line_1194'>      the ingratitude, the vices, and the inevitable ruin, of the</a>
<a id='line_1195'>      worthless youth. Among the successors of Nero and Elagabalus, we</a>
<a id='line_1196'>      have not hitherto found the imitation of their vices, the</a>
<a id='line_1197'>      character of a Roman prince who considered pleasure as the object</a>
<a id='line_1198'>      of life, and virtue as the enemy of pleasure. Whatever might have</a>
<a id='line_1199'>      been the maternal care of Theodora in the education of Michael</a>
<a id='line_1200'>      the Third, her unfortunate son was a king before he was a man. If</a>
<a id='line_1201'>      the ambitious mother labored to check the progress of reason, she</a>
<a id='line_1202'>      could not cool the ebullition of passion; and her selfish policy</a>
<a id='line_1203'>      was justly repaid by the contempt and ingratitude of the</a>
<a id='line_1204'>      headstrong youth. At the age of eighteen, he rejected her</a>
<a id='line_1205'>      authority, without feeling his own incapacity to govern the</a>
<a id='line_1206'>      empire and himself. With Theodora, all gravity and wisdom retired</a>
<a id='line_1207'>      from the court; their place was supplied by the alternate</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      dominion of vice and folly; and it was impossible, without</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      forfeiting the public esteem, to acquire or preserve the favor of</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      the emperor. The millions of gold and silver which had been</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      accumulated for the service of the state, were lavished on the</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      vilest of men, who flattered his passions and shared his</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      pleasures; and in a reign of thirteen years, the richest of</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      sovereigns was compelled to strip the palace and the churches of</a>
<a id='line_1215'>      their precious furniture. Like Nero, he delighted in the</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      amusements of the theatre, and sighed to be surpassed in the</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      accomplishments in which he should have blushed to excel. Yet the</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      studies of Nero in music and poetry betrayed some symptoms of a</a>
<a id='line_1219'>      liberal taste; the more ignoble arts of the son of Theophilus</a>
<a id='line_1220'>      were confined to the chariot-race of the hippodrome. The four</a>
<a id='line_1221'>      factions which had agitated the peace, still amused the idleness,</a>
<a id='line_1222'>      of the capital: for himself, the emperor assumed the blue livery;</a>
<a id='line_1223'>      the three rival colors were distributed to his favorites, and in</a>
<a id='line_1224'>      the vile though eager contention he forgot the dignity of his</a>
<a id='line_1225'>      person and the safety of his dominions. He silenced the messenger</a>
<a id='line_1226'>      of an invasion, who presumed to divert his attention in the most</a>
<a id='line_1227'>      critical moment of the race; and by his command, the importunate</a>
<a id='line_1228'>      beacons were extinguished, that too frequently spread the alarm</a>
<a id='line_1229'>      from Tarsus to Constantinople. The most skilful charioteers</a>
<a id='line_1230'>      obtained the first place in his confidence and esteem; their</a>
<a id='line_1231'>      merit was profusely rewarded; the emperor feasted in their</a>
<a id='line_1232'>      houses, and presented their children at the baptismal font; and</a>
<a id='line_1233'>      while he applauded his own popularity, he affected to blame the</a>
<a id='line_1234'>      cold and stately reserve of his predecessors. The unnatural lusts</a>
<a id='line_1235'>      which had degraded even the manhood of Nero, were banished from</a>
<a id='line_1236'>      the world; yet the strength of Michael was consumed by the</a>
<a id='line_1237'>      indulgence of love and intemperance. 1012 In his midnight revels,</a>
<a id='line_1238'>      when his passions were inflamed by wine, he was provoked to issue</a>
<a id='line_1239'>      the most sanguinary commands; and if any feelings of humanity</a>
<a id='line_1240'>      were left, he was reduced, with the return of sense, to approve</a>
<a id='line_1241'>      the salutary disobedience of his servants. But the most</a>
<a id='line_1242'>      extraordinary feature in the character of Michael, is the profane</a>
<a id='line_1243'>      mockery of the religion of his country. The superstition of the</a>
<a id='line_1244'>      Greeks might indeed excite the smile of a philosopher; but his</a>
<a id='line_1245'>      smile would have been rational and temperate, and he must have</a>
<a id='line_1246'>      condemned the ignorant folly of a youth who insulted the objects</a>
<a id='line_1247'>      of public veneration. A buffoon of the court was invested in the</a>
<a id='line_1248'>      robes of the patriarch: his twelve metropolitans, among whom the</a>
<a id='line_1249'>      emperor was ranked, assumed their ecclesiastical garments: they</a>
<a id='line_1250'>      used or abused the sacred vessels of the altar; and in their</a>
<a id='line_1251'>      bacchanalian feasts, the holy communion was administered in a</a>
<a id='line_1252'>      nauseous compound of vinegar and mustard. Nor were these impious</a>
<a id='line_1253'>      spectacles concealed from the eyes of the city. On the day of a</a>
<a id='line_1254'>      solemn festival, the emperor, with his bishops or buffoons, rode</a>
<a id='line_1255'>      on asses through the streets, encountered the true patriarch at</a>
<a id='line_1256'>      the head of his clergy; and by their licentious shouts and</a>
<a id='line_1257'>      obscene gestures, disordered the gravity of the Christian</a>
<a id='line_1258'>      procession. The devotion of Michael appeared only in some offence</a>
<a id='line_1259'>      to reason or piety: he received his theatrical crowns from the</a>
<a id='line_1260'>      statue of the Virgin; and an Imperial tomb was violated for the</a>
<a id='line_1261'>      sake of burning the bones of Constantine the Iconoclast. By this</a>
<a id='line_1262'>      extravagant conduct, the son of Theophilus became as contemptible</a>
<a id='line_1263'>      as he was odious: every citizen was impatient for the deliverance</a>
<a id='line_1264'>      of his country; and even the favorites of the moment were</a>
<a id='line_1265'>      apprehensive that a caprice might snatch away what a caprice had</a>
<a id='line_1266'>      bestowed. In the thirtieth year of his age, and in the hour of</a>
<a id='line_1267'>      intoxication and sleep, Michael the Third was murdered in his</a>
<a id='line_1268'>      chamber by the founder of a new dynasty, whom the emperor had</a>
<a id='line_1269'>      raised to an equality of rank and power.</a>

<a id='line_1274'>      The genealogy of Basil the Macedonian (if it be not the spurious</a>
<a id='line_1275'>      offspring of pride and flattery) exhibits a genuine picture of</a>
<a id='line_1276'>      the revolution of the most illustrious families. The Arsacides,</a>
<a id='line_1277'>      the rivals of Rome, possessed the sceptre of the East near four</a>
<a id='line_1278'>      hundred years: a younger branch of these Parthian kings continued</a>
<a id='line_1279'>      to reign in Armenia; and their royal descendants survived the</a>
<a id='line_1280'>      partition and servitude of that ancient monarchy. Two of these,</a>
<a id='line_1281'>      Artabanus and Chlienes, escaped or retired to the court of Leo</a>
<a id='line_1282'>      the First: his bounty seated them in a safe and hospitable exile,</a>
<a id='line_1283'>      in the province of Macedonia: Adrianople was their final</a>
<a id='line_1284'>      settlement. During several generations they maintained the</a>
<a id='line_1285'>      dignity of their birth; and their Roman patriotism rejected the</a>
<a id='line_1286'>      tempting offers of the Persian and Arabian powers, who recalled</a>
<a id='line_1287'>      them to their native country. But their splendor was insensibly</a>
<a id='line_1288'>      clouded by time and poverty; and the father of Basil was reduced</a>
<a id='line_1289'>      to a small farm, which he cultivated with his own hands: yet he</a>
<a id='line_1290'>      scorned to disgrace the blood of the Arsacides by a plebeian</a>
<a id='line_1291'>      alliance: his wife, a widow of Adrianople, was pleased to count</a>
<a id='line_1292'>      among her ancestors the great Constantine; and their royal infant</a>
<a id='line_1293'>      was connected by some dark affinity of lineage or country with</a>
<a id='line_1294'>      the Macedonian Alexander. No sooner was he born, than the cradle</a>
<a id='line_1295'>      of Basil, his family, and his city, were swept away by an</a>
<a id='line_1296'>      inundation of the Bulgarians: he was educated a slave in a</a>
<a id='line_1297'>      foreign land; and in this severe discipline, he acquired the</a>
<a id='line_1298'>      hardiness of body and flexibility of mind which promoted his</a>
<a id='line_1299'>      future elevation. In the age of youth or manhood he shared the</a>
<a id='line_1300'>      deliverance of the Roman captives, who generously broke their</a>
<a id='line_1301'>      fetters, marched through Bulgaria to the shores of the Euxine,</a>
<a id='line_1302'>      defeated two armies of Barbarians, embarked in the ships which</a>
<a id='line_1303'>      had been stationed for their reception, and returned to</a>
<a id='line_1304'>      Constantinople, from whence they were distributed to their</a>
<a id='line_1305'>      respective homes. But the freedom of Basil was naked and</a>
<a id='line_1306'>      destitute: his farm was ruined by the calamities of war: after</a>
<a id='line_1307'>      his father’s death, his manual labor, or service, could no longer</a>
<a id='line_1308'>      support a family of orphans and he resolved to seek a more</a>
<a id='line_1309'>      conspicuous theatre, in which every virtue and every vice may</a>
<a id='line_1310'>      lead to the paths of greatness. The first night of his arrival at</a>
<a id='line_1311'>      Constantinople, without friends or money, the weary pilgrim slept</a>
<a id='line_1312'>      on the steps of the church of St. Diomede: he was fed by the</a>
<a id='line_1313'>      casual hospitality of a monk; and was introduced to the service</a>
<a id='line_1314'>      of a cousin and namesake of the emperor Theophilus; who, though</a>
<a id='line_1315'>      himself of a diminutive person, was always followed by a train of</a>
<a id='line_1316'>      tall and handsome domestics. Basil attended his patron to the</a>
<a id='line_1317'>      government of Peloponnesus; eclipsed, by his personal merit the</a>
<a id='line_1318'>      birth and dignity of Theophilus, and formed a useful connection</a>
<a id='line_1319'>      with a wealthy and charitable matron of Patras. Her spiritual or</a>
<a id='line_1320'>      carnal love embraced the young adventurer, whom she adopted as</a>
<a id='line_1321'>      her son. Danielis presented him with thirty slaves; and the</a>
<a id='line_1322'>      produce of her bounty was expended in the support of his</a>
<a id='line_1323'>      brothers, and the purchase of some large estates in Macedonia.</a>
<a id='line_1324'>      His gratitude or ambition still attached him to the service of</a>
<a id='line_1325'>      Theophilus; and a lucky accident recommended him to the notice of</a>
<a id='line_1326'>      the court. A famous wrestler, in the train of the Bulgarian</a>
<a id='line_1327'>      ambassadors, had defied, at the royal banquet, the boldest and</a>
<a id='line_1328'>      most robust of the Greeks. The strength of Basil was praised; he</a>
<a id='line_1329'>      accepted the challenge; and the Barbarian champion was overthrown</a>
<a id='line_1330'>      at the first onset. A beautiful but vicious horse was condemned</a>
<a id='line_1331'>      to be hamstrung: it was subdued by the dexterity and courage of</a>
<a id='line_1332'>      the servant of Theophilus; and his conqueror was promoted to an</a>
<a id='line_1333'>      honorable rank in the Imperial stables. But it was impossible to</a>
<a id='line_1334'>      obtain the confidence of Michael, without complying with his</a>
<a id='line_1335'>      vices; and his new favorite, the great chamberlain of the palace,</a>
<a id='line_1336'>      was raised and supported by a disgraceful marriage with a royal</a>
<a id='line_1337'>      concubine, and the dishonor of his sister, who succeeded to her</a>
<a id='line_1338'>      place. The public administration had been abandoned to the Caesar</a>
<a id='line_1339'>      Bardas, the brother and enemy of Theodora; but the arts of female</a>
<a id='line_1340'>      influence persuaded Michael to hate and to fear his uncle: he was</a>
<a id='line_1341'>      drawn from Constantinople, under the pretence of a Cretan</a>
<a id='line_1342'>      expedition, and stabbed in the tent of audience, by the sword of</a>
<a id='line_1343'>      the chamberlain, and in the presence of the emperor. About a</a>
<a id='line_1344'>      month after this execution, Basil was invested with the title of</a>
<a id='line_1345'>      Augustus and the government of the empire. He supported this</a>
<a id='line_1346'>      unequal association till his influence was fortified by popular</a>
<a id='line_1347'>      esteem. His life was endangered by the caprice of the emperor;</a>
<a id='line_1348'>      and his dignity was profaned by a second colleague, who had rowed</a>
<a id='line_1349'>      in the galleys. Yet the murder of his benefactor must be</a>
<a id='line_1350'>      condemned as an act of ingratitude and treason; and the churches</a>
<a id='line_1351'>      which he dedicated to the name of St. Michael were a poor and</a>
<a id='line_1352'>      puerile expiation of his guilt. The different ages of Basil the</a>
<a id='line_1353'>      First may be compared with those of Augustus. The situation of</a>
<a id='line_1354'>      the Greek did not allow him in his earliest youth to lead an army</a>
<a id='line_1355'>      against his country; or to proscribe the nobles of her sons; but</a>
<a id='line_1356'>      his aspiring genius stooped to the arts of a slave; he dissembled</a>
<a id='line_1357'>      his ambition and even his virtues, and grasped, with the bloody</a>
<a id='line_1358'>      hand of an assassin, the empire which he ruled with the wisdom</a>
<a id='line_1359'>      and tenderness of a parent.</a>
<a id='line_1360'></a>
<a id='line_1361'>      A private citizen may feel his interest repugnant to his duty;</a>
<a id='line_1362'>      but it must be from a deficiency of sense or courage, that an</a>
<a id='line_1363'>      absolute monarch can separate his happiness from his glory, or</a>
<a id='line_1364'>      his glory from the public welfare. The life or panegyric of Basil</a>
<a id='line_1365'>      has indeed been composed and published under the long reign of</a>
<a id='line_1366'>      his descendants; but even their stability on the throne may be</a>
<a id='line_1367'>      justly ascribed to the superior merit of their ancestor. In his</a>
<a id='line_1368'>      character, his grandson Constantine has attempted to delineate a</a>
<a id='line_1369'>      perfect image of royalty: but that feeble prince, unless he had</a>
<a id='line_1370'>      copied a real model, could not easily have soared so high above</a>
<a id='line_1371'>      the level of his own conduct or conceptions. But the most solid</a>
<a id='line_1372'>      praise of Basil is drawn from the comparison of a ruined and a</a>
<a id='line_1373'>      flourishing monarchy, that which he wrested from the dissolute</a>
<a id='line_1374'>      Michael, and that which he bequeathed to the Mecedonian dynasty.</a>
<a id='line_1375'>      The evils which had been sanctified by time and example, were</a>
<a id='line_1376'>      corrected by his master-hand; and he revived, if not the national</a>
<a id='line_1377'>      spirit, at least the order and majesty of the Roman empire. His</a>
<a id='line_1378'>      application was indefatigable, his temper cool, his understanding</a>
<a id='line_1379'>      vigorous and decisive; and in his practice he observed that rare</a>
<a id='line_1380'>      and salutary moderation, which pursues each virtue, at an equal</a>
<a id='line_1381'>      distance between the opposite vices. His military service had</a>
<a id='line_1382'>      been confined to the palace: nor was the emperor endowed with the</a>
<a id='line_1383'>      spirit or the talents of a warrior. Yet under his reign the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1384'>      arms were again formidable to the Barbarians. As soon as he had</a>
<a id='line_1385'>      formed a new army by discipline and exercise, he appeared in</a>
<a id='line_1386'>      person on the banks of the Euphrates, curbed the pride of the</a>
<a id='line_1387'>      Saracens, and suppressed the dangerous though just revolt of the</a>
<a id='line_1388'>      Manichaeans. His indignation against a rebel who had long eluded</a>
<a id='line_1389'>      his pursuit, provoked him to wish and to pray, that, by the grace</a>
<a id='line_1390'>      of God, he might drive three arrows into the head of Chrysochir.</a>
<a id='line_1391'>      That odious head, which had been obtained by treason rather than</a>
<a id='line_1392'>      by valor, was suspended from a tree, and thrice exposed to the</a>
<a id='line_1393'>      dexterity of the Imperial archer; a base revenge against the</a>
<a id='line_1394'>      dead, more worthy of the times than of the character of Basil.</a>
<a id='line_1395'>      But his principal merit was in the civil administration of the</a>
<a id='line_1396'>      finances and of the laws. To replenish an exhausted treasury, it</a>
<a id='line_1397'>      was proposed to resume the lavish and ill-placed gifts of his</a>
<a id='line_1398'>      predecessor: his prudence abated one moiety of the restitution;</a>
<a id='line_1399'>      and a sum of twelve hundred thousand pounds was instantly</a>
<a id='line_1400'>      procured to answer the most pressing demands, and to allow some</a>
<a id='line_1401'>      space for the mature operations of economy. Among the various</a>
<a id='line_1402'>      schemes for the improvement of the revenue, a new mode was</a>
<a id='line_1403'>      suggested of capitation, or tribute, which would have too much</a>
<a id='line_1404'>      depended on the arbitrary discretion of the assessors. A</a>
<a id='line_1405'>      sufficient list of honest and able agents was instantly produced</a>
<a id='line_1406'>      by the minister; but on the more careful scrutiny of Basil</a>
<a id='line_1407'>      himself, only two could be found, who might be safely intrusted</a>
<a id='line_1408'>      with such dangerous powers; but they justified his esteem by</a>
<a id='line_1409'>      declining his confidence. But the serious and successful</a>
<a id='line_1410'>      diligence of the emperor established by degrees the equitable</a>
<a id='line_1411'>      balance of property and payment, of receipt and expenditure; a</a>
<a id='line_1412'>      peculiar fund was appropriated to each service; and a public</a>
<a id='line_1413'>      method secured the interest of the prince and the property of the</a>
<a id='line_1414'>      people. After reforming the luxury, he assigned two patrimonial</a>
<a id='line_1415'>      estates to supply the decent plenty, of the Imperial table: the</a>
<a id='line_1416'>      contributions of the subject were reserved for his defence; and</a>
<a id='line_1417'>      the residue was employed in the embellishment of the capital and</a>
<a id='line_1418'>      provinces. A taste for building, however costly, may deserve some</a>
<a id='line_1419'>      praise and much excuse: from thence industry is fed, art is</a>
<a id='line_1420'>      encouraged, and some object is attained of public emolument or</a>
<a id='line_1421'>      pleasure: the use of a road, an aqueduct, or a hospital, is</a>
<a id='line_1422'>      obvious and solid; and the hundred churches that arose by the</a>
<a id='line_1423'>      command of Basil were consecrated to the devotion of the age. In</a>
<a id='line_1424'>      the character of a judge he was assiduous and impartial; desirous</a>
<a id='line_1425'>      to save, but not afraid to strike: the oppressors of the people</a>
<a id='line_1426'>      were severely chastised; but his personal foes, whom it might be</a>
<a id='line_1427'>      unsafe to pardon, were condemned, after the loss of their eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1428'>      to a life of solitude and repentance. The change of language and</a>
<a id='line_1429'>      manners demanded a revision of the obsolete jurisprudence of</a>
<a id='line_1430'>      Justinian: the voluminous body of his Institutes, Pandects, Code,</a>
<a id='line_1431'>      and Novels, was digested under forty titles, in the Greek idiom;</a>
<a id='line_1432'>      and the Basilics, which were improved and completed by his son</a>
<a id='line_1433'>      and grandson, must be referred to the original genius of the</a>
<a id='line_1434'>      founder of their race. This glorious reign was terminated by an</a>
<a id='line_1435'>      accident in the chase. A furious stag entangled his horns in the</a>
<a id='line_1436'>      belt of Basil, and raised him from his horse: he was rescued by</a>
<a id='line_1437'>      an attendant, who cut the belt and slew the animal; but the fall,</a>
<a id='line_1438'>      or the fever, exhausted the strength of the aged monarch, and he</a>
<a id='line_1439'>      expired in the palace amidst the tears of his family and people.</a>
<a id='line_1440'>      If he struck off the head of the faithful servant for presuming</a>
<a id='line_1441'>      to draw his sword against his sovereign, the pride of despotism,</a>
<a id='line_1442'>      which had lain dormant in his life, revived in the last moments</a>
<a id='line_1443'>      of despair, when he no longer wanted or valued the opinion of</a>
<a id='line_1444'>      mankind.</a>
<a id='line_1445'></a>
<a id='line_1446'>      Of the four sons of the emperor, Constantine died before his</a>
<a id='line_1447'>      father, whose grief and credulity were amused by a flattering</a>
<a id='line_1448'>      impostor and a vain apparition. Stephen, the youngest, was</a>
<a id='line_1449'>      content with the honors of a patriarch and a saint; both Leo and</a>
<a id='line_1450'>      Alexander were alike invested with the purple, but the powers of</a>
<a id='line_1451'>      government were solely exercised by the elder brother. The name</a>
<a id='line_1452'>      of Leo the Sixth has been dignified with the title of</a>
<a id='line_1453'>      philosopher; and the union of the prince and the sage, of the</a>
<a id='line_1454'>      active and speculative virtues, would indeed constitute the</a>
<a id='line_1455'>      perfection of human nature. But the claims of Leo are far short</a>
<a id='line_1456'>      of this ideal excellence. Did he reduce his passions and</a>
<a id='line_1457'>      appetites under the dominion of reason? His life was spent in the</a>
<a id='line_1458'>      pomp of the palace, in the society of his wives and concubines;</a>
<a id='line_1459'>      and even the clemency which he showed, and the peace which he</a>
<a id='line_1460'>      strove to preserve, must be imputed to the softness and indolence</a>
<a id='line_1461'>      of his character. Did he subdue his prejudices, and those of his</a>
<a id='line_1462'>      subjects? His mind was tinged with the most puerile superstition;</a>
<a id='line_1463'>      the influence of the clergy, and the errors of the people, were</a>
<a id='line_1464'>      consecrated by his laws; and the oracles of Leo, which reveal, in</a>
<a id='line_1465'>      prophetic style, the fates of the empire, are founded on the arts</a>
<a id='line_1466'>      of astrology and divination. If we still inquire the reason of</a>
<a id='line_1467'>      his sage appellation, it can only be replied, that the son of</a>
<a id='line_1468'>      Basil was less ignorant than the greater part of his</a>
<a id='line_1469'>      contemporaries in church and state; that his education had been</a>
<a id='line_1470'>      directed by the learned Photius; and that several books of</a>
<a id='line_1471'>      profane and ecclesiastical science were composed by the pen, or</a>
<a id='line_1472'>      in the name, of the Imperial philosopher. But the reputation of</a>
<a id='line_1473'>      his philosophy and religion was overthrown by a domestic vice,</a>
<a id='line_1474'>      the repetition of his nuptials. The primitive ideas of the merit</a>
<a id='line_1475'>      and holiness of celibacy were preached by the monks and</a>
<a id='line_1476'>      entertained by the Greeks. Marriage was allowed as a necessary</a>
<a id='line_1477'>      means for the propagation of mankind; after the death of either</a>
<a id='line_1478'>      party, the survivor might satisfy, by a second union, the</a>
<a id='line_1479'>      weakness or the strength of the flesh: but a third marriage was</a>
<a id='line_1480'>      censured as a state of legal fornication; and a fourth was a sin</a>
<a id='line_1481'>      or scandal as yet unknown to the Christians of the East. In the</a>
<a id='line_1482'>      beginning of his reign, Leo himself had abolished the state of</a>
<a id='line_1483'>      concubines, and condemned, without annulling, third marriages:</a>
<a id='line_1484'>      but his patriotism and love soon compelled him to violate his own</a>
<a id='line_1485'>      laws, and to incur the penance, which in a similar case he had</a>
<a id='line_1486'>      imposed on his subjects. In his three first alliances, his</a>
<a id='line_1487'>      nuptial bed was unfruitful; the emperor required a female</a>
<a id='line_1488'>      companion, and the empire a legitimate heir. The beautiful Zoe</a>
<a id='line_1489'>      was introduced into the palace as a concubine; and after a trial</a>
<a id='line_1490'>      of her fecundity, and the birth of Constantine, her lover</a>
<a id='line_1491'>      declared his intention of legitimating the mother and the child,</a>
<a id='line_1492'>      by the celebration of his fourth nuptials. But the patriarch</a>
<a id='line_1493'>      Nicholas refused his blessing: the Imperial baptism of the young</a>
<a id='line_1494'>      prince was obtained by a promise of separation; and the</a>
<a id='line_1495'>      contumacious husband of Zoe was excluded from the communion of</a>
<a id='line_1496'>      the faithful. Neither the fear of exile, nor the desertion of his</a>
<a id='line_1497'>      brethren, nor the authority of the Latin church, nor the danger</a>
<a id='line_1498'>      of failure or doubt in the succession to the empire, could bend</a>
<a id='line_1499'>      the spirit of the inflexible monk. After the death of Leo, he was</a>
<a id='line_1500'>      recalled from exile to the civil and ecclesiastical</a>
<a id='line_1501'>      administration; and the edict of union which was promulgated in</a>
<a id='line_1502'>      the name of Constantine, condemned the future scandal of fourth</a>
<a id='line_1503'>      marriages, and left a tacit imputation on his own birth. In the</a>
<a id='line_1504'>      Greek language, purple and porphyry are the same word: and as the</a>
<a id='line_1505'>      colors of nature are invariable, we may learn, that a dark deep</a>
<a id='line_1506'>      red was the Tyrian dye which stained the purple of the ancients.</a>
<a id='line_1507'>      An apartment of the Byzantine palace was lined with porphyry: it</a>
<a id='line_1508'>      was reserved for the use of the pregnant empresses; and the royal</a>
<a id='line_1509'>      birth of their children was expressed by the appellation of</a>
<a id='line_1510'>      porphyrogenite, or born in the purple. Several of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1511'>      princes had been blessed with an heir; but this peculiar surname</a>
<a id='line_1512'>      was first applied to Constantine the Seventh. His life and</a>
<a id='line_1513'>      titular reign were of equal duration; but of fifty-four years,</a>
<a id='line_1514'>      six had elapsed before his father’s death; and the son of Leo was</a>
<a id='line_1515'>      ever the voluntary or reluctant subject of those who oppressed</a>
<a id='line_1516'>      his weakness or abused his confidence. His uncle Alexander, who</a>
<a id='line_1517'>      had long been invested with the title of Augustus, was the first</a>
<a id='line_1518'>      colleague and governor of the young prince: but in a rapid career</a>
<a id='line_1519'>      of vice and folly, the brother of Leo already emulated the</a>
<a id='line_1520'>      reputation of Michael; and when he was extinguished by a timely</a>
<a id='line_1521'>      death, he entertained a project of castrating his nephew, and</a>
<a id='line_1522'>      leaving the empire to a worthless favorite. The succeeding years</a>
<a id='line_1523'>      of the minority of Constantine were occupied by his mother Zoe,</a>
<a id='line_1524'>      and a succession or council of seven regents, who pursued their</a>
<a id='line_1525'>      interest, gratified their passions, abandoned the republic,</a>
<a id='line_1526'>      supplanted each other, and finally vanished in the presence of a</a>
<a id='line_1527'>      soldier. From an obscure origin, Romanus Lecapenus had raised</a>
<a id='line_1528'>      himself to the command of the naval armies; and in the anarchy of</a>
<a id='line_1529'>      the times, had deserved, or at least had obtained, the national</a>
<a id='line_1530'>      esteem. With a victorious and affectionate fleet, he sailed from</a>
<a id='line_1531'>      the mouth of the Danube into the harbor of Constantinople, and</a>
<a id='line_1532'>      was hailed as the deliverer of the people, and the guardian of</a>
<a id='line_1533'>      the prince. His supreme office was at first defined by the new</a>
<a id='line_1534'>      appellation of father of the emperor; but Romanus soon disdained</a>
<a id='line_1535'>      the subordinate powers of a minister, and assumed with the titles</a>
<a id='line_1536'>      of Caesar and Augustus, the full independence of royalty, which</a>
<a id='line_1537'>      he held near five-and-twenty years. His three sons, Christopher,</a>
<a id='line_1538'>      Stephen, and Constantine were successively adorned with the same</a>
<a id='line_1539'>      honors, and the lawful emperor was degraded from the first to the</a>
<a id='line_1540'>      fifth rank in this college of princes. Yet, in the preservation</a>
<a id='line_1541'>      of his life and crown, he might still applaud his own fortune and</a>
<a id='line_1542'>      the clemency of the usurper. The examples of ancient and modern</a>
<a id='line_1543'>      history would have excused the ambition of Romanus: the powers</a>
<a id='line_1544'>      and the laws of the empire were in his hand; the spurious birth</a>
<a id='line_1545'>      of Constantine would have justified his exclusion; and the grave</a>
<a id='line_1546'>      or the monastery was open to receive the son of the concubine.</a>
<a id='line_1547'>      But Lecapenus does not appear to have possessed either the</a>
<a id='line_1548'>      virtues or the vices of a tyrant. The spirit and activity of his</a>
<a id='line_1549'>      private life dissolved away in the sunshine of the throne; and in</a>
<a id='line_1550'>      his licentious pleasures, he forgot the safety both of the</a>
<a id='line_1551'>      republic and of his family. Of a mild and religious character, he</a>
<a id='line_1552'>      respected the sanctity of oaths, the innocence of the youth, the</a>
<a id='line_1553'>      memory of his parents, and the attachment of the people. The</a>
<a id='line_1554'>      studious temper and retirement of Constantine disarmed the</a>
<a id='line_1555'>      jealousy of power: his books and music, his pen and his pencil,</a>
<a id='line_1556'>      were a constant source of amusement; and if he could improve a</a>
<a id='line_1557'>      scanty allowance by the sale of his pictures, if their price was</a>
<a id='line_1558'>      not enhanced by the name of the artist, he was endowed with a</a>
<a id='line_1559'>      personal talent, which few princes could employ in the hour of</a>
<a id='line_1560'>      adversity.</a>
<a id='line_1561'></a>
<a id='line_1562'>      The fall of Romanus was occasioned by his own vices and those of</a>
<a id='line_1563'>      his children. After the decease of Christopher, his eldest son,</a>
<a id='line_1564'>      the two surviving brothers quarrelled with each other, and</a>
<a id='line_1565'>      conspired against their father. At the hour of noon, when all</a>
<a id='line_1566'>      strangers were regularly excluded from the palace, they entered</a>
<a id='line_1567'>      his apartment with an armed force, and conveyed him, in the habit</a>
<a id='line_1568'>      of a monk, to a small island in the Propontis, which was peopled</a>
<a id='line_1569'>      by a religious community. The rumor of this domestic revolution</a>
<a id='line_1570'>      excited a tumult in the city; but Porphyrogenitus alone, the true</a>
<a id='line_1571'>      and lawful emperor, was the object of the public care; and the</a>
<a id='line_1572'>      sons of Lecapenus were taught, by tardy experience, that they had</a>
<a id='line_1573'>      achieved a guilty and perilous enterprise for the benefit of</a>
<a id='line_1574'>      their rival. Their sister Helena, the wife of Constantine,</a>
<a id='line_1575'>      revealed, or supposed, their treacherous design of assassinating</a>
<a id='line_1576'>      her husband at the royal banquet. His loyal adherents were</a>
<a id='line_1577'>      alarmed, and the two usurpers were prevented, seized, degraded</a>
<a id='line_1578'>      from the purple, and embarked for the same island and monastery</a>
<a id='line_1579'>      where their father had been so lately confined. Old Romanus met</a>
<a id='line_1580'>      them on the beach with a sarcastic smile, and, after a just</a>
<a id='line_1581'>      reproach of their folly and ingratitude, presented his Imperial</a>
<a id='line_1582'>      colleagues with an equal share of his water and vegetable diet.</a>
<a id='line_1583'>      In the fortieth year of his reign, Constantine the Seventh</a>
<a id='line_1584'>      obtained the possession of the Eastern world, which he ruled or</a>
<a id='line_1585'>      seemed to rule, near fifteen years. But he was devoid of that</a>
<a id='line_1586'>      energy of character which could emerge into a life of action and</a>
<a id='line_1587'>      glory; and the studies, which had amused and dignified his</a>
<a id='line_1588'>      leisure, were incompatible with the serious duties of a</a>
<a id='line_1589'>      sovereign. The emperor neglected the practice to instruct his son</a>
<a id='line_1590'>      Romanus in the theory of government; while he indulged the habits</a>
<a id='line_1591'>      of intemperance and sloth, he dropped the reins of the</a>
<a id='line_1592'>      administration into the hands of Helena his wife; and, in the</a>
<a id='line_1593'>      shifting scene of her favor and caprice, each minister was</a>
<a id='line_1594'>      regretted in the promotion of a more worthless successor. Yet the</a>
<a id='line_1595'>      birth and misfortunes of Constantine had endeared him to the</a>
<a id='line_1596'>      Greeks; they excused his failings; they respected his learning,</a>
<a id='line_1597'>      his innocence, and charity, his love of justice; and the ceremony</a>
<a id='line_1598'>      of his funeral was mourned with the unfeigned tears of his</a>
<a id='line_1599'>      subjects. The body, according to ancient custom, lay in state in</a>
<a id='line_1600'>      the vestibule of the palace; and the civil and military officers,</a>
<a id='line_1601'>      the patricians, the senate, and the clergy approached in due</a>
<a id='line_1602'>      order to adore and kiss the inanimate corpse of their sovereign.</a>
<a id='line_1603'>      Before the procession moved towards the Imperial sepulchre, a</a>
<a id='line_1604'>      herald proclaimed this awful admonition: “Arise, O king of the</a>
<a id='line_1605'>      world, and obey the summons of the King of kings!”</a>
<a id='line_1606'></a>
<a id='line_1607'>      The death of Constantine was imputed to poison; and his son</a>
<a id='line_1608'>      Romanus, who derived that name from his maternal grandfather,</a>
<a id='line_1609'>      ascended the throne of Constantinople. A prince who, at the age</a>
<a id='line_1610'>      of twenty, could be suspected of anticipating his inheritance,</a>
<a id='line_1611'>      must have been already lost in the public esteem; yet Romanus was</a>
<a id='line_1612'>      rather weak than wicked; and the largest share of the guilt was</a>
<a id='line_1613'>      transferred to his wife, Theophano, a woman of base origin</a>
<a id='line_1614'>      masculine spirit, and flagitious manners. The sense of personal</a>
<a id='line_1615'>      glory and public happiness, the true pleasures of royalty, were</a>
<a id='line_1616'>      unknown to the son of Constantine; and, while the two brothers,</a>
<a id='line_1617'>      Nicephorus and Leo, triumphed over the Saracens, the hours which</a>
<a id='line_1618'>      the emperor owed to his people were consumed in strenuous</a>
<a id='line_1619'>      idleness. In the morning he visited the circus; at noon he</a>
<a id='line_1620'>      feasted the senators; the greater part of the afternoon he spent</a>
<a id='line_1621'>      in the sphoeristerium, or tennis-court, the only theatre of his</a>
<a id='line_1622'>      victories; from thence he passed over to the Asiatic side of the</a>
<a id='line_1623'>      Bosphorus, hunted and killed four wild boars of the largest size,</a>
<a id='line_1624'>      and returned to the palace, proudly content with the labors of</a>
<a id='line_1625'>      the day. In strength and beauty he was conspicuous above his</a>
<a id='line_1626'>      equals: tall and straight as a young cypress, his complexion was</a>
<a id='line_1627'>      fair and florid, his eyes sparkling, his shoulders broad, his</a>
<a id='line_1628'>      nose long and aquiline. Yet even these perfections were</a>
<a id='line_1629'>      insufficient to fix the love of Theophano; and, after a reign of</a>
<a id='line_1630'>      four 1013 years, she mingled for her husband the same deadly</a>
<a id='line_1631'>      draught which she had composed for his father.</a>

<a id='line_1635'></a>
<a id='line_1636'>      By his marriage with this impious woman, Romanus the younger left</a>
<a id='line_1637'>      two sons, Basil the Second and Constantine the Ninth, and two</a>
<a id='line_1638'>      daughters, Theophano and Anne. The eldest sister was given to</a>
<a id='line_1639'>      Otho the Second, emperor of the West; the younger became the wife</a>
<a id='line_1640'>      of Wolodomir, great duke and apostle of russia, and by the</a>
<a id='line_1641'>      marriage of her granddaughter with Henry the First, king of</a>
<a id='line_1642'>      France, the blood of the Macedonians, and perhaps of the</a>
<a id='line_1643'>      Arsacides, still flows in the veins of the Bourbon line. After</a>
<a id='line_1644'>      the death of her husband, the empress aspired to reign in the</a>
<a id='line_1645'>      name of her sons, the elder of whom was five, and the younger</a>
<a id='line_1646'>      only two, years of age; but she soon felt the instability of a</a>
<a id='line_1647'>      throne which was supported by a female who could not be esteemed,</a>
<a id='line_1648'>      and two infants who could not be feared. Theophano looked around</a>
<a id='line_1649'>      for a protector, and threw herself into the arms of the bravest</a>
<a id='line_1650'>      soldier; her heart was capacious; but the deformity of the new</a>
<a id='line_1651'>      favorite rendered it more than probable that interest was the</a>
<a id='line_1652'>      motive and excuse of her love. Nicephorus Phocus united, in the</a>
<a id='line_1653'>      popular opinion, the double merit of a hero and a saint. In the</a>
<a id='line_1654'>      former character, his qualifications were genuine and splendid:</a>
<a id='line_1655'>      the descendant of a race illustrious by their military exploits,</a>
<a id='line_1656'>      he had displayed in every station and in every province the</a>
<a id='line_1657'>      courage of a soldier and the conduct of a chief; and Nicephorus</a>
<a id='line_1658'>      was crowned with recent laurels, from the important conquest of</a>
<a id='line_1659'>      the Isle of Crete. His religion was of a more ambiguous cast; and</a>
<a id='line_1660'>      his hair-cloth, his fasts, his pious idiom, and his wish to</a>
<a id='line_1661'>      retire from the business of the world, were a convenient mask for</a>
<a id='line_1662'>      his dark and dangerous ambition. Yet he imposed on a holy</a>
<a id='line_1663'>      patriarch, by whose influence, and by a decree of the senate, he</a>
<a id='line_1664'>      was intrusted, during the minority of the young princes, with the</a>
<a id='line_1665'>      absolute and independent command of the Oriental armies. As soon</a>
<a id='line_1666'>      as he had secured the leaders and the troops, he boldly marched</a>
<a id='line_1667'>      to Constantinople, trampled on his enemies, avowed his</a>
<a id='line_1668'>      correspondence with the empress, and without degrading her sons,</a>
<a id='line_1669'>      assumed, with the title of Augustus, the preeminence of rank and</a>
<a id='line_1670'>      the plenitude of power. But his marriage with Theophano was</a>
<a id='line_1671'>      refused by the same patriarch who had placed the crown on his</a>
<a id='line_1672'>      head: by his second nuptials he incurred a year of canonical</a>
<a id='line_1673'>      penance; 1014 a bar of spiritual affinity was opposed to their</a>
<a id='line_1674'>      celebration; and some evasion and perjury were required to</a>
<a id='line_1675'>      silence the scruples of the clergy and people. The popularity of</a>
<a id='line_1676'>      the emperor was lost in the purple: in a reign of six years he</a>
<a id='line_1677'>      provoked the hatred of strangers and subjects: and the hypocrisy</a>
<a id='line_1678'>      and avarice of the first Nicephorus were revived in his</a>
<a id='line_1679'>      successor. Hypocrisy I shall never justify or palliate; but I</a>
<a id='line_1680'>      will dare to observe, that the odious vice of avarice is of all</a>
<a id='line_1681'>      others most hastily arraigned, and most unmercifully condemned.</a>
<a id='line_1682'>      In a private citizen, our judgment seldom expects an accurate</a>

<a id='line_1685'>      of taxes too often an indispensable duty. In the use of his</a>
<a id='line_1686'>      patrimony, the generous temper of Nicephorus had been proved; and</a>
<a id='line_1687'>      the revenue was strictly applied to the service of the state:</a>

<a id='line_1706'>      Among the warriors who promoted his elevation, and served under</a>
<a id='line_1707'>      his standard, a noble and valiant Armenian had deserved and</a>

<a id='line_1709'>      was below the ordinary standard: but this diminutive body was</a>
<a id='line_1710'>      endowed with strength, beauty, and the soul of a hero. By the</a>
<a id='line_1711'>      jealousy of the emperor’s brother, he was degraded from the</a>
<a id='line_1712'>      office of general of the East, to that of director of the posts,</a>
<a id='line_1713'>      and his murmurs were chastised with disgrace and exile. But</a>
<a id='line_1714'>      Zimisces was ranked among the numerous lovers of the empress: on</a>
<a id='line_1715'>      her intercession, he was permitted to reside at Chalcedon, in the</a>
<a id='line_1716'>      neighborhood of the capital: her bounty was repaid in his</a>
<a id='line_1717'>      clandestine and amorous visits to the palace; and Theophano</a>
<a id='line_1718'>      consented, with alacrity, to the death of an ugly and penurious</a>
<a id='line_1719'>      husband. Some bold and trusty conspirators were concealed in her</a>
<a id='line_1720'>      most private chambers: in the darkness of a winter night,</a>
<a id='line_1721'>      Zimisces, with his principal companions, embarked in a small</a>
<a id='line_1722'>      boat, traversed the Bosphorus, landed at the palace stairs, and</a>
<a id='line_1723'>      silently ascended a ladder of ropes, which was cast down by the</a>
<a id='line_1724'>      female attendants. Neither his own suspicions, nor the warnings</a>
<a id='line_1725'>      of his friends, nor the tardy aid of his brother Leo, nor the</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      fortress which he had erected in the palace, could protect</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      Nicephorus from a domestic foe, at whose voice every door was</a>
<a id='line_1728'>      open to the assassins. As he slept on a bear-skin on the ground,</a>
<a id='line_1729'>      he was roused by their noisy intrusion, and thirty daggers</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      glittered before his eyes. It is doubtful whether Zimisces</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      imbrued his hands in the blood of his sovereign; but he enjoyed</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      the inhuman spectacle of revenge. 1016 The murder was protracted</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      by insult and cruelty: and as soon as the head of Nicephorus was</a>
<a id='line_1734'>      shown from the window, the tumult was hushed, and the Armenian</a>
<a id='line_1735'>      was emperor of the East. On the day of his coronation, he was</a>
<a id='line_1736'>      stopped on the threshold of St. Sophia, by the intrepid</a>
<a id='line_1737'>      patriarch; who charged his conscience with the deed of treason</a>
<a id='line_1738'>      and blood; and required, as a sign of repentance, that he should</a>
<a id='line_1739'>      separate himself from his more criminal associate. This sally of</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      apostolic zeal was not offensive to the prince, since he could</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      neither love nor trust a woman who had repeatedly violated the</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      most sacred obligations; and Theophano, instead of sharing his</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      imperial fortune, was dismissed with ignominy from his bed and</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      palace. In their last interview, she displayed a frantic and</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      impotent rage; accused the ingratitude of her lover; assaulted,</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      with words and blows, her son Basil, as he stood silent and</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      submissive in the presence of a superior colleague; and avowed</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      her own prostitution in proclaiming the illegitimacy of his</a>
<a id='line_1749'>      birth. The public indignation was appeased by her exile, and the</a>
<a id='line_1750'>      punishment of the meaner accomplices: the death of an unpopular</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      prince was forgiven; and the guilt of Zimisces was forgotten in</a>
<a id='line_1752'>      the splendor of his virtues. Perhaps his profusion was less</a>
<a id='line_1753'>      useful to the state than the avarice of Nicephorus; but his</a>
<a id='line_1754'>      gentle and generous behavior delighted all who approached his</a>
<a id='line_1755'>      person; and it was only in the paths of victory that he trod in</a>
<a id='line_1756'>      the footsteps of his predecessor. The greatest part of his reign</a>
<a id='line_1757'>      was employed in the camp and the field: his personal valor and</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      activity were signalized on the Danube and the Tigris, the</a>
<a id='line_1759'>      ancient boundaries of the Roman world; and by his double triumph</a>
<a id='line_1760'>      over the Russians and the Saracens, he deserved the titles of</a>
<a id='line_1761'>      savior of the empire, and conqueror of the East. In his last</a>
<a id='line_1762'>      return from Syria, he observed that the most fruitful lands of</a>
<a id='line_1763'>      his new provinces were possessed by the eunuchs. “And is it for</a>
<a id='line_1764'>      them,” he exclaimed, with honest indignation, “that we have</a>
<a id='line_1765'>      fought and conquered? Is it for them that we shed our blood, and</a>
<a id='line_1766'>      exhaust the treasures of our people?” The complaint was reechoed</a>
<a id='line_1767'>      to the palace, and the death of Zimisces is strongly marked with</a>
<a id='line_1768'>      the suspicion of poison.</a>

<a id='line_1773'>      by invoking the name of the “mother of God,” with his own hand</a>

<a id='line_1779'>      Under this usurpation, or regency, of twelve years, the two</a>
<a id='line_1780'>      lawful emperors, Basil and Constantine, had silently grown to the</a>
<a id='line_1781'>      age of manhood. Their tender years had been incapable of</a>
<a id='line_1782'>      dominion: the respectful modesty of their attendance and</a>
<a id='line_1783'>      salutation was due to the age and merit of their guardians; the</a>
<a id='line_1784'>      childless ambition of those guardians had no temptation to</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      violate their right of succession: their patrimony was ably and</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      faithfully administered; and the premature death of Zimisces was</a>
<a id='line_1787'>      a loss, rather than a benefit, to the sons of Romanus. Their want</a>
<a id='line_1788'>      of experience detained them twelve years longer the obscure and</a>
<a id='line_1789'>      voluntary pupils of a minister, who extended his reign by</a>
<a id='line_1790'>      persuading them to indulge the pleasures of youth, and to disdain</a>
<a id='line_1791'>      the labors of government. In this silken web, the weakness of</a>
<a id='line_1792'>      Constantine was forever entangled; but his elder brother felt the</a>
<a id='line_1793'>      impulse of genius and the desire of action; he frowned, and the</a>
<a id='line_1794'>      minister was no more. Basil was the acknowledged sovereign of</a>
<a id='line_1795'>      Constantinople and the provinces of Europe; but Asia was</a>
<a id='line_1796'>      oppressed by two veteran generals, Phocas and Sclerus, who,</a>
<a id='line_1797'>      alternately friends and enemies, subjects and rebels, maintained</a>
<a id='line_1798'>      their independence, and labored to emulate the example of</a>
<a id='line_1799'>      successful usurpation. Against these domestic enemies the son of</a>
<a id='line_1800'>      Romanus first drew his sword, and they trembled in the presence</a>
<a id='line_1801'>      of a lawful and high-spirited prince. The first, in the front of</a>
<a id='line_1802'>      battle, was thrown from his horse, by the stroke of poison, or an</a>
<a id='line_1803'>      arrow; the second, who had been twice loaded with chains, 1017</a>
<a id='line_1804'>      and twice invested with the purple, was desirous of ending in</a>
<a id='line_1805'>      peace the small remainder of his days. As the aged suppliant</a>
<a id='line_1806'>      approached the throne, with dim eyes and faltering steps, leaning</a>
<a id='line_1807'>      on his two attendants, the emperor exclaimed, in the insolence of</a>
<a id='line_1808'>      youth and power, “And is this the man who has so long been the</a>
<a id='line_1809'>      object of our terror?” After he had confirmed his own authority,</a>
<a id='line_1810'>      and the peace of the empire, the trophies of Nicephorus and</a>
<a id='line_1811'>      Zimisces would not suffer their royal pupil to sleep in the</a>
<a id='line_1812'>      palace. His long and frequent expeditions against the Saracens</a>
<a id='line_1813'>      were rather glorious than useful to the empire; but the final</a>
<a id='line_1814'>      destruction of the kingdom of Bulgaria appears, since the time of</a>
<a id='line_1815'>      Belisarius, the most important triumph of the Roman arms. Yet,</a>
<a id='line_1816'>      instead of applauding their victorious prince, his subjects</a>
<a id='line_1817'>      detested the rapacious and rigid avarice of Basil; and in the</a>
<a id='line_1818'>      imperfect narrative of his exploits, we can only discern the</a>
<a id='line_1819'>      courage, patience, and ferociousness of a soldier. A vicious</a>
<a id='line_1820'>      education, which could not subdue his spirit, had clouded his</a>
<a id='line_1821'>      mind; he was ignorant of every science; and the remembrance of</a>
<a id='line_1822'>      his learned and feeble grandsire might encourage his real or</a>
<a id='line_1823'>      affected contempt of laws and lawyers, of artists and arts. Of</a>
<a id='line_1824'>      such a character, in such an age, superstition took a firm and</a>
<a id='line_1825'>      lasting possession; after the first license of his youth, Basil</a>
<a id='line_1826'>      the Second devoted his life, in the palace and the camp, to the</a>
<a id='line_1827'>      penance of a hermit, wore the monastic habit under his robes and</a>
<a id='line_1828'>      armor, observed a vow of continence, and imposed on his appetites</a>
<a id='line_1829'>      a perpetual abstinence from wine and flesh. In the sixty-eighth</a>
<a id='line_1830'>      year of his age, his martial spirit urged him to embark in person</a>
<a id='line_1831'>      for a holy war against the Saracens of Sicily; he was prevented</a>
<a id='line_1832'>      by death, and Basil, surnamed the Slayer of the Bulgarians, was</a>
<a id='line_1833'>      dismissed from the world with the blessings of the clergy and the</a>
<a id='line_1834'>      curse of the people. After his decease, his brother Constantine</a>
<a id='line_1835'>      enjoyed, about three years, the power, or rather the pleasures,</a>
<a id='line_1836'>      of royalty; and his only care was the settlement of the</a>
<a id='line_1837'>      succession. He had enjoyed sixty-six years the title of Augustus;</a>
<a id='line_1838'>      and the reign of the two brothers is the longest, and most</a>
<a id='line_1839'>      obscure, of the Byzantine history.</a>

<a id='line_1843'></a>
<a id='line_1844'>      A lineal succession of five emperors, in a period of one hundred</a>
<a id='line_1845'>      and sixty years, had attached the loyalty of the Greeks to the</a>
<a id='line_1846'>      Macedonian dynasty, which had been thrice respected by the</a>
<a id='line_1847'>      usurpers of their power. After the death of Constantine the</a>
<a id='line_1848'>      Ninth, the last male of the royal race, a new and broken scene</a>
<a id='line_1849'>      presents itself, and the accumulated years of twelve emperors do</a>
<a id='line_1850'>      not equal the space of his single reign. His elder brother had</a>
<a id='line_1851'>      preferred his private chastity to the public interest, and</a>
<a id='line_1852'>      Constantine himself had only three daughters; Eudocia, who took</a>
<a id='line_1853'>      the veil, and Zoe and Theodora, who were preserved till a mature</a>
<a id='line_1854'>      age in a state of ignorance and virginity. When their marriage</a>
<a id='line_1855'>      was discussed in the council of their dying father, the cold or</a>
<a id='line_1856'>      pious Theodora refused to give an heir to the empire, but her</a>
<a id='line_1857'>      sister Zoe presented herself a willing victim at the altar.</a>
<a id='line_1858'>      Romanus Argyrus, a patrician of a graceful person and fair</a>
<a id='line_1859'>      reputation, was chosen for her husband, and, on his declining</a>
<a id='line_1860'>      that honor, was informed, that blindness or death was the second</a>
<a id='line_1861'>      alternative. The motive of his reluctance was conjugal affection</a>
<a id='line_1862'>      but his faithful wife sacrificed her own happiness to his safety</a>
<a id='line_1863'>      and greatness; and her entrance into a monastery removed the only</a>
<a id='line_1864'>      bar to the Imperial nuptials. After the decease of Constantine,</a>
<a id='line_1865'>      the sceptre devolved to Romanus the Third; but his labors at home</a>
<a id='line_1866'>      and abroad were equally feeble and fruitless; and the mature age,</a>
<a id='line_1867'>      the forty-eight years of Zoe, were less favorable to the hopes of</a>
<a id='line_1868'>      pregnancy than to the indulgence of pleasure. Her favorite</a>
<a id='line_1869'>      chamberlain was a handsome Paphlagonian of the name of Michael,</a>
<a id='line_1870'>      whose first trade had been that of a money-changer; and Romanus,</a>
<a id='line_1871'>      either from gratitude or equity, connived at their criminal</a>
<a id='line_1872'>      intercourse, or accepted a slight assurance of their innocence.</a>
<a id='line_1873'>      But Zoe soon justified the Roman maxim, that every adulteress is</a>
<a id='line_1874'>      capable of poisoning her husband; and the death of Romanus was</a>
<a id='line_1875'>      instantly followed by the scandalous marriage and elevation of</a>
<a id='line_1876'>      Michael the Fourth. The expectations of Zoe were, however,</a>
<a id='line_1877'>      disappointed: instead of a vigorous and grateful lover, she had</a>
<a id='line_1878'>      placed in her bed a miserable wretch, whose health and reason</a>
<a id='line_1879'>      were impaired by epileptic fits, and whose conscience was</a>
<a id='line_1880'>      tormented by despair and remorse. The most skilful physicians of</a>
<a id='line_1881'>      the mind and body were summoned to his aid; and his hopes were</a>
<a id='line_1882'>      amused by frequent pilgrimages to the baths, and to the tombs of</a>
<a id='line_1883'>      the most popular saints; the monks applauded his penance, and,</a>
<a id='line_1884'>      except restitution, (but to whom should he have restored?)</a>
<a id='line_1885'>      Michael sought every method of expiating his guilt. While he</a>
<a id='line_1886'>      groaned and prayed in sackcloth and ashes, his brother, the</a>
<a id='line_1887'>      eunuch John, smiled at his remorse, and enjoyed the harvest of a</a>
<a id='line_1888'>      crime of which himself was the secret and most guilty author. His</a>
<a id='line_1889'>      administration was only the art of satiating his avarice, and Zoe</a>
<a id='line_1890'>      became a captive in the palace of her fathers, and in the hands</a>
<a id='line_1891'>      of her slaves. When he perceived the irretrievable decline of his</a>
<a id='line_1892'>      brother’s health, he introduced his nephew, another Michael, who</a>
<a id='line_1893'>      derived his surname of Calaphates from his father’s occupation in</a>
<a id='line_1894'>      the careening of vessels: at the command of the eunuch, Zoe</a>
<a id='line_1895'>      adopted for her son the son of a mechanic; and this fictitious</a>
<a id='line_1896'>      heir was invested with the title and purple of the Caesars, in</a>
<a id='line_1897'>      the presence of the senate and clergy. So feeble was the</a>
<a id='line_1898'>      character of Zoe, that she was oppressed by the liberty and power</a>
<a id='line_1899'>      which she recovered by the death of the Paphlagonian; and at the</a>
<a id='line_1900'>      end of four days, she placed the crown on the head of Michael the</a>
<a id='line_1901'>      Fifth, who had protested, with tears and oaths, that he should</a>
<a id='line_1902'>      ever reign the first and most obedient of her subjects.</a>
<a id='line_1903'></a>
<a id='line_1904'>      The only act of his short reign was his base ingratitude to his</a>
<a id='line_1905'>      benefactors, the eunuch and the empress. The disgrace of the</a>
<a id='line_1906'>      former was pleasing to the public: but the murmurs, and at length</a>
<a id='line_1907'>      the clamors, of Constantinople deplored the exile of Zoe, the</a>
<a id='line_1908'>      daughter of so many emperors; her vices were forgotten, and</a>
<a id='line_1909'>      Michael was taught, that there is a period in which the patience</a>
<a id='line_1910'>      of the tamest slaves rises into fury and revenge. The citizens of</a>
<a id='line_1911'>      every degree assembled in a formidable tumult which lasted three</a>
<a id='line_1912'>      days; they besieged the palace, forced the gates, recalled their</a>
<a id='line_1913'>      mothers, Zoe from her prison, Theodora from her monastery, and</a>
<a id='line_1914'>      condemned the son of Calaphates to the loss of his eyes or of his</a>
<a id='line_1915'>      life. For the first time the Greeks beheld with surprise the two</a>
<a id='line_1916'>      royal sisters seated on the same throne, presiding in the senate,</a>
<a id='line_1917'>      and giving audience to the ambassadors of the nations. But the</a>
<a id='line_1918'>      singular union subsisted no more than two months; the two</a>
<a id='line_1919'>      sovereigns, their tempers, interests, and adherents, were</a>
<a id='line_1920'>      secretly hostile to each other; and as Theodora was still averse</a>
<a id='line_1921'>      to marriage, the indefatigable Zoe, at the age of sixty,</a>
<a id='line_1922'>      consented, for the public good, to sustain the embraces of a</a>
<a id='line_1923'>      third husband, and the censures of the Greek church. His name and</a>
<a id='line_1924'>      number were Constantine the Tenth, and the epithet of Monomachus,</a>
<a id='line_1925'>      the single combatant, must have been expressive of his valor and</a>
<a id='line_1926'>      victory in some public or private quarrel. But his health was</a>
<a id='line_1927'>      broken by the tortures of the gout, and his dissolute reign was</a>
<a id='line_1928'>      spent in the alternative of sickness and pleasure. A fair and</a>
<a id='line_1929'>      noble widow had accompanied Constantine in his exile to the Isle</a>
<a id='line_1930'>      of Lesbos, and Sclerena gloried in the appellation of his</a>
<a id='line_1931'>      mistress. After his marriage and elevation, she was invested with</a>
<a id='line_1932'>      the title and pomp of Augusta, and occupied a contiguous</a>
<a id='line_1933'>      apartment in the palace. The lawful consort (such was the</a>
<a id='line_1934'>      delicacy or corruption of Zoe) consented to this strange and</a>
<a id='line_1935'>      scandalous partition; and the emperor appeared in public between</a>
<a id='line_1936'>      his wife and his concubine. He survived them both; but the last</a>
<a id='line_1937'>      measures of Constantine to change the order of succession were</a>
<a id='line_1938'>      prevented by the more vigilant friends of Theodora; and after his</a>
<a id='line_1939'>      decease, she resumed, with the general consent, the possession of</a>
<a id='line_1940'>      her inheritance. In her name, and by the influence of four</a>
<a id='line_1941'>      eunuchs, the Eastern world was peaceably governed about nineteen</a>
<a id='line_1942'>      months; and as they wished to prolong their dominion, they</a>
<a id='line_1943'>      persuaded the aged princess to nominate for her successor Michael</a>
<a id='line_1944'>      the Sixth. The surname of Stratioticus declares his military</a>
<a id='line_1945'>      profession; but the crazy and decrepit veteran could only see</a>
<a id='line_1946'>      with the eyes, and execute with the hands, of his ministers.</a>
<a id='line_1947'>      Whilst he ascended the throne, Theodora sunk into the grave; the</a>
<a id='line_1948'>      last of the Macedonian or Basilian dynasty. I have hastily</a>
<a id='line_1949'>      reviewed, and gladly dismiss, this shameful and destructive</a>
<a id='line_1950'>      period of twenty-eight years, in which the Greeks, degraded below</a>
<a id='line_1951'>      the common level of servitude, were transferred like a herd of</a>
<a id='line_1952'>      cattle by the choice or caprice of two impotent females.</a>
<a id='line_1953'></a>
<a id='line_1954'>      From this night of slavery, a ray of freedom, or at least of</a>
<a id='line_1955'>      spirit, begins to emerge: the Greeks either preserved or revived</a>
<a id='line_1956'>      the use of surnames, which perpetuate the fame of hereditary</a>
<a id='line_1957'>      virtue: and we now discern the rise, succession, and alliances of</a>
<a id='line_1958'>      the last dynasties of Constantinople and Trebizond. The Comneni,</a>
<a id='line_1959'>      who upheld for a while the fate of the sinking empire, assumed</a>
<a id='line_1960'>      the honor of a Roman origin: but the family had been long since</a>
<a id='line_1961'>      transported from Italy to Asia. Their patrimonial estate was</a>
<a id='line_1962'>      situate in the district of Castamona, in the neighborhood of the</a>
<a id='line_1963'>      Euxine; and one of their chiefs, who had already entered the</a>
<a id='line_1964'>      paths of ambition, revisited with affection, perhaps with regret,</a>
<a id='line_1965'>      the modest though honorable dwelling of his fathers. The first of</a>
<a id='line_1966'>      their line was the illustrious Manuel, who in the reign of the</a>
<a id='line_1967'>      second Basil, contributed by war and treaty to appease the</a>
<a id='line_1968'>      troubles of the East: he left, in a tender age, two sons, Isaac</a>
<a id='line_1969'>      and John, whom, with the consciousness of desert, he bequeathed</a>
<a id='line_1970'>      to the gratitude and favor of his sovereign. The noble youths</a>
<a id='line_1971'>      were carefully trained in the learning of the monastery, the arts</a>
<a id='line_1972'>      of the palace, and the exercises of the camp: and from the</a>
<a id='line_1973'>      domestic service of the guards, they were rapidly promoted to the</a>
<a id='line_1974'>      command of provinces and armies. Their fraternal union doubled</a>
<a id='line_1975'>      the force and reputation of the Comneni, and their ancient</a>
<a id='line_1976'>      nobility was illustrated by the marriage of the two brothers,</a>
<a id='line_1977'>      with a captive princess of Bulgaria, and the daughter of a</a>
<a id='line_1978'>      patrician, who had obtained the name of Charon from the number of</a>
<a id='line_1979'>      enemies whom he had sent to the infernal shades. The soldiers had</a>
<a id='line_1980'>      served with reluctant loyalty a series of effeminate masters; the</a>
<a id='line_1981'>      elevation of Michael the Sixth was a personal insult to the more</a>
<a id='line_1982'>      deserving generals; and their discontent was inflamed by the</a>
<a id='line_1983'>      parsimony of the emperor and the insolence of the eunuchs. They</a>
<a id='line_1984'>      secretly assembled in the sanctuary of St. Sophia, and the votes</a>
<a id='line_1985'>      of the military synod would have been unanimous in favor of the</a>
<a id='line_1986'>      old and valiant Catacalon, if the patriotism or modesty of the</a>
<a id='line_1987'>      veteran had not suggested the importance of birth as well as</a>
<a id='line_1988'>      merit in the choice of a sovereign. Isaac Comnenus was approved</a>
<a id='line_1989'>      by general consent, and the associates separated without delay to</a>
<a id='line_1990'>      meet in the plains of Phrygia at the head of their respective</a>
<a id='line_1991'>      squadrons and detachments. The cause of Michael was defended in a</a>
<a id='line_1992'>      single battle by the mercenaries of the Imperial guard, who were</a>
<a id='line_1993'>      aliens to the public interest, and animated only by a principle</a>
<a id='line_1994'>      of honor and gratitude. After their defeat, the fears of the</a>
<a id='line_1995'>      emperor solicited a treaty, which was almost accepted by the</a>
<a id='line_1996'>      moderation of the Comnenian. But the former was betrayed by his</a>
<a id='line_1997'>      ambassadors, and the latter was prevented by his friends. The</a>
<a id='line_1998'>      solitary Michael submitted to the voice of the people; the</a>
<a id='line_1999'>      patriarch annulled their oath of allegiance; and as he shaved the</a>
<a id='line_2000'>      head of the royal monk, congratulated his beneficial exchange of</a>
<a id='line_2001'>      temporal royalty for the kingdom of heaven; an exchange, however,</a>
<a id='line_2002'>      which the priest, on his own account, would probably have</a>
<a id='line_2003'>      declined. By the hands of the same patriarch, Isaac Comnenus was</a>
<a id='line_2004'>      solemnly crowned; the sword which he inscribed on his coins might</a>
<a id='line_2005'>      be an offensive symbol, if it implied his title by conquest; but</a>
<a id='line_2006'>      this sword would have been drawn against the foreign and domestic</a>
<a id='line_2007'>      enemies of the state. The decline of his health and vigor</a>
<a id='line_2008'>      suspended the operation of active virtue; and the prospect of</a>
<a id='line_2009'>      approaching death determined him to interpose some moments</a>
<a id='line_2010'>      between life and eternity. But instead of leaving the empire as</a>
<a id='line_2011'>      the marriage portion of his daughter, his reason and inclination</a>
<a id='line_2012'>      concurred in the preference of his brother John, a soldier, a</a>
<a id='line_2013'>      patriot, and the father of five sons, the future pillars of an</a>
<a id='line_2014'>      hereditary succession. His first modest reluctance might be the</a>
<a id='line_2015'>      natural dictates of discretion and tenderness, but his obstinate</a>
<a id='line_2016'>      and successful perseverance, however it may dazzle with the show</a>
<a id='line_2017'>      of virtue, must be censured as a criminal desertion of his duty,</a>
<a id='line_2018'>      and a rare offence against his family and country. The purple</a>
<a id='line_2019'>      which he had refused was accepted by Constantine Ducas, a friend</a>
<a id='line_2020'>      of the Comnenian house, and whose noble birth was adorned with</a>
<a id='line_2021'>      the experience and reputation of civil policy. In the monastic</a>
<a id='line_2022'>      habit, Isaac recovered his health, and survived two years his</a>
<a id='line_2023'>      voluntary abdication. At the command of his abbot, he observed</a>
<a id='line_2024'>      the rule of St. Basil, and executed the most servile offices of</a>
<a id='line_2025'>      the convent: but his latent vanity was gratified by the frequent</a>
<a id='line_2026'>      and respectful visits of the reigning monarch, who revered in his</a>
<a id='line_2027'>      person the character of a benefactor and a saint. If Constantine</a>
<a id='line_2028'>      the Eleventh were indeed the subject most worthy of empire, we</a>
<a id='line_2029'>      must pity the debasement of the age and nation in which he was</a>
<a id='line_2030'>      chosen. In the labor of puerile declamations he sought, without</a>
<a id='line_2031'>      obtaining, the crown of eloquence, more precious, in his opinion,</a>
<a id='line_2032'>      than that of Rome; and in the subordinate functions of a judge,</a>
<a id='line_2033'>      he forgot the duties of a sovereign and a warrior. Far from</a>
<a id='line_2034'>      imitating the patriotic indifference of the authors of his</a>
<a id='line_2035'>      greatness, Ducas was anxious only to secure, at the expense of</a>
<a id='line_2036'>      the republic, the power and prosperity of his children. His three</a>
<a id='line_2037'>      sons, Michael the Seventh, Andronicus the First, and Constantine</a>
<a id='line_2038'>      the Twelfth, were invested, in a tender age, with the equal title</a>
<a id='line_2039'>      of Augustus; and the succession was speedily opened by their</a>
<a id='line_2040'>      father’s death. His widow, Eudocia, was intrusted with the</a>
<a id='line_2041'>      administration; but experience had taught the jealousy of the</a>
<a id='line_2042'>      dying monarch to protect his sons from the danger of her second</a>
<a id='line_2043'>      nuptials; and her solemn engagement, attested by the principal</a>
<a id='line_2044'>      senators, was deposited in the hands of the patriarch. Before the</a>
<a id='line_2045'>      end of seven months, the wants of Eudocia, or those of the state,</a>
<a id='line_2046'>      called aloud for the male virtues of a soldier; and her heart had</a>
<a id='line_2047'>      already chosen Romanus Diogenes, whom she raised from the</a>
<a id='line_2048'>      scaffold to the throne. The discovery of a treasonable attempt</a>
<a id='line_2049'>      had exposed him to the severity of the laws: his beauty and valor</a>
<a id='line_2050'>      absolved him in the eyes of the empress; and Romanus, from a mild</a>
<a id='line_2051'>      exile, was recalled on the second day to the command of the</a>
<a id='line_2052'>      Oriental armies.</a>
<a id='line_2053'></a>
<a id='line_2054'>      Her royal choice was yet unknown to the public; and the promise</a>
<a id='line_2055'>      which would have betrayed her falsehood and levity, was stolen by</a>
<a id='line_2056'>      a dexterous emissary from the ambition of the patriarch. Xiphilin</a>
<a id='line_2057'>      at first alleged the sanctity of oaths, and the sacred nature of</a>
<a id='line_2058'>      a trust; but a whisper, that his brother was the future emperor,</a>
<a id='line_2059'>      relaxed his scruples, and forced him to confess that the public</a>
<a id='line_2060'>      safety was the supreme law. He resigned the important paper; and</a>
<a id='line_2061'>      when his hopes were confounded by the nomination of Romanus, he</a>
<a id='line_2062'>      could no longer regain his security, retract his declarations,</a>
<a id='line_2063'>      nor oppose the second nuptials of the empress. Yet a murmur was</a>
<a id='line_2064'>      heard in the palace; and the Barbarian guards had raised their</a>
<a id='line_2065'>      battle-axes in the cause of the house of Lucas, till the young</a>
<a id='line_2066'>      princes were soothed by the tears of their mother and the solemn</a>
<a id='line_2067'>      assurances of the fidelity of their guardian, who filled the</a>
<a id='line_2068'>      Imperial station with dignity and honor. Hereafter I shall relate</a>
<a id='line_2069'>      his valiant, but unsuccessful, efforts to resist the progress of</a>
<a id='line_2070'>      the Turks. His defeat and captivity inflicted a deadly wound on</a>
<a id='line_2071'>      the Byzantine monarchy of the East; and after he was released</a>
<a id='line_2072'>      from the chains of the sultan, he vainly sought his wife and his</a>
<a id='line_2073'>      subjects. His wife had been thrust into a monastery, and the</a>
<a id='line_2074'>      subjects of Romanus had embraced the rigid maxim of the civil</a>
<a id='line_2075'>      law, that a prisoner in the hands of the enemy is deprived, as by</a>
<a id='line_2076'>      the stroke of death, of all the public and private rights of a</a>
<a id='line_2077'>      citizen. In the general consternation, the Caesar John asserted</a>
<a id='line_2078'>      the indefeasible right of his three nephews: Constantinople</a>
<a id='line_2079'>      listened to his voice: and the Turkish captive was proclaimed in</a>
<a id='line_2080'>      the capital, and received on the frontier, as an enemy of the</a>
<a id='line_2081'>      republic. Romanus was not more fortunate in domestic than in</a>
<a id='line_2082'>      foreign war: the loss of two battles compelled him to yield, on</a>
<a id='line_2083'>      the assurance of fair and honorable treatment; but his enemies</a>
<a id='line_2084'>      were devoid of faith or humanity; and, after the cruel extinction</a>
<a id='line_2085'>      of his sight, his wounds were left to bleed and corrupt, till in</a>
<a id='line_2086'>      a few days he was relieved from a state of misery. Under the</a>
<a id='line_2087'>      triple reign of the house of Ducas, the two younger brothers were</a>
<a id='line_2088'>      reduced to the vain honors of the purple; but the eldest, the</a>
<a id='line_2089'>      pusillanimous Michael, was incapable of sustaining the Roman</a>
<a id='line_2090'>      sceptre; and his surname of Parapinaces denotes the reproach</a>
<a id='line_2091'>      which he shared with an avaricious favorite, who enhanced the</a>
<a id='line_2092'>      price, and diminished the measure, of wheat. In the school of</a>
<a id='line_2093'>      Psellus, and after the example of his mother, the son of Eudocia</a>
<a id='line_2094'>      made some proficiency in philosophy and rhetoric; but his</a>
<a id='line_2095'>      character was degraded, rather than ennobled, by the virtues of a</a>
<a id='line_2096'>      monk and the learning of a sophist. Strong in the contempt of</a>
<a id='line_2097'>      their sovereign and their own esteem, two generals, at the head</a>
<a id='line_2098'>      of the European and Asiatic legions, assumed the purple at</a>
<a id='line_2099'>      Adrianople and Nice. Their revolt was in the same months; they</a>
<a id='line_2100'>      bore the same name of Nicephorus; but the two candidates were</a>
<a id='line_2101'>      distinguished by the surnames of Bryennius and Botaniates; the</a>
<a id='line_2102'>      former in the maturity of wisdom and courage, the latter</a>
<a id='line_2103'>      conspicuous only by the memory of his past exploits. While</a>
<a id='line_2104'>      Botaniates advanced with cautious and dilatory steps, his active</a>
<a id='line_2105'>      competitor stood in arms before the gates of Constantinople. The</a>
<a id='line_2106'>      name of Bryennius was illustrious; his cause was popular; but his</a>
<a id='line_2107'>      licentious troops could not be restrained from burning and</a>
<a id='line_2108'>      pillaging a suburb; and the people, who would have hailed the</a>
<a id='line_2109'>      rebel, rejected and repulsed the incendiary of his country. This</a>
<a id='line_2110'>      change of the public opinion was favorable to Botaniates, who at</a>
<a id='line_2111'>      length, with an army of Turks, approached the shores of</a>
<a id='line_2112'>      Chalcedon. A formal invitation, in the name of the patriarch, the</a>
<a id='line_2113'>      synod, and the senate, was circulated through the streets of</a>
<a id='line_2114'>      Constantinople; and the general assembly, in the dome of St.</a>
<a id='line_2115'>      Sophia, debated, with order and calmness, on the choice of their</a>
<a id='line_2116'>      sovereign. The guards of Michael would have dispersed this</a>
<a id='line_2117'>      unarmed multitude; but the feeble emperor, applauding his own</a>
<a id='line_2118'>      moderation and clemency, resigned the ensigns of royalty, and was</a>
<a id='line_2119'>      rewarded with the monastic habit, and the title of Archbishop of</a>
<a id='line_2120'>      Ephesus. He left a son, a Constantine, born and educated in the</a>
<a id='line_2121'>      purple; and a daughter of the house of Ducas illustrated the</a>
<a id='line_2122'>      blood, and confirmed the succession, of the Comnenian dynasty.</a>
<a id='line_2123'></a>
<a id='line_2124'>      John Comnenus, the brother of the emperor Isaac, survived in</a>
<a id='line_2125'>      peace and dignity his generous refusal of the sceptre. By his</a>
<a id='line_2126'>      wife Anne, a woman of masculine spirit and a policy, he left</a>
<a id='line_2127'>      eight children: the three daughters multiplied the Comnenian</a>
<a id='line_2128'>      alliance with the noblest of the Greeks: of the five sons, Manuel</a>
<a id='line_2129'>      was stopped by a premature death; Isaac and Alexius restored the</a>
<a id='line_2130'>      Imperial greatness of their house, which was enjoyed without toil</a>
<a id='line_2131'>      or danger by the two younger brethren, Adrian and Nicephorus.</a>
<a id='line_2132'>      Alexius, the third and most illustrious of the brothers was</a>
<a id='line_2133'>      endowed by nature with the choicest gifts both of mind and body:</a>
<a id='line_2134'>      they were cultivated by a liberal education, and exercised in the</a>
<a id='line_2135'>      school of obedience and adversity. The youth was dismissed from</a>
<a id='line_2136'>      the perils of the Turkish war, by the paternal care of the</a>
<a id='line_2137'>      emperor Romanus: but the mother of the Comneni, with her aspiring</a>
<a id='line_2138'>      face, was accused of treason, and banished, by the sons of Ducas,</a>
<a id='line_2139'>      to an island in the Propontis. The two brothers soon emerged into</a>
<a id='line_2140'>      favor and action, fought by each other’s side against the rebels</a>
<a id='line_2141'>      and Barbarians, and adhered to the emperor Michael, till he was</a>
<a id='line_2142'>      deserted by the world and by himself. In his first interview with</a>
<a id='line_2143'>      Botaniates, “Prince,” said Alexius with a noble frankness, “my</a>
<a id='line_2144'>      duty rendered me your enemy; the decrees of God and of the people</a>
<a id='line_2145'>      have made me your subject. Judge of my future loyalty by my past</a>
<a id='line_2146'>      opposition.” The successor of Michael entertained him with esteem</a>
<a id='line_2147'>      and confidence: his valor was employed against three rebels, who</a>
<a id='line_2148'>      disturbed the peace of the empire, or at least of the emperors.</a>
<a id='line_2149'>      Ursel, Bryennius, and Basilacius, were formidable by their</a>
<a id='line_2150'>      numerous forces and military fame: they were successively</a>
<a id='line_2151'>      vanquished in the field, and led in chains to the foot of the</a>
<a id='line_2152'>      throne; and whatever treatment they might receive from a timid</a>
<a id='line_2153'>      and cruel court, they applauded the clemency, as well as the</a>
<a id='line_2154'>      courage, of their conqueror. But the loyalty of the Comneni was</a>
<a id='line_2155'>      soon tainted by fear and suspicion; nor is it easy to settle</a>
<a id='line_2156'>      between a subject and a despot, the debt of gratitude, which the</a>
<a id='line_2157'>      former is tempted to claim by a revolt, and the latter to</a>
<a id='line_2158'>      discharge by an executioner. The refusal of Alexius to march</a>
<a id='line_2159'>      against a fourth rebel, the husband of his sister, destroyed the</a>
<a id='line_2160'>      merit or memory of his past services: the favorites of Botaniates</a>
<a id='line_2161'>      provoked the ambition which they apprehended and accused; and the</a>
<a id='line_2162'>      retreat of the two brothers might be justified by the defence of</a>
<a id='line_2163'>      their life and liberty. The women of the family were deposited in</a>
<a id='line_2164'>      a sanctuary, respected by tyrants: the men, mounted on horseback,</a>
<a id='line_2165'>      sallied from the city, and erected the standard of civil war. The</a>
<a id='line_2166'>      soldiers who had been gradually assembled in the capital and the</a>
<a id='line_2167'>      neighborhood, were devoted to the cause of a victorious and</a>
<a id='line_2168'>      injured leader: the ties of common interest and domestic alliance</a>
<a id='line_2169'>      secured the attachment of the house of Ducas; and the generous</a>
<a id='line_2170'>      dispute of the Comneni was terminated by the decisive resolution</a>
<a id='line_2171'>      of Isaac, who was the first to invest his younger brother with</a>
<a id='line_2172'>      the name and ensigns of royalty. They returned to Constantinople,</a>
<a id='line_2173'>      to threaten rather than besiege that impregnable fortress; but</a>
<a id='line_2174'>      the fidelity of the guards was corrupted; a gate was surprised,</a>
<a id='line_2175'>      and the fleet was occupied by the active courage of George</a>
<a id='line_2176'>      Palaeologus, who fought against his father, without foreseeing</a>
<a id='line_2177'>      that he labored for his posterity. Alexius ascended the throne;</a>
<a id='line_2178'>      and his aged competitor disappeared in a monastery. An army of</a>
<a id='line_2179'>      various nations was gratified with the pillage of the city; but</a>
<a id='line_2180'>      the public disorders were expiated by the tears and fasts of the</a>
<a id='line_2181'>      Comneni, who submitted to every penance compatible with the</a>
<a id='line_2182'>      possession of the empire. The life of the emperor Alexius has</a>
<a id='line_2183'>      been delineated by a favorite daughter, who was inspired by a</a>
<a id='line_2184'>      tender regard for his person and a laudable zeal to perpetuate</a>
<a id='line_2185'>      his virtues. Conscious of the just suspicions of her readers, the</a>
<a id='line_2186'>      princess Anna Comnena repeatedly protests, that, besides her</a>
<a id='line_2187'>      personal knowledge, she had searched the discourses and writings</a>
<a id='line_2188'>      of the most respectable veterans: and after an interval of thirty</a>
<a id='line_2189'>      years, forgotten by, and forgetful of, the world, her mournful</a>
<a id='line_2190'>      solitude was inaccessible to hope and fear; and that truth, the</a>
<a id='line_2191'>      naked perfect truth, was more dear and sacred than the memory of</a>
<a id='line_2192'>      her parent. Yet, instead of the simplicity of style and narrative</a>
<a id='line_2193'>      which wins our belief, an elaborate affectation of rhetoric and</a>
<a id='line_2194'>      science betrays in every page the vanity of a female author. The</a>
<a id='line_2195'>      genuine character of Alexius is lost in a vague constellation of</a>
<a id='line_2196'>      virtues; and the perpetual strain of panegyric and apology</a>
<a id='line_2197'>      awakens our jealousy, to question the veracity of the historian</a>
<a id='line_2198'>      and the merit of the hero. We cannot, however, refuse her</a>
<a id='line_2199'>      judicious and important remark, that the disorders of the times</a>
<a id='line_2200'>      were the misfortune and the glory of Alexius; and that every</a>
<a id='line_2201'>      calamity which can afflict a declining empire was accumulated on</a>
<a id='line_2202'>      his reign by the justice of Heaven and the vices of his</a>
<a id='line_2203'>      predecessors. In the East, the victorious Turks had spread, from</a>
<a id='line_2204'>      Persia to the Hellespont, the reign of the Koran and the</a>
<a id='line_2205'>      Crescent: the West was invaded by the adventurous valor of the</a>
<a id='line_2206'>      Normans; and, in the moments of peace, the Danube poured forth</a>
<a id='line_2207'>      new swarms, who had gained, in the science of war, what they had</a>
<a id='line_2208'>      lost in the ferociousness of manners. The sea was not less</a>
<a id='line_2209'>      hostile than the land; and while the frontiers were assaulted by</a>
<a id='line_2210'>      an open enemy, the palace was distracted with secret treason and</a>
<a id='line_2211'>      conspiracy. On a sudden, the banner of the Cross was displayed by</a>
<a id='line_2212'>      the Latins; Europe was precipitated on Asia; and Constantinople</a>
<a id='line_2213'>      had almost been swept away by this impetuous deluge. In the</a>
<a id='line_2214'>      tempest, Alexius steered the Imperial vessel with dexterity and</a>
<a id='line_2215'>      courage. At the head of his armies, he was bold in action,</a>
<a id='line_2216'>      skilful in stratagem, patient of fatigue, ready to improve his</a>
<a id='line_2217'>      advantages, and rising from his defeats with inexhaustible vigor.</a>
<a id='line_2218'>      The discipline of the camp was revived, and a new generation of</a>
<a id='line_2219'>      men and soldiers was created by the example and precepts of their</a>
<a id='line_2220'>      leader. In his intercourse with the Latins, Alexius was patient</a>
<a id='line_2221'>      and artful: his discerning eye pervaded the new system of an</a>
<a id='line_2222'>      unknown world and I shall hereafter describe the superior policy</a>
<a id='line_2223'>      with which he balanced the interests and passions of the</a>
<a id='line_2224'>      champions of the first crusade. In a long reign of thirty-seven</a>
<a id='line_2225'>      years, he subdued and pardoned the envy of his equals: the laws</a>
<a id='line_2226'>      of public and private order were restored: the arts of wealth and</a>
<a id='line_2227'>      science were cultivated: the limits of the empire were enlarged</a>
<a id='line_2228'>      in Europe and Asia; and the Comnenian sceptre was transmitted to</a>
<a id='line_2229'>      his children of the third and fourth generation. Yet the</a>
<a id='line_2230'>      difficulties of the times betrayed some defects in his character;</a>
<a id='line_2231'>      and have exposed his memory to some just or ungenerous reproach.</a>
<a id='line_2232'>      The reader may possibly smile at the lavish praise which his</a>
<a id='line_2233'>      daughter so often bestows on a flying hero: the weakness or</a>
<a id='line_2234'>      prudence of his situation might be mistaken for a want of</a>
<a id='line_2235'>      personal courage; and his political arts are branded by the</a>
<a id='line_2236'>      Latins with the names of deceit and dissimulation. The increase</a>
<a id='line_2237'>      of the male and female branches of his family adorned the throne,</a>
<a id='line_2238'>      and secured the succession; but their princely luxury and pride</a>
<a id='line_2239'>      offended the patricians, exhausted the revenue, and insulted the</a>
<a id='line_2240'>      misery of the people. Anna is a faithful witness that his</a>
<a id='line_2241'>      happiness was destroyed, and his health was broken, by the cares</a>
<a id='line_2242'>      of a public life; the patience of Constantinople was fatigued by</a>
<a id='line_2243'>      the length and severity of his reign; and before Alexius expired,</a>
<a id='line_2244'>      he had lost the love and reverence of his subjects. The clergy</a>
<a id='line_2245'>      could not forgive his application of the sacred riches to the</a>
<a id='line_2246'>      defence of the state; but they applauded his theological learning</a>
<a id='line_2247'>      and ardent zeal for the orthodox faith, which he defended with</a>
<a id='line_2248'>      his tongue, his pen, and his sword. His character was degraded by</a>
<a id='line_2249'>      the superstition of the Greeks; and the same inconsistent</a>
<a id='line_2250'>      principle of human nature enjoined the emperor to found a</a>
<a id='line_2251'>      hospital for the poor and infirm, and to direct the execution of</a>
<a id='line_2252'>      a heretic, who was burned alive in the square of St. Sophia. Even</a>
<a id='line_2253'>      the sincerity of his moral and religious virtues was suspected by</a>
<a id='line_2254'>      the persons who had passed their lives in his familiar</a>
<a id='line_2255'>      confidence. In his last hours, when he was pressed by his wife</a>
<a id='line_2256'>      Irene to alter the succession, he raised his head, and breathed a</a>
<a id='line_2257'>      pious ejaculation on the vanity of this world. The indignant</a>
<a id='line_2258'>      reply of the empress may be inscribed as an epitaph on his tomb,</a>
<a id='line_2259'>      “You die, as you have lived—A Hypocrite!”</a>
<a id='line_2260'></a>
<a id='line_2261'>      It was the wish of Irene to supplant the eldest of her surviving</a>
<a id='line_2262'>      sons, in favor of her daughter the princess Anne whose philosophy</a>
<a id='line_2263'>      would not have refused the weight of a diadem. But the order of</a>
<a id='line_2264'>      male succession was asserted by the friends of their country; the</a>
<a id='line_2265'>      lawful heir drew the royal signet from the finger of his</a>
<a id='line_2266'>      insensible or conscious father and the empire obeyed the master</a>
<a id='line_2267'>      of the palace. Anna Comnena was stimulated by ambition and</a>
<a id='line_2268'>      revenge to conspire against the life of her brother, and when the</a>
<a id='line_2269'>      design was prevented by the fears or scruples of her husband, she</a>
<a id='line_2270'>      passionately exclaimed that nature had mistaken the two sexes,</a>
<a id='line_2271'>      and had endowed Bryennius with the soul of a woman. The two sons</a>
<a id='line_2272'>      of Alexius, John and Isaac, maintained the fraternal concord, the</a>
<a id='line_2273'>      hereditary virtue of their race, and the younger brother was</a>
<a id='line_2274'>      content with the title of Sebastocrator, which approached the</a>
<a id='line_2275'>      dignity, without sharing the power, of the emperor. In the same</a>
<a id='line_2276'>      person the claims of primogeniture and merit were fortunately</a>
<a id='line_2277'>      united; his swarthy complexion, harsh features, and diminutive</a>
<a id='line_2278'>      stature, had suggested the ironical surname of Calo-Johannes, or</a>
<a id='line_2279'>      John the Handsome, which his grateful subjects more seriously</a>
<a id='line_2280'>      applied to the beauties of his mind. After the discovery of her</a>
<a id='line_2281'>      treason, the life and fortune of Anne were justly forfeited to</a>
<a id='line_2282'>      the laws. Her life was spared by the clemency of the emperor; but</a>
<a id='line_2283'>      he visited the pomp and treasures of her palace, and bestowed the</a>
<a id='line_2284'>      rich confiscation on the most deserving of his friends. That</a>
<a id='line_2285'>      respectable friend Axuch, a slave of Turkish extraction, presumed</a>
<a id='line_2286'>      to decline the gift, and to intercede for the criminal: his</a>
<a id='line_2287'>      generous master applauded and imitated the virtue of his</a>
<a id='line_2288'>      favorite, and the reproach or complaint of an injured brother was</a>
<a id='line_2289'>      the only chastisement of the guilty princess. After this example</a>
<a id='line_2290'>      of clemency, the remainder of his reign was never disturbed by</a>
<a id='line_2291'>      conspiracy or rebellion: feared by his nobles, beloved by his</a>
<a id='line_2292'>      people, John was never reduced to the painful necessity of</a>
<a id='line_2293'>      punishing, or even of pardoning, his personal enemies. During his</a>
<a id='line_2294'>      government of twenty-five years, the penalty of death was</a>
<a id='line_2295'>      abolished in the Roman empire, a law of mercy most delightful to</a>
<a id='line_2296'>      the humane theorist, but of which the practice, in a large and</a>
<a id='line_2297'>      vicious community, is seldom consistent with the public safety.</a>
<a id='line_2298'>      Severe to himself, indulgent to others, chaste, frugal,</a>
<a id='line_2299'>      abstemious, the philosophic Marcus would not have disdained the</a>
<a id='line_2300'>      artless virtues of his successor, derived from his heart, and not</a>
<a id='line_2301'>      borrowed from the schools. He despised and moderated the stately</a>
<a id='line_2302'>      magnificence of the Byzantine court, so oppressive to the people,</a>
<a id='line_2303'>      so contemptible to the eye of reason. Under such a prince,</a>
<a id='line_2304'>      innocence had nothing to fear, and merit had every thing to hope;</a>
<a id='line_2305'>      and, without assuming the tyrannic office of a censor, he</a>
<a id='line_2306'>      introduced a gradual though visible reformation in the public and</a>
<a id='line_2307'>      private manners of Constantinople. The only defect of this</a>
<a id='line_2308'>      accomplished character was the frailty of noble minds, the love</a>
<a id='line_2309'>      of arms and military glory. Yet the frequent expeditions of John</a>
<a id='line_2310'>      the Handsome may be justified, at least in their principle, by</a>
<a id='line_2311'>      the necessity of repelling the Turks from the Hellespont and the</a>
<a id='line_2312'>      Bosphorus. The sultan of Iconium was confined to his capital, the</a>
<a id='line_2313'>      Barbarians were driven to the mountains, and the maritime</a>
<a id='line_2314'>      provinces of Asia enjoyed the transient blessings of their</a>
<a id='line_2315'>      deliverance. From Constantinople to Antioch and Aleppo, he</a>
<a id='line_2316'>      repeatedly marched at the head of a victorious army, and in the</a>
<a id='line_2317'>      sieges and battles of this holy war, his Latin allies were</a>
<a id='line_2318'>      astonished by the superior spirit and prowess of a Greek. As he</a>
<a id='line_2319'>      began to indulge the ambitious hope of restoring the ancient</a>
<a id='line_2320'>      limits of the empire, as he revolved in his mind, the Euphrates</a>
<a id='line_2321'>      and Tigris, the dominion of Syria, and the conquest of Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_2322'>      the thread of his life and of the public felicity was broken by a</a>
<a id='line_2323'>      singular accident. He hunted the wild boar in the valley of</a>
<a id='line_2324'>      Anazarbus, and had fixed his javelin in the body of the furious</a>
<a id='line_2325'>      animal; but in the struggle a poisoned arrow dropped from his</a>
<a id='line_2326'>      quiver, and a slight wound in his hand, which produced a</a>
<a id='line_2327'>      mortification, was fatal to the best and greatest of the</a>
<a id='line_2328'>      Comnenian princes.</a>

<a id='line_2334'>      Emperors.—Part V.</a>
<a id='line_2335'></a>
<a id='line_2336'>      A premature death had swept away the two eldest sons of John the</a>
<a id='line_2337'>      Handsome; of the two survivors, Isaac and Manuel, his judgment or</a>
<a id='line_2338'>      affection preferred the younger; and the choice of their dying</a>
<a id='line_2339'>      prince was ratified by the soldiers, who had applauded the valor</a>
<a id='line_2340'>      of his favorite in the Turkish war. The faithful Axuch hastened</a>
<a id='line_2341'>      to the capital, secured the person of Isaac in honorable</a>
<a id='line_2342'>      confinement, and purchased, with a gift of two hundred pounds of</a>
<a id='line_2343'>      silver, the leading ecclesiastics of St. Sophia, who possessed a</a>
<a id='line_2344'>      decisive voice in the consecration of an emperor. With his</a>
<a id='line_2345'>      veteran and affectionate troops, Manuel soon visited</a>
<a id='line_2346'>      Constantinople; his brother acquiesced in the title of</a>
<a id='line_2347'>      Sebastocrator; his subjects admired the lofty stature and martial</a>
<a id='line_2348'>      graces of their new sovereign, and listened with credulity to the</a>
<a id='line_2349'>      flattering promise, that he blended the wisdom of age with the</a>
<a id='line_2350'>      activity and vigor of youth. By the experience of his government,</a>
<a id='line_2351'>      they were taught, that he emulated the spirit, and shared the</a>
<a id='line_2352'>      talents, of his father whose social virtues were buried in the</a>
<a id='line_2353'>      grave. A reign of thirty seven years is filled by a perpetual</a>
<a id='line_2354'>      though various warfare against the Turks, the Christians, and the</a>
<a id='line_2355'>      hordes of the wilderness beyond the Danube. The arms of Manuel</a>
<a id='line_2356'>      were exercised on Mount Taurus, in the plains of Hungary, on the</a>
<a id='line_2357'>      coast of Italy and Egypt, and on the seas of Sicily and Greece:</a>
<a id='line_2358'>      the influence of his negotiations extended from Jerusalem to Rome</a>
<a id='line_2359'>      and Russia; and the Byzantine monarchy, for a while, became an</a>
<a id='line_2360'>      object of respect or terror to the powers of Asia and Europe.</a>
<a id='line_2361'>      Educated in the silk and purple of the East, Manuel possessed the</a>
<a id='line_2362'>      iron temper of a soldier, which cannot easily be paralleled,</a>
<a id='line_2363'>      except in the lives of Richard the First of England, and of</a>
<a id='line_2364'>      Charles the Twelfth of Sweden. Such was his strength and exercise</a>
<a id='line_2365'>      in arms, that Raymond, surnamed the Hercules of Antioch, was</a>
<a id='line_2366'>      incapable of wielding the lance and buckler of the Greek emperor.</a>
<a id='line_2367'>      In a famous tournament, he entered the lists on a fiery courser,</a>
<a id='line_2368'>      and overturned in his first career two of the stoutest of the</a>
<a id='line_2369'>      Italian knights. The first in the charge, the last in the</a>
<a id='line_2370'>      retreat, his friends and his enemies alike trembled, the former</a>
<a id='line_2371'>      for his safety, and the latter for their own. After posting an</a>
<a id='line_2372'>      ambuscade in a wood, he rode forwards in search of some perilous</a>
<a id='line_2373'>      adventure, accompanied only by his brother and the faithful</a>
<a id='line_2374'>      Axuch, who refused to desert their sovereign. Eighteen horsemen,</a>
<a id='line_2375'>      after a short combat, fled before them: but the numbers of the</a>
<a id='line_2376'>      enemy increased; the march of the reenforcement was tardy and</a>
<a id='line_2377'>      fearful, and Manuel, without receiving a wound, cut his way</a>
<a id='line_2378'>      through a squadron of five hundred Turks. In a battle against the</a>
<a id='line_2379'>      Hungarians, impatient of the slowness of his troops, he snatched</a>
<a id='line_2380'>      a standard from the head of the column, and was the first, almost</a>
<a id='line_2381'>      alone, who passed a bridge that separated him from the enemy. In</a>
<a id='line_2382'>      the same country, after transporting his army beyond the Save, he</a>
<a id='line_2383'>      sent back the boats, with an order under pain of death, to their</a>
<a id='line_2384'>      commander, that he should leave him to conquer or die on that</a>
<a id='line_2385'>      hostile land. In the siege of Corfu, towing after him a captive</a>
<a id='line_2386'>      galley, the emperor stood aloft on the poop, opposing against the</a>
<a id='line_2387'>      volleys of darts and stones, a large buckler and a flowing sail;</a>
<a id='line_2388'>      nor could he have escaped inevitable death, had not the Sicilian</a>
<a id='line_2389'>      admiral enjoined his archers to respect the person of a hero. In</a>
<a id='line_2390'>      one day, he is said to have slain above forty of the Barbarians</a>
<a id='line_2391'>      with his own hand; he returned to the camp, dragging along four</a>
<a id='line_2392'>      Turkish prisoners, whom he had tied to the rings of his saddle:</a>
<a id='line_2393'>      he was ever the foremost to provoke or to accept a single combat;</a>
<a id='line_2394'>      and the gigantic champions, who encountered his arm, were</a>
<a id='line_2395'>      transpierced by the lance, or cut asunder by the sword, of the</a>
<a id='line_2396'>      invincible Manuel. The story of his exploits, which appear as a</a>
<a id='line_2397'>      model or a copy of the romances of chivalry, may induce a</a>
<a id='line_2398'>      reasonable suspicion of the veracity of the Greeks: I will not,</a>
<a id='line_2399'>      to vindicate their credit, endanger my own: yet I may observe,</a>
<a id='line_2400'>      that, in the long series of their annals, Manuel is the only</a>
<a id='line_2401'>      prince who has been the subject of similar exaggeration. With the</a>
<a id='line_2402'>      valor of a soldier, he did not unite the skill or prudence of a</a>
<a id='line_2403'>      general; his victories were not productive of any permanent or</a>
<a id='line_2404'>      useful conquest; and his Turkish laurels were blasted in his last</a>
<a id='line_2405'>      unfortunate campaign, in which he lost his army in the mountains</a>
<a id='line_2406'>      of Pisidia, and owed his deliverance to the generosity of the</a>
<a id='line_2407'>      sultan. But the most singular feature in the character of Manuel,</a>
<a id='line_2408'>      is the contrast and vicissitude of labor and sloth, of hardiness</a>
<a id='line_2409'>      and effeminacy. In war he seemed ignorant of peace, in peace he</a>
<a id='line_2410'>      appeared incapable of war. In the field he slept in the sun or in</a>
<a id='line_2411'>      the snow, tired in the longest marches the strength of his men</a>
<a id='line_2412'>      and horses, and shared with a smile the abstinence or diet of the</a>
<a id='line_2413'>      camp. No sooner did he return to Constantinople, than he resigned</a>
<a id='line_2414'>      himself to the arts and pleasures of a life of luxury: the</a>
<a id='line_2415'>      expense of his dress, his table, and his palace, surpassed the</a>
<a id='line_2416'>      measure of his predecessors, and whole summer days were idly</a>
<a id='line_2417'>      wasted in the delicious isles of the Propontis, in the incestuous</a>
<a id='line_2418'>      love of his niece Theodora. The double cost of a warlike and</a>
<a id='line_2419'>      dissolute prince exhausted the revenue, and multiplied the taxes;</a>
<a id='line_2420'>      and Manuel, in the distress of his last Turkish campaign, endured</a>
<a id='line_2421'>      a bitter reproach from the mouth of a desperate soldier. As he</a>
<a id='line_2422'>      quenched his thirst, he complained that the water of a fountain</a>
<a id='line_2423'>      was mingled with Christian blood. “It is not the first time,”</a>
<a id='line_2424'>      exclaimed a voice from the crowd, “that you have drank, O</a>
<a id='line_2425'>      emperor, the blood of your Christian subjects.” Manuel Comnenus</a>
<a id='line_2426'>      was twice married, to the virtuous Bertha or Irene of Germany,</a>
<a id='line_2427'>      and to the beauteous Maria, a French or Latin princess of</a>
<a id='line_2428'>      Antioch. The only daughter of his first wife was destined for</a>
<a id='line_2429'>      Bela, a Hungarian prince, who was educated at Constantinople</a>
<a id='line_2430'>      under the name of Alexius; and the consummation of their nuptials</a>
<a id='line_2431'>      might have transferred the Roman sceptre to a race of free and</a>
<a id='line_2432'>      warlike Barbarians. But as soon as Maria of Antioch had given a</a>
<a id='line_2433'>      son and heir to the empire, the presumptive rights of Bela were</a>
<a id='line_2434'>      abolished, and he was deprived of his promised bride; but the</a>
<a id='line_2435'>      Hungarian prince resumed his name and the kingdom of his fathers,</a>
<a id='line_2436'>      and displayed such virtues as might excite the regret and envy of</a>
<a id='line_2437'>      the Greeks. The son of Maria was named Alexius; and at the age of</a>
<a id='line_2438'>      ten years he ascended the Byzantine throne, after his father’s</a>
<a id='line_2439'>      decease had closed the glories of the Comnenian line.</a>
<a id='line_2440'></a>
<a id='line_2441'>      The fraternal concord of the two sons of the great Alexius had</a>
<a id='line_2442'>      been sometimes clouded by an opposition of interest and passion.</a>
<a id='line_2443'>      By ambition, Isaac the Sebastocrator was excited to flight and</a>
<a id='line_2444'>      rebellion, from whence he was reclaimed by the firmness and</a>
<a id='line_2445'>      clemency of John the Handsome. The errors of Isaac, the father of</a>
<a id='line_2446'>      the emperors of Trebizond, were short and venial; but John, the</a>
<a id='line_2447'>      elder of his sons, renounced forever his religion. Provoked by a</a>
<a id='line_2448'>      real or imaginary insult of his uncle, he escaped from the Roman</a>
<a id='line_2449'>      to the Turkish camp: his apostasy was rewarded with the sultan’s</a>
<a id='line_2450'>      daughter, the title of Chelebi, or noble, and the inheritance of</a>
<a id='line_2451'>      a princely estate; and in the fifteenth century, Mahomet the</a>
<a id='line_2452'>      Second boasted of his Imperial descent from the Comnenian family.</a>
<a id='line_2453'>      Andronicus, the younger brother of John, son of Isaac, and</a>
<a id='line_2454'>      grandson of Alexius Comnenus, is one of the most conspicuous</a>
<a id='line_2455'>      characters of the age; and his genuine adventures might form the</a>
<a id='line_2456'>      subject of a very singular romance. To justify the choice of</a>
<a id='line_2457'>      three ladies of royal birth, it is incumbent on me to observe,</a>
<a id='line_2458'>      that their fortunate lover was cast in the best proportions of</a>
<a id='line_2459'>      strength and beauty; and that the want of the softer graces was</a>
<a id='line_2460'>      supplied by a manly countenance, a lofty stature, athletic</a>
<a id='line_2461'>      muscles, and the air and deportment of a soldier. The</a>
<a id='line_2462'>      preservation, in his old age, of health and vigor, was the reward</a>
<a id='line_2463'>      of temperance and exercise. A piece of bread and a draught of</a>
<a id='line_2464'>      water was often his sole and evening repast; and if he tasted of</a>
<a id='line_2465'>      a wild boar or a stag, which he had roasted with his own hands,</a>
<a id='line_2466'>      it was the well-earned fruit of a laborious chase. Dexterous in</a>
<a id='line_2467'>      arms, he was ignorant of fear; his persuasive eloquence could</a>
<a id='line_2468'>      bend to every situation and character of life, his style, though</a>
<a id='line_2469'>      not his practice, was fashioned by the example of St. Paul; and,</a>
<a id='line_2470'>      in every deed of mischief, he had a heart to resolve, a head to</a>
<a id='line_2471'>      contrive, and a hand to execute. In his youth, after the death of</a>
<a id='line_2472'>      the emperor John, he followed the retreat of the Roman army; but,</a>
<a id='line_2473'>      in the march through Asia Minor, design or accident tempted him</a>
<a id='line_2474'>      to wander in the mountains: the hunter was encompassed by the</a>
<a id='line_2475'>      Turkish huntsmen, and he remained some time a reluctant or</a>
<a id='line_2476'>      willing captive in the power of the sultan. His virtues and vices</a>
<a id='line_2477'>      recommended him to the favor of his cousin: he shared the perils</a>
<a id='line_2478'>      and the pleasures of Manuel; and while the emperor lived in</a>
<a id='line_2479'>      public incest with his niece Theodora, the affections of her</a>
<a id='line_2480'>      sister Eudocia were seduced and enjoyed by Andronicus. Above the</a>
<a id='line_2481'>      decencies of her sex and rank, she gloried in the name of his</a>
<a id='line_2482'>      concubine; and both the palace and the camp could witness that</a>
<a id='line_2483'>      she slept, or watched, in the arms of her lover. She accompanied</a>
<a id='line_2484'>      him to his military command of Cilicia, the first scene of his</a>
<a id='line_2485'>      valor and imprudence. He pressed, with active ardor, the siege of</a>
<a id='line_2486'>      Mopsuestia: the day was employed in the boldest attacks; but the</a>
<a id='line_2487'>      night was wasted in song and dance; and a band of Greek comedians</a>
<a id='line_2488'>      formed the choicest part of his retinue. Andronicus was surprised</a>
<a id='line_2489'>      by the sally of a vigilant foe; but, while his troops fled in</a>
<a id='line_2490'>      disorder, his invincible lance transpierced the thickest ranks of</a>
<a id='line_2491'>      the Armenians. On his return to the Imperial camp in Macedonia,</a>
<a id='line_2492'>      he was received by Manuel with public smiles and a private</a>
<a id='line_2493'>      reproof; but the duchies of Naissus, Braniseba, and Castoria,</a>
<a id='line_2494'>      were the reward or consolation of the unsuccessful general.</a>
<a id='line_2495'>      Eudocia still attended his motions: at midnight, their tent was</a>
<a id='line_2496'>      suddenly attacked by her angry brothers, impatient to expiate her</a>
<a id='line_2497'>      infamy in his blood: his daring spirit refused her advice, and</a>
<a id='line_2498'>      the disguise of a female habit; and, boldly starting from his</a>
<a id='line_2499'>      couch, he drew his sword, and cut his way through the numerous</a>
<a id='line_2500'>      assassins. It was here that he first betrayed his ingratitude and</a>
<a id='line_2501'>      treachery: he engaged in a treasonable correspondence with the</a>
<a id='line_2502'>      king of Hungary and the German emperor; approached the royal tent</a>
<a id='line_2503'>      at a suspicious hour with a drawn sword, and under the mask of a</a>
<a id='line_2504'>      Latin soldier, avowed an intention of revenge against a mortal</a>
<a id='line_2505'>      foe; and imprudently praised the fleetness of his horse as an</a>
<a id='line_2506'>      instrument of flight and safety. The monarch dissembled his</a>
<a id='line_2507'>      suspicions; but, after the close of the campaign, Andronicus was</a>
<a id='line_2508'>      arrested and strictly confined in a tower of the palace of</a>
<a id='line_2509'>      Constantinople.</a>
<a id='line_2510'></a>
<a id='line_2511'>      In this prison he was left about twelve years; a most painful</a>
<a id='line_2512'>      restraint, from which the thirst of action and pleasure</a>
<a id='line_2513'>      perpetually urged him to escape. Alone and pensive, he perceived</a>
<a id='line_2514'>      some broken bricks in a corner of the chamber, and gradually</a>
<a id='line_2515'>      widened the passage, till he had explored a dark and forgotten</a>
<a id='line_2516'>      recess. Into this hole he conveyed himself, and the remains of</a>
<a id='line_2517'>      his provisions, replacing the bricks in their former position,</a>
<a id='line_2518'>      and erasing with care the footsteps of his retreat. At the hour</a>
<a id='line_2519'>      of the customary visit, his guards were amazed by the silence and</a>
<a id='line_2520'>      solitude of the prison, and reported, with shame and fear, his</a>
<a id='line_2521'>      incomprehensible flight. The gates of the palace and city were</a>
<a id='line_2522'>      instantly shut: the strictest orders were despatched into the</a>
<a id='line_2523'>      provinces, for the recovery of the fugitive; and his wife, on the</a>
<a id='line_2524'>      suspicion of a pious act, was basely imprisoned in the same</a>
<a id='line_2525'>      tower. At the dead of night she beheld a spectre; she recognized</a>
<a id='line_2526'>      her husband: they shared their provisions; and a son was the</a>
<a id='line_2527'>      fruit of these stolen interviews, which alleviated the</a>
<a id='line_2528'>      tediousness of their confinement. In the custody of a woman, the</a>
<a id='line_2529'>      vigilance of the keepers was insensibly relaxed; and the captive</a>
<a id='line_2530'>      had accomplished his real escape, when he was discovered, brought</a>
<a id='line_2531'>      back to Constantinople, and loaded with a double chain. At length</a>
<a id='line_2532'>      he found the moment, and the means, of his deliverance. A boy,</a>
<a id='line_2533'>      his domestic servant, intoxicated the guards, and obtained in wax</a>
<a id='line_2534'>      the impression of the keys. By the diligence of his friends, a</a>
<a id='line_2535'>      similar key, with a bundle of ropes, was introduced into the</a>
<a id='line_2536'>      prison, in the bottom of a hogshead. Andronicus employed, with</a>
<a id='line_2537'>      industry and courage, the instruments of his safety, unlocked the</a>
<a id='line_2538'>      doors, descended from the tower, concealed himself all day among</a>
<a id='line_2539'>      the bushes, and scaled in the night the garden-wall of the</a>
<a id='line_2540'>      palace. A boat was stationed for his reception: he visited his</a>
<a id='line_2541'>      own house, embraced his children, cast away his chain, mounted a</a>
<a id='line_2542'>      fleet horse, and directed his rapid course towards the banks of</a>
<a id='line_2543'>      the Danube. At Anchialus in Thrace, an intrepid friend supplied</a>
<a id='line_2544'>      him with horses and money: he passed the river, traversed with</a>
<a id='line_2545'>      speed the desert of Moldavia and the Carpathian hills, and had</a>
<a id='line_2546'>      almost reached the town of Halicz, in the Polish Russia, when he</a>
<a id='line_2547'>      was intercepted by a party of Walachians, who resolved to convey</a>
<a id='line_2548'>      their important captive to Constantinople. His presence of mind</a>
<a id='line_2549'>      again extricated him from danger. Under the pretence of sickness,</a>
<a id='line_2550'>      he dismounted in the night, and was allowed to step aside from</a>
<a id='line_2551'>      the troop: he planted in the ground his long staff, clothed it</a>
<a id='line_2552'>      with his cap and upper garment; and, stealing into the wood, left</a>
<a id='line_2553'>      a phantom to amuse, for some time, the eyes of the Walachians.</a>
<a id='line_2554'>      From Halicz he was honorably conducted to Kiow, the residence of</a>
<a id='line_2555'>      the great duke: the subtle Greek soon obtained the esteem and</a>
<a id='line_2556'>      confidence of Ieroslaus; his character could assume the manners</a>
<a id='line_2557'>      of every climate; and the Barbarians applauded his strength and</a>
<a id='line_2558'>      courage in the chase of the elks and bears of the forest. In this</a>
<a id='line_2559'>      northern region he deserved the forgiveness of Manuel, who</a>
<a id='line_2560'>      solicited the Russian prince to join his arms in the invasion of</a>
<a id='line_2561'>      Hungary. The influence of Andronicus achieved this important</a>
<a id='line_2562'>      service: his private treaty was signed with a promise of fidelity</a>
<a id='line_2563'>      on one side, and of oblivion on the other; and he marched, at the</a>
<a id='line_2564'>      head of the Russian cavalry, from the Borysthenes to the Danube.</a>
<a id='line_2565'>      In his resentment Manuel had ever sympathized with the martial</a>
<a id='line_2566'>      and dissolute character of his cousin; and his free pardon was</a>
<a id='line_2567'>      sealed in the assault of Zemlin, in which he was second, and</a>
<a id='line_2568'>      second only, to the valor of the emperor.</a>
<a id='line_2569'></a>
<a id='line_2570'>      No sooner was the exile restored to freedom and his country, than</a>
<a id='line_2571'>      his ambition revived, at first to his own, and at length to the</a>
<a id='line_2572'>      public, misfortune. A daughter of Manuel was a feeble bar to the</a>
<a id='line_2573'>      succession of the more deserving males of the Comnenian blood;</a>
<a id='line_2574'>      her future marriage with the prince of Hungary was repugnant to</a>
<a id='line_2575'>      the hopes or prejudices of the princes and nobles. But when an</a>
<a id='line_2576'>      oath of allegiance was required to the presumptive heir,</a>
<a id='line_2577'>      Andronicus alone asserted the honor of the Roman name, declined</a>
<a id='line_2578'>      the unlawful engagement, and boldly protested against the</a>
<a id='line_2579'>      adoption of a stranger. His patriotism was offensive to the</a>
<a id='line_2580'>      emperor, but he spoke the sentiments of the people, and was</a>
<a id='line_2581'>      removed from the royal presence by an honorable banishment, a</a>
<a id='line_2582'>      second command of the Cilician frontier, with the absolute</a>
<a id='line_2583'>      disposal of the revenues of Cyprus. In this station the Armenians</a>
<a id='line_2584'>      again exercised his courage and exposed his negligence; and the</a>
<a id='line_2585'>      same rebel, who baffled all his operations, was unhorsed, and</a>
<a id='line_2586'>      almost slain by the vigor of his lance. But Andronicus soon</a>
<a id='line_2587'>      discovered a more easy and pleasing conquest, the beautiful</a>
<a id='line_2588'>      Philippa, sister of the empress Maria, and daughter of Raymond of</a>
<a id='line_2589'>      Poitou, the Latin prince of Antioch. For her sake he deserted his</a>
<a id='line_2590'>      station, and wasted the summer in balls and tournaments: to his</a>
<a id='line_2591'>      love she sacrificed her innocence, her reputation, and the offer</a>
<a id='line_2592'>      of an advantageous marriage. But the resentment of Manuel for</a>
<a id='line_2593'>      this domestic affront interrupted his pleasures: Andronicus left</a>
<a id='line_2594'>      the indiscreet princess to weep and to repent; and, with a band</a>
<a id='line_2595'>      of desperate adventurers, undertook the pilgrimage of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_2596'>      His birth, his martial renown, and professions of zeal, announced</a>
<a id='line_2597'>      him as the champion of the Cross: he soon captivated both the</a>
<a id='line_2598'>      clergy and the king; and the Greek prince was invested with the</a>
<a id='line_2599'>      lordship of Berytus, on the coast of Phoenicia.</a>
<a id='line_2600'></a>
<a id='line_2601'>      In his neighborhood resided a young and handsome queen, of his</a>
<a id='line_2602'>      own nation and family, great-granddaughter of the emperor Alexis,</a>
<a id='line_2603'>      and widow of Baldwin the Third, king of Jerusalem. She visited</a>
<a id='line_2604'>      and loved her kinsman. Theodora was the third victim of his</a>
<a id='line_2605'>      amorous seduction; and her shame was more public and scandalous</a>
<a id='line_2606'>      than that of her predecessors. The emperor still thirsted for</a>
<a id='line_2607'>      revenge; and his subjects and allies of the Syrian frontier were</a>
<a id='line_2608'>      repeatedly pressed to seize the person, and put out the eyes, of</a>
<a id='line_2609'>      the fugitive. In Palestine he was no longer safe; but the tender</a>
<a id='line_2610'>      Theodora revealed his danger, and accompanied his flight. The</a>
<a id='line_2611'>      queen of Jerusalem was exposed to the East, his obsequious</a>
<a id='line_2612'>      concubine; and two illegitimate children were the living</a>
<a id='line_2613'>      monuments of her weakness. Damascus was his first refuge; and, in</a>
<a id='line_2614'>      the characters of the great Noureddin and his servant Saladin,</a>
<a id='line_2615'>      the superstitious Greek might learn to revere the virtues of the</a>
<a id='line_2616'>      Mussulmans. As the friend of Noureddin he visited, most probably,</a>
<a id='line_2617'>      Bagdad, and the courts of Persia; and, after a long circuit round</a>
<a id='line_2618'>      the Caspian Sea and the mountains of Georgia, he finally settled</a>
<a id='line_2619'>      among the Turks of Asia Minor, the hereditary enemies of his</a>
<a id='line_2620'>      country. The sultan of Colonia afforded a hospitable retreat to</a>
<a id='line_2621'>      Andronicus, his mistress, and his band of outlaws: the debt of</a>
<a id='line_2622'>      gratitude was paid by frequent inroads in the Roman province of</a>
<a id='line_2623'>      Trebizond; and he seldom returned without an ample harvest of</a>
<a id='line_2624'>      spoil and of Christian captives. In the story of his adventures,</a>
<a id='line_2625'>      he was fond of comparing himself to David, who escaped, by a long</a>
<a id='line_2626'>      exile, the snares of the wicked. But the royal prophet (he</a>
<a id='line_2627'>      presumed to add) was content to lurk on the borders of Judaea, to</a>
<a id='line_2628'>      slay an Amalekite, and to threaten, in his miserable state, the</a>
<a id='line_2629'>      life of the avaricious Nabal. The excursions of the Comnenian</a>
<a id='line_2630'>      prince had a wider range; and he had spread over the Eastern</a>
<a id='line_2631'>      world the glory of his name and religion.</a>
<a id='line_2632'></a>
<a id='line_2633'>      By a sentence of the Greek church, the licentious rover had been</a>
<a id='line_2634'>      separated from the faithful; but even this excommunication may</a>
<a id='line_2635'>      prove, that he never abjured the profession of Chistianity.</a>
<a id='line_2636'></a>
<a id='line_2637'>      His vigilance had eluded or repelled the open and secret</a>
<a id='line_2638'>      persecution of the emperor; but he was at length insnared by the</a>
<a id='line_2639'>      captivity of his female companion. The governor of Trebizond</a>
<a id='line_2640'>      succeeded in his attempt to surprise the person of Theodora: the</a>
<a id='line_2641'>      queen of Jerusalem and her two children were sent to</a>
<a id='line_2642'>      Constantinople, and their loss imbittered the tedious solitude of</a>
<a id='line_2643'>      banishment. The fugitive implored and obtained a final pardon,</a>
<a id='line_2644'>      with leave to throw himself at the feet of his sovereign, who was</a>
<a id='line_2645'>      satisfied with the submission of this haughty spirit. Prostrate</a>
<a id='line_2646'>      on the ground, he deplored with tears and groans the guilt of his</a>
<a id='line_2647'>      past rebellion; nor would he presume to arise, unless some</a>
<a id='line_2648'>      faithful subject would drag him to the foot of the throne, by an</a>
<a id='line_2649'>      iron chain with which he had secretly encircled his neck. This</a>
<a id='line_2650'>      extraordinary penance excited the wonder and pity of the</a>
<a id='line_2651'>      assembly; his sins were forgiven by the church and state; but the</a>
<a id='line_2652'>      just suspicion of Manuel fixed his residence at a distance from</a>
<a id='line_2653'>      the court, at Oenoe, a town of Pontus, surrounded with rich</a>
<a id='line_2654'>      vineyards, and situate on the coast of the Euxine. The death of</a>
<a id='line_2655'>      Manuel, and the disorders of the minority, soon opened the</a>
<a id='line_2656'>      fairest field to his ambition. The emperor was a boy of twelve or</a>
<a id='line_2657'>      fourteen years of age, without vigor, or wisdom, or experience:</a>
<a id='line_2658'>      his mother, the empress Mary, abandoned her person and government</a>
<a id='line_2659'>      to a favorite of the Comnenian name; and his sister, another</a>
<a id='line_2660'>      Mary, whose husband, an Italian, was decorated with the title of</a>
<a id='line_2661'>      Caesar, excited a conspiracy, and at length an insurrection,</a>
<a id='line_2662'>      against her odious step-mother. The provinces were forgotten, the</a>
<a id='line_2663'>      capital was in flames, and a century of peace and order was</a>
<a id='line_2664'>      overthrown in the vice and weakness of a few months. A civil war</a>
<a id='line_2665'>      was kindled in Constantinople; the two factions fought a bloody</a>
<a id='line_2666'>      battle in the square of the palace, and the rebels sustained a</a>
<a id='line_2667'>      regular siege in the cathedral of St. Sophia. The patriarch</a>
<a id='line_2668'>      labored with honest zeal to heal the wounds of the republic, the</a>
<a id='line_2669'>      most respectable patriots called aloud for a guardian and</a>
<a id='line_2670'>      avenger, and every tongue repeated the praise of the talents and</a>
<a id='line_2671'>      even the virtues of Andronicus. In his retirement, he affected to</a>
<a id='line_2672'>      revolve the solemn duties of his oath: “If the safety or honor of</a>
<a id='line_2673'>      the Imperial family be threatened, I will reveal and oppose the</a>
<a id='line_2674'>      mischief to the utmost of my power.” His correspondence with the</a>
<a id='line_2675'>      patriarch and patricians was seasoned with apt quotations from</a>
<a id='line_2676'>      the Psalms of David and the epistles of St. Paul; and he</a>
<a id='line_2677'>      patiently waited till he was called to her deliverance by the</a>
<a id='line_2678'>      voice of his country. In his march from Oenoe to Constantinople,</a>
<a id='line_2679'>      his slender train insensibly swelled to a crowd and an army: his</a>
<a id='line_2680'>      professions of religion and loyalty were mistaken for the</a>
<a id='line_2681'>      language of his heart; and the simplicity of a foreign dress,</a>
<a id='line_2682'>      which showed to advantage his majestic stature, displayed a</a>
<a id='line_2683'>      lively image of his poverty and exile. All opposition sunk before</a>
<a id='line_2684'>      him; he reached the straits of the Thracian Bosphorus; the</a>
<a id='line_2685'>      Byzantine navy sailed from the harbor to receive and transport</a>
<a id='line_2686'>      the savior of the empire: the torrent was loud and irresistible,</a>
<a id='line_2687'>      and the insects who had basked in the sunshine of royal favor</a>
<a id='line_2688'>      disappeared at the blast of the storm. It was the first care of</a>
<a id='line_2689'>      Andronicus to occupy the palace, to salute the emperor, to</a>
<a id='line_2690'>      confine his mother, to punish her minister, and to restore the</a>
<a id='line_2691'>      public order and tranquillity. He then visited the sepulchre of</a>
<a id='line_2692'>      Manuel: the spectators were ordered to stand aloof, but as he</a>
<a id='line_2693'>      bowed in the attitude of prayer, they heard, or thought they</a>
<a id='line_2694'>      heard, a murmur of triumph or revenge: “I no longer fear thee, my</a>
<a id='line_2695'>      old enemy, who hast driven me a vagabond to every climate of the</a>
<a id='line_2696'>      earth. Thou art safely deposited under a seven-fold dome, from</a>
<a id='line_2697'>      whence thou canst never arise till the signal of the last</a>
<a id='line_2698'>      trumpet. It is now my turn, and speedily will I trample on thy</a>
<a id='line_2699'>      ashes and thy posterity.” From his subsequent tyranny we may</a>
<a id='line_2700'>      impute such feelings to the man and the moment; but it is not</a>
<a id='line_2701'>      extremely probable that he gave an articulate sound to his secret</a>
<a id='line_2702'>      thoughts. In the first months of his administration, his designs</a>
<a id='line_2703'>      were veiled by a fair semblance of hypocrisy, which could delude</a>
<a id='line_2704'>      only the eyes of the multitude; the coronation of Alexius was</a>
<a id='line_2705'>      performed with due solemnity, and his perfidious guardian,</a>
<a id='line_2706'>      holding in his hands the body and blood of Christ, most fervently</a>
<a id='line_2707'>      declared that he lived, and was ready to die, for the service of</a>
<a id='line_2708'>      his beloved pupil. But his numerous adherents were instructed to</a>
<a id='line_2709'>      maintain, that the sinking empire must perish in the hands of a</a>
<a id='line_2710'>      child, that the Romans could only be saved by a veteran prince,</a>
<a id='line_2711'>      bold in arms, skilful in policy, and taught to reign by the long</a>
<a id='line_2712'>      experience of fortune and mankind; and that it was the duty of</a>
<a id='line_2713'>      every citizen to force the reluctant modesty of Andronicus to</a>
<a id='line_2714'>      undertake the burden of the public care. The young emperor was</a>
<a id='line_2715'>      himself constrained to join his voice to the general acclamation,</a>
<a id='line_2716'>      and to solicit the association of a colleague, who instantly</a>
<a id='line_2717'>      degraded him from the supreme rank, secluded his person, and</a>
<a id='line_2718'>      verified the rash declaration of the patriarch, that Alexius</a>
<a id='line_2719'>      might be considered as dead, so soon as he was committed to the</a>
<a id='line_2720'>      custody of his guardian. But his death was preceded by the</a>
<a id='line_2721'>      imprisonment and execution of his mother. After blackening her</a>
<a id='line_2722'>      reputation, and inflaming against her the passions of the</a>
<a id='line_2723'>      multitude, the tyrant accused and tried the empress for a</a>
<a id='line_2724'>      treasonable correspondence with the king of Hungary. His own son,</a>
<a id='line_2725'>      a youth of honor and humanity, avowed his abhorrence of this</a>
<a id='line_2726'>      flagitious act, and three of the judges had the merit of</a>
<a id='line_2727'>      preferring their conscience to their safety: but the obsequious</a>
<a id='line_2728'>      tribunal, without requiring any reproof, or hearing any defence,</a>
<a id='line_2729'>      condemned the widow of Manuel; and her unfortunate son subscribed</a>
<a id='line_2730'>      the sentence of her death. Maria was strangled, her corpse was</a>
<a id='line_2731'>      buried in the sea, and her memory was wounded by the insult most</a>
<a id='line_2732'>      offensive to female vanity, a false and ugly representation of</a>
<a id='line_2733'>      her beauteous form. The fate of her son was not long deferred: he</a>
<a id='line_2734'>      was strangled with a bowstring; and the tyrant, insensible to</a>
<a id='line_2735'>      pity or remorse, after surveying the body of the innocent youth,</a>
<a id='line_2736'>      struck it rudely with his foot: “Thy father,” he cried, “was a</a>
<a id='line_2737'>      knave, thy mother a whore, and thyself a fool!”</a>
<a id='line_2738'></a>
<a id='line_2739'>      The Roman sceptre, the reward of his crimes, was held by</a>
<a id='line_2740'>      Andronicus about three years and a half as the guardian or</a>
<a id='line_2741'>      sovereign of the empire. His government exhibited a singular</a>
<a id='line_2742'>      contrast of vice and virtue. When he listened to his passions, he</a>
<a id='line_2743'>      was the scourge; when he consulted his reason, the father, of his</a>
<a id='line_2744'>      people. In the exercise of private justice, he was equitable and</a>
<a id='line_2745'>      rigorous: a shameful and pernicious venality was abolished, and</a>
<a id='line_2746'>      the offices were filled with the most deserving candidates, by a</a>
<a id='line_2747'>      prince who had sense to choose, and severity to punish. He</a>
<a id='line_2748'>      prohibited the inhuman practice of pillaging the goods and</a>
<a id='line_2749'>      persons of shipwrecked mariners; the provinces, so long the</a>
<a id='line_2750'>      objects of oppression or neglect, revived in prosperity and</a>
<a id='line_2751'>      plenty; and millions applauded the distant blessings of his</a>
<a id='line_2752'>      reign, while he was cursed by the witnesses of his daily</a>
<a id='line_2753'>      cruelties. The ancient proverb, That bloodthirsty is the man who</a>
<a id='line_2754'>      returns from banishment to power, had been applied, with too much</a>
<a id='line_2755'>      truth, to Marius and Tiberius; and was now verified for the third</a>
<a id='line_2756'>      time in the life of Andronicus. His memory was stored with a</a>
<a id='line_2757'>      black list of the enemies and rivals, who had traduced his merit,</a>
<a id='line_2758'>      opposed his greatness, or insulted his misfortunes; and the only</a>
<a id='line_2759'>      comfort of his exile was the sacred hope and promise of revenge.</a>
<a id='line_2760'>      The necessary extinction of the young emperor and his mother</a>
<a id='line_2761'>      imposed the fatal obligation of extirpating the friends, who</a>
<a id='line_2762'>      hated, and might punish, the assassin; and the repetition of</a>
<a id='line_2763'>      murder rendered him less willing, and less able, to forgive. 1018</a>
<a id='line_2764'>      A horrid narrative of the victims whom he sacrificed by poison or</a>
<a id='line_2765'>      the sword, by the sea or the flames, would be less expressive of</a>
<a id='line_2766'>      his cruelty than the appellation of the halcyon days, which was</a>
<a id='line_2767'>      applied to a rare and bloodless week of repose: the tyrant strove</a>
<a id='line_2768'>      to transfer, on the laws and the judges, some portion of his</a>
<a id='line_2769'>      guilt; but the mask was fallen, and his subjects could no longer</a>
<a id='line_2770'>      mistake the true author of their calamities. The noblest of the</a>
<a id='line_2771'>      Greeks, more especially those who, by descent or alliance, might</a>
<a id='line_2772'>      dispute the Comnenian inheritance, escaped from the monster’s</a>
<a id='line_2773'>      den: Nice and Prusa, Sicily or Cyprus, were their places of</a>
<a id='line_2774'>      refuge; and as their flight was already criminal, they aggravated</a>
<a id='line_2775'>      their offence by an open revolt, and the Imperial title. Yet</a>
<a id='line_2776'>      Andronicus resisted the daggers and swords of his most formidable</a>
<a id='line_2777'>      enemies: Nice and Prusa were reduced and chastised: the Sicilians</a>
<a id='line_2778'>      were content with the sack of Thessalonica; and the distance of</a>
<a id='line_2779'>      Cyprus was not more propitious to the rebel than to the tyrant.</a>
<a id='line_2780'>      His throne was subverted by a rival without merit, and a people</a>
<a id='line_2781'>      without arms. Isaac Angelus, a descendant in the female line from</a>
<a id='line_2782'>      the great Alexius, was marked as a victim by the prudence or</a>
<a id='line_2783'>      superstition of the emperor. 1019 In a moment of despair, Angelus</a>
<a id='line_2784'>      defended his life and liberty, slew the executioner, and fled to</a>
<a id='line_2785'>      the church of St. Sophia. The sanctuary was insensibly filled</a>
<a id='line_2786'>      with a curious and mournful crowd, who, in his fate,</a>
<a id='line_2787'>      prognosticated their own. But their lamentations were soon turned</a>
<a id='line_2788'>      to curses, and their curses to threats: they dared to ask, “Why</a>
<a id='line_2789'>      do we fear? why do we obey? We are many, and he is one: our</a>
<a id='line_2790'>      patience is the only bond of our slavery.” With the dawn of day</a>
<a id='line_2791'>      the city burst into a general sedition, the prisons were thrown</a>
<a id='line_2792'>      open, the coldest and most servile were roused to the defence of</a>
<a id='line_2793'>      their country, and Isaac, the second of the name, was raised from</a>
<a id='line_2794'>      the sanctuary to the throne. Unconscious of his danger, the</a>
<a id='line_2795'>      tyrant was absent; withdrawn from the toils of state, in the</a>
<a id='line_2796'>      delicious islands of the Propontis. He had contracted an indecent</a>
<a id='line_2797'>      marriage with Alice, or Agnes, daughter of Lewis the Seventh, of</a>
<a id='line_2798'>      France, and relict of the unfortunate Alexius; and his society,</a>
<a id='line_2799'>      more suitable to his temper than to his age, was composed of a</a>
<a id='line_2800'>      young wife and a favorite concubine. On the first alarm, he</a>
<a id='line_2801'>      rushed to Constantinople, impatient for the blood of the guilty;</a>
<a id='line_2802'>      but he was astonished by the silence of the palace, the tumult of</a>
<a id='line_2803'>      the city, and the general desertion of mankind. Andronicus</a>
<a id='line_2804'>      proclaimed a free pardon to his subjects; they neither desired,</a>
<a id='line_2805'>      nor would grant, forgiveness; he offered to resign the crown to</a>
<a id='line_2806'>      his son Manuel; but the virtues of the son could not expiate his</a>
<a id='line_2807'>      father’s crimes. The sea was still open for his retreat; but the</a>
<a id='line_2808'>      news of the revolution had flown along the coast; when fear had</a>
<a id='line_2809'>      ceased, obedience was no more: the Imperial galley was pursued</a>
<a id='line_2810'>      and taken by an armed brigantine; and the tyrant was dragged to</a>
<a id='line_2811'>      the presence of Isaac Angelus, loaded with fetters, and a long</a>
<a id='line_2812'>      chain round his neck. His eloquence, and the tears of his female</a>
<a id='line_2813'>      companions, pleaded in vain for his life; but, instead of the</a>
<a id='line_2814'>      decencies of a legal execution, the new monarch abandoned the</a>
<a id='line_2815'>      criminal to the numerous sufferers, whom he had deprived of a</a>
<a id='line_2816'>      father, a husband, or a friend. His teeth and hair, an eye and a</a>
<a id='line_2817'>      hand, were torn from him, as a poor compensation for their loss:</a>
<a id='line_2818'>      and a short respite was allowed, that he might feel the</a>
<a id='line_2819'>      bitterness of death. Astride on a camel, without any danger of a</a>
<a id='line_2820'>      rescue, he was carried through the city, and the basest of the</a>
<a id='line_2821'>      populace rejoiced to trample on the fallen majesty of their</a>
<a id='line_2822'>      prince. After a thousand blows and outrages, Andronicus was hung</a>
<a id='line_2823'>      by the feet, between two pillars, that supported the statues of a</a>
<a id='line_2824'>      wolf and an a sow; and every hand that could reach the public</a>
<a id='line_2825'>      enemy, inflicted on his body some mark of ingenious or brutal</a>
<a id='line_2826'>      cruelty, till two friendly or furious Italians, plunging their</a>
<a id='line_2827'>      swords into his body, released him from all human punishment. In</a>
<a id='line_2828'>      this long and painful agony, “Lord, have mercy upon me!” and “Why</a>
<a id='line_2829'>      will you bruise a broken reed?” were the only words that escaped</a>
<a id='line_2830'>      from his mouth. Our hatred for the tyrant is lost in pity for the</a>
<a id='line_2831'>      man; nor can we blame his pusillanimous resignation, since a</a>
<a id='line_2832'>      Greek Christian was no longer master of his life.</a>

<a id='line_2835'>      Trapezunt, p. 29, 33) has highly drawn the character of</a>
<a id='line_2836'>      Andronicus. In his view the extermination of the Byzantine</a>
<a id='line_2837'>      factions and dissolute nobility was part of a deep-laid and</a>
<a id='line_2838'>      splendid plan for the regeneration of the empire. It was</a>
<a id='line_2839'>      necessary for the wise and benevolent schemes of the father of</a>
<a id='line_2840'>      his people to lop off those limbs which were infected with</a>
<a id='line_2841'>      irremediable pestilence— “and with necessity, The tyrant’s plea,</a>

<a id='line_2848'>      cruelties.—M.]</a>
<a id='line_2849'></a>
<a id='line_2850'>      I have been tempted to expatiate on the extraordinary character</a>
<a id='line_2851'>      and adventures of Andronicus; but I shall here terminate the</a>
<a id='line_2852'>      series of the Greek emperors since the time of Heraclius. The</a>
<a id='line_2853'>      branches that sprang from the Comnenian trunk had insensibly</a>
<a id='line_2854'>      withered; and the male line was continued only in the posterity</a>
<a id='line_2855'>      of Andronicus himself, who, in the public confusion, usurped the</a>
<a id='line_2856'>      sovereignty of Trebizond, so obscure in history, and so famous in</a>
<a id='line_2857'>      romance. A private citizen of Philadelphia, Constantine Angelus,</a>
<a id='line_2858'>      had emerged to wealth and honors, by his marriage with a daughter</a>
<a id='line_2859'>      of the emperor Alexius. His son Andronicus is conspicuous only by</a>
<a id='line_2860'>      his cowardice. His grandson Isaac punished and succeeded the</a>
<a id='line_2861'>      tyrant; but he was dethroned by his own vices, and the ambition</a>
<a id='line_2862'>      of his brother; and their discord introduced the Latins to the</a>
<a id='line_2863'>      conquest of Constantinople, the first great period in the fall of</a>
<a id='line_2864'>      the Eastern empire.</a>
<a id='line_2865'></a>
<a id='line_2866'>      If we compute the number and duration of the reigns, it will be</a>
<a id='line_2867'>      found, that a period of six hundred years is filled by sixty</a>
<a id='line_2868'>      emperors, including in the Augustan list some female sovereigns;</a>
<a id='line_2869'>      and deducting some usurpers who were never acknowledged in the</a>
<a id='line_2870'>      capital, and some princes who did not live to possess their</a>
<a id='line_2871'>      inheritance. The average proportion will allow ten years for each</a>
<a id='line_2872'>      emperor, far below the chronological rule of Sir Isaac Newton,</a>
<a id='line_2873'>      who, from the experience of more recent and regular monarchies,</a>
<a id='line_2874'>      has defined about eighteen or twenty years as the term of an</a>
<a id='line_2875'>      ordinary reign. The Byzantine empire was most tranquil and</a>
<a id='line_2876'>      prosperous when it could acquiesce in hereditary succession; five</a>
<a id='line_2877'>      dynasties, the Heraclian, Isaurian, Amorian, Basilian, and</a>
<a id='line_2878'>      Comnenian families, enjoyed and transmitted the royal patrimony</a>
<a id='line_2879'>      during their respective series of five, four, three, six, and</a>
<a id='line_2880'>      four generations; several princes number the years of their reign</a>
<a id='line_2881'>      with those of their infancy; and Constantine the Seventh and his</a>
<a id='line_2882'>      two grandsons occupy the space of an entire century. But in the</a>
<a id='line_2883'>      intervals of the Byzantine dynasties, the succession is rapid and</a>
<a id='line_2884'>      broken, and the name of a successful candidate is speedily erased</a>
<a id='line_2885'>      by a more fortunate competitor. Many were the paths that led to</a>
<a id='line_2886'>      the summit of royalty: the fabric of rebellion was overthrown by</a>
<a id='line_2887'>      the stroke of conspiracy, or undermined by the silent arts of</a>
<a id='line_2888'>      intrigue: the favorites of the soldiers or people, of the senate</a>
<a id='line_2889'>      or clergy, of the women and eunuchs, were alternately clothed</a>
<a id='line_2890'>      with the purple: the means of their elevation were base, and</a>
<a id='line_2891'>      their end was often contemptible or tragic. A being of the nature</a>
<a id='line_2892'>      of man, endowed with the same faculties, but with a longer</a>
<a id='line_2893'>      measure of existence, would cast down a smile of pity and</a>
<a id='line_2894'>      contempt on the crimes and follies of human ambition, so eager,</a>
<a id='line_2895'>      in a narrow span, to grasp at a precarious and shortlived</a>
<a id='line_2896'>      enjoyment. It is thus that the experience of history exalts and</a>
<a id='line_2897'>      enlarges the horizon of our intellectual view. In a composition</a>
<a id='line_2898'>      of some days, in a perusal of some hours, six hundred years have</a>
<a id='line_2899'>      rolled away, and the duration of a life or reign is contracted to</a>
<a id='line_2900'>      a fleeting moment: the grave is ever beside the throne: the</a>
<a id='line_2901'>      success of a criminal is almost instantly followed by the loss of</a>
<a id='line_2902'>      his prize and our immortal reason survives and disdains the sixty</a>
<a id='line_2903'>      phantoms of kings who have passed before our eyes, and faintly</a>
<a id='line_2904'>      dwell on our remembrance. The observation that, in every age and</a>
<a id='line_2905'>      climate, ambition has prevailed with the same commanding energy,</a>
<a id='line_2906'>      may abate the surprise of a philosopher: but while he condemns</a>
<a id='line_2907'>      the vanity, he may search the motive, of this universal desire to</a>
<a id='line_2908'>      obtain and hold the sceptre of dominion. To the greater part of</a>
<a id='line_2909'>      the Byzantine series, we cannot reasonably ascribe the love of</a>
<a id='line_2910'>      fame and of mankind. The virtue alone of John Comnenus was</a>
<a id='line_2911'>      beneficent and pure: the most illustrious of the princes, who</a>
<a id='line_2912'>      procede or follow that respectable name, have trod with some</a>
<a id='line_2913'>      dexterity and vigor the crooked and bloody paths of a selfish</a>
<a id='line_2914'>      policy: in scrutinizing the imperfect characters of Leo the</a>
<a id='line_2915'>      Isaurian, Basil the First, and Alexius Comnenus, of Theophilus,</a>
<a id='line_2916'>      the second Basil, and Manuel Comnenus, our esteem and censure are</a>
<a id='line_2917'>      almost equally balanced; and the remainder of the Imperial crowd</a>
<a id='line_2918'>      could only desire and expect to be forgotten by posterity. Was</a>
<a id='line_2919'>      personal happiness the aim and object of their ambition? I shall</a>
<a id='line_2920'>      not descant on the vulgar topics of the misery of kings; but I</a>
<a id='line_2921'>      may surely observe, that their condition, of all others, is the</a>
<a id='line_2922'>      most pregnant with fear, and the least susceptible of hope. For</a>
<a id='line_2923'>      these opposite passions, a larger scope was allowed in the</a>
<a id='line_2924'>      revolutions of antiquity, than in the smooth and solid temper of</a>
<a id='line_2925'>      the modern world, which cannot easily repeat either the triumph</a>
<a id='line_2926'>      of Alexander or the fall of Darius. But the peculiar infelicity</a>
<a id='line_2927'>      of the Byzantine princes exposed them to domestic perils, without</a>
<a id='line_2928'>      affording any lively promise of foreign conquest. From the</a>
<a id='line_2929'>      pinnacle of greatness, Andronicus was precipitated by a death</a>
<a id='line_2930'>      more cruel and shameful than that of the malefactor; but the most</a>
<a id='line_2931'>      glorious of his predecessors had much more to dread from their</a>
<a id='line_2932'>      subjects than to hope from their enemies. The army was licentious</a>
<a id='line_2933'>      without spirit, the nation turbulent without freedom: the</a>
<a id='line_2934'>      Barbarians of the East and West pressed on the monarchy, and the</a>
<a id='line_2935'>      loss of the provinces was terminated by the final servitude of</a>
<a id='line_2936'>      the capital.</a>
<a id='line_2937'></a>
<a id='line_2938'>      The entire series of Roman emperors, from the first of the</a>
<a id='line_2939'>      Caesars to the last of the Constantines, extends above fifteen</a>
<a id='line_2940'>      hundred years: and the term of dominion, unbroken by foreign</a>
<a id='line_2941'>      conquest, surpasses the measure of the ancient monarchies; the</a>
