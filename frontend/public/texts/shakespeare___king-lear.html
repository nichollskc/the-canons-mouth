<a id='line_80'> Enter Kent, Gloucester and Edmund.</a>
<a id='line_81'></a>
<a id='line_82'>KENT.</a>
<a id='line_83'>I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.</a>
<a id='line_84'></a>
<a id='line_85'>GLOUCESTER.</a>
<a id='line_86'>It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the kingdom,</a>
<a id='line_87'>it appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for qualities are so</a>
<a id='line_88'>weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either’s moiety.</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>KENT.</a>
<a id='line_91'>Is not this your son, my lord?</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>GLOUCESTER.</a>
<a id='line_94'>His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often blush’d to</a>
<a id='line_95'>acknowledge him that now I am braz’d to’t.</a>
<a id='line_96'></a>
<a id='line_97'>KENT.</a>
<a id='line_98'>I cannot conceive you.</a>
<a id='line_99'></a>
<a id='line_100'>GLOUCESTER.</a>
<a id='line_101'>Sir, this young fellow’s mother could; whereupon she grew round-wombed,</a>
<a id='line_102'>and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her</a>
<a id='line_103'>bed. Do you smell a fault?</a>
<a id='line_104'></a>
<a id='line_105'>KENT.</a>
<a id='line_106'>I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'>GLOUCESTER.</a>
<a id='line_109'>But I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than this, who</a>
<a id='line_110'>yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came something</a>
<a id='line_111'>saucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair;</a>
<a id='line_112'>there was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be</a>
<a id='line_113'>acknowledged. Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?</a>
<a id='line_114'></a>
<a id='line_115'>EDMUND.</a>
<a id='line_116'>No, my lord.</a>

<a id='line_123'></a>
<a id='line_124'>KENT.</a>
<a id='line_125'>I must love you, and sue to know you better.</a>
<a id='line_126'></a>
<a id='line_127'>EDMUND.</a>
<a id='line_128'>Sir, I shall study deserving.</a>
<a id='line_129'></a>
<a id='line_130'>GLOUCESTER.</a>
<a id='line_131'>He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. The King is</a>
<a id='line_132'>coming.</a>
<a id='line_133'></a>
<a id='line_134'> [_Sennet within._]</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'> Enter Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia and Attendants.</a>
<a id='line_137'></a>
<a id='line_138'>LEAR.</a>
<a id='line_139'>Attend the lords of France and Burgundy,</a>

<a id='line_147'>LEAR.</a>
<a id='line_148'>Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.</a>
<a id='line_149'>Give me the map there. Know that we have divided</a>
<a id='line_150'>In three our kingdom: and ’tis our fast intent</a>
<a id='line_151'>To shake all cares and business from our age;</a>
<a id='line_152'>Conferring them on younger strengths, while we</a>
<a id='line_153'>Unburden’d crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,</a>
<a id='line_154'>And you, our no less loving son of Albany,</a>
<a id='line_155'>We have this hour a constant will to publish</a>
<a id='line_156'>Our daughters’ several dowers, that future strife</a>
<a id='line_157'>May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,</a>
<a id='line_158'>Great rivals in our youngest daughter’s love,</a>
<a id='line_159'>Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,</a>
<a id='line_160'>And here are to be answer’d. Tell me, my daughters,—</a>
<a id='line_161'>Since now we will divest us both of rule,</a>
<a id='line_162'>Interest of territory, cares of state,—</a>
<a id='line_163'>Which of you shall we say doth love us most?</a>
<a id='line_164'>That we our largest bounty may extend</a>
<a id='line_165'>Where nature doth with merit challenge.—Goneril,</a>
<a id='line_166'>Our eldest born, speak first.</a>
<a id='line_167'></a>
<a id='line_168'>GONERIL.</a>
<a id='line_169'>Sir, I love you more than word can wield the matter;</a>
<a id='line_170'>Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;</a>
<a id='line_171'>Beyond what can be valu’d, rich or rare;</a>
<a id='line_172'>No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;</a>
<a id='line_173'>As much as child e’er lov’d, or father found;</a>
<a id='line_174'>A love that makes breath poor and speech unable;</a>
<a id='line_175'>Beyond all manner of so much I love you.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>CORDELIA.</a>
<a id='line_178'>[_Aside._] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.</a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>LEAR.</a>
<a id='line_181'>Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,</a>
<a id='line_182'>With shadowy forests and with champains rich’d,</a>
<a id='line_183'>With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,</a>
<a id='line_184'>We make thee lady: to thine and Albany’s issue</a>
<a id='line_185'>Be this perpetual.—What says our second daughter,</a>
<a id='line_186'>Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak.</a>
<a id='line_187'></a>
<a id='line_188'>REGAN.</a>
<a id='line_189'>Sir, I am made of the self mettle as my sister,</a>
<a id='line_190'>And prize me at her worth. In my true heart</a>
<a id='line_191'>I find she names my very deed of love;</a>
<a id='line_192'>Only she comes too short, that I profess</a>
<a id='line_193'>Myself an enemy to all other joys</a>
<a id='line_194'>Which the most precious square of sense possesses,</a>
<a id='line_195'>And find I am alone felicitate</a>
<a id='line_196'>In your dear highness’ love.</a>
<a id='line_197'></a>
<a id='line_198'>CORDELIA.</a>
<a id='line_199'>[_Aside._] Then poor Cordelia,</a>
<a id='line_200'>And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love’s</a>
<a id='line_201'>More ponderous than my tongue.</a>
<a id='line_202'></a>
<a id='line_203'>LEAR.</a>
<a id='line_204'>To thee and thine hereditary ever</a>
<a id='line_205'>Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;</a>
<a id='line_206'>No less in space, validity, and pleasure</a>
<a id='line_207'>Than that conferr’d on Goneril.—Now, our joy,</a>
<a id='line_208'>Although the last and least; to whose young love</a>
<a id='line_209'>The vines of France and milk of Burgundy</a>
<a id='line_210'>Strive to be interess’d; what can you say to draw</a>
<a id='line_211'>A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.</a>
<a id='line_212'></a>
<a id='line_213'>CORDELIA.</a>
<a id='line_214'>Nothing, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_215'></a>
<a id='line_216'>LEAR.</a>
<a id='line_217'>Nothing?</a>

<a id='line_220'>Nothing.</a>
<a id='line_221'></a>
<a id='line_222'>LEAR.</a>
<a id='line_223'>Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.</a>
<a id='line_224'></a>
<a id='line_225'>CORDELIA.</a>
<a id='line_226'>Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave</a>
<a id='line_227'>My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty</a>
<a id='line_228'>According to my bond; no more nor less.</a>
<a id='line_229'></a>
<a id='line_230'>LEAR.</a>
<a id='line_231'>How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,</a>
<a id='line_232'>Lest you may mar your fortunes.</a>
<a id='line_233'></a>
<a id='line_234'>CORDELIA.</a>
<a id='line_235'>Good my lord,</a>
<a id='line_236'>You have begot me, bred me, lov’d me: I</a>
<a id='line_237'>Return those duties back as are right fit,</a>
<a id='line_238'>Obey you, love you, and most honour you.</a>
<a id='line_239'>Why have my sisters husbands if they say</a>
<a id='line_240'>They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,</a>
<a id='line_241'>That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry</a>
<a id='line_242'>Half my love with him, half my care and duty:</a>
<a id='line_243'>Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,</a>
<a id='line_244'>To love my father all.</a>
<a id='line_245'></a>
<a id='line_246'>LEAR.</a>
<a id='line_247'>But goes thy heart with this?</a>
<a id='line_248'></a>
<a id='line_249'>CORDELIA.</a>
<a id='line_250'>Ay, my good lord.</a>
