<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'>Enter ORLANDO and ADAM</a>
<a id='line_35'></a>
<a id='line_36'>  ORLANDO. As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me</a>
<a id='line_37'>  by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st, charged my</a>
<a id='line_38'>  brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there begins my</a>
<a id='line_39'>  sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks</a>
<a id='line_40'>  goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me rustically at home,</a>
<a id='line_41'>  or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call</a>
<a id='line_42'>  you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from</a>
<a id='line_43'>  the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better; for, besides that</a>
<a id='line_44'>  they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and</a>
<a id='line_45'>  to that end riders dearly hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing</a>
<a id='line_46'>  under him but growth; for the which his animals on his dunghills are</a>
<a id='line_47'>  as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so</a>
<a id='line_48'>  plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his</a>
<a id='line_49'>  countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds,</a>
<a id='line_50'>  bars me the place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my</a>
<a id='line_51'>  gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and</a>
<a id='line_52'>  the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny</a>
<a id='line_53'>  against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know</a>
<a id='line_54'>  no wise remedy how to avoid it.</a>
<a id='line_55'></a>
<a id='line_56'>                           Enter OLIVER</a>
<a id='line_57'></a>
<a id='line_58'>  ADAM. Yonder comes my master, your brother.</a>
<a id='line_59'>  ORLANDO. Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me</a>
<a id='line_60'>    up.                                           [ADAM retires]</a>
<a id='line_61'>  OLIVER. Now, sir! what make you here?</a>
<a id='line_62'>  ORLANDO. Nothing; I am not taught to make any thing.</a>
<a id='line_63'>  OLIVER. What mar you then, sir?</a>
<a id='line_64'>  ORLANDO. Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a</a>
<a id='line_65'>    poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.</a>
<a id='line_66'>  OLIVER. Marry, sir, be better employed, and be nought awhile.</a>
<a id='line_67'>  ORLANDO. Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What</a>
<a id='line_68'>    prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury?</a>
<a id='line_69'>  OLIVER. Know you where you are, sir?</a>
<a id='line_70'>  ORLANDO. O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.</a>
<a id='line_71'>  OLIVER. Know you before whom, sir?</a>
<a id='line_72'>  ORLANDO. Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are</a>
<a id='line_73'>    my eldest brother; and in the gentle condition of blood, you</a>
<a id='line_74'>    should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better</a>
<a id='line_75'>    in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes not</a>
<a id='line_76'>    away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as</a>
<a id='line_77'>    much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming</a>
<a id='line_78'>    before me is nearer to his reverence.</a>
<a id='line_79'>  OLIVER. What, boy!                               [Strikes him]</a>
<a id='line_80'>  ORLANDO. Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.</a>
<a id='line_81'>  OLIVER. Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?</a>
<a id='line_82'>  ORLANDO. I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de</a>
<a id='line_83'>    Boys. He was my father; and he is thrice a villain that says such</a>
<a id='line_84'>    a father begot villains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not</a>
<a id='line_85'>    take this hand from thy throat till this other had pull'd out thy</a>
<a id='line_86'>    tongue for saying so. Thou has rail'd on thyself.</a>
<a id='line_87'>  ADAM. [Coming forward] Sweet masters, be patient; for your father's</a>
<a id='line_88'>    remembrance, be at accord.</a>
<a id='line_89'>  OLIVER. Let me go, I say.</a>
<a id='line_90'>  ORLANDO. I will not, till I please; you shall hear me. My father</a>
<a id='line_91'>    charg'd you in his will to give me good education: you have</a>
<a id='line_92'>    train'd me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all</a>
<a id='line_93'>    gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in</a>
<a id='line_94'>    me, and I will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such</a>
<a id='line_95'>    exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor</a>
<a id='line_96'>    allottery my father left me by testament; with that I will go buy</a>
<a id='line_97'>    my fortunes.</a>
<a id='line_98'>  OLIVER. And what wilt thou do? Beg, when that is spent? Well, sir,</a>
<a id='line_99'>    get you in. I will not long be troubled with you; you shall have</a>
<a id='line_100'>    some part of your will. I pray you leave me.</a>
<a id='line_101'>  ORLANDO. I no further offend you than becomes me for my good.</a>
<a id='line_102'>  OLIVER. Get you with him, you old dog.</a>
<a id='line_103'>  ADAM. Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in</a>
<a id='line_104'>    your service. God be with my old master! He would not have spoke</a>
<a id='line_105'>    such a word.</a>

<a id='line_107'>  OLIVER. Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I will physic</a>
<a id='line_108'>    your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither. Holla,</a>
<a id='line_109'>    Dennis!</a>
<a id='line_110'></a>
<a id='line_111'>                          Enter DENNIS</a>

<a id='line_113'>  DENNIS. Calls your worship?</a>
<a id='line_114'>  OLIVER. not Charles, the Duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?</a>
<a id='line_115'>  DENNIS. So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access</a>
<a id='line_116'>    to you.</a>
<a id='line_117'>  OLIVER. Call him in. [Exit DENNIS] 'Twill be a good way; and</a>
<a id='line_118'>    to-morrow the wrestling is.</a>
<a id='line_119'></a>
<a id='line_120'>                          Enter CHARLES</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>  CHARLES. Good morrow to your worship.</a>
<a id='line_123'>  OLIVER. Good Monsieur Charles! What's the new news at the new</a>
<a id='line_124'>    court?</a>
<a id='line_125'>  CHARLES. There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news; that</a>
<a id='line_126'>    is, the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke;</a>
<a id='line_127'>    and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary</a>
<a id='line_128'>    exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke;</a>
<a id='line_129'>    therefore he gives them good leave to wander.</a>
<a id='line_130'>  OLIVER. Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke's daughter, be banished</a>
<a id='line_131'>    with her father?</a>
<a id='line_132'>  CHARLES. O, no; for the Duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her,</a>
<a id='line_133'>    being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have</a>
<a id='line_134'>    followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her. She is at</a>
<a id='line_135'>    the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own</a>
<a id='line_136'>    daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do.</a>
<a id='line_137'>  OLIVER. Where will the old Duke live?</a>
<a id='line_138'>  CHARLES. They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many</a>
<a id='line_139'>    merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood</a>
<a id='line_140'>    of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day,</a>
<a id='line_141'>    and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.</a>
<a id='line_142'>  OLIVER. What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new Duke?</a>
<a id='line_143'>  CHARLES. Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a</a>
<a id='line_144'>    matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger</a>
<a id='line_145'>    brother, Orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against</a>
<a id='line_146'>    me to try a fall. To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he</a>
<a id='line_147'>    that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.</a>
<a id='line_148'>    Your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, I would</a>
<a id='line_149'>    be loath to foil him, as I must, for my own honour, if he come</a>
<a id='line_150'>    in; therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint</a>
<a id='line_151'>    you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment,</a>
<a id='line_152'>    or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is</a>
<a id='line_153'>    thing of his own search and altogether against my will.</a>
<a id='line_154'>  OLIVER. Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_155'>    find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my</a>
<a id='line_156'>    brother's purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to</a>
<a id='line_157'>    dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I'll tell thee,</a>
<a id='line_158'>    Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France; full of</a>
<a id='line_159'>    ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a secret</a>
<a id='line_160'>    and villainous contriver against me his natural brother.</a>
<a id='line_161'>    Therefore use thy discretion: I had as lief thou didst break his</a>
<a id='line_162'>    neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if thou</a>
<a id='line_163'>    dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace</a>
<a id='line_164'>    himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap</a>
<a id='line_165'>    thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he</a>
<a id='line_166'>    hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; for, I</a>
<a id='line_167'>    assure thee, and almost with tears I speak it, there is not one</a>
<a id='line_168'>    so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly</a>
<a id='line_169'>    of him; but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush</a>
<a id='line_170'>    and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.</a>
<a id='line_171'>  CHARLES. I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come</a>
<a id='line_172'>    to-morrow I'll give him his payment. If ever he go alone again,</a>
<a id='line_173'>    I'll never wrestle for prize more. And so, God keep your worship!</a>
<a id='line_174'> Exit</a>
<a id='line_175'>  OLIVER. Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I</a>
<a id='line_176'>    hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,</a>
<a id='line_177'>    hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle; never school'd and</a>
<a id='line_178'>    yet learned; full of noble device; of all sorts enchantingly</a>
<a id='line_179'>    beloved; and, indeed, so much in the heart of the world, and</a>
<a id='line_180'>    especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am</a>
<a id='line_181'>    altogether misprised. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler</a>
<a id='line_182'>    shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy</a>
<a id='line_183'>    thither, which now I'll go about.                       Exit</a>
<a id='line_184'></a>
<a id='line_185'>SCENE II. A lawn before the DUKE'S palace</a>
<a id='line_186'></a>
<a id='line_187'>Enter ROSALIND and CELIA</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>  CELIA. I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.</a>
<a id='line_190'>  ROSALIND. Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of; and</a>
<a id='line_191'>    would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget</a>
<a id='line_192'>    a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any</a>
<a id='line_193'>    extraordinary pleasure.</a>
<a id='line_194'>  CELIA. Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I</a>
<a id='line_195'>    love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy</a>
<a id='line_196'>    uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I</a>
<a id='line_197'>    could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; so wouldst</a>
<a id='line_198'>    thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper'd</a>
<a id='line_199'>    as mine is to thee.</a>
<a id='line_200'>  ROSALIND. Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to</a>
<a id='line_201'>    rejoice in yours.</a>
<a id='line_202'>  CELIA. You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to</a>
<a id='line_203'>    have; and, truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir; for what</a>
<a id='line_204'>    he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee</a>
<a id='line_205'>    again in affection. By mine honour, I will; and when I break that</a>
<a id='line_206'>    oath, let me turn monster; therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear</a>
<a id='line_207'>    Rose, be merry.</a>
<a id='line_208'>  ROSALIND. From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.</a>
<a id='line_209'>    Let me see; what think you of falling in love?</a>
<a id='line_210'>  CELIA. Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal; but love no man</a>
<a id='line_211'>    in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety</a>
<a id='line_212'>    of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.</a>
<a id='line_213'>  ROSALIND. What shall be our sport, then?</a>
<a id='line_214'>  CELIA. Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her</a>
<a id='line_215'>    wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.</a>
<a id='line_216'>  ROSALIND. I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily</a>
<a id='line_217'>    misplaced; and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her</a>
<a id='line_218'>    gifts to women.</a>
<a id='line_219'>  CELIA. 'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes</a>
<a id='line_220'>    honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very</a>
<a id='line_221'>    ill-favouredly.</a>
<a id='line_222'>  ROSALIND. Nay; now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's:</a>
<a id='line_223'>    Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of</a>
<a id='line_224'>    Nature.</a>
<a id='line_225'></a>
<a id='line_226'>                         Enter TOUCHSTONE</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>  CELIA. No; when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by</a>
<a id='line_229'>    Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to</a>
<a id='line_230'>    flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off</a>
<a id='line_231'>    the argument?</a>
<a id='line_232'>  ROSALIND. Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when</a>
<a id='line_233'>    Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of Nature's wit.</a>
<a id='line_234'>  CELIA. Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but</a>
<a id='line_235'>    Nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of</a>
<a id='line_236'>    such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for</a>
<a id='line_237'>    always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How</a>
<a id='line_238'>    now, wit! Whither wander you?</a>
<a id='line_239'>  TOUCHSTONE. Mistress, you must come away to your father.</a>
<a id='line_240'>  CELIA. Were you made the messenger?</a>
<a id='line_241'>  TOUCHSTONE. No, by mine honour; but I was bid to come for you.</a>
<a id='line_242'>  ROSALIND. Where learned you that oath, fool?</a>
<a id='line_243'>  TOUCHSTONE. Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were</a>
<a id='line_244'>    good pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was naught.</a>
<a id='line_245'>    Now I'll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard</a>
<a id='line_246'>    was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.</a>
<a id='line_247'>  CELIA. How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?</a>
<a id='line_248'>  ROSALIND. Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.</a>
<a id='line_249'>  TOUCHSTONE. Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear</a>
<a id='line_250'>    by your beards that I am a knave.</a>
<a id='line_251'>  CELIA. By our beards, if we had them, thou art.</a>
<a id='line_252'>  TOUCHSTONE. By my knavery, if I had it, then I were. But if you</a>
<a id='line_253'>    swear by that that not, you are not forsworn; no more was this</a>
<a id='line_254'>    knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he</a>
<a id='line_255'>    had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or</a>
<a id='line_256'>    that mustard.</a>
<a id='line_257'>  CELIA. Prithee, who is't that thou mean'st?</a>
<a id='line_258'>  TOUCHSTONE. One that old Frederick, your father, loves.</a>
<a id='line_259'>  CELIA. My father's love is enough to honour him. Enough, speak no</a>
<a id='line_260'>    more of him; you'll be whipt for taxation one of these days.</a>
<a id='line_261'>  TOUCHSTONE. The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise</a>
<a id='line_262'>    men do foolishly.</a>
<a id='line_263'>  CELIA. By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that</a>
<a id='line_264'>    fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have</a>
<a id='line_265'>    makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.</a>
<a id='line_266'></a>
<a id='line_267'>                           Enter LE BEAU</a>
<a id='line_268'></a>
<a id='line_269'>  ROSALIND. With his mouth full of news.</a>
<a id='line_270'>  CELIA. Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.</a>
<a id='line_271'>  ROSALIND. Then shall we be news-cramm'd.</a>
<a id='line_272'>  CELIA. All the better; we shall be the more marketable. Bon jour,</a>
<a id='line_273'>    Monsieur Le Beau. What's the news?</a>
<a id='line_274'>  LE BEAU. Fair Princess, you have lost much good sport.</a>
<a id='line_275'>  CELIA. Sport! of what colour?</a>
<a id='line_276'>  LE BEAU. What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?</a>
<a id='line_277'>  ROSALIND. As wit and fortune will.</a>
<a id='line_278'>  TOUCHSTONE. Or as the Destinies decrees.</a>
<a id='line_279'>  CELIA. Well said; that was laid on with a trowel.</a>
<a id='line_280'>  TOUCHSTONE. Nay, if I keep not my rank-</a>
<a id='line_281'>  ROSALIND. Thou losest thy old smell.</a>
<a id='line_282'>  LE BEAU. You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good</a>
<a id='line_283'>    wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.</a>
<a id='line_284'>  ROSALIND. Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.</a>
<a id='line_285'>  LE BEAU. I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your</a>
<a id='line_286'>    ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is yet to do; and</a>
<a id='line_287'>    here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.</a>
<a id='line_288'>  CELIA. Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.</a>
<a id='line_289'>  LE BEAU. There comes an old man and his three sons-</a>
<a id='line_290'>  CELIA. I could match this beginning with an old tale.</a>
<a id='line_291'>  LE BEAU. Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.</a>
<a id='line_292'>  ROSALIND. With bills on their necks: 'Be it known unto all men by</a>
<a id='line_293'>    these presents'-</a>
<a id='line_294'>  LE BEAU. The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke's</a>
<a id='line_295'>    wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of</a>
<a id='line_296'>    his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. So he serv'd</a>
<a id='line_297'>    the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,</a>
<a id='line_298'>    their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the</a>
<a id='line_299'>    beholders take his part with weeping.</a>
<a id='line_300'>  ROSALIND. Alas!</a>
<a id='line_301'>  TOUCHSTONE. But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have</a>
<a id='line_302'>    lost?</a>
<a id='line_303'>  LE BEAU. Why, this that I speak of.</a>
<a id='line_304'>  TOUCHSTONE. Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time</a>
<a id='line_305'>    that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.</a>
<a id='line_306'>  CELIA. Or I, I promise thee.</a>
<a id='line_307'>  ROSALIND. But is there any else longs to see this broken music in</a>
<a id='line_308'>    his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we</a>
<a id='line_309'>    see this wrestling, cousin?</a>
<a id='line_310'>  LE BEAU. You must, if you stay here; for here is the place</a>
<a id='line_311'>    appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.</a>
<a id='line_312'>  CELIA. Yonder, sure, they are coming. Let us now stay and see it.</a>
<a id='line_313'></a>
<a id='line_314'>           Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, LORDS, ORLANDO,</a>
<a id='line_315'>                     CHARLES, and ATTENDANTS</a>

<a id='line_317'>  FREDERICK. Come on; since the youth will not be entreated, his own</a>
<a id='line_318'>    peril on his forwardness.</a>
<a id='line_319'>  ROSALIND. Is yonder the man?</a>
<a id='line_320'>  LE BEAU. Even he, madam.</a>
<a id='line_321'>  CELIA. Alas, he is too young; yet he looks successfully.</a>
<a id='line_322'>  FREDERICK. How now, daughter and cousin! Are you crept hither to</a>
<a id='line_323'>    see the wrestling?</a>
<a id='line_324'>  ROSALIND. Ay, my liege; so please you give us leave.</a>
<a id='line_325'>  FREDERICK. You will take little delight in it, I can tell you,</a>
<a id='line_326'>    there is such odds in the man. In pity of the challenger's youth</a>
<a id='line_327'>    I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated. Speak to</a>
<a id='line_328'>    him, ladies; see if you can move him.</a>
<a id='line_329'>  CELIA. Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.</a>
<a id='line_330'>  FREDERICK. Do so; I'll not be by.</a>
<a id='line_331'>                                     [DUKE FREDERICK goes apart]</a>
<a id='line_332'>  LE BEAU. Monsieur the Challenger, the Princess calls for you.</a>
<a id='line_333'>  ORLANDO. I attend them with all respect and duty.</a>
<a id='line_334'>  ROSALIND. Young man, have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler?</a>
<a id='line_335'>  ORLANDO. No, fair Princess; he is the general challenger. I come</a>
<a id='line_336'>    but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.</a>
<a id='line_337'>  CELIA. Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years.</a>
<a id='line_338'>    You have seen cruel proof of this man's strength; if you saw</a>
<a id='line_339'>    yourself with your eyes, or knew yourself with your judgment, the</a>
<a id='line_340'>    fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal</a>
<a id='line_341'>    enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to embrace your own</a>
<a id='line_342'>    safety and give over this attempt.</a>
<a id='line_343'>  ROSALIND. Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore be</a>
<a id='line_344'>    misprised: we will make it our suit to the Duke that the</a>
<a id='line_345'>    wrestling might not go forward.</a>
<a id='line_346'>  ORLANDO. I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts,</a>
<a id='line_347'>    wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent</a>
<a id='line_348'>    ladies any thing. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go</a>
<a id='line_349'>    with me to my trial; wherein if I be foil'd there is but one</a>
<a id='line_350'>    sham'd that was never gracious; if kill'd, but one dead that is</a>
<a id='line_351'>    willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none</a>
<a id='line_352'>    to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only</a>
<a id='line_353'>    in the world I fill up a place, which may be better supplied when</a>
<a id='line_354'>    I have made it empty.</a>
<a id='line_355'>  ROSALIND. The little strength that I have, I would it were with</a>
<a id='line_356'>    you.</a>
<a id='line_357'>  CELIA. And mine to eke out hers.</a>
<a id='line_358'>  ROSALIND. Fare you well. Pray heaven I be deceiv'd in you!</a>
<a id='line_359'>  CELIA. Your heart's desires be with you!</a>
<a id='line_360'>  CHARLES. Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to</a>
<a id='line_361'>    lie with his mother earth?</a>
<a id='line_362'>  ORLANDO. Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.</a>
<a id='line_363'>  FREDERICK. You shall try but one fall.</a>
<a id='line_364'>  CHARLES. No, I warrant your Grace, you shall not entreat him to a</a>
<a id='line_365'>    second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.</a>
<a id='line_366'>  ORLANDO. You mean to mock me after; you should not have mock'd me</a>
<a id='line_367'>    before; but come your ways.</a>
<a id='line_368'>  ROSALIND. Now, Hercules be thy speed, young man!</a>
<a id='line_369'>  CELIA. I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the</a>

<a id='line_377'>  FREDERICK. How dost thou, Charles?</a>
<a id='line_378'>  LE BEAU. He cannot speak, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_379'>  FREDERICK. Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?</a>
<a id='line_380'>  ORLANDO. Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de</a>
<a id='line_381'>    Boys.</a>
<a id='line_382'>  FREDERICK. I would thou hadst been son to some man else.</a>
<a id='line_383'>    The world esteem'd thy father honourable,</a>
<a id='line_384'>    But I did find him still mine enemy.</a>

<a id='line_386'>    Hadst thou descended from another house.</a>
<a id='line_387'>    But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth;</a>
<a id='line_388'>    I would thou hadst told me of another father.</a>

<a id='line_390'>  CELIA. Were I my father, coz, would I do this?</a>
<a id='line_391'>  ORLANDO. I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,</a>
<a id='line_392'>    His youngest son- and would not change that calling</a>
<a id='line_393'>    To be adopted heir to Frederick.</a>
<a id='line_394'>  ROSALIND. My father lov'd Sir Rowland as his soul,</a>
<a id='line_395'>    And all the world was of my father's mind;</a>
<a id='line_396'>    Had I before known this young man his son,</a>

<a id='line_410'>  CELIA. Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.</a>
<a id='line_411'>  ORLANDO. Can I not say 'I thank you'? My better parts</a>
<a id='line_412'>    Are all thrown down; and that which here stands up</a>
<a id='line_413'>    Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.</a>
<a id='line_414'>  ROSALIND. He calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes;</a>
<a id='line_415'>    I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?</a>
<a id='line_416'>    Sir, you have wrestled well, and overthrown</a>

<a id='line_427'></a>
<a id='line_428'>  LE BEAU. Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you</a>
<a id='line_429'>    To leave this place. Albeit you have deserv'd</a>
<a id='line_430'>    High commendation, true applause, and love,</a>
<a id='line_431'>    Yet such is now the Duke's condition</a>
<a id='line_432'>    That he misconstrues all that you have done.</a>
<a id='line_433'>    The Duke is humorous; what he is, indeed,</a>
<a id='line_434'>    More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.</a>
<a id='line_435'>  ORLANDO. I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:</a>
<a id='line_436'>    Which of the two was daughter of the Duke</a>
<a id='line_437'>    That here was at the wrestling?</a>
<a id='line_438'>  LE BEAU. Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;</a>
<a id='line_439'>    But yet, indeed, the smaller is his daughter;</a>
<a id='line_440'>    The other is daughter to the banish'd Duke,</a>
<a id='line_441'>    And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,</a>
<a id='line_442'>    To keep his daughter company; whose loves</a>
<a id='line_443'>    Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.</a>
<a id='line_444'>    But I can tell you that of late this Duke</a>
<a id='line_445'>    Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,</a>
<a id='line_446'>    Grounded upon no other argument</a>
<a id='line_447'>    But that the people praise her for her virtues</a>
<a id='line_448'>    And pity her for her good father's sake;</a>
<a id='line_449'>    And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady</a>
<a id='line_450'>    Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well.</a>
<a id='line_451'>    Hereafter, in a better world than this,</a>
<a id='line_452'>    I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.</a>
<a id='line_453'>  ORLANDO. I rest much bounden to you; fare you well.</a>
<a id='line_454'>                                                    Exit LE BEAU</a>

<a id='line_456'>    From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother.</a>
<a id='line_457'>    But heavenly Rosalind!                                  Exit</a>
<a id='line_458'></a>

<a id='line_464'>    Not a word?</a>
<a id='line_465'>  ROSALIND. Not one to throw at a dog.</a>
<a id='line_466'>  CELIA. No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs;</a>
<a id='line_467'>    throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.</a>
<a id='line_468'>  ROSALIND. Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should</a>

<a id='line_470'>  CELIA. But is all this for your father?</a>
<a id='line_471'>  ROSALIND. No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how full of</a>
<a id='line_472'>    briers is this working-day world!</a>
<a id='line_473'>  CELIA. They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday</a>

<a id='line_481'>  ROSALIND. O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.</a>
<a id='line_482'>  CELIA. O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of</a>
<a id='line_483'>    a fall. But, turning these jests out of service, let us talk in</a>
<a id='line_484'>    good earnest. Is it possible, on such a sudden, you should fall</a>
<a id='line_485'>    into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?</a>
<a id='line_486'>  ROSALIND. The Duke my father lov'd his father dearly.</a>
<a id='line_487'>  CELIA. Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?</a>
<a id='line_488'>    By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his</a>

<a id='line_490'>  ROSALIND. No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.</a>
<a id='line_491'>  CELIA. Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?</a>

<a id='line_540'>    Speak to the people, and they pity her.</a>
<a id='line_541'>    Thou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name;</a>

<a id='line_557'>    Prithee be cheerful. Know'st thou not the Duke</a>
<a id='line_558'>    Hath banish'd me, his daughter?</a>
<a id='line_559'>  ROSALIND. That he hath not.</a>
<a id='line_560'>  CELIA. No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love</a>
<a id='line_561'>    Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.</a>
<a id='line_562'>    Shall we be sund'red? Shall we part, sweet girl?</a>
<a id='line_563'>    No; let my father seek another heir.</a>
<a id='line_564'>    Therefore devise with me how we may fly,</a>
<a id='line_565'>    Whither to go, and what to bear with us;</a>
<a id='line_566'>    And do not seek to take your charge upon you,</a>
<a id='line_567'>    To bear your griefs yourself, and leave me out;</a>
<a id='line_568'>    For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,</a>
<a id='line_569'>    Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.</a>
<a id='line_570'>  ROSALIND. Why, whither shall we go?</a>
<a id='line_571'>  CELIA. To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.</a>
<a id='line_572'>  ROSALIND. Alas, what danger will it be to us,</a>
<a id='line_573'>    Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!</a>
<a id='line_574'>    Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.</a>
<a id='line_575'>  CELIA. I'll put myself in poor and mean attire,</a>
<a id='line_576'>    And with a kind of umber smirch my face;</a>
<a id='line_577'>    The like do you; so shall we pass along,</a>
<a id='line_578'>    And never stir assailants.</a>
<a id='line_579'>  ROSALIND. Were it not better,</a>
<a id='line_580'>    Because that I am more than common tall,</a>
<a id='line_581'>    That I did suit me all points like a man?</a>
<a id='line_582'>    A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,</a>
<a id='line_583'>    A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart</a>
<a id='line_584'>    Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will-</a>
<a id='line_585'>    We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,</a>
<a id='line_586'>    As many other mannish cowards have</a>
<a id='line_587'>    That do outface it with their semblances.</a>
<a id='line_588'>  CELIA. What shall I call thee when thou art a man?</a>
<a id='line_589'>  ROSALIND. I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,</a>
<a id='line_590'>    And therefore look you call me Ganymede.</a>
<a id='line_591'>    But what will you be call'd?</a>
<a id='line_592'>  CELIA. Something that hath a reference to my state:</a>
<a id='line_593'>    No longer Celia, but Aliena.</a>
<a id='line_594'>  ROSALIND. But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal</a>
<a id='line_595'>    The clownish fool out of your father's court?</a>
<a id='line_596'>    Would he not be a comfort to our travel?</a>
<a id='line_597'>  CELIA. He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;</a>
<a id='line_598'>    Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,</a>
<a id='line_599'>    And get our jewels and our wealth together;</a>
<a id='line_600'>    Devise the fittest time and safest way</a>
<a id='line_601'>    To hide us from pursuit that will be made</a>

<a id='line_610'>    Hath not old custom made this life more sweet</a>
<a id='line_611'>    Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods</a>
<a id='line_612'>    More free from peril than the envious court?</a>
<a id='line_613'>    Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,</a>
<a id='line_614'>    The seasons' difference; as the icy fang</a>
<a id='line_615'>    And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,</a>
<a id='line_616'>    Which when it bites and blows upon my body,</a>
<a id='line_617'>    Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say</a>
<a id='line_618'>    'This is no flattery; these are counsellors</a>
<a id='line_619'>    That feelingly persuade me what I am.'</a>
<a id='line_620'>    Sweet are the uses of adversity,</a>
<a id='line_621'>    Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,</a>
<a id='line_622'>    Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;</a>
<a id='line_623'>    And this our life, exempt from public haunt,</a>
<a id='line_624'>    Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,</a>
<a id='line_625'>    Sermons in stones, and good in everything.</a>
<a id='line_626'>    I would not change it.</a>
<a id='line_627'>  AMIENS. Happy is your Grace,</a>

<a id='line_630'>  DUKE SENIOR. Come, shall we go and kill us venison?</a>
<a id='line_631'>    And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,</a>
<a id='line_632'>    Being native burghers of this desert city,</a>
<a id='line_633'>    Should, in their own confines, with forked heads</a>
<a id='line_634'>    Have their round haunches gor'd.</a>
<a id='line_635'>  FIRST LORD. Indeed, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_636'>    The melancholy Jaques grieves at that;</a>
<a id='line_637'>    And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp</a>
<a id='line_638'>    Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.</a>
<a id='line_639'>    To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself</a>
<a id='line_640'>    Did steal behind him as he lay along</a>
<a id='line_641'>    Under an oak whose antique root peeps out</a>
<a id='line_642'>    Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!</a>
<a id='line_643'>    To the which place a poor sequest'red stag,</a>
<a id='line_644'>    That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,</a>
<a id='line_645'>    Did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_646'>    The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans</a>
<a id='line_647'>    That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat</a>
<a id='line_648'>    Almost to bursting; and the big round tears</a>
<a id='line_649'>    Cours'd one another down his innocent nose</a>
<a id='line_650'>    In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,</a>
<a id='line_651'>    Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,</a>
<a id='line_652'>    Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook,</a>
<a id='line_653'>    Augmenting it with tears.</a>
<a id='line_654'>  DUKE SENIOR. But what said Jaques?</a>
<a id='line_655'>    Did he not moralize this spectacle?</a>
<a id='line_656'>  FIRST LORD. O, yes, into a thousand similes.</a>
<a id='line_657'>    First, for his weeping into the needless stream:</a>
<a id='line_658'>    'Poor deer,' quoth he 'thou mak'st a testament</a>
<a id='line_659'>    As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more</a>
<a id='line_660'>    To that which had too much.' Then, being there alone,</a>
<a id='line_661'>    Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:</a>
<a id='line_662'>    ''Tis right'; quoth he 'thus misery doth part</a>
<a id='line_663'>    The flux of company.' Anon, a careless herd,</a>
<a id='line_664'>    Full of the pasture, jumps along by him</a>
<a id='line_665'>    And never stays to greet him. 'Ay,' quoth Jaques</a>
<a id='line_666'>    'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;</a>
<a id='line_667'>    'Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look</a>
<a id='line_668'>    Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'</a>
<a id='line_669'>    Thus most invectively he pierceth through</a>
<a id='line_670'>    The body of the country, city, court,</a>
<a id='line_671'>    Yea, and of this our life; swearing that we</a>
<a id='line_672'>    Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse,</a>
<a id='line_673'>    To fright the animals, and to kill them up</a>
<a id='line_674'>    In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.</a>
<a id='line_675'>  DUKE SENIOR. And did you leave him in this contemplation?</a>
<a id='line_676'>  SECOND LORD. We did, my lord, weeping and commenting</a>
<a id='line_677'>    Upon the sobbing deer.</a>
<a id='line_678'>  DUKE SENIOR. Show me the place;</a>
<a id='line_679'>    I love to cope him in these sullen fits,</a>
<a id='line_680'>    For then he's full of matter.</a>

<a id='line_689'>    Are of consent and sufferance in this.</a>
<a id='line_690'>  FIRST LORD. I cannot hear of any that did see her.</a>
<a id='line_691'>    The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,</a>
<a id='line_692'>    Saw her abed, and in the morning early</a>
<a id='line_693'>    They found the bed untreasur'd of their mistress.</a>
<a id='line_694'>  SECOND LORD. My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft</a>
<a id='line_695'>    Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.</a>
<a id='line_696'>    Hisperia, the Princess' gentlewoman,</a>

<a id='line_701'>    And she believes, wherever they are gone,</a>
<a id='line_702'>    That youth is surely in their company.</a>
<a id='line_703'>  FREDERICK. Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither.</a>
<a id='line_704'>    If he be absent, bring his brother to me;</a>
<a id='line_705'>    I'll make him find him. Do this suddenly;</a>
<a id='line_706'>    And let not search and inquisition quail</a>

<a id='line_720'>    The bonny prizer of the humorous Duke?</a>
<a id='line_721'>    Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.</a>
<a id='line_722'>    Know you not, master, to some kind of men</a>
<a id='line_723'>    Their graces serve them but as enemies?</a>
<a id='line_724'>    No more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master,</a>
<a id='line_725'>    Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.</a>
<a id='line_726'>    O, what a world is this, when what is comely</a>

<a id='line_728'>  ORLANDO. Why, what's the matter?</a>
<a id='line_729'>  ADAM. O unhappy youth!</a>
<a id='line_730'>    Come not within these doors; within this roof</a>
<a id='line_731'>    The enemy of all your graces lives.</a>
<a id='line_732'>    Your brother- no, no brother; yet the son-</a>

<a id='line_734'>    Of him I was about to call his father-</a>
<a id='line_735'>    Hath heard your praises; and this night he means</a>
<a id='line_736'>    To burn the lodging where you use to lie,</a>
<a id='line_737'>    And you within it. If he fail of that,</a>
<a id='line_738'>    He will have other means to cut you off;</a>
<a id='line_739'>    I overheard him and his practices.</a>
<a id='line_740'>    This is no place; this house is but a butchery;</a>

<a id='line_743'>  ADAM. No matter whither, so you come not here.</a>
<a id='line_744'>  ORLANDO. What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,</a>
<a id='line_745'>    Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce</a>
<a id='line_746'>    A thievish living on the common road?</a>
<a id='line_747'>    This I must do, or know not what to do;</a>
<a id='line_748'>    Yet this I will not do, do how I can.</a>
<a id='line_749'>    I rather will subject me to the malice</a>

<a id='line_770'>    The constant service of the antique world,</a>
<a id='line_771'>    When service sweat for duty, not for meed!</a>
<a id='line_772'>    Thou art not for the fashion of these times,</a>

<a id='line_1003'>  JAQUES. A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest,</a>

<a id='line_1009'>    'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I; 'No, sir,' quoth he,</a>
<a id='line_1010'>    'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.'</a>
<a id='line_1011'>    And then he drew a dial from his poke,</a>
<a id='line_1012'>    And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,</a>
<a id='line_1013'>    Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock;</a>
<a id='line_1014'>    Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags;</a>
<a id='line_1015'>    'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;</a>
<a id='line_1016'>    And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;</a>

<a id='line_1020'>    The motley fool thus moral on the time,</a>
<a id='line_1021'>    My lungs began to crow like chanticleer</a>
<a id='line_1022'>    That fools should be so deep contemplative;</a>
<a id='line_1023'>    And I did laugh sans intermission</a>
<a id='line_1024'>    An hour by his dial. O noble fool!</a>
<a id='line_1025'>    A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.</a>
<a id='line_1026'>  DUKE SENIOR. What fool is this?</a>
<a id='line_1027'>  JAQUES. O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,</a>
<a id='line_1028'>    And says, if ladies be but young and fair,</a>
<a id='line_1029'>    They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,</a>
<a id='line_1030'>    Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit</a>

<a id='line_1032'>    With observation, the which he vents</a>

<a id='line_1042'>    And they that are most galled with my folly,</a>
<a id='line_1043'>    They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?</a>
<a id='line_1044'>    The why is plain as way to parish church:</a>

<a id='line_1055'>  JAQUES. What, for a counter, would I do but good?</a>
<a id='line_1056'>  DUKE SENIOR. Most Mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;</a>

<a id='line_1066'>    What woman in the city do I name</a>
<a id='line_1067'>    When that I say the city-woman bears</a>

<a id='line_1140'>    And one man in his time plays many parts,</a>
<a id='line_1141'>    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,</a>
<a id='line_1142'>    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;</a>
<a id='line_1143'>    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel</a>
<a id='line_1144'>    And shining morning face, creeping like snail</a>
<a id='line_1145'>    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,</a>
<a id='line_1146'>    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad</a>
<a id='line_1147'>    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,</a>
<a id='line_1148'>    Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,</a>
<a id='line_1149'>    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,</a>
<a id='line_1150'>    Seeking the bubble reputation</a>
<a id='line_1151'>    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,</a>
<a id='line_1152'>    In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,</a>
<a id='line_1153'>    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,</a>
<a id='line_1154'>    Full of wise saws and modern instances;</a>
<a id='line_1155'>    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts</a>
<a id='line_1156'>    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,</a>
<a id='line_1157'>    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,</a>
<a id='line_1158'>    His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide</a>
<a id='line_1159'>    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,</a>
<a id='line_1160'>    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes</a>
<a id='line_1161'>    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,</a>
<a id='line_1162'>    That ends this strange eventful history,</a>
<a id='line_1163'>    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;</a>
<a id='line_1164'>    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.</a>

<a id='line_1247'></a>
<a id='line_1248'>  CORIN. And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?</a>
<a id='line_1249'>  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good</a>
<a id='line_1250'>    life; but in respect that it is a shepherd's life, it is nought.</a>
<a id='line_1251'>    In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in</a>
<a id='line_1252'>    respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now in</a>
<a id='line_1253'>    respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect</a>
<a id='line_1254'>    it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life,</a>
<a id='line_1255'>    look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty</a>
<a id='line_1256'>    in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in</a>
<a id='line_1257'>    thee, shepherd?</a>
<a id='line_1258'>  CORIN. No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at</a>
<a id='line_1259'>    ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content, is</a>
<a id='line_1260'>    without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet,</a>
<a id='line_1261'>    and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a</a>
<a id='line_1262'>    great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath</a>
<a id='line_1263'>    learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding,</a>
<a id='line_1264'>    or comes of a very dull kindred.</a>
<a id='line_1265'>  TOUCHSTONE. Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in</a>
<a id='line_1266'>    court, shepherd?</a>
<a id='line_1267'>  CORIN. No, truly.</a>
<a id='line_1268'>  TOUCHSTONE. Then thou art damn'd.</a>
<a id='line_1269'>  CORIN. Nay, I hope.</a>
<a id='line_1270'>  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on</a>
<a id='line_1271'>    one side.</a>
<a id='line_1272'>  CORIN. For not being at court? Your reason.</a>
<a id='line_1273'>  TOUCHSTONE. Why, if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good</a>
<a id='line_1274'>    manners; if thou never saw'st good manners, then thy manners must</a>
<a id='line_1275'>    be wicked; and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art</a>
<a id='line_1276'>    in a parlous state, shepherd.</a>
<a id='line_1277'>  CORIN. Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the</a>
<a id='line_1278'>    court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the</a>
<a id='line_1279'>    country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not</a>
<a id='line_1280'>    at the court, but you kiss your hands; that courtesy would be</a>
<a id='line_1281'>    uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.</a>
<a id='line_1282'>  TOUCHSTONE. Instance, briefly; come, instance.</a>
<a id='line_1283'>  CORIN. Why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you</a>
<a id='line_1284'>    know, are greasy.</a>
<a id='line_1285'>  TOUCHSTONE. Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? And is not the</a>
<a id='line_1286'>    grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow,</a>
<a id='line_1287'>    shallow. A better instance, I say; come.</a>
<a id='line_1288'>  CORIN. Besides, our hands are hard.</a>
<a id='line_1289'>  TOUCHSTONE. Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A</a>
<a id='line_1290'>    more sounder instance; come.</a>
<a id='line_1291'>  CORIN. And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our</a>
<a id='line_1292'>    sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier's hands are</a>
<a id='line_1293'>    perfum'd with civet.</a>
<a id='line_1294'>  TOUCHSTONE. Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good</a>
<a id='line_1295'>    piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is</a>
<a id='line_1296'>    of a baser birth than tar- the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend</a>
<a id='line_1297'>    the instance, shepherd.</a>
<a id='line_1298'>  CORIN. You have too courtly a wit for me; I'll rest.</a>
<a id='line_1299'>  TOUCHSTONE. Wilt thou rest damn'd? God help thee, shallow man! God</a>
<a id='line_1300'>    make incision in thee! thou art raw.</a>
<a id='line_1301'>  CORIN. Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I</a>
<a id='line_1302'>    wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other</a>
<a id='line_1303'>    men's good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is</a>
<a id='line_1304'>    to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.</a>
<a id='line_1305'>  TOUCHSTONE. That is another simple sin in you: to bring the ewes</a>
<a id='line_1306'>    and the rams together, and to offer to get your living by the</a>
<a id='line_1307'>    copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to betray</a>
<a id='line_1308'>    a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,</a>
<a id='line_1309'>    out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not damn'd for this,</a>
<a id='line_1310'>    the devil himself will have no shepherds; I cannot see else how</a>
<a id='line_1311'>    thou shouldst scape.</a>

<a id='line_1407'>  ROSALIND. Is it a man?</a>
<a id='line_1408'>  CELIA. And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.</a>
<a id='line_1409'>    Change you colour?</a>
<a id='line_1410'>  ROSALIND. I prithee, who?</a>
<a id='line_1411'>  CELIA. O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but</a>
<a id='line_1412'>    mountains may be remov'd with earthquakes, and so encounter.</a>
<a id='line_1413'>  ROSALIND. Nay, but who is it?</a>
<a id='line_1414'>  CELIA. Is it possible?</a>
<a id='line_1415'>  ROSALIND. Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell</a>
<a id='line_1416'>    me who it is.</a>
<a id='line_1417'>  CELIA. O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet</a>
<a id='line_1418'>    again wonderful, and after that, out of all whooping!</a>
<a id='line_1419'>  ROSALIND. Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am</a>
<a id='line_1420'>    caparison'd like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my</a>
<a id='line_1421'>    disposition? One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery.</a>
<a id='line_1422'>    I prithee tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would</a>
<a id='line_1423'>    thou could'st stammer, that thou mightst pour this conceal'd man</a>
<a id='line_1424'>    out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of narrow-mouth'd bottle-</a>
<a id='line_1425'>    either too much at once or none at all. I prithee take the cork</a>
<a id='line_1426'>    out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings.</a>
<a id='line_1427'>  CELIA. So you may put a man in your belly.</a>
<a id='line_1428'>  ROSALIND. Is he of God's making? What manner of man?</a>
<a id='line_1429'>    Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?</a>
<a id='line_1430'>  CELIA. Nay, he hath but a little beard.</a>
<a id='line_1431'>  ROSALIND. Why, God will send more if the man will be thankful. Let</a>
<a id='line_1432'>    me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the</a>
<a id='line_1433'>    knowledge of his chin.</a>
<a id='line_1434'>  CELIA. It is young Orlando, that tripp'd up the wrestler's heels</a>
<a id='line_1435'>    and your heart both in an instant.</a>
<a id='line_1436'>  ROSALIND. Nay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true</a>
<a id='line_1437'>    maid.</a>
<a id='line_1438'>  CELIA. I' faith, coz, 'tis he.</a>
<a id='line_1439'>  ROSALIND. Orlando?</a>
<a id='line_1440'>  CELIA. Orlando.</a>
<a id='line_1441'>  ROSALIND. Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose?</a>
<a id='line_1442'>    What did he when thou saw'st him? What said he? How look'd he?</a>
<a id='line_1443'>    Wherein went he? What makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where</a>
<a id='line_1444'>    remains he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him</a>
<a id='line_1445'>    again? Answer me in one word.</a>
<a id='line_1446'>  CELIA. You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too</a>
<a id='line_1447'>    great for any mouth of this age's size. To say ay and no to these</a>
<a id='line_1448'>    particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.</a>
<a id='line_1449'>  ROSALIND. But doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's</a>
<a id='line_1450'>    apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?</a>
<a id='line_1451'>  CELIA. It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the</a>
<a id='line_1452'>    propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my finding him, and</a>
<a id='line_1453'>    relish it with good observance. I found him under a tree, like a</a>
<a id='line_1454'>    dropp'd acorn.</a>
<a id='line_1455'>  ROSALIND. It may well be call'd Jove's tree, when it drops forth</a>
<a id='line_1456'>    such fruit.</a>
<a id='line_1457'>  CELIA. Give me audience, good madam.</a>
<a id='line_1458'>  ROSALIND. Proceed.</a>
<a id='line_1459'>  CELIA. There lay he, stretch'd along like a wounded knight.</a>
<a id='line_1460'>  ROSALIND. Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes</a>
<a id='line_1461'>    the ground.</a>
<a id='line_1462'>  CELIA. Cry 'Holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets</a>
<a id='line_1463'>    unseasonably. He was furnish'd like a hunter.</a>
<a id='line_1464'>  ROSALIND. O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.</a>
<a id='line_1465'>  CELIA. I would sing my song without a burden; thou bring'st me out</a>
<a id='line_1466'>    of tune.</a>
<a id='line_1467'>  ROSALIND. Do you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak.</a>
<a id='line_1468'>    Sweet, say on.</a>
<a id='line_1469'>  CELIA. You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?</a>
<a id='line_1470'></a>
<a id='line_1471'>                   Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES</a>
<a id='line_1472'></a>
<a id='line_1473'>  ROSALIND. 'Tis he; slink by, and note him. JAQUES. I thank you for</a>
<a id='line_1474'>  your company; but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself alone.</a>
<a id='line_1475'>  ORLANDO. And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too for</a>
<a id='line_1476'>  your society. JAQUES. God buy you; let's meet as little as we can.</a>
<a id='line_1477'>  ORLANDO. I do desire we may be better strangers. JAQUES. I pray you</a>
<a id='line_1478'>  mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks. ORLANDO. I</a>
<a id='line_1479'>  pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill-favouredly.</a>
<a id='line_1480'>  JAQUES. Rosalind is your love's name? ORLANDO. Yes, just. JAQUES. I</a>
<a id='line_1481'>  do not like her name. ORLANDO. There was no thought of pleasing you</a>
<a id='line_1482'>  when she was christen'd. JAQUES. What stature is she of? ORLANDO.</a>
<a id='line_1483'>  Just as high as my heart. JAQUES. You are full of pretty answers.</a>
<a id='line_1484'>  Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conn'd them</a>
<a id='line_1485'>  out of rings? ORLANDO. Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth,</a>
<a id='line_1486'>  from whence you have studied your questions. JAQUES. You have a</a>
<a id='line_1487'>  nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down</a>
<a id='line_1488'>  with me? and we two will rail against our mistress the world, and all</a>
<a id='line_1489'>  our misery. ORLANDO. I will chide no breather in the world but</a>
<a id='line_1490'>  myself, against whom I know most faults. JAQUES. The worst fault you</a>
<a id='line_1491'>  have is to be in love. ORLANDO. 'Tis a fault I will not change for</a>
<a id='line_1492'>  your best virtue. I am weary of you. JAQUES. By my troth, I was</a>
<a id='line_1493'>  seeking for a fool when I found you. ORLANDO. He is drown'd in the</a>
<a id='line_1494'>  brook; look but in, and you shall see him. JAQUES. There I shall see</a>
<a id='line_1495'>  mine own figure. ORLANDO. Which I take to be either a fool or a</a>
<a id='line_1496'>  cipher. JAQUES. I'll tarry no longer with you; farewell, good Signior</a>
<a id='line_1497'>  Love. ORLANDO. I am glad of your departure; adieu, good Monsieur</a>
<a id='line_1498'>  Melancholy. Exit JAQUES ROSALIND. [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to</a>
<a id='line_1499'>  him like a saucy lackey, and under that habit play the knave with</a>
<a id='line_1500'>  him.- Do you hear, forester? ORLANDO. Very well; what would you?</a>
<a id='line_1501'>  ROSALIND. I pray you, what is't o'clock? ORLANDO. You should ask me</a>
<a id='line_1502'>  what time o' day; there's no clock in the forest. ROSALIND. Then</a>
<a id='line_1503'>  there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing every minute and</a>
<a id='line_1504'>  groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a</a>
<a id='line_1505'>  clock. ORLANDO. And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been</a>
<a id='line_1506'>  as proper? ROSALIND. By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces</a>
<a id='line_1507'>  with divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles withal, who Time</a>
<a id='line_1508'>  trots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands still</a>
<a id='line_1509'>  withal. ORLANDO. I prithee, who doth he trot withal? ROSALIND. Marry,</a>
<a id='line_1510'>  he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage</a>
<a id='line_1511'>  and the day it is solemniz'd; if the interim be but a se'nnight,</a>
<a id='line_1512'>  Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year.</a>
<a id='line_1513'>  ORLANDO. Who ambles Time withal? ROSALIND. With a priest that lacks</a>
<a id='line_1514'>  Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout; for the one sleeps</a>
<a id='line_1515'>  easily because he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because</a>
<a id='line_1516'>  he feels no pain; the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful</a>
<a id='line_1517'>  learning, the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These</a>
<a id='line_1518'>  Time ambles withal. ORLANDO. Who doth he gallop withal? ROSALIND.</a>
<a id='line_1519'>  With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly as foot can</a>
<a id='line_1520'>  fall, he thinks himself too soon there. ORLANDO. Who stays it still</a>
<a id='line_1521'>  withal? ROSALIND. With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep</a>
<a id='line_1522'>  between term and term, and then they perceive not how Time moves.</a>
<a id='line_1523'>  ORLANDO. Where dwell you, pretty youth? ROSALIND. With this</a>
<a id='line_1524'>  shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe</a>
<a id='line_1525'>  upon a petticoat. ORLANDO. Are you native of this place? ROSALIND. As</a>
<a id='line_1526'>  the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled. ORLANDO. Your</a>
<a id='line_1527'>  accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a</a>
<a id='line_1528'>  dwelling. ROSALIND. I have been told so of many; but indeed an old</a>
<a id='line_1529'>  religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an</a>
<a id='line_1530'>  inland man; one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in</a>
<a id='line_1531'>  love. I have heard him read many lectures against it; and I thank God</a>
<a id='line_1532'>  I am not a woman, to be touch'd with so many giddy offences as he</a>
<a id='line_1533'>  hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal. ORLANDO. Can you</a>
<a id='line_1534'>  remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of</a>
<a id='line_1535'>  women? ROSALIND. There were none principal; they were all like one</a>
<a id='line_1536'>  another as halfpence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his</a>
<a id='line_1537'>  fellow-fault came to match it. ORLANDO. I prithee recount some of</a>
<a id='line_1538'>  them. ROSALIND. No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that</a>
<a id='line_1539'>  are sick. There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young</a>
<a id='line_1540'>  plants with carving 'Rosalind' on their barks; hangs odes upon</a>
<a id='line_1541'>  hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the name</a>
<a id='line_1542'>  of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give him some</a>
<a id='line_1543'>  good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him.</a>
<a id='line_1544'>  ORLANDO. I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your</a>
<a id='line_1545'>  remedy. ROSALIND. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he</a>
<a id='line_1546'>  taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes I am</a>
<a id='line_1547'>  sure you are not prisoner. ORLANDO. What were his marks? ROSALIND. A</a>
<a id='line_1548'>  lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have</a>
<a id='line_1549'>  not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected,</a>
<a id='line_1550'>  which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for simply your having</a>
<a id='line_1551'>  in beard is a younger brother's revenue. Then your hose should be</a>
<a id='line_1552'>  ungarter'd, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbutton'd, your shoe</a>
<a id='line_1553'>  untied, and every thing about you demonstrating a careless</a>
<a id='line_1554'>  desolation. But you are no such man; you are rather point-device in</a>
<a id='line_1555'>  your accoutrements, as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any</a>
<a id='line_1556'>  other. ORLANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.</a>
<a id='line_1557'>  ROSALIND. Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love</a>
<a id='line_1558'>  believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to confess she</a>
<a id='line_1559'>  does. That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie</a>
<a id='line_1560'>  to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the</a>
<a id='line_1561'>  verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired? ORLANDO. I swear</a>
<a id='line_1562'>  to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that</a>
<a id='line_1563'>  unfortunate he. ROSALIND. But are you so much in love as your rhymes</a>
<a id='line_1564'>  speak? ORLANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.</a>
<a id='line_1565'>  ROSALIND. Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as well</a>
<a id='line_1566'>  a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not</a>
<a id='line_1567'>  so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the</a>
<a id='line_1568'>  whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.</a>
<a id='line_1569'>  ORLANDO. Did you ever cure any so? ROSALIND. Yes, one; and in this</a>
<a id='line_1570'>  manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress; and I set him</a>
<a id='line_1571'>  every day to woo me; at which time would I, being but a moonish</a>
<a id='line_1572'>  youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud,</a>
<a id='line_1573'>  fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of</a>
<a id='line_1574'>  smiles; for every passion something and for no passion truly</a>
<a id='line_1575'>  anything, as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this</a>
<a id='line_1576'>  colour; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then</a>
<a id='line_1577'>  forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my</a>
<a id='line_1578'>  suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness;</a>
<a id='line_1579'>  which was, to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a</a>
<a id='line_1580'>  nook merely monastic. And thus I cur'd him; and this way will I take</a>
<a id='line_1581'>  upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart, that</a>
<a id='line_1582'>  there shall not be one spot of love in 't. ORLANDO. I would not be</a>
<a id='line_1583'>  cured, youth. ROSALIND. I would cure you, if you would but call me</a>
<a id='line_1584'>  Rosalind, and come every day to my cote and woo me. ORLANDO. Now, by</a>
<a id='line_1585'>  the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is. ROSALIND. Go with</a>
<a id='line_1586'>  me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way, you shall tell me</a>
<a id='line_1587'>  where in the forest you live. Will you go? ORLANDO. With all my</a>
<a id='line_1588'>  heart, good youth. ROSALIND. Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come,</a>
<a id='line_1589'>  sister, will you go?</a>
<a id='line_1590'>   Exeunt</a>
<a id='line_1591'></a>
<a id='line_1592'>SCENE III. The forest</a>
<a id='line_1593'></a>
<a id='line_1594'>Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind</a>
<a id='line_1595'></a>
<a id='line_1596'>  TOUCHSTONE. Come apace, good Audrey; I will fetch up your goats,</a>
<a id='line_1597'>    Audrey. And how, Audrey, am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature</a>
<a id='line_1598'>    content you?</a>
<a id='line_1599'>  AUDREY. Your features! Lord warrant us! What features?</a>
<a id='line_1600'>  TOUCHSTONE. I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most</a>
<a id='line_1601'>    capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.</a>
<a id='line_1602'>  JAQUES. [Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a</a>
<a id='line_1603'>    thatch'd house!</a>
<a id='line_1604'>  TOUCHSTONE. When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's</a>
<a id='line_1605'>    good wit seconded with the forward child understanding, it</a>
<a id='line_1606'>    strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room.</a>
<a id='line_1607'>    Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.</a>
<a id='line_1608'>  AUDREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and</a>
<a id='line_1609'>    word? Is it a true thing?</a>
<a id='line_1610'>  TOUCHSTONE. No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning,</a>
<a id='line_1611'>    and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry may</a>
<a id='line_1612'>    be said as lovers they do feign.</a>
<a id='line_1613'>  AUDREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?</a>
<a id='line_1614'>  TOUCHSTONE. I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest;</a>
<a id='line_1615'>    now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst</a>
<a id='line_1616'>    feign.</a>
<a id='line_1617'>  AUDREY. Would you not have me honest?</a>
<a id='line_1618'>  TOUCHSTONE. No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favour'd; for honesty</a>
<a id='line_1619'>    coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.</a>
<a id='line_1620'>  JAQUES. [Aside] A material fool!</a>
<a id='line_1621'>  AUDREY. Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me</a>
<a id='line_1622'>    honest.</a>
<a id='line_1623'>  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were</a>
<a id='line_1624'>    to put good meat into an unclean dish.</a>
<a id='line_1625'>  AUDREY. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.</a>
<a id='line_1626'>  TOUCHSTONE. Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;</a>
<a id='line_1627'>    sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will</a>
<a id='line_1628'>    marry thee; and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext,</a>
<a id='line_1629'>    the vicar of the next village, who hath promis'd to meet me in</a>
<a id='line_1630'>    this place of the forest, and to couple us.</a>
<a id='line_1631'>  JAQUES. [Aside] I would fain see this meeting.</a>
<a id='line_1632'>  AUDREY. Well, the gods give us joy!</a>
<a id='line_1633'>  TOUCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger</a>
<a id='line_1634'>    in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no</a>
<a id='line_1635'>    assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are</a>
<a id='line_1636'>    odious, they are necessary. It is said: 'Many a man knows no end</a>
<a id='line_1637'>    of his goods.' Right! Many a man has good horns and knows no end</a>
<a id='line_1638'>    of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his</a>
<a id='line_1639'>    own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest</a>
<a id='line_1640'>    deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore</a>
<a id='line_1641'>    blessed? No; as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village, so</a>
<a id='line_1642'>    is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare</a>
<a id='line_1643'>    brow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no</a>
<a id='line_1644'>    skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want. Here comes</a>
<a id='line_1645'>    Sir Oliver.</a>
<a id='line_1646'></a>
<a id='line_1647'>                       Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</a>
<a id='line_1648'></a>
<a id='line_1649'>    Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met. Will you dispatch us here</a>
<a id='line_1650'>    under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?</a>
<a id='line_1651'>  MARTEXT. Is there none here to give the woman?</a>
<a id='line_1652'>  TOUCHSTONE. I will not take her on gift of any man.</a>
<a id='line_1653'>  MARTEXT. Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.</a>
<a id='line_1654'>  JAQUES. [Discovering himself] Proceed, proceed; I'll give her.</a>
<a id='line_1655'>  TOUCHSTONE. Good even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do you, sir?</a>
<a id='line_1656'>    You are very well met. Goddild you for your last company. I am</a>

<a id='line_1659'>  JAQUES. Will you be married, motley?</a>

<a id='line_1691'>  ROSALIND. Never talk to me; I will weep.</a>
<a id='line_1692'>  CELIA. Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears</a>
<a id='line_1693'>    do not become a man.</a>
<a id='line_1694'>  ROSALIND. But have I not cause to weep?</a>
<a id='line_1695'>  CELIA. As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.</a>
<a id='line_1696'>  ROSALIND. His very hair is of the dissembling colour.</a>
<a id='line_1697'>  CELIA. Something browner than Judas's.</a>
<a id='line_1698'>    Marry, his kisses are Judas's own children.</a>
<a id='line_1699'>  ROSALIND. I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.</a>
<a id='line_1700'>  CELIA. An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.</a>
<a id='line_1701'>  ROSALIND. And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of</a>
<a id='line_1702'>    holy bread.</a>
<a id='line_1703'>  CELIA. He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of</a>
<a id='line_1704'>    winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice of</a>
<a id='line_1705'>    chastity is in them.</a>
<a id='line_1706'>  ROSALIND. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and</a>
<a id='line_1707'>    comes not?</a>
<a id='line_1708'>  CELIA. Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.</a>
<a id='line_1709'>  ROSALIND. Do you think so?</a>
<a id='line_1710'>  CELIA. Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but</a>
<a id='line_1711'>    for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as covered</a>
<a id='line_1712'>    goblet or a worm-eaten nut.</a>
<a id='line_1713'>  ROSALIND. Not true in love?</a>
<a id='line_1714'>  CELIA. Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.</a>
<a id='line_1715'>  ROSALIND. You have heard him swear downright he was.</a>
<a id='line_1716'>  CELIA. 'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no</a>

<a id='line_1719'>    your father.</a>
<a id='line_1720'>  ROSALIND. I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him.</a>
<a id='line_1721'>    He asked me of what parentage I was; I told him, of as good as</a>
<a id='line_1722'>    he; so he laugh'd and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when</a>
<a id='line_1723'>    there is such a man as Orlando?</a>
<a id='line_1724'>  CELIA. O, that's a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave</a>
<a id='line_1725'>    words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite</a>

<a id='line_1873'>    But, sure, he's proud; and yet his pride becomes him.</a>
<a id='line_1874'>    He'll make a proper man. The best thing in him</a>
<a id='line_1875'>    Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue</a>
<a id='line_1876'>    Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.</a>
<a id='line_1877'>    He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall;</a>
<a id='line_1878'>    His leg is but so-so; and yet 'tis well.</a>
<a id='line_1879'>    There was a pretty redness in his lip,</a>
<a id='line_1880'>    A little riper and more lusty red</a>
<a id='line_1881'>    Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference</a>

<a id='line_1883'>    There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him</a>

<a id='line_1886'>    I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet</a>
<a id='line_1887'>    I have more cause to hate him than to love him;</a>
<a id='line_1888'>    For what had he to do to chide at me?</a>
<a id='line_1889'>    He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,</a>
<a id='line_1890'>    And, now I am rememb'red, scorn'd at me.</a>
<a id='line_1891'>    I marvel why I answer'd not again;</a>
<a id='line_1892'>    But that's all one: omittance is no quittance.</a>
<a id='line_1893'>    I'll write to him a very taunting letter,</a>
<a id='line_1894'>    And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius?</a>

<a id='line_1909'>  ROSALIND. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable</a>
<a id='line_1910'>    fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than</a>
<a id='line_1911'>    drunkards.</a>
<a id='line_1912'>  JAQUES. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.</a>
<a id='line_1913'>  ROSALIND. Why then, 'tis good to be a post.</a>
<a id='line_1914'>  JAQUES. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is</a>

<a id='line_1919'>    melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted</a>
<a id='line_1920'>    from many objects, and, indeed, the sundry contemplation of my</a>
<a id='line_1921'>    travels; in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous</a>
<a id='line_1922'>    sadness.</a>
<a id='line_1923'>  ROSALIND. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be</a>
<a id='line_1924'>    sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's; then</a>

<a id='line_1938'>    out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making</a>

<a id='line_1941'>    have you been all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such</a>
<a id='line_1942'>    another trick, never come in my sight more.</a>
<a id='line_1943'>  ORLANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.</a>
<a id='line_1944'>  ROSALIND. Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a</a>
<a id='line_1945'>    minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the</a>
<a id='line_1946'>    thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said</a>
<a id='line_1947'>    of him that Cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' shoulder, but I'll</a>
<a id='line_1948'>    warrant him heart-whole.</a>
<a id='line_1949'>  ORLANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.</a>
<a id='line_1950'>  ROSALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had</a>
<a id='line_1951'>    as lief be woo'd of a snail.</a>
<a id='line_1952'>  ORLANDO. Of a snail!</a>
<a id='line_1953'>  ROSALIND. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries</a>
<a id='line_1954'>    his house on his head- a better jointure, I think, than you make</a>
<a id='line_1955'>    a woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him.</a>
<a id='line_1956'>  ORLANDO. What's that?</a>
<a id='line_1957'>  ROSALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to</a>
<a id='line_1958'>    your wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and prevents</a>
<a id='line_1959'>    the slander of his wife.</a>
<a id='line_1960'>  ORLANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.</a>
<a id='line_1961'>  ROSALIND. And I am your Rosalind.</a>
<a id='line_1962'>  CELIA. It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a</a>
<a id='line_1963'>    better leer than you.</a>
<a id='line_1964'>  ROSALIND. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,</a>
<a id='line_1965'>    and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I</a>
<a id='line_1966'>    were your very very Rosalind?</a>
<a id='line_1967'>  ORLANDO. I would kiss before I spoke.</a>
<a id='line_1968'>  ROSALIND. Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were</a>
<a id='line_1969'>    gravell'd for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.</a>
<a id='line_1970'>    Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for</a>
<a id='line_1971'>    lovers lacking- God warn us!- matter, the cleanliest shift is to</a>
<a id='line_1972'>    kiss.</a>
<a id='line_1973'>  ORLANDO. How if the kiss be denied?</a>
<a id='line_1974'>  ROSALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new</a>
<a id='line_1975'>    matter.</a>
<a id='line_1976'>  ORLANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?</a>
<a id='line_1977'>  ROSALIND. Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I</a>
<a id='line_1978'>    should think my honesty ranker than my wit.</a>
<a id='line_1979'>  ORLANDO. What, of my suit?</a>
<a id='line_1980'>  ROSALIND. Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.</a>
<a id='line_1981'>    Am not I your Rosalind?</a>
<a id='line_1982'>  ORLANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking</a>
<a id='line_1983'>    of her.</a>
<a id='line_1984'>  ROSALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.</a>
<a id='line_1985'>  ORLANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.</a>
<a id='line_1986'>  ROSALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six</a>
<a id='line_1987'>    thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man</a>
<a id='line_1988'>    died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. Troilus had</a>
<a id='line_1989'>    his brains dash'd out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he</a>
<a id='line_1990'>    could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love.</a>
<a id='line_1991'>    Leander, he would have liv'd many a fair year, though Hero had</a>
<a id='line_1992'>    turn'd nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for,</a>
<a id='line_1993'>    good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and,</a>
<a id='line_1994'>    being taken with the cramp, was drown'd; and the foolish</a>
<a id='line_1995'>    chroniclers of that age found it was- Hero of Sestos. But these</a>
<a id='line_1996'>    are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have</a>
<a id='line_1997'>    eaten them, but not for love.</a>
<a id='line_1998'>  ORLANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I</a>
<a id='line_1999'>    protest, her frown might kill me.</a>
<a id='line_2000'>  ROSALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I</a>
<a id='line_2001'>    will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me</a>
<a id='line_2002'>    what you will, I will grant it.</a>
<a id='line_2003'>  ORLANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.</a>
<a id='line_2004'>  ROSALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.</a>
<a id='line_2005'>  ORLANDO. And wilt thou have me?</a>
<a id='line_2006'>  ROSALIND. Ay, and twenty such.</a>
<a id='line_2007'>  ORLANDO. What sayest thou?</a>
<a id='line_2008'>  ROSALIND. Are you not good?</a>
<a id='line_2009'>  ORLANDO. I hope so.</a>
<a id='line_2010'>  ROSALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,</a>
<a id='line_2011'>    sister, you shall be the priest, and marry us. Give me your hand,</a>
<a id='line_2012'>    Orlando. What do you say, sister?</a>
<a id='line_2013'>  ORLANDO. Pray thee, marry us.</a>
<a id='line_2014'>  CELIA. I cannot say the words.</a>
<a id='line_2015'>  ROSALIND. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-</a>
<a id='line_2016'>  CELIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?</a>
<a id='line_2017'>  ORLANDO. I will.</a>
<a id='line_2018'>  ROSALIND. Ay, but when?</a>
<a id='line_2019'>  ORLANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.</a>
<a id='line_2020'>  ROSALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'</a>
<a id='line_2021'>  ORLANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.</a>
<a id='line_2022'>  ROSALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,</a>
<a id='line_2023'>    Orlando, for my husband. There's a girl goes before the priest;</a>
<a id='line_2024'>    and, certainly, a woman's thought runs before her actions.</a>
<a id='line_2025'>  ORLANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.</a>
<a id='line_2026'>  ROSALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have</a>
<a id='line_2027'>    possess'd her.</a>
<a id='line_2028'>  ORLANDO. For ever and a day.</a>
<a id='line_2029'>  ROSALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are</a>
<a id='line_2030'>    April when they woo, December when they wed: maids are May when</a>
<a id='line_2031'>    they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will</a>
<a id='line_2032'>    be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,</a>
<a id='line_2033'>    more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than</a>
<a id='line_2034'>    an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for</a>
<a id='line_2035'>    nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you</a>
<a id='line_2036'>    are dispos'd to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and that when</a>
<a id='line_2037'>    thou are inclin'd to sleep.</a>
<a id='line_2038'>  ORLANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?</a>
<a id='line_2039'>  ROSALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.</a>
<a id='line_2040'>  ORLANDO. O, but she is wise.</a>
<a id='line_2041'>  ROSALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,</a>
<a id='line_2042'>    the waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman's wit, and it will out</a>
<a id='line_2043'>    at the casement; shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole; stop</a>
<a id='line_2044'>    that, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.</a>
<a id='line_2045'>  ORLANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,</a>
<a id='line_2046'>    whither wilt?' ROSALIND. Nay, you might keep that check for it,</a>
<a id='line_2047'>    till you met your</a>
<a id='line_2048'>    wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.</a>
<a id='line_2049'>  ORLANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?</a>
<a id='line_2050'>  ROSALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never</a>
<a id='line_2051'>    take her without her answer, unless you take her without her</a>
<a id='line_2052'>    tongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's</a>
<a id='line_2053'>    occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will</a>
<a id='line_2054'>    breed it like a fool!</a>
<a id='line_2055'>  ORLANDO. For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.</a>
<a id='line_2056'>  ROSALIND. Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!</a>
<a id='line_2057'>  ORLANDO. I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be</a>
<a id='line_2058'>    with thee again.</a>
<a id='line_2059'>  ROSALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would</a>
<a id='line_2060'>    prove; my friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That</a>
<a id='line_2061'>    flattering tongue of yours won me. 'Tis but one cast away, and</a>
<a id='line_2062'>    so, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?</a>
<a id='line_2063'>  ORLANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind.</a>
<a id='line_2064'>  ROSALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and</a>
<a id='line_2065'>    by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot</a>
<a id='line_2066'>    of your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I will</a>
<a id='line_2067'>    think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow</a>
<a id='line_2068'>    lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind, that may</a>
<a id='line_2069'>    be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore</a>
<a id='line_2070'>    beware my censure, and keep your promise.</a>
<a id='line_2071'>  ORLANDO. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my</a>
<a id='line_2072'>    Rosalind; so, adieu.</a>
<a id='line_2073'>  ROSALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such</a>
<a id='line_2074'>    offenders, and let Time try. Adieu.             Exit ORLANDO</a>
<a id='line_2075'>  CELIA. You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate. We must</a>

<a id='line_2082'>    in, it runs out.</a>
<a id='line_2083'>  ROSALIND. No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of</a>

<a id='line_2085'>    rascally boy, that abuses every one's eyes, because his own are</a>

<a id='line_2208'></a>
<a id='line_2209'>  OLIVER. Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,</a>
<a id='line_2210'>    Where in the purlieus of this forest stands</a>
<a id='line_2211'>    A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?</a>
<a id='line_2212'>  CELIA. West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.</a>
<a id='line_2213'>    The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream</a>
<a id='line_2214'>    Left on your right hand brings you to the place.</a>
<a id='line_2215'>    But at this hour the house doth keep itself;</a>
<a id='line_2216'>    There's none within.</a>
<a id='line_2217'>  OLIVER. If that an eye may profit by a tongue,</a>
<a id='line_2218'>    Then should I know you by description-</a>
<a id='line_2219'>    Such garments, and such years: 'The boy is fair,</a>
<a id='line_2220'>    Of female favour, and bestows himself</a>
<a id='line_2221'>    Like a ripe sister; the woman low,</a>
<a id='line_2222'>    And browner than her brother.' Are not you</a>
<a id='line_2223'>    The owner of the house I did inquire for?</a>
<a id='line_2224'>  CELIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.</a>
<a id='line_2225'>  OLIVER. Orlando doth commend him to you both;</a>
<a id='line_2226'>    And to that youth he calls his Rosalind</a>
<a id='line_2227'>    He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?</a>
<a id='line_2228'>  ROSALIND. I am. What must we understand by this?</a>
<a id='line_2229'>  OLIVER. Some of my shame; if you will know of me</a>
<a id='line_2230'>    What man I am, and how, and why, and where,</a>
<a id='line_2231'>    This handkercher was stain'd.</a>
<a id='line_2232'>  CELIA. I pray you, tell it.</a>
<a id='line_2233'>  OLIVER. When last the young Orlando parted from you,</a>
<a id='line_2234'>    He left a promise to return again</a>
<a id='line_2235'>    Within an hour; and, pacing through the forest,</a>
<a id='line_2236'>    Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,</a>
<a id='line_2237'>    Lo, what befell! He threw his eye aside,</a>
<a id='line_2238'>    And mark what object did present itself.</a>
<a id='line_2239'>    Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,</a>
<a id='line_2240'>    And high top bald with dry antiquity,</a>
<a id='line_2241'>    A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,</a>
<a id='line_2242'>    Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck</a>
<a id='line_2243'>    A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,</a>
<a id='line_2244'>    Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd</a>
<a id='line_2245'>    The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,</a>
<a id='line_2246'>    Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,</a>
<a id='line_2247'>    And with indented glides did slip away</a>
<a id='line_2248'>    Into a bush; under which bush's shade</a>
<a id='line_2249'>    A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,</a>
<a id='line_2250'>    Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,</a>
<a id='line_2251'>    When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis</a>
<a id='line_2252'>    The royal disposition of that beast</a>
<a id='line_2253'>    To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.</a>
<a id='line_2254'>    This seen, Orlando did approach the man,</a>
<a id='line_2255'>    And found it was his brother, his elder brother.</a>
<a id='line_2256'>  CELIA. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;</a>
<a id='line_2257'>    And he did render him the most unnatural</a>
<a id='line_2258'>    That liv'd amongst men.</a>
<a id='line_2259'>  OLIVER. And well he might so do,</a>
<a id='line_2260'>    For well I know he was unnatural.</a>
<a id='line_2261'>  ROSALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,</a>
<a id='line_2262'>    Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?</a>
<a id='line_2263'>  OLIVER. Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;</a>
<a id='line_2264'>    But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,</a>
<a id='line_2265'>    And nature, stronger than his just occasion,</a>
<a id='line_2266'>    Made him give battle to the lioness,</a>
<a id='line_2267'>    Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling</a>
<a id='line_2268'>    From miserable slumber I awak'd.</a>
<a id='line_2269'>  CELIA. Are you his brother?</a>
<a id='line_2270'>  ROSALIND. Was't you he rescu'd?</a>
<a id='line_2271'>  CELIA. Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?</a>
<a id='line_2272'>  OLIVER. 'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame</a>
<a id='line_2273'>    To tell you what I was, since my conversion</a>
<a id='line_2274'>    So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.</a>
<a id='line_2275'>  ROSALIND. But for the bloody napkin?</a>
<a id='line_2276'>  OLIVER. By and by.</a>
<a id='line_2277'>    When from the first to last, betwixt us two,</a>
<a id='line_2278'>    Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd,</a>
<a id='line_2279'>    As how I came into that desert place-</a>
<a id='line_2280'>    In brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,</a>
<a id='line_2281'>    Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,</a>
<a id='line_2282'>    Committing me unto my brother's love;</a>
<a id='line_2283'>    Who led me instantly unto his cave,</a>
<a id='line_2284'>    There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm</a>
<a id='line_2285'>    The lioness had torn some flesh away,</a>
<a id='line_2286'>    Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,</a>
<a id='line_2287'>    And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.</a>
<a id='line_2288'>    Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound,</a>
<a id='line_2289'>    And, after some small space, being strong at heart,</a>
<a id='line_2290'>    He sent me hither, stranger as I am,</a>
<a id='line_2291'>    To tell this story, that you might excuse</a>
<a id='line_2292'>    His broken promise, and to give this napkin,</a>

<a id='line_2302'>    I pray you, will you take him by the arm?</a>
<a id='line_2303'>  OLIVER. Be of good cheer, youth. You a man!</a>
<a id='line_2304'>    You lack a man's heart.</a>
<a id='line_2305'>  ROSALIND. I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think</a>

<a id='line_2310'>  ROSALIND. Counterfeit, I assure you.</a>
<a id='line_2311'>  OLIVER. Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.</a>
<a id='line_2312'>  ROSALIND. So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by</a>

<a id='line_2610'>  JAQUES. Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded</a>

<a id='line_2612'>     courtier, he swears.</a>
<a id='line_2613'>  TOUCHSTONE. If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.</a>
<a id='line_2614'>    I have trod a measure; I have flatt'red a lady; I have been</a>
<a id='line_2615'>    politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone</a>
<a id='line_2616'>    three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought</a>
<a id='line_2617'>    one.</a>
<a id='line_2618'>  JAQUES. And how was that ta'en up?</a>
<a id='line_2619'>  TOUCHSTONE. Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the</a>
<a id='line_2620'>    seventh cause.</a>
<a id='line_2621'>  JAQUES. How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.</a>
<a id='line_2622'>  DUKE SENIOR. I like him very well.</a>
<a id='line_2623'>  TOUCHSTONE. God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I press in</a>
<a id='line_2624'>    here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear</a>
<a id='line_2625'>    and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A</a>
<a id='line_2626'>    poor virgin, sir, an ill-favour'd thing, sir, but mine own; a</a>
<a id='line_2627'>    poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will. Rich</a>
<a id='line_2628'>    honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house; as your pearl</a>
<a id='line_2629'>    in your foul oyster.</a>
<a id='line_2630'>  DUKE SENIOR. By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.</a>
<a id='line_2631'>  TOUCHSTONE. According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet</a>
<a id='line_2632'>    diseases.</a>
<a id='line_2633'>  JAQUES. But, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quarrel on</a>
<a id='line_2634'>    the seventh cause?</a>
<a id='line_2635'>  TOUCHSTONE. Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more</a>
<a id='line_2636'>    seeming, Audrey- as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain</a>
<a id='line_2637'>    courtier's beard; he sent me word, if I said his beard was not</a>
<a id='line_2638'>    cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is call'd the Retort</a>
<a id='line_2639'>    Courteous. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would</a>
<a id='line_2640'>    send me word he cut it to please himself. This is call'd the Quip</a>
<a id='line_2641'>    Modest. If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment.</a>
<a id='line_2642'>    This is call'd the Reply Churlish. If again it was not well cut,</a>
<a id='line_2643'>    he would answer I spake not true. This is call'd the Reproof</a>
<a id='line_2644'>    Valiant. If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie. This</a>
<a id='line_2645'>    is call'd the Countercheck Quarrelsome. And so to the Lie</a>
<a id='line_2646'>    Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.</a>
<a id='line_2647'>  JAQUES. And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?</a>
<a id='line_2648'>  TOUCHSTONE. I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor</a>
<a id='line_2649'>    he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur'd swords</a>
<a id='line_2650'>    and parted.</a>
<a id='line_2651'>  JAQUES. Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?</a>
<a id='line_2652'>  TOUCHSTONE. O, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have</a>
<a id='line_2653'>    books for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first,</a>
<a id='line_2654'>    the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the</a>
<a id='line_2655'>    Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the</a>
<a id='line_2656'>    Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance;</a>
<a id='line_2657'>    the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie</a>
<a id='line_2658'>    Direct; and you may avoid that too with an If. I knew when seven</a>
<a id='line_2659'>    justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were</a>
<a id='line_2660'>    met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as: 'If you</a>
<a id='line_2661'>    said so, then I said so.' And they shook hands, and swore</a>
<a id='line_2662'>    brothers. Your If is the only peace-maker; much virtue in If.</a>
<a id='line_2663'>  JAQUES. Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?</a>
<a id='line_2664'>    He's as good at any thing, and yet a fool.</a>
<a id='line_2665'>  DUKE SENIOR. He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the</a>

<a id='line_2743'>    Shall share the good of our returned fortune,</a>
<a id='line_2744'>    According to the measure of their states.</a>
<a id='line_2745'>    Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,</a>
<a id='line_2746'>    And fall into our rustic revelry.</a>
<a id='line_2747'>    Play, music; and you brides and bridegrooms all,</a>
<a id='line_2748'>    With measure heap'd in joy, to th' measures fall.</a>
<a id='line_2749'>  JAQUES. Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,</a>
<a id='line_2750'>    The Duke hath put on a religious life,</a>
<a id='line_2751'>    And thrown into neglect the pompous court.</a>
<a id='line_2752'>  JAQUES DE BOYS. He hath.</a>
<a id='line_2753'>  JAQUES. To him will I. Out of these convertites</a>
<a id='line_2754'>    There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.</a>
<a id='line_2755'>    [To DUKE] You to your former honour I bequeath;</a>
<a id='line_2756'>    Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.</a>
<a id='line_2757'>    [To ORLANDO] You to a love that your true faith doth merit;</a>
<a id='line_2758'>    [To OLIVER] You to your land, and love, and great allies</a>
<a id='line_2759'>    [To SILVIUS] You to a long and well-deserved bed;</a>
<a id='line_2760'>    [To TOUCHSTONE] And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage</a>
<a id='line_2761'>    Is but for two months victuall'd.- So to your pleasures;</a>
<a id='line_2762'>    I am for other than for dancing measures.</a>
<a id='line_2763'>  DUKE SENIOR. Stay, Jaques, stay.</a>
<a id='line_2764'>  JAQUES. To see no pastime I. What you would have</a>
<a id='line_2765'>    I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.               Exit</a>
<a id='line_2766'>  DUKE SENIOR. Proceed, proceed. We will begin these rites,</a>
<a id='line_2767'>    As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.    [A dance] Exeunt</a>
<a id='line_2768'></a>
<a id='line_2769'>EPILOGUE</a>
<a id='line_2770'>                           EPILOGUE.</a>
<a id='line_2771'>  ROSALIND. It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue; but</a>
<a id='line_2772'>    it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it</a>
<a id='line_2773'>    be true that good wine needs no bush, 'tis true that a good play</a>
<a id='line_2774'>    needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes; and</a>
<a id='line_2775'>    good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a</a>
<a id='line_2776'>    case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot</a>
<a id='line_2777'>    insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not</a>
<a id='line_2778'>    furnish'd like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My</a>
<a id='line_2779'>    way is to conjure you; and I'll begin with the women. I charge</a>
<a id='line_2780'>    you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of</a>
<a id='line_2781'>    this play as please you; and I charge you, O men, for the love</a>
<a id='line_2782'>    you bear to women- as I perceive by your simp'ring none of you</a>
<a id='line_2783'>    hates them- that between you and the women the play may please.</a>
<a id='line_2784'>    If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that</a>
<a id='line_2785'>    pleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that I defied</a>
<a id='line_2786'>    not; and, I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces,</a>
<a id='line_2787'>    or sweet breaths, will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy,</a>
<a id='line_2788'>    bid me farewell.</a>
