<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'>I.</a>
<a id='line_3'></a>
<a id='line_4'>Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,</a>
<a id='line_5'>'Gainst whom the world could not hold argument,</a>
<a id='line_6'>Persuade my heart to this false perjury?</a>
<a id='line_7'>Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.</a>
<a id='line_8'>A woman I forswore; but I will prove,</a>
<a id='line_9'>Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:</a>
<a id='line_10'>My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;</a>
<a id='line_11'>Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.</a>
<a id='line_12'>My vow was breath, and breath a vapour is;</a>
<a id='line_13'>Then, thou fair sun, that on this earth doth shine,</a>
<a id='line_14'>Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:</a>
<a id='line_15'>If broken, then it is no fault of mine.</a>
<a id='line_16'>  If by me broke, what fool is not so wise</a>
<a id='line_17'>  To break an oath, to win a paradise?</a>
<a id='line_18'></a>
<a id='line_19'>II.</a>
<a id='line_20'></a>
<a id='line_21'>Sweet Cytherea, sitting by a brook</a>
<a id='line_22'>With young Adonis, lovely, fresh, and green,</a>
<a id='line_23'>Did court the lad with many a lovely look,</a>
<a id='line_24'>Such looks as none could look but beauty's queen.</a>
<a id='line_25'>She told him stories to delight his ear;</a>
<a id='line_26'>She show'd him favours to allure his eye;</a>
<a id='line_27'>To win his heart, she touch'd him here and there:</a>
<a id='line_28'>Touches so soft still conquer chastity.</a>
<a id='line_29'>But whether unripe years did want conceit,</a>
<a id='line_30'>Or he refus'd to take her figur'd proffer,</a>
<a id='line_31'>The tender nibbler would not touch the bait,</a>
<a id='line_32'>But smile and jest at every gentle offer:</a>
<a id='line_33'>  Then fell she on her back, fair queen, and toward;</a>
<a id='line_34'>  He rose and ran away; ah, fool too froward!</a>
<a id='line_35'></a>
<a id='line_36'>III.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?</a>
<a id='line_39'>O never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd:</a>
<a id='line_40'>Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll constant prove;</a>
<a id='line_41'>Those thoughts, to me like oaks, to thee like osiers bow'd.</a>
<a id='line_42'>Study his bias leaves, and makes his book thine eyes,</a>
<a id='line_43'>Where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend.</a>
<a id='line_44'>If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;</a>
<a id='line_45'>Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend;</a>
<a id='line_46'>All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;</a>
<a id='line_47'>Which is to me some praise, that I thy parts admire:</a>
<a id='line_48'>Thy eye Jove's lightning seems, thy voice his dreadful thunder,</a>
<a id='line_49'>Which (not to anger bent) is music and sweet fire.</a>
<a id='line_50'>  Celestial as thou art, O do not love that wrong,</a>
<a id='line_51'>  To sing heavens' praise with such an earthly tongue.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>IV.</a>
<a id='line_54'></a>
<a id='line_55'>Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn,</a>
<a id='line_56'>And scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade,</a>
<a id='line_57'>When Cytherea, all in love forlorn,</a>
<a id='line_58'>A longing tarriance for Adonis made,</a>
<a id='line_59'>Under an osier growing by a brook,</a>
<a id='line_60'>A brook where Adon used to cool his spleen.</a>
<a id='line_61'>Hot was the day; she hotter that did look</a>
<a id='line_62'>For his approach, that often there had been.</a>
<a id='line_63'>Anon he comes, and throws his mantle by,</a>
<a id='line_64'>And stood stark naked on the brook's green brim;</a>
<a id='line_65'>The sun look'd on the world with glorious eye,</a>
<a id='line_66'>Yet not so wistly as this queen on him:</a>
<a id='line_67'>  He, spying her, bounc'd in, whereas he stood;</a>
<a id='line_68'>  O Jove, quoth she, why was not I a flood?</a>
<a id='line_69'></a>
<a id='line_70'>V.</a>
<a id='line_71'></a>
<a id='line_72'>Fair is my love, but not so fair as fickle;</a>
<a id='line_73'>Mild as a dove, but neither true nor trusty;</a>
<a id='line_74'>Brighter than glass, and yet, as glass is, brittle;</a>
<a id='line_75'>Softer than wax, and yet, as iron, rusty:</a>
<a id='line_76'>  A lily pale, with damask die to grace her,</a>
<a id='line_77'>  None fairer, nor none falser to deface her.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>Her lips to mine how often hath she join'd,</a>
<a id='line_80'>Between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing!</a>
<a id='line_81'>How many tales to please me hath she coin'd,</a>
<a id='line_82'>Dreading my love, the loss thereof still fearing!</a>
<a id='line_83'>  Yet in the midst of all her pure protestings,</a>
<a id='line_84'>  Her faith, her oaths, her tears, and all were jestings.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>She burn'd with love, as straw with fire flameth;</a>
<a id='line_87'>She burn'd out love, as soon as straw outburneth;</a>
<a id='line_88'>She fram'd the love, and yet she foil'd the framing;</a>
<a id='line_89'>She bade love last, and yet she fell a turning.</a>
<a id='line_90'>  Was this a lover, or a lecher whether?</a>
<a id='line_91'>  Bad in the best, though excellent in neither.</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>VI.</a>
<a id='line_94'></a>
<a id='line_95'>If music and sweet poetry agree,</a>
<a id='line_96'>As they must needs, the sister and the brother,</a>
<a id='line_97'>Then must the love be great 'twixt thee and me,</a>
<a id='line_98'>Because thou lovest the one, and I the other.</a>
<a id='line_99'>Dowland to thee is dear, whose heavenly touch</a>
<a id='line_100'>Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;</a>
<a id='line_101'>Spenser to me, whose deep conceit is such</a>
<a id='line_102'>As, passing all conceit, needs no defence.</a>
<a id='line_103'>Thou lov'st to hear the sweet melodious sound</a>
<a id='line_104'>That Phoebus' lute, the queen of music, makes;</a>
<a id='line_105'>And I in deep delight am chiefly drown'd</a>
<a id='line_106'>Whenas himself to singing he betakes.</a>
<a id='line_107'>  One god is god of both, as poets feign;</a>
<a id='line_108'>  One knight loves both, and both in thee remain.</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>
<a id='line_110'>VII.</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'>Fair was the morn when the fair queen of love,</a>
<a id='line_113'>    *     *     *     *     *     *</a>
<a id='line_114'>Paler for sorrow than her milk-white dove,</a>
<a id='line_115'>For Adon's sake, a youngster proud and wild;</a>
<a id='line_116'>Her stand she takes upon a steep-up hill:</a>
<a id='line_117'>Anon Adonis comes with horn and hounds;</a>
<a id='line_118'>She, silly queen, with more than love's good will,</a>
<a id='line_119'>Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds;</a>
<a id='line_120'>Once, quoth she, did I see a fair sweet youth</a>
<a id='line_121'>Here in these brakes deep-wounded with a boar,</a>
<a id='line_122'>Deep in the thigh, a spectacle of ruth!</a>
<a id='line_123'>See, in my thigh, quoth she, here was the sore.</a>
<a id='line_124'>  She showed hers: he saw more wounds than one,</a>
<a id='line_125'>  And blushing fled, and left her all alone.</a>
<a id='line_126'></a>
<a id='line_127'>VIII.</a>
<a id='line_128'></a>
<a id='line_129'>Sweet rose, fair flower, untimely pluck'd, soon vaded,</a>
<a id='line_130'>Pluck'd in the bud, and vaded in the spring!</a>
<a id='line_131'>Bright orient pearl, alack! too timely shaded!</a>
<a id='line_132'>Fair creature, kill'd too soon by death's sharp sting!</a>
<a id='line_133'>  Like a green plum that hangs upon a tree,</a>
<a id='line_134'>  And falls, through wind, before the fall should be.</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>I weep for thee, and yet no cause I have;</a>
<a id='line_137'>For why? thou left'st me nothing in thy will:</a>
<a id='line_138'>And yet thou left'st me more than I did crave;</a>
<a id='line_139'>For why? I craved nothing of thee still:</a>
<a id='line_140'>  O yes, dear friend, I pardon crave of thee,</a>
<a id='line_141'>  Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me.</a>
<a id='line_142'></a>
<a id='line_143'>IX.</a>
<a id='line_144'></a>
<a id='line_145'>Venus, with young Adonis sitting by her,</a>
<a id='line_146'>Under a myrtle shade, began to woo him:</a>
<a id='line_147'>She told the youngling how god Mars did try her,</a>
<a id='line_148'>And as he fell to her, so fell she to him.</a>
<a id='line_149'>Even thus, quoth she, the warlike god embrac'd me,</a>
<a id='line_150'>And then she clipp'd Adonis in her arms;</a>
<a id='line_151'>Even thus, quoth she, the warlike god unlaced me;</a>
<a id='line_152'>As if the boy should use like loving charms;</a>
<a id='line_153'>Even thus, quoth she, he seized on my lips,</a>
<a id='line_154'>And with her lips on his did act the seizure;</a>
<a id='line_155'>And as she fetched breath, away he skips,</a>
<a id='line_156'>And would not take her meaning nor her pleasure.</a>
<a id='line_157'>  Ah! that I had my lady at this bay,</a>
<a id='line_158'>  To kiss and clip me till I run away!</a>
<a id='line_159'></a>
<a id='line_160'>X.</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>   Crabbed age and youth</a>
<a id='line_163'>     Cannot live together</a>
<a id='line_164'>   Youth is full of pleasance,</a>
<a id='line_165'>     Age is full of care;</a>
<a id='line_166'>   Youth like summer morn,</a>
<a id='line_167'>     Age like winter weather;</a>
<a id='line_168'>   Youth like summer brave,</a>
<a id='line_169'>     Age like winter bare;</a>
<a id='line_170'>   Youth is full of sport,</a>
<a id='line_171'>   Age's breath is short;</a>
<a id='line_172'>     Youth is nimble, age is lame;</a>
<a id='line_173'>   Youth is hot and bold,</a>
<a id='line_174'>   Age is weak and cold;</a>
<a id='line_175'>     Youth is wild, and age is tame.</a>
<a id='line_176'>   Age, I do abhor thee;</a>
<a id='line_177'>   Youth, I do adore thee;</a>
<a id='line_178'>     O, my love, my love is young!</a>
<a id='line_179'>   Age, I do defy thee;</a>
<a id='line_180'>   O, sweet shepherd, hie thee,</a>
<a id='line_181'>   For methinks thou stay'st too long.</a>
<a id='line_182'></a>
<a id='line_183'>XI.</a>
<a id='line_184'></a>
<a id='line_185'>Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good,</a>
<a id='line_186'>A shining gloss that vadeth suddenly;</a>
<a id='line_187'>A flower that dies when first it 'gins to bud;</a>
<a id='line_188'>A brittle glass, that's broken presently:</a>
<a id='line_189'>  A doubtful good, a gloss, a glass, a flower,</a>
<a id='line_190'>  Lost, vaded, broken, dead within an hour.</a>
<a id='line_191'></a>
<a id='line_192'>And as goods lost are seld or never found,</a>
<a id='line_193'>As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh,</a>
<a id='line_194'>As flowers dead lie wither'd on the ground,</a>
<a id='line_195'>As broken glass no cement can redress,</a>
<a id='line_196'>  So beauty blemish'd once, for ever's lost,</a>
<a id='line_197'>  In spite of physic, painting, pain and cost.</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>XII.</a>
<a id='line_200'></a>
<a id='line_201'>Good night, good rest.  Ah! neither be my share:</a>
<a id='line_202'>She bade good night that kept my rest away;</a>
<a id='line_203'>And daff'd me to a cabin hang'd with care,</a>
<a id='line_204'>To descant on the doubts of my decay.</a>
<a id='line_205'> Farewell, quoth she, and come again tomorrow:</a>
<a id='line_206'> Fare well I could not, for I supp'd with sorrow;</a>
<a id='line_207'></a>
<a id='line_208'>Yet at my parting sweetly did she smile,</a>
<a id='line_209'>In scorn or friendship, nill I construe whether:</a>
<a id='line_210'>'T may be, she joy'd to jest at my exile,</a>
<a id='line_211'>'T may be, again to make me wander thither:</a>
<a id='line_212'>  'Wander,' a word for shadows like myself,</a>
<a id='line_213'>  As take the pain, but cannot pluck the pelf.</a>
<a id='line_214'></a>
<a id='line_215'>XIII.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!</a>
<a id='line_218'>My heart doth charge the watch; the morning rise</a>
<a id='line_219'>Doth cite each moving sense from idle rest.</a>
<a id='line_220'>Not daring trust the office of mine eyes,</a>
<a id='line_221'>  While Philomela sits and sings, I sit and mark,</a>
<a id='line_222'>  And wish her lays were tuned like the lark;</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>For she doth welcome daylight with her ditty,</a>
<a id='line_225'>And drives away dark dismal-dreaming night:</a>
<a id='line_226'>The night so pack'd, I post unto my pretty;</a>
<a id='line_227'>Heart hath his hope, and eyes their wished sight;</a>
<a id='line_228'>  Sorrow chang'd to solace, solace mix'd with sorrow;</a>
<a id='line_229'>  For why, she sigh'd and bade me come tomorrow.</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>Were I with her, the night would post too soon;</a>
<a id='line_232'>But now are minutes added to the hours;</a>
<a id='line_233'>To spite me now, each minute seems a moon;</a>
<a id='line_234'>Yet not for me, shine sun to succour flowers!</a>
<a id='line_235'>  Pack night, peep day; good day, of night now borrow:</a>
<a id='line_236'>  Short, night, to-night, and length thyself to-morrow.</a>
