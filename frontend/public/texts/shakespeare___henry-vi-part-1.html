<a id='line_54'></a>
<a id='line_55'>Westminster Abbey</a>
<a id='line_56'></a>
<a id='line_57'>Dead March. Enter the funeral of KING HENRY THE FIFTH, attended on by</a>
<a id='line_58'>the DUKE OF BEDFORD, Regent of France, the DUKE OF GLOUCESTER,</a>
<a id='line_59'>Protector, the DUKE OF EXETER, the EARL OF WARWICK, the BISHOP OF</a>
<a id='line_60'>WINCHESTER</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>  BEDFORD. Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to</a>
<a id='line_63'>    night! Comets, importing change of times and states,</a>
<a id='line_64'>    Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky</a>
<a id='line_65'>    And with them scourge the bad revolting stars</a>
<a id='line_66'>    That have consented unto Henry's death!</a>
<a id='line_67'>    King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!</a>
<a id='line_68'>    England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.</a>
<a id='line_69'>  GLOUCESTER. England ne'er had a king until his time.</a>
<a id='line_70'>    Virtue he had, deserving to command;</a>
<a id='line_71'>    His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams;</a>
<a id='line_72'>    His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;</a>
<a id='line_73'>    His sparkling eyes, replete with wrathful fire,</a>
<a id='line_74'>    More dazzled and drove back his enemies</a>
<a id='line_75'>    Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.</a>
<a id='line_76'>    What should I say? His deeds exceed all speech:</a>
<a id='line_77'>    He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.</a>
<a id='line_78'>  EXETER. We mourn in black; why mourn we not in blood?</a>
<a id='line_79'>    Henry is dead and never shall revive.</a>
<a id='line_80'>    Upon a wooden coffin we attend;</a>
<a id='line_81'>    And death's dishonourable victory</a>
<a id='line_82'>    We with our stately presence glorify,</a>
<a id='line_83'>    Like captives bound to a triumphant car.</a>
<a id='line_84'>    What! shall we curse the planets of mishap</a>
<a id='line_85'>    That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?</a>
<a id='line_86'>    Or shall we think the subtle-witted French</a>
<a id='line_87'>    Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,</a>
<a id='line_88'>    By magic verses have contriv'd his end?</a>
<a id='line_89'>  WINCHESTER. He was a king bless'd of the King of kings;</a>
<a id='line_90'>    Unto the French the dreadful judgment-day</a>
<a id='line_91'>    So dreadful will not be as was his sight.</a>
<a id='line_92'>    The battles of the Lord of Hosts he fought;</a>
<a id='line_93'>    The Church's prayers made him so prosperous.</a>
<a id='line_94'>  GLOUCESTER. The Church! Where is it? Had not churchmen</a>
<a id='line_95'>    pray'd,</a>
<a id='line_96'>    His thread of life had not so soon decay'd.</a>
<a id='line_97'>    None do you like but an effeminate prince,</a>
<a id='line_98'>    Whom like a school-boy you may overawe.</a>
<a id='line_99'>  WINCHESTER. Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art</a>
<a id='line_100'>    Protector</a>
<a id='line_101'>    And lookest to command the Prince and realm.</a>
<a id='line_102'>    Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe</a>
<a id='line_103'>    More than God or religious churchmen may.</a>
<a id='line_104'>  GLOUCESTER. Name not religion, for thou lov'st the flesh;</a>
<a id='line_105'>    And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st,</a>
<a id='line_106'>    Except it be to pray against thy foes.</a>
<a id='line_107'>  BEDFORD. Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace;</a>
<a id='line_108'>    Let's to the altar. Heralds, wait on us.</a>
<a id='line_109'>    Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms,</a>
<a id='line_110'>    Since arms avail not, now that Henry's dead.</a>
<a id='line_111'>    Posterity, await for wretched years,</a>
<a id='line_112'>    When at their mothers' moist'ned eyes babes shall suck,</a>
<a id='line_113'>    Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,</a>
<a id='line_114'>    And none but women left to wail the dead.</a>
<a id='line_115'>  HENRY the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:</a>
<a id='line_116'>    Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,</a>
<a id='line_117'>    Combat with adverse planets in the heavens.</a>
<a id='line_118'>    A far more glorious star thy soul will make</a>
<a id='line_119'>    Than Julius Caesar or bright</a>
<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>                          Enter a MESSENGER</a>
<a id='line_122'></a>
<a id='line_123'>  MESSENGER. My honourable lords, health to you all!</a>
<a id='line_124'>    Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,</a>
<a id='line_125'>    Of loss, of slaughter, and discomfiture:</a>
<a id='line_126'>    Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,</a>
<a id='line_127'>    Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.</a>
<a id='line_128'>  BEDFORD. What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?</a>
<a id='line_129'>    Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns</a>
<a id='line_130'>    Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.</a>
<a id='line_131'>  GLOUCESTER. Is Paris lost? Is Rouen yielded up?</a>
<a id='line_132'>    If Henry were recall'd to life again,</a>
<a id='line_133'>    These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.</a>
<a id='line_134'>  EXETER. How were they lost? What treachery was us'd?</a>
<a id='line_135'>  MESSENGER. No treachery, but want of men and money.</a>
<a id='line_136'>    Amongst the soldiers this is muttered</a>
<a id='line_137'>    That here you maintain several factions;</a>
<a id='line_138'>    And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,</a>
<a id='line_139'>    You are disputing of your generals:</a>
<a id='line_140'>    One would have ling'ring wars, with little cost;</a>
<a id='line_141'>    Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;</a>
<a id='line_142'>    A third thinks, without expense at all,</a>
<a id='line_143'>    By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.</a>
<a id='line_144'>    Awake, awake, English nobility!</a>
<a id='line_145'>    Let not sloth dim your honours, new-begot.</a>
<a id='line_146'>    Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;</a>
<a id='line_147'>    Of England's coat one half is cut away.</a>
<a id='line_148'>  EXETER. Were our tears wanting to this funeral,</a>
<a id='line_149'>    These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.</a>
<a id='line_150'>  BEDFORD. Me they concern; Regent I am of France.</a>
<a id='line_151'>    Give me my steeled coat; I'll fight for France.</a>
<a id='line_152'>    Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!</a>
<a id='line_153'>    Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,</a>
<a id='line_154'>    To weep their intermissive miseries.</a>
<a id='line_155'></a>
<a id='line_156'>                   Enter a second MESSENGER</a>
<a id='line_157'></a>
<a id='line_158'>  SECOND MESSENGER. Lords, view these letters full of bad</a>
<a id='line_159'>    mischance.</a>
<a id='line_160'>    France is revolted from the English quite,</a>
<a id='line_161'>    Except some petty towns of no import.</a>
<a id='line_162'>    The Dauphin Charles is crowned king in Rheims;</a>
<a id='line_163'>    The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;</a>
<a id='line_164'>    Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;</a>
<a id='line_165'>    The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.</a>
<a id='line_166'>  EXETER. The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!</a>
<a id='line_167'>    O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?</a>
<a id='line_168'>  GLOUCESTER. We will not fly but to our enemies' throats.</a>
<a id='line_169'>    Bedford, if thou be slack I'll fight it out.</a>
<a id='line_170'>  BEDFORD. Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?</a>
<a id='line_171'>    An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,</a>
<a id='line_172'>    Wherewith already France is overrun.</a>
<a id='line_173'></a>
<a id='line_174'>                   Enter a third MESSENGER</a>
<a id='line_175'></a>
<a id='line_176'>  THIRD MESSENGER. My gracious lords, to add to your</a>
<a id='line_177'>    laments,</a>
<a id='line_178'>    Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,</a>
<a id='line_179'>    I must inform you of a dismal fight</a>
<a id='line_180'>    Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.</a>
<a id='line_181'>  WINCHESTER. What! Wherein Talbot overcame? Is't so?</a>
<a id='line_182'>  THIRD MESSENGER. O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was</a>
<a id='line_183'>    o'erthrown.</a>
<a id='line_184'>    The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.</a>
<a id='line_185'>    The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,</a>
<a id='line_186'>    Retiring from the siege of Orleans,</a>
<a id='line_187'>    Having full scarce six thousand in his troop,</a>
<a id='line_188'>    By three and twenty thousand of the French</a>
<a id='line_189'>    Was round encompassed and set upon.</a>
<a id='line_190'>    No leisure had he to enrank his men;</a>
<a id='line_191'>    He wanted pikes to set before his archers;</a>
<a id='line_192'>    Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges</a>
<a id='line_193'>    They pitched in the ground confusedly</a>
<a id='line_194'>    To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.</a>
<a id='line_195'>    More than three hours the fight continued;</a>
<a id='line_196'>    Where valiant Talbot, above human thought,</a>
<a id='line_197'>    Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:</a>
<a id='line_198'>    Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;</a>
<a id='line_199'>    Here, there, and everywhere, enrag'd he slew</a>
<a id='line_200'>    The French exclaim'd the devil was in arms;</a>
<a id='line_201'>    All the whole army stood agaz'd on him.</a>
<a id='line_202'>    His soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit,</a>
<a id='line_203'>    'A Talbot! a Talbot!' cried out amain,</a>
<a id='line_204'>    And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.</a>
<a id='line_205'>    Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up</a>
<a id='line_206'>    If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward.</a>
<a id='line_207'>    He, being in the vaward plac'd behind</a>
<a id='line_208'>    With purpose to relieve and follow them-</a>
<a id='line_209'>    Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke;</a>
<a id='line_210'>    Hence grew the general wreck and massacre.</a>
<a id='line_211'>    Enclosed were they with their enemies.</a>
<a id='line_212'>    A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,</a>
<a id='line_213'>    Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back;</a>
<a id='line_214'>    Whom all France, with their chief assembled strength,</a>
<a id='line_215'>    Durst not presume to look once in the face.</a>
<a id='line_216'>  BEDFORD. Is Talbot slain? Then I will slay myself,</a>
<a id='line_217'>    For living idly here in pomp and ease,</a>
<a id='line_218'>    Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,</a>
<a id='line_219'>    Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.</a>
<a id='line_220'>  THIRD MESSENGER. O no, he lives, but is took prisoner,</a>
<a id='line_221'>    And Lord Scales with him, and Lord Hungerford;</a>
<a id='line_222'>    Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.</a>
<a id='line_223'>  BEDFORD. His ransom there is none but I shall pay.</a>
<a id='line_224'>    I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne;</a>
<a id='line_225'>    His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;</a>
<a id='line_226'>    Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.</a>
<a id='line_227'>    Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;</a>
<a id='line_228'>    Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make</a>
<a id='line_229'>    To keep our great Saint George's feast withal.</a>
<a id='line_230'>    Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,</a>
<a id='line_231'>    Whose bloody deeds shall make an Europe quake.</a>
<a id='line_232'>  THIRD MESSENGER. So you had need; for Orleans is besieg'd;</a>
<a id='line_233'>    The English army is grown weak and faint;</a>
<a id='line_234'>    The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply</a>
<a id='line_235'>    And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,</a>
<a id='line_236'>    Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.</a>
<a id='line_237'>  EXETER. Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,</a>
<a id='line_238'>    Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,</a>
<a id='line_239'>    Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.</a>
<a id='line_240'>  BEDFORD. I do remember it, and here take my leave</a>
<a id='line_241'>    To go about my preparation.                             Exit</a>
<a id='line_242'>  GLOUCESTER. I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can</a>
<a id='line_243'>    To view th' artillery and munition;</a>
<a id='line_244'>    And then I will proclaim young Henry king.              Exit</a>
<a id='line_245'>  EXETER. To Eltham will I, where the young King is,</a>
<a id='line_246'>    Being ordain'd his special governor;</a>
<a id='line_247'>    And for his safety there I'll best devise.              Exit</a>
<a id='line_248'>  WINCHESTER.  [Aside]  Each hath his place and function to</a>
<a id='line_249'>    attend:</a>
<a id='line_250'>    I am left out; for me nothing remains.</a>
<a id='line_251'>    But long I will not be Jack out of office.</a>
<a id='line_252'>    The King from Eltham I intend to steal,</a>
<a id='line_253'>    And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.             Exeunt</a>
<a id='line_254'></a>
<a id='line_255'>                          SCENE 2.</a>
<a id='line_256'></a>
<a id='line_257'>                  France. Before Orleans</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>      Sound a flourish. Enter CHARLES THE DAUPHIN, ALENCON,</a>
<a id='line_260'>           and REIGNIER, marching with drum and soldiers</a>
<a id='line_261'></a>
<a id='line_262'>  CHARLES. Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens</a>
<a id='line_263'>    So in the earth, to this day is not known.</a>
<a id='line_264'>    Late did he shine upon the English side;</a>
<a id='line_265'>    Now we are victors, upon us he smiles.</a>
<a id='line_266'>    What towns of any moment but we have?</a>
<a id='line_267'>    At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;</a>
<a id='line_268'>    Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,</a>
<a id='line_269'>    Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.</a>
<a id='line_270'>  ALENCON. They want their porridge and their fat bull</a>
<a id='line_271'>    beeves.</a>
<a id='line_272'>    Either they must be dieted like mules</a>
<a id='line_273'>    And have their provender tied to their mouths,</a>
<a id='line_274'>    Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.</a>
<a id='line_275'>  REIGNIER. Let's raise the siege. Why live we idly here?</a>
<a id='line_276'>    Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear;</a>
<a id='line_277'>    Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury,</a>
<a id='line_278'>    And he may well in fretting spend his gall</a>
<a id='line_279'>    Nor men nor money hath he to make war.</a>
<a id='line_280'>  CHARLES. Sound, sound alarum; we will rush on them.</a>
<a id='line_281'>    Now for the honour of the forlorn French!</a>
<a id='line_282'>    Him I forgive my death that killeth me,</a>
<a id='line_283'>    When he sees me go back one foot or flee.             Exeunt</a>
<a id='line_284'></a>
<a id='line_285'>       Here alarum. They are beaten hack by the English, with</a>
<a id='line_286'>         great loss. Re-enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and REIGNIER</a>
<a id='line_287'></a>
<a id='line_288'>  CHARLES. Who ever saw the like? What men have I!</a>
<a id='line_289'>    Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled</a>
<a id='line_290'>    But that they left me midst my enemies.</a>
<a id='line_291'>  REIGNIER. Salisbury is a desperate homicide;</a>
<a id='line_292'>    He fighteth as one weary of his life.</a>
<a id='line_293'>    The other lords, like lions wanting food,</a>
<a id='line_294'>    Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.</a>
<a id='line_295'>  ALENCON. Froissart, a countryman of ours, records</a>
<a id='line_296'>    England all Olivers and Rowlands bred</a>
<a id='line_297'>    During the time Edward the Third did reign.</a>
<a id='line_298'>    More truly now may this be verified;</a>
<a id='line_299'>    For none but Samsons and Goliases</a>
<a id='line_300'>    It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!</a>
<a id='line_301'>    Lean raw-bon'd rascals! Who would e'er suppose</a>
<a id='line_302'>    They had such courage and audacity?</a>
<a id='line_303'>  CHARLES. Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd</a>

<a id='line_325'>    The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,</a>

<a id='line_376'>    Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.</a>
<a id='line_377'>  CHARLES. Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman.</a>

<a id='line_393'>  CHARLES. Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.</a>
<a id='line_394'>  REIGNIER. My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.</a>

<a id='line_403'>    Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.</a>
<a id='line_404'>  CHARLES. What she says I'll confirm; we'll fight it out.</a>

<a id='line_592'>  TALBOT. The Earl of Bedford had a prisoner</a>
<a id='line_593'>    Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;</a>
<a id='line_594'>    For him was I exchang'd and ransomed.</a>

<a id='line_599'>    In fine, redeem'd I was as I desir'd.</a>
<a id='line_600'>    But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart</a>
<a id='line_601'>    Whom with my bare fists I would execute,</a>

<a id='line_603'>  SALISBURY. Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.</a>
<a id='line_604'>  TALBOT. With scoffs, and scorns, and contumelious taunts,</a>

<a id='line_607'>    Here, said they, is the terror of the French,</a>
<a id='line_608'>    The scarecrow that affrights our children so.</a>
<a id='line_609'>    Then broke I from the officers that led me,</a>
<a id='line_610'>    And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground</a>
<a id='line_611'>    To hurl at the beholders of my shame;</a>
<a id='line_612'>    My grisly countenance made others fly;</a>
<a id='line_613'>    None durst come near for fear of sudden death.</a>
<a id='line_614'>    In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;</a>
<a id='line_615'>    So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread</a>
<a id='line_616'>    That they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel</a>
<a id='line_617'>    And spurn in pieces posts of adamant;</a>
<a id='line_618'>    Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had</a>

<a id='line_883'>  PUCELLE. Question, my lords, no further of the case,</a>

<a id='line_886'>    And now there rests no other shift but this</a>
<a id='line_887'>    To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispers'd,</a>

<a id='line_956'>    You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.</a>

<a id='line_1011'>  TALBOT. Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,</a>

<a id='line_1020'>    Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,</a>

<a id='line_1030'>  TALBOT. I laugh to see your ladyship so fond</a>
<a id='line_1031'>    To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow</a>
<a id='line_1032'>    Whereon to practise your severity.</a>
<a id='line_1033'>  COUNTESS. Why, art not thou the man?</a>
<a id='line_1034'>  TALBOT. I am indeed.</a>
<a id='line_1035'>  COUNTESS. Then have I substance too.</a>
<a id='line_1036'>  TALBOT. No, no, I am but shadow of myself.</a>
<a id='line_1037'>    You are deceiv'd, my substance is not here;</a>

<a id='line_1050'></a>
<a id='line_1051'>    How say you, madam? Are you now persuaded</a>
<a id='line_1052'>    That Talbot is but shadow of himself?</a>
<a id='line_1053'>    These are his substance, sinews, arms, and strength,</a>
<a id='line_1054'>    With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,</a>
<a id='line_1055'>    Razeth your cities, and subverts your towns,</a>
<a id='line_1056'>    And in a moment makes them desolate.</a>
<a id='line_1057'>  COUNTESS. Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse.</a>
<a id='line_1058'>    I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited,</a>
<a id='line_1059'>    And more than may be gathered by thy shape.</a>
<a id='line_1060'>    Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath,</a>

<a id='line_1082'>    silence?</a>
<a id='line_1083'>    Dare no man answer in a case of truth?</a>
<a id='line_1084'>  SUFFOLK. Within the Temple Hall we were too loud;</a>
<a id='line_1085'>    The garden here is more convenient.</a>

<a id='line_1087'>    Or else was wrangling Somerset in th' error?</a>
<a id='line_1088'>  SUFFOLK. Faith, I have been a truant in the law</a>
<a id='line_1089'>    And never yet could frame my will to it;</a>
<a id='line_1090'>    And therefore frame the law unto my will.</a>
<a id='line_1091'>  SOMERSET. Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.</a>
<a id='line_1092'>  WARWICK. Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch;</a>
<a id='line_1093'>    Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;</a>
<a id='line_1094'>    Between two blades, which bears the better temper;</a>

<a id='line_1096'>    Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye</a>
<a id='line_1097'>    I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment;</a>

<a id='line_1099'>    Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.</a>
<a id='line_1100'>  PLANTAGENET. Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:</a>
<a id='line_1101'>    The truth appears so naked on my side</a>
<a id='line_1102'>    That any purblind eye may find it out.</a>
<a id='line_1103'>  SOMERSET. And on my side it is so well apparell'd,</a>
<a id='line_1104'>    So clear, so shining, and so evident,</a>
<a id='line_1105'>    That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.</a>
<a id='line_1106'>  PLANTAGENET. Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,</a>
<a id='line_1107'>    In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts.</a>
<a id='line_1108'>    Let him that is a true-born gentleman</a>

<a id='line_1114'>    Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.</a>
<a id='line_1115'>  WARWICK. I love no colours; and, without all colour</a>
<a id='line_1116'>    Of base insinuating flattery,</a>
<a id='line_1117'>    I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.</a>
<a id='line_1118'>  SUFFOLK. I pluck this red rose with young Somerset,</a>

<a id='line_1120'>  VERNON. Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more</a>

<a id='line_1144'>  PLANTAGENET. Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our</a>

<a id='line_1146'>    For pale they look with fear, as witnessing</a>
<a id='line_1147'>    The truth on our side.</a>
<a id='line_1148'>  SOMERSET. No, Plantagenet,</a>
<a id='line_1149'>    'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks</a>
<a id='line_1150'>    Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,</a>
<a id='line_1151'>    And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.</a>
<a id='line_1152'>  PLANTAGENET. Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?</a>
<a id='line_1153'>  SOMERSET. Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?</a>
<a id='line_1154'>  PLANTAGENET. Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;</a>
<a id='line_1155'>    Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.</a>
<a id='line_1156'>  SOMERSET. Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,</a>
<a id='line_1157'>    That shall maintain what I have said is true,</a>
<a id='line_1158'>    Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.</a>
<a id='line_1159'>  PLANTAGENET. Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,</a>

<a id='line_1310'>    But mark: as in this haughty great attempt</a>
<a id='line_1311'>    They laboured to plant the rightful heir,</a>
<a id='line_1312'>    I lost my liberty, and they their lives.</a>
<a id='line_1313'>    Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,</a>
<a id='line_1314'>    Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,</a>

<a id='line_1321'>    But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl,</a>

<a id='line_1329'>  PLANTAGENET. Thy grave admonishments prevail with me.</a>
<a id='line_1330'>    But yet methinks my father's execution</a>
<a id='line_1331'>    Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.</a>

<a id='line_1343'>    Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;</a>

<a id='line_1345'>    And so, farewell; and fair be all thy hopes,</a>

<a id='line_2849'>  SUFFOLK. Sweet madam, give me hearing in a cause</a>
<a id='line_2850'>  MARGARET.  [Aside]  Tush! women have been captivate ere</a>
<a id='line_2851'>    now.</a>
<a id='line_2852'>  SUFFOLK. Lady, wherefore talk you so?</a>
<a id='line_2853'>  MARGARET. I cry you mercy, 'tis but quid for quo.</a>
<a id='line_2854'>  SUFFOLK. Say, gentle Princess, would you not suppose</a>
<a id='line_2855'>    Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?</a>
<a id='line_2856'>  MARGARET. To be a queen in bondage is more vile</a>
<a id='line_2857'>    Than is a slave in base servility;</a>
<a id='line_2858'>    For princes should be free.</a>
<a id='line_2859'>  SUFFOLK. And so shall you,</a>
<a id='line_2860'>    If happy England's royal king be free.</a>
<a id='line_2861'>  MARGARET. Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?</a>
<a id='line_2862'>  SUFFOLK. I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,</a>
<a id='line_2863'>    To put a golden sceptre in thy hand</a>
<a id='line_2864'>    And set a precious crown upon thy head,</a>
<a id='line_2865'>    If thou wilt condescend to be my-</a>
<a id='line_2866'>  MARGARET. What?</a>
<a id='line_2867'>  SUFFOLK. His love.</a>
<a id='line_2868'>  MARGARET. I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.</a>
<a id='line_2869'>  SUFFOLK. No, gentle madam; I unworthy am</a>
<a id='line_2870'>    To woo so fair a dame to be his wife</a>
<a id='line_2871'>    And have no portion in the choice myself.</a>
<a id='line_2872'>    How say you, madam? Are ye so content?</a>
<a id='line_2873'>  MARGARET. An if my father please, I am content.</a>
<a id='line_2874'>  SUFFOLK. Then call our captains and our colours forth!</a>
<a id='line_2875'>    And, madam, at your father's castle walls</a>
<a id='line_2876'>    We'll crave a parley to confer with him.</a>
<a id='line_2877'></a>
<a id='line_2878'>           Sound a parley. Enter REIGNIER on the walls</a>
<a id='line_2879'></a>
<a id='line_2880'>    See, Reignier, see, thy daughter prisoner!</a>
<a id='line_2881'>  REIGNIER. To whom?</a>
<a id='line_2882'>  SUFFOLK. To me.</a>
<a id='line_2883'>  REIGNIER. Suffolk, what remedy?</a>
<a id='line_2884'>    I am a soldier and unapt to weep</a>
<a id='line_2885'>    Or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness.</a>
<a id='line_2886'>  SUFFOLK. Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2887'>    Consent, and for thy honour give consent,</a>
<a id='line_2888'>    Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king,</a>
<a id='line_2889'>    Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto;</a>
<a id='line_2890'>    And this her easy-held imprisonment</a>
<a id='line_2891'>    Hath gain'd thy daughter princely liberty.</a>
<a id='line_2892'>  REIGNIER. Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?</a>
<a id='line_2893'>  SUFFOLK. Fair Margaret knows</a>
<a id='line_2894'>    That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign.</a>
<a id='line_2895'>  REIGNIER. Upon thy princely warrant I descend</a>
<a id='line_2896'>    To give thee answer of thy just demand.</a>
<a id='line_2897'>                                    Exit REIGNIER from the walls</a>
<a id='line_2898'>  SUFFOLK. And here I will expect thy coming.</a>
<a id='line_2899'></a>
<a id='line_2900'>                Trumpets sound. Enter REIGNIER below</a>
<a id='line_2901'></a>
<a id='line_2902'>  REIGNIER. Welcome, brave Earl, into our territories;</a>
<a id='line_2903'>    Command in Anjou what your Honour pleases.</a>
<a id='line_2904'>  SUFFOLK. Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,</a>
<a id='line_2905'>    Fit to be made companion with a king.</a>
<a id='line_2906'>    What answer makes your Grace unto my suit?</a>
<a id='line_2907'>  REIGNIER. Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth</a>
<a id='line_2908'>    To be the princely bride of such a lord,</a>
<a id='line_2909'>    Upon condition I may quietly</a>
<a id='line_2910'>    Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,</a>
<a id='line_2911'>    Free from oppression or the stroke of war,</a>
<a id='line_2912'>    My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.</a>
<a id='line_2913'>  SUFFOLK. That is her ransom; I deliver her.</a>
<a id='line_2914'>    And those two counties I will undertake</a>
<a id='line_2915'>    Your Grace shall well and quietly enjoy.</a>
<a id='line_2916'>  REIGNIER. And I again, in Henry's royal name,</a>
<a id='line_2917'>    As deputy unto that gracious king,</a>
<a id='line_2918'>    Give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith.</a>
<a id='line_2919'>  SUFFOLK. Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,</a>
<a id='line_2920'>    Because this is in traffic of a king.</a>
<a id='line_2921'>    [Aside]  And yet, methinks, I could be well content</a>
<a id='line_2922'>    To be mine own attorney in this case.</a>
<a id='line_2923'>    I'll over then to England with this news,</a>
<a id='line_2924'>    And make this marriage to be solemniz'd.</a>
<a id='line_2925'>    So, farewell, Reignier. Set this diamond safe</a>
<a id='line_2926'>    In golden palaces, as it becomes.</a>
<a id='line_2927'>  REIGNIER. I do embrace thee as I would embrace</a>
<a id='line_2928'>    The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here.</a>
<a id='line_2929'>  MARGARET. Farewell, my lord. Good wishes, praise, and</a>
<a id='line_2930'>    prayers,</a>
<a id='line_2931'>    Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.          [She is going]</a>
<a id='line_2932'>  SUFFOLK. Farewell, sweet madam. But hark you, Margaret</a>
<a id='line_2933'>    No princely commendations to my king?</a>
<a id='line_2934'>  MARGARET. Such commendations as becomes a maid,</a>
<a id='line_2935'>    A virgin, and his servant, say to him.</a>
<a id='line_2936'>  SUFFOLK. Words sweetly plac'd and modestly directed.</a>
<a id='line_2937'>    But, madam, I must trouble you again</a>
<a id='line_2938'>    No loving token to his Majesty?</a>
<a id='line_2939'>  MARGARET. Yes, my good lord: a pure unspotted heart,</a>
<a id='line_2940'>    Never yet taint with love, I send the King.</a>
<a id='line_2941'>  SUFFOLK. And this withal.                         [Kisses her]</a>
<a id='line_2942'>  MARGARET. That for thyself, I will not so presume</a>
<a id='line_2943'>    To send such peevish tokens to a king.</a>
<a id='line_2944'>                                    Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET</a>
<a id='line_2945'>  SUFFOLK. O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay;</a>
<a id='line_2946'>    Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth:</a>
<a id='line_2947'>    There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.</a>
<a id='line_2948'>    Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise.</a>
<a id='line_2949'>    Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,</a>
<a id='line_2950'>    And natural graces that extinguish art;</a>
<a id='line_2951'>    Repeat their semblance often on the seas,</a>
<a id='line_2952'>    That, when thou com'st to kneel at Henry's feet,</a>
<a id='line_2953'>    Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.         Exit</a>

<a id='line_2957'>                  Camp of the DUKE OF YORK in Anjou</a>
<a id='line_2958'></a>
<a id='line_2959'>                   Enter YORK, WARWICK, and others</a>
<a id='line_2960'>  YORK. Bring forth that sorceress, condemn'd to burn.</a>
<a id='line_2961'></a>
<a id='line_2962'>              Enter LA PUCELLE, guarded, and a SHEPHERD</a>
<a id='line_2963'></a>
<a id='line_2964'>  SHEPHERD. Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!</a>
<a id='line_2965'>    Have I sought every country far and near,</a>
<a id='line_2966'>    And, now it is my chance to find thee out,</a>
<a id='line_2967'>    Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?</a>
<a id='line_2968'>    Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I'll die with thee!</a>
<a id='line_2969'>  PUCELLE. Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!</a>
<a id='line_2970'>    I am descended of a gentler blood;</a>
<a id='line_2971'>    Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.</a>
<a id='line_2972'>  SHEPHERD. Out, out! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so;</a>
<a id='line_2973'>    I did beget her, all the parish knows.</a>
<a id='line_2974'>    Her mother liveth yet, can testify</a>
<a id='line_2975'>    She was the first fruit of my bach'lorship.</a>
<a id='line_2976'>  WARWICK. Graceless, wilt thou deny thy parentage?</a>
<a id='line_2977'>  YORK. This argues what her kind of life hath been-</a>
<a id='line_2978'>    Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes.</a>
<a id='line_2979'>  SHEPHERD. Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!</a>
<a id='line_2980'>    God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;</a>
<a id='line_2981'>    And for thy sake have I shed many a tear.</a>
<a id='line_2982'>    Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.</a>
<a id='line_2983'>  PUCELLE. Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man</a>
<a id='line_2984'>    Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.</a>
<a id='line_2985'>  SHEPHERD. 'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest</a>
<a id='line_2986'>    The morn that I was wedded to her mother.</a>
<a id='line_2987'>    Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.</a>
<a id='line_2988'>    Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time</a>
<a id='line_2989'>    Of thy nativity. I would the milk</a>
<a id='line_2990'>    Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast</a>
<a id='line_2991'>    Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake.</a>
<a id='line_2992'>    Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs afield,</a>
<a id='line_2993'>    I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee.</a>
<a id='line_2994'>    Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?</a>
<a id='line_2995'>    O, burn her, burn her! Hanging is too good.             Exit</a>
<a id='line_2996'>  YORK. Take her away; for she hath liv'd too long,</a>
<a id='line_2997'>    To fill the world with vicious qualities.</a>
<a id='line_2998'>  PUCELLE. First let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:</a>
<a id='line_2999'>    Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,</a>
<a id='line_3000'>    But issued from the progeny of kings;</a>
<a id='line_3001'>    Virtuous and holy, chosen from above</a>
<a id='line_3002'>    By inspiration of celestial grace,</a>
<a id='line_3003'>    To work exceeding miracles on earth.</a>
<a id='line_3004'>    I never had to do with wicked spirits.</a>
<a id='line_3005'>    But you, that are polluted with your lusts,</a>
<a id='line_3006'>    Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,</a>
<a id='line_3007'>    Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,</a>
<a id='line_3008'>    Because you want the grace that others have,</a>
<a id='line_3009'>    You judge it straight a thing impossible</a>
<a id='line_3010'>    To compass wonders but by help of devils.</a>
<a id='line_3011'>    No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been</a>
<a id='line_3012'>    A virgin from her tender infancy,</a>
<a id='line_3013'>    Chaste and immaculate in very thought;</a>
<a id='line_3014'>    Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effus'd,</a>
<a id='line_3015'>    Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_3016'>  YORK. Ay, ay. Away with her to execution!</a>
<a id='line_3017'>  WARWICK. And hark ye, sirs; because she is a maid,</a>
<a id='line_3018'>    Spare for no fagots, let there be enow.</a>
<a id='line_3019'>    Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,</a>
<a id='line_3020'>    That so her torture may be shortened.</a>
<a id='line_3021'>  PUCELLE. Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?</a>
<a id='line_3022'>    Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity</a>
<a id='line_3023'>    That warranteth by law to be thy privilege:</a>
<a id='line_3024'>    I am with child, ye bloody homicides;</a>
<a id='line_3025'>    Murder not then the fruit within my womb,</a>
<a id='line_3026'>    Although ye hale me to a violent death.</a>
<a id='line_3027'>  YORK. Now heaven forfend! The holy maid with child!</a>
<a id='line_3028'>  WARWICK. The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought:</a>
<a id='line_3029'>    Is all your strict preciseness come to this?</a>
<a id='line_3030'>  YORK. She and the Dauphin have been juggling.</a>
<a id='line_3031'>    I did imagine what would be her refuge.</a>
<a id='line_3032'>  WARWICK. Well, go to; we'll have no bastards live;</a>
<a id='line_3033'>    Especially since Charles must father it.</a>
<a id='line_3034'>  PUCELLE. You are deceiv'd; my child is none of his:</a>
<a id='line_3035'>    It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love.</a>
<a id='line_3036'>  YORK. Alencon, that notorious Machiavel!</a>
<a id='line_3037'>    It dies, an if it had a thousand lives.</a>
<a id='line_3038'>  PUCELLE. O, give me leave, I have deluded you.</a>
<a id='line_3039'>    'Twas neither Charles nor yet the Duke I nam'd,</a>
<a id='line_3040'>    But Reignier, King of Naples, that prevail'd.</a>
<a id='line_3041'>  WARWICK. A married man! That's most intolerable.</a>
<a id='line_3042'>  YORK. Why, here's a girl! I think she knows not well</a>
<a id='line_3043'>    There were so many-whom she may accuse.</a>
<a id='line_3044'>  WARWICK. It's sign she hath been liberal and free.</a>
<a id='line_3045'>  YORK. And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure.</a>
<a id='line_3046'>    Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee.</a>
<a id='line_3047'>    Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.</a>
<a id='line_3048'>  PUCELLE. Then lead me hence-with whom I leave my</a>
<a id='line_3049'>    curse:</a>
<a id='line_3050'>    May never glorious sun reflex his beams</a>
<a id='line_3051'>    Upon the country where you make abode;</a>
<a id='line_3052'>    But darkness and the gloomy shade of death</a>
<a id='line_3053'>    Environ you, till mischief and despair</a>
<a id='line_3054'>    Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!</a>
<a id='line_3055'>                                                   Exit, guarded</a>
<a id='line_3056'>  YORK. Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes,</a>
<a id='line_3057'>    Thou foul accursed minister of hell!</a>

<a id='line_3069'>  YORK. Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?</a>
<a id='line_3070'>    After the slaughter of so many peers,</a>
<a id='line_3071'>    So many captains, gentlemen, and soldiers,</a>
<a id='line_3072'>    That in this quarrel have been overthrown</a>
<a id='line_3073'>    And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,</a>
<a id='line_3074'>    Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?</a>
<a id='line_3075'>    Have we not lost most part of all the towns,</a>
<a id='line_3076'>    By treason, falsehood, and by treachery,</a>
<a id='line_3077'>    Our great progenitors had conquered?</a>
<a id='line_3078'>    O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief</a>
<a id='line_3079'>    The utter loss of all the realm of France.</a>
<a id='line_3080'>  WARWICK. Be patient, York. If we conclude a peace,</a>
<a id='line_3081'>    It shall be with such strict and severe covenants</a>
<a id='line_3082'>    As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.</a>
<a id='line_3083'></a>

<a id='line_3085'></a>
<a id='line_3086'>  CHARLES. Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed</a>
<a id='line_3087'>    That peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France,</a>
<a id='line_3088'>    We come to be informed by yourselves</a>

<a id='line_3097'>    An suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,</a>
<a id='line_3098'>    You shall become true liegemen to his crown;</a>

<a id='line_3101'>    Thou shalt be plac'd as viceroy under him,</a>
<a id='line_3102'>    And still enjoy thy regal dignity.</a>

<a id='line_3135'>    Although you break it when your pleasure serves.</a>
<a id='line_3136'>  WARWICK. How say'st thou, Charles? Shall our condition</a>
<a id='line_3137'>    stand?</a>
<a id='line_3138'>  CHARLES. It shall;</a>
<a id='line_3139'>    Only reserv'd, you claim no interest</a>
<a id='line_3140'>    In any of our towns of garrison.</a>
<a id='line_3141'>  YORK. Then swear allegiance to his Majesty:</a>
<a id='line_3142'>    As thou art knight, never to disobey</a>
<a id='line_3143'>    Nor be rebellious to the crown of England</a>
<a id='line_3144'>    Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.</a>
<a id='line_3145'>                    [CHARLES and the rest give tokens of fealty]</a>
<a id='line_3146'>    So, now dismiss your army when ye please;</a>
<a id='line_3147'>    Hang up your ensigns, let your drums be still,</a>
<a id='line_3148'>    For here we entertain a solemn peace.                 Exeunt</a>
<a id='line_3149'></a>
<a id='line_3150'>                              SCENE 5.</a>
<a id='line_3151'></a>
<a id='line_3152'>                         London. The palace</a>
<a id='line_3153'></a>
<a id='line_3154'>            Enter SUFFOLK, in conference with the KING,</a>
<a id='line_3155'>                     GLOUCESTER and EXETER</a>
<a id='line_3156'></a>
<a id='line_3157'>  KING HENRY. Your wondrous rare description, noble Earl,</a>
<a id='line_3158'>    Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me.</a>
<a id='line_3159'>    Her virtues, graced with external gifts,</a>
<a id='line_3160'>    Do breed love's settled passions in my heart;</a>
<a id='line_3161'>    And like as rigour of tempestuous gusts</a>
<a id='line_3162'>    Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,</a>
<a id='line_3163'>    So am I driven by breath of her renown</a>
<a id='line_3164'>    Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive</a>
<a id='line_3165'>    Where I may have fruition of her love.</a>
<a id='line_3166'>  SUFFOLK. Tush, my good lord! This superficial tale</a>
<a id='line_3167'>    Is but a preface of her worthy praise.</a>
<a id='line_3168'>    The chief perfections of that lovely dame,</a>
<a id='line_3169'>    Had I sufficient skill to utter them,</a>
<a id='line_3170'>    Would make a volume of enticing lines,</a>
<a id='line_3171'>    Able to ravish any dull conceit;</a>
<a id='line_3172'>    And, which is more, she is not so divine,</a>
<a id='line_3173'>    So full-replete with choice of all delights,</a>
<a id='line_3174'>    But with as humble lowliness of mind</a>
<a id='line_3175'>    She is content to be at your command</a>
<a id='line_3176'>    Command, I mean, of virtuous intents,</a>
<a id='line_3177'>    To love and honour Henry as her lord.</a>
<a id='line_3178'>  KING HENRY. And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.</a>
<a id='line_3179'>    Therefore, my Lord Protector, give consent</a>
<a id='line_3180'>    That Margaret may be England's royal Queen.</a>
<a id='line_3181'>  GLOUCESTER. So should I give consent to flatter sin.</a>
<a id='line_3182'>    You know, my lord, your Highness is betroth'd</a>
<a id='line_3183'>    Unto another lady of esteem.</a>
<a id='line_3184'>    How shall we then dispense with that contract,</a>
<a id='line_3185'>    And not deface your honour with reproach?</a>
<a id='line_3186'>  SUFFOLK. As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;</a>
<a id='line_3187'>    Or one that at a triumph, having vow'd</a>
<a id='line_3188'>    To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists</a>
<a id='line_3189'>    By reason of his adversary's odds:</a>
<a id='line_3190'>    A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,</a>
<a id='line_3191'>    And therefore may be broke without offence.</a>
<a id='line_3192'>  GLOUCESTER. Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than</a>
<a id='line_3193'>    that?</a>
<a id='line_3194'>    Her father is no better than an earl,</a>
<a id='line_3195'>    Although in glorious titles he excel.</a>
<a id='line_3196'>  SUFFOLK. Yes, my lord, her father is a king,</a>
<a id='line_3197'>    The King of Naples and Jerusalem;</a>
<a id='line_3198'>    And of such great authority in France</a>
<a id='line_3199'>    As his alliance will confirm our peace,</a>
<a id='line_3200'>    And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.</a>
<a id='line_3201'>  GLOUCESTER. And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,</a>
<a id='line_3202'>    Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.</a>
<a id='line_3203'>  EXETER. Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower;</a>
<a id='line_3204'>    Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.</a>
<a id='line_3205'>  SUFFOLK. A dow'r, my lords! Disgrace not so your king,</a>
<a id='line_3206'>    That he should be so abject, base, and poor,</a>
<a id='line_3207'>    To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.</a>
<a id='line_3208'>    Henry is able to enrich his queen,</a>
<a id='line_3209'>    And not to seek a queen to make him rich.</a>
<a id='line_3210'>    So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,</a>
<a id='line_3211'>    As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.</a>
<a id='line_3212'>    Marriage is a matter of more worth</a>
<a id='line_3213'>    Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;</a>
<a id='line_3214'>    Not whom we will, but whom his Grace affects,</a>
<a id='line_3215'>    Must be companion of his nuptial bed.</a>
<a id='line_3216'>    And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,</a>
<a id='line_3217'>    It most of all these reasons bindeth us</a>
<a id='line_3218'>    In our opinions she should be preferr'd;</a>
<a id='line_3219'>    For what is wedlock forced but a hell,</a>
<a id='line_3220'>    An age of discord and continual strife?</a>
<a id='line_3221'>    Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,</a>
<a id='line_3222'>    And is a pattern of celestial peace.</a>
<a id='line_3223'>    Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,</a>
<a id='line_3224'>    But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?</a>
<a id='line_3225'>    Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,</a>
<a id='line_3226'>    Approves her fit for none but for a king;</a>
<a id='line_3227'>    Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,</a>
<a id='line_3228'>    More than in women commonly is seen,</a>
<a id='line_3229'>    Will answer our hope in issue of a king;</a>
<a id='line_3230'>    For Henry, son unto a conqueror,</a>
<a id='line_3231'>    Is likely to beget more conquerors,</a>
<a id='line_3232'>    If with a lady of so high resolve</a>
<a id='line_3233'>    As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.</a>
<a id='line_3234'>    Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me</a>
<a id='line_3235'>    That Margaret shall be Queen, and none but she.</a>
<a id='line_3236'>  KING HENRY. Whether it be through force of your report,</a>
<a id='line_3237'>    My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that</a>
<a id='line_3238'>    My tender youth was never yet attaint</a>
<a id='line_3239'>    With any passion of inflaming love,</a>
<a id='line_3240'>    I cannot tell; but this I am assur'd,</a>
<a id='line_3241'>    I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,</a>
<a id='line_3242'>    Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,</a>
<a id='line_3243'>    As I am sick with working of my thoughts.</a>
<a id='line_3244'>    Take therefore shipping; post, my lord, to France;</a>
<a id='line_3245'>    Agree to any covenants; and procure</a>
<a id='line_3246'>    That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come</a>
<a id='line_3247'>    To cross the seas to England, and be crown'd</a>
<a id='line_3248'>    King Henry's faithful and anointed queen.</a>
<a id='line_3249'>    For your expenses and sufficient charge,</a>
<a id='line_3250'>    Among the people gather up a tenth.</a>
<a id='line_3251'>    Be gone, I say; for till you do return</a>
<a id='line_3252'>    I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.</a>
<a id='line_3253'>    And you, good uncle, banish all offence:</a>
<a id='line_3254'>    If you do censure me by what you were,</a>
<a id='line_3255'>    Not what you are, I know it will excuse</a>
<a id='line_3256'>    This sudden execution of my will.</a>
<a id='line_3257'>    And so conduct me where, from company,</a>
<a id='line_3258'>    I may revolve and ruminate my grief.                    Exit</a>
<a id='line_3259'>  GLOUCESTER. Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.</a>
<a id='line_3260'>                                    Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER</a>
<a id='line_3261'>  SUFFOLK. Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,</a>
<a id='line_3262'>    As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,</a>
<a id='line_3263'>    With hope to find the like event in love</a>
<a id='line_3264'>    But prosper better than the Troyan did.</a>
<a id='line_3265'>    Margaret shall now be Queen, and rule the King;</a>
<a id='line_3266'>    But I will rule both her, the King, and realm.          Exit</a>
<a id='line_3267'></a>
