                    <a id='line_0'>The Third Epistle General of John</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</a>
<a id='line_4'></a>
<a id='line_5'>1:2 Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be</a>
<a id='line_6'>in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</a>
<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>1:3 For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of</a>
<a id='line_9'>the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</a>
<a id='line_10'></a>
<a id='line_11'>1:4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</a>
<a id='line_12'></a>
<a id='line_13'>1:5 Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the</a>
<a id='line_14'>brethren, and to strangers; 1:6 Which have borne witness of thy</a>
<a id='line_15'>charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey</a>
<a id='line_16'>after a godly sort, thou shalt do well: 1:7 Because that for his</a>
<a id='line_17'>nameâ€™s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</a>
<a id='line_18'></a>
<a id='line_19'>1:8 We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers</a>
<a id='line_20'>to the truth.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>1:9 I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the</a>
<a id='line_23'>preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'>1:10 Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth,</a>
<a id='line_26'>prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith,</a>
<a id='line_27'>neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that</a>
<a id='line_28'>would, and casteth them out of the church.</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>1:11 Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good.</a>
<a id='line_31'>He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen</a>
<a id='line_32'>God.</a>
<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'>1:12 Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself:</a>
<a id='line_35'>yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</a>
<a id='line_36'></a>
<a id='line_37'>1:13 I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write</a>
<a id='line_38'>unto thee: 1:14 But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall</a>
<a id='line_39'>speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet</a>
<a id='line_40'>the friends by name.</a>
