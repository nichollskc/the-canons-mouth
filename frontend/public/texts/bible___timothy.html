                    <a id='line_0'>The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our</a>
<a id='line_4'>Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope; 1:2 Unto Timothy,</a>
<a id='line_5'>my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father</a>
<a id='line_6'>and Jesus Christ our Lord.</a>
<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>1:3 As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into</a>
<a id='line_9'>Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other</a>
<a id='line_10'>doctrine, 1:4 Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies,</a>
<a id='line_11'>which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in</a>
<a id='line_12'>faith: so do.</a>
<a id='line_13'></a>
<a id='line_14'>1:5 Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and</a>
<a id='line_15'>of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned: 1:6 From which some</a>
<a id='line_16'>having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling; 1:7 Desiring to</a>
<a id='line_17'>be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor</a>
<a id='line_18'>whereof they affirm.</a>
<a id='line_19'></a>
<a id='line_20'>1:8 But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; 1:9</a>
<a id='line_21'>Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for</a>
<a id='line_22'>the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for</a>
<a id='line_23'>unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers,</a>
<a id='line_24'>for manslayers, 1:10 For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves</a>
<a id='line_25'>with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if</a>
<a id='line_26'>there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine; 1:11</a>
<a id='line_27'>According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was</a>
<a id='line_28'>committed to my trust.</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>1:12 And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that</a>
<a id='line_31'>he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; 1:13 Who was</a>
<a id='line_32'>before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained</a>
<a id='line_33'>mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</a>
<a id='line_34'></a>
<a id='line_35'>1:14 And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and</a>
<a id='line_36'>love which is in Christ Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>1:15 This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that</a>
<a id='line_39'>Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</a>
<a id='line_40'></a>
<a id='line_41'>1:16 Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus</a>
<a id='line_42'>Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which</a>
<a id='line_43'>should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</a>
<a id='line_44'></a>
<a id='line_45'>1:17 Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise</a>
<a id='line_46'>God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_47'></a>
<a id='line_48'>1:18 This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the</a>
<a id='line_49'>prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a</a>
<a id='line_50'>good warfare; 1:19 Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some</a>
<a id='line_51'>having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck: 1:20 Of whom is</a>
<a id='line_52'>Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they</a>
<a id='line_53'>may learn not to blaspheme.</a>
<a id='line_54'></a>
<a id='line_55'>2:1 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers,</a>
<a id='line_56'>intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; 2:2 For</a>
<a id='line_57'>kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and</a>
<a id='line_58'>peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</a>
<a id='line_59'></a>
<a id='line_60'>2:3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;</a>
<a id='line_61'>2:4 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge</a>
<a id='line_62'>of the truth.</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>2:5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the</a>
<a id='line_65'>man Christ Jesus; 2:6 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be</a>
<a id='line_66'>testified in due time.</a>
<a id='line_67'></a>
<a id='line_68'>2:7 Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the</a>
<a id='line_69'>truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and</a>
<a id='line_70'>verity.</a>
<a id='line_71'></a>
<a id='line_72'>2:8 I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands,</a>
<a id='line_73'>without wrath and doubting.</a>
<a id='line_74'></a>
<a id='line_75'>2:9 In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest</a>
<a id='line_76'>apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or</a>
<a id='line_77'>gold, or pearls, or costly array; 2:10 But (which becometh women</a>
<a id='line_78'>professing godliness) with good works.</a>
<a id='line_79'></a>
<a id='line_80'>2:11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</a>
<a id='line_81'></a>
<a id='line_82'>2:12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over</a>
<a id='line_83'>the man, but to be in silence.</a>
<a id='line_84'></a>
<a id='line_85'>2:13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</a>
<a id='line_86'></a>
<a id='line_87'>2:14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in</a>
<a id='line_88'>the transgression.</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>2:15 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they</a>
<a id='line_91'>continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>3:1 This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he</a>
<a id='line_94'>desireth a good work.</a>
<a id='line_95'></a>
<a id='line_96'>3:2 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife,</a>
<a id='line_97'>vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to</a>
<a id='line_98'>teach; 3:3 Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;</a>
<a id='line_99'>but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; 3:4 One that ruleth well his</a>
<a id='line_100'>own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity; 3:5</a>
<a id='line_101'>(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take</a>
<a id='line_102'>care of the church of God?)  3:6 Not a novice, lest being lifted up</a>
<a id='line_103'>with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.</a>
<a id='line_104'></a>
<a id='line_105'>3:7 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without;</a>
<a id='line_106'>lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'>3:8 Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given</a>
<a id='line_109'>to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; 3:9 Holding the mystery of</a>
<a id='line_110'>the faith in a pure conscience.</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'>3:10 And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office</a>
<a id='line_113'>of a deacon, being found blameless.</a>
<a id='line_114'></a>
<a id='line_115'>3:11 Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober,</a>
<a id='line_116'>faithful in all things.</a>
<a id='line_117'></a>
<a id='line_118'>3:12 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their</a>
<a id='line_119'>children and their own houses well.</a>
<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>3:13 For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to</a>
<a id='line_122'>themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in</a>
<a id='line_123'>Christ Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_124'></a>
<a id='line_125'>3:14 These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:</a>
<a id='line_126'>3:15 But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to</a>
<a id='line_127'>behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living</a>
<a id='line_128'>God, the pillar and ground of the truth.</a>
<a id='line_129'></a>
<a id='line_130'>3:16 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God</a>
<a id='line_131'>was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels,</a>
<a id='line_132'>preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into</a>
<a id='line_133'>glory.</a>
<a id='line_134'></a>
<a id='line_135'>4:1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some</a>
<a id='line_136'>shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and</a>
<a id='line_137'>doctrines of devils; 4:2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their</a>
<a id='line_138'>conscience seared with a hot iron; 4:3 Forbidding to marry, and</a>
<a id='line_139'>commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be</a>
<a id='line_140'>received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.</a>
<a id='line_141'></a>
<a id='line_142'>4:4 For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if</a>
<a id='line_143'>it be received with thanksgiving: 4:5 For it is sanctified by the word</a>
<a id='line_144'>of God and prayer.</a>
<a id='line_145'></a>
<a id='line_146'>4:6 If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou</a>
<a id='line_147'>shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of</a>
<a id='line_148'>faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.</a>
<a id='line_149'></a>
<a id='line_150'>4:7 But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself</a>
<a id='line_151'>rather unto godliness.</a>
<a id='line_152'></a>
<a id='line_153'>4:8 For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable</a>
<a id='line_154'>unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that</a>
<a id='line_155'>which is to come.</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>4:9 This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</a>
<a id='line_158'></a>
<a id='line_159'>4:10 For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we</a>
<a id='line_160'>trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of</a>
<a id='line_161'>those that believe.</a>
<a id='line_162'></a>
<a id='line_163'>4:11 These things command and teach.</a>
<a id='line_164'></a>
<a id='line_165'>4:12 Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the</a>
<a id='line_166'>believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith,</a>
<a id='line_167'>in purity.</a>
<a id='line_168'></a>
<a id='line_169'>4:13 Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to</a>
<a id='line_170'>doctrine.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>4:14 Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by</a>
<a id='line_173'>prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>4:15 Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy</a>
<a id='line_176'>profiting may appear to all.</a>
<a id='line_177'></a>
<a id='line_178'>4:16 Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them:</a>
<a id='line_179'>for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear</a>
<a id='line_180'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_181'></a>
<a id='line_182'>5:1 Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger</a>
<a id='line_183'>men as brethren; 5:2 The elder women as mothers; the younger as</a>
<a id='line_184'>sisters, with all purity.</a>
<a id='line_185'></a>
<a id='line_186'>5:3 Honour widows that are widows indeed.</a>
<a id='line_187'></a>
<a id='line_188'>5:4 But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to</a>
<a id='line_189'>shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and</a>
<a id='line_190'>acceptable before God.</a>
<a id='line_191'></a>
<a id='line_192'>5:5 Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and</a>
<a id='line_193'>continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.</a>
<a id='line_194'></a>
<a id='line_195'>5:6 But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>5:7 And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>5:8 But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his</a>
<a id='line_200'>own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>5:9 Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years</a>
<a id='line_203'>old, having been the wife of one man.</a>
<a id='line_204'></a>
<a id='line_205'>5:10 Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children,</a>
<a id='line_206'>if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if</a>
<a id='line_207'>she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every</a>
<a id='line_208'>good work.</a>
<a id='line_209'></a>
<a id='line_210'>5:11 But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax</a>
<a id='line_211'>wanton against Christ, they will marry; 5:12 Having damnation, because</a>
<a id='line_212'>they have cast off their first faith.</a>
<a id='line_213'></a>
<a id='line_214'>5:13 And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to</a>
<a id='line_215'>house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking</a>
<a id='line_216'>things which they ought not.</a>
<a id='line_217'></a>
<a id='line_218'>5:14 I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children,</a>
<a id='line_219'>guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak</a>
<a id='line_220'>reproachfully.</a>
<a id='line_221'></a>
<a id='line_222'>5:15 For some are already turned aside after Satan.</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>5:16 If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve</a>
<a id='line_225'>them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that</a>
<a id='line_226'>are widows indeed.</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>5:17 Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour,</a>
<a id='line_229'>especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>5:18 For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that</a>
<a id='line_232'>treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.</a>
<a id='line_233'></a>
<a id='line_234'>5:19 Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or</a>
<a id='line_235'>three witnesses.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>5:20 Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.</a>
<a id='line_238'></a>
<a id='line_239'>5:21 I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the</a>
<a id='line_240'>elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one</a>
<a id='line_241'>before another, doing nothing by partiality.</a>
<a id='line_242'></a>
<a id='line_243'>5:22 Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s</a>
<a id='line_244'>sins: keep thyself pure.</a>
<a id='line_245'></a>
<a id='line_246'>5:23 Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s</a>
<a id='line_247'>sake and thine often infirmities.</a>
<a id='line_248'></a>
<a id='line_249'>5:24 Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment;</a>
<a id='line_250'>and some men they follow after.</a>
<a id='line_251'></a>
<a id='line_252'>5:25 Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and</a>
<a id='line_253'>they that are otherwise cannot be hid.</a>
<a id='line_254'></a>
<a id='line_255'>6:1 Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters</a>
<a id='line_256'>worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not</a>
<a id='line_257'>blasphemed.</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>6:2 And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them,</a>
<a id='line_260'>because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they</a>
<a id='line_261'>are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach</a>
<a id='line_262'>and exhort.</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>6:3 If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words,</a>
<a id='line_265'>even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is</a>
<a id='line_266'>according to godliness; 6:4 He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting</a>
<a id='line_267'>about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife,</a>
<a id='line_268'>railings, evil surmisings, 6:5 Perverse disputings of men of corrupt</a>
<a id='line_269'>minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness:</a>
<a id='line_270'>from such withdraw thyself.</a>
<a id='line_271'></a>
<a id='line_272'>6:6 But godliness with contentment is great gain.</a>
<a id='line_273'></a>
<a id='line_274'>6:7 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can</a>
<a id='line_275'>carry nothing out.</a>
<a id='line_276'></a>
<a id='line_277'>6:8 And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.</a>
<a id='line_278'></a>
<a id='line_279'>6:9 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and</a>
<a id='line_280'>into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction</a>
<a id='line_281'>and perdition.</a>
<a id='line_282'></a>
<a id='line_283'>6:10 For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some</a>
<a id='line_284'>coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves</a>
<a id='line_285'>through with many sorrows.</a>
<a id='line_286'></a>
<a id='line_287'>6:11 But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after</a>
<a id='line_288'>righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</a>
<a id='line_289'></a>
<a id='line_290'>6:12 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life,</a>
<a id='line_291'>whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession</a>
<a id='line_292'>before many witnesses.</a>
<a id='line_293'></a>
<a id='line_294'>6:13 I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all</a>
<a id='line_295'>things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a</a>
<a id='line_296'>good confession; 6:14 That thou keep this commandment without spot,</a>
<a id='line_297'>unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: 6:15 Which</a>
<a id='line_298'>in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the</a>
<a id='line_299'>King of kings, and Lord of lords; 6:16 Who only hath immortality,</a>
<a id='line_300'>dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath</a>
<a id='line_301'>seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_302'></a>
<a id='line_303'>6:17 Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not</a>
<a id='line_304'>highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who</a>
<a id='line_305'>giveth us richly all things to enjoy; 6:18 That they do good, that</a>
<a id='line_306'>they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to</a>
<a id='line_307'>communicate; 6:19 Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation</a>
<a id='line_308'>against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</a>
<a id='line_309'></a>
<a id='line_310'>6:20 O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding</a>
<a id='line_311'>profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so</a>
<a id='line_312'>called: 6:21 Which some professing have erred concerning the faith.</a>
<a id='line_313'>Grace be with thee. Amen.</a>

<a id='line_318'>The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy</a>
<a id='line_319'></a>
<a id='line_320'></a>
<a id='line_321'>1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to</a>
<a id='line_322'>the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus, 1:2 To Timothy,</a>
<a id='line_323'>my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father</a>
<a id='line_324'>and Christ Jesus our Lord.</a>
<a id='line_325'></a>
<a id='line_326'>1:3 I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure</a>
<a id='line_327'>conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my</a>
<a id='line_328'>prayers night and day; 1:4 Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful</a>
<a id='line_329'>of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; 1:5 When I call to</a>
<a id='line_330'>remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in</a>
<a id='line_331'>thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that</a>
<a id='line_332'>in thee also.</a>
<a id='line_333'></a>
<a id='line_334'>1:6 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of</a>
<a id='line_335'>God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</a>
<a id='line_336'></a>
<a id='line_337'>1:7 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of</a>
<a id='line_338'>love, and of a sound mind.</a>
<a id='line_339'></a>
<a id='line_340'>1:8 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of</a>
<a id='line_341'>me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel</a>
<a id='line_342'>according to the power of God; 1:9 Who hath saved us, and called us</a>
<a id='line_343'>with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his</a>
<a id='line_344'>own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the</a>
<a id='line_345'>world began, 1:10 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our</a>
<a id='line_346'>Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life</a>
<a id='line_347'>and immortality to light through the gospel: 1:11 Whereunto I am</a>
<a id='line_348'>appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</a>
<a id='line_349'></a>
<a id='line_350'>1:12 For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am</a>
<a id='line_351'>not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he</a>
<a id='line_352'>is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</a>
<a id='line_353'></a>
<a id='line_354'>1:13 Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me,</a>
<a id='line_355'>in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_356'></a>
<a id='line_357'>1:14 That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy</a>
<a id='line_358'>Ghost which dwelleth in us.</a>
<a id='line_359'></a>
<a id='line_360'>1:15 This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away</a>
<a id='line_361'>from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</a>
<a id='line_362'></a>
<a id='line_363'>1:16 The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft</a>
<a id='line_364'>refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: 1:17 But, when he was</a>
<a id='line_365'>in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.</a>
<a id='line_366'></a>
<a id='line_367'>1:18 The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in</a>
<a id='line_368'>that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus,</a>
<a id='line_369'>thou knowest very well.</a>
<a id='line_370'></a>
<a id='line_371'>2:1 Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ</a>
<a id='line_372'>Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_373'></a>
<a id='line_374'>2:2 And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses,</a>
<a id='line_375'>the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach</a>
<a id='line_376'>others also.</a>
<a id='line_377'></a>
<a id='line_378'>2:3 Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_379'></a>
<a id='line_380'>2:4 No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this</a>
<a id='line_381'>life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</a>
<a id='line_382'></a>
<a id='line_383'>2:5 And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned,</a>
<a id='line_384'>except he strive lawfully.</a>
<a id='line_385'></a>
<a id='line_386'>2:6 The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the</a>
<a id='line_387'>fruits.</a>
<a id='line_388'></a>
<a id='line_389'>2:7 Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all</a>
<a id='line_390'>things.</a>
<a id='line_391'></a>
<a id='line_392'>2:8 Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from</a>
<a id='line_393'>the dead according to my gospel: 2:9 Wherein I suffer trouble, as an</a>
<a id='line_394'>evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</a>
<a id='line_395'></a>
<a id='line_396'>2:10 Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they</a>
<a id='line_397'>may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal</a>
<a id='line_398'>glory.</a>
<a id='line_399'></a>
<a id='line_400'>2:11 It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall</a>
<a id='line_401'>also live with him: 2:12 If we suffer, we shall also reign with him:</a>
<a id='line_402'>if we deny him, he also will deny us: 2:13 If we believe not, yet he</a>
<a id='line_403'>abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</a>
<a id='line_404'></a>
<a id='line_405'>2:14 Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the</a>
<a id='line_406'>Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the</a>
<a id='line_407'>subverting of the hearers.</a>
<a id='line_408'></a>
<a id='line_409'>2:15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth</a>
<a id='line_410'>not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</a>
<a id='line_411'></a>
<a id='line_412'>2:16 But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto</a>
<a id='line_413'>more ungodliness.</a>
<a id='line_414'></a>
<a id='line_415'>2:17 And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus</a>
<a id='line_416'>and Philetus; 2:18 Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that</a>
<a id='line_417'>the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</a>
<a id='line_418'></a>
<a id='line_419'>2:19 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this</a>
<a id='line_420'>seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that</a>
<a id='line_421'>nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_422'></a>
<a id='line_423'>2:20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of</a>
<a id='line_424'>silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to</a>
<a id='line_425'>dishonour.</a>
<a id='line_426'></a>
<a id='line_427'>2:21 If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel</a>
<a id='line_428'>unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared</a>
<a id='line_429'>unto every good work.</a>
<a id='line_430'></a>
<a id='line_431'>2:22 Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith,</a>
<a id='line_432'>charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</a>
<a id='line_433'></a>
<a id='line_434'>2:23 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do</a>
<a id='line_435'>gender strifes.</a>
<a id='line_436'></a>
<a id='line_437'>2:24 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto</a>
<a id='line_438'>all men, apt to teach, patient, 2:25 In meekness instructing those</a>
<a id='line_439'>that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance</a>
<a id='line_440'>to the acknowledging of the truth; 2:26 And that they may recover</a>
<a id='line_441'>themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him</a>
<a id='line_442'>at his will.</a>
<a id='line_443'></a>
<a id='line_444'>3:1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</a>
<a id='line_445'></a>
<a id='line_446'>3:2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters,</a>
<a id='line_447'>proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3:3</a>
<a id='line_448'>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent,</a>
<a id='line_449'>fierce, despisers of those that are good, 3:4 Traitors, heady,</a>
<a id='line_450'>highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 3:5 Having a</a>
<a id='line_451'>form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</a>
<a id='line_452'></a>
<a id='line_453'>3:6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead</a>
<a id='line_454'>captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, 3:7</a>
<a id='line_455'>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</a>
<a id='line_456'></a>
<a id='line_457'>3:8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist</a>
<a id='line_458'>the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</a>
<a id='line_459'></a>
<a id='line_460'>3:9 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be</a>
<a id='line_461'>manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.</a>
<a id='line_462'></a>
<a id='line_463'>3:10 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose,</a>
<a id='line_464'>faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, 3:11 Persecutions,</a>
<a id='line_465'>afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra;</a>
<a id='line_466'>what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered</a>
<a id='line_467'>me.</a>
<a id='line_468'></a>
<a id='line_469'>3:12 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer</a>
<a id='line_470'>persecution.</a>
<a id='line_471'></a>
<a id='line_472'>3:13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving,</a>
<a id='line_473'>and being deceived.</a>
<a id='line_474'></a>
<a id='line_475'>3:14 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast</a>
<a id='line_476'>been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; 3:15 And that</a>
<a id='line_477'>from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to</a>
<a id='line_478'>make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_479'></a>
<a id='line_480'>3:16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable</a>
<a id='line_481'>for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in</a>
<a id='line_482'>righteousness: 3:17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly</a>
<a id='line_483'>furnished unto all good works.</a>
<a id='line_484'></a>
<a id='line_485'>4:1 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who</a>
<a id='line_486'>shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</a>
<a id='line_487'>4:2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove,</a>
<a id='line_488'>rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</a>
<a id='line_489'></a>
<a id='line_490'>4:3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine;</a>
<a id='line_491'>but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers,</a>
<a id='line_492'>having itching ears; 4:4 And they shall turn away their ears from the</a>
<a id='line_493'>truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</a>
<a id='line_494'></a>
<a id='line_495'>4:5 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of</a>
<a id='line_496'>an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</a>
<a id='line_497'></a>
<a id='line_498'>4:6 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is</a>
<a id='line_499'>at hand.</a>
<a id='line_500'></a>
<a id='line_501'>4:7 I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept</a>
<a id='line_502'>the faith: 4:8 Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of</a>
<a id='line_503'>righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at</a>
<a id='line_504'>that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his</a>
<a id='line_505'>appearing.</a>
<a id='line_506'></a>
<a id='line_507'>4:9 Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: 4:10 For Demas hath</a>
<a id='line_508'>forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto</a>

<a id='line_511'>4:11 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he</a>
<a id='line_512'>is profitable to me for the ministry.</a>
<a id='line_513'></a>
<a id='line_514'>4:12 And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</a>
<a id='line_515'></a>

<a id='line_519'>4:14 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him</a>
<a id='line_520'>according to his works: 4:15 Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath</a>
<a id='line_521'>greatly withstood our words.</a>
<a id='line_522'></a>
<a id='line_523'>4:16 At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me:</a>
<a id='line_524'>I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.</a>
<a id='line_525'></a>
<a id='line_526'>4:17 Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that</a>
<a id='line_527'>by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles</a>
<a id='line_528'>might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</a>
<a id='line_529'></a>
<a id='line_530'>4:18 And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will</a>
