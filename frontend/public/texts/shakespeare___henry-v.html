<a id='line_112'>A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,</a>
<a id='line_113'>And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!</a>

<a id='line_118'>The flat unraised spirits that hath dar’d</a>
<a id='line_119'>On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth</a>
<a id='line_120'>So great an object. Can this cockpit hold</a>

<a id='line_122'>Within this wooden O the very casques</a>

<a id='line_154'></a>
<a id='line_155'>CANTERBURY.</a>
<a id='line_156'>My lord, I’ll tell you, that self bill is urg’d</a>
<a id='line_157'>Which in the eleventh year of the last king’s reign</a>
<a id='line_158'>Was like, and had indeed against us passed</a>
<a id='line_159'>But that the scambling and unquiet time</a>
<a id='line_160'>Did push it out of farther question.</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>ELY.</a>
<a id='line_163'>But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?</a>
<a id='line_164'></a>
<a id='line_165'>CANTERBURY.</a>
<a id='line_166'>It must be thought on. If it pass against us,</a>
<a id='line_167'>We lose the better half of our possession:</a>
<a id='line_168'>For all the temporal lands, which men devout</a>
<a id='line_169'>By testament have given to the Church,</a>
<a id='line_170'>Would they strip from us; being valu’d thus:</a>
<a id='line_171'>As much as would maintain, to the King’s honour,</a>
<a id='line_172'>Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,</a>
<a id='line_173'>Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;</a>
<a id='line_174'>And, to relief of lazars and weak age,</a>
<a id='line_175'>Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil,</a>
<a id='line_176'>A hundred almshouses right well supplied;</a>
<a id='line_177'>And to the coffers of the King beside,</a>
<a id='line_178'>A thousand pounds by th’ year. Thus runs the bill.</a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>ELY.</a>
<a id='line_181'>This would drink deep.</a>
<a id='line_182'></a>
<a id='line_183'>CANTERBURY.</a>
<a id='line_184'>’Twould drink the cup and all.</a>
<a id='line_185'></a>
<a id='line_186'>ELY.</a>
<a id='line_187'>But what prevention?</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>CANTERBURY.</a>
<a id='line_190'>The King is full of grace and fair regard.</a>
<a id='line_191'></a>
<a id='line_192'>ELY.</a>
<a id='line_193'>And a true lover of the holy Church.</a>
<a id='line_194'></a>
<a id='line_195'>CANTERBURY.</a>
<a id='line_196'>The courses of his youth promis’d it not.</a>
<a id='line_197'>The breath no sooner left his father’s body</a>
<a id='line_198'>But that his wildness, mortified in him,</a>
<a id='line_199'>Seemed to die too; yea, at that very moment</a>
<a id='line_200'>Consideration like an angel came</a>
<a id='line_201'>And whipped th’ offending Adam out of him,</a>
<a id='line_202'>Leaving his body as a paradise</a>
<a id='line_203'>T’ envelope and contain celestial spirits.</a>
<a id='line_204'>Never was such a sudden scholar made,</a>
<a id='line_205'>Never came reformation in a flood</a>
<a id='line_206'>With such a heady currance scouring faults,</a>
<a id='line_207'>Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness</a>
<a id='line_208'>So soon did lose his seat, and all at once,</a>
<a id='line_209'>As in this king.</a>
<a id='line_210'></a>
<a id='line_211'>ELY.</a>
<a id='line_212'>We are blessed in the change.</a>
<a id='line_213'></a>
<a id='line_214'>CANTERBURY.</a>
<a id='line_215'>Hear him but reason in divinity</a>
<a id='line_216'>And, all-admiring, with an inward wish</a>
<a id='line_217'>You would desire the King were made a prelate;</a>
<a id='line_218'>Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,</a>
<a id='line_219'>You would say it hath been all in all his study;</a>
<a id='line_220'>List his discourse of war, and you shall hear</a>
<a id='line_221'>A fearful battle rendered you in music;</a>
<a id='line_222'>Turn him to any cause of policy,</a>
<a id='line_223'>The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,</a>
<a id='line_224'>Familiar as his garter; that, when he speaks,</a>
<a id='line_225'>The air, a chartered libertine, is still,</a>
<a id='line_226'>And the mute wonder lurketh in men’s ears</a>
<a id='line_227'>To steal his sweet and honeyed sentences;</a>
<a id='line_228'>So that the art and practic part of life</a>
<a id='line_229'>Must be the mistress to this theoric:</a>
<a id='line_230'>Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it,</a>
<a id='line_231'>Since his addiction was to courses vain,</a>
<a id='line_232'>His companies unlettered, rude, and shallow,</a>
<a id='line_233'>His hours filled up with riots, banquets, sports,</a>
<a id='line_234'>And never noted in him any study,</a>
<a id='line_235'>Any retirement, any sequestration</a>
<a id='line_236'>From open haunts and popularity.</a>
<a id='line_237'></a>
<a id='line_238'>ELY.</a>
<a id='line_239'>The strawberry grows underneath the nettle,</a>
<a id='line_240'>And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best</a>
<a id='line_241'>Neighboured by fruit of baser quality;</a>
<a id='line_242'>And so the Prince obscured his contemplation</a>
<a id='line_243'>Under the veil of wildness, which, no doubt,</a>
<a id='line_244'>Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,</a>
<a id='line_245'>Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'>CANTERBURY.</a>
<a id='line_248'>It must be so, for miracles are ceased,</a>
<a id='line_249'>And therefore we must needs admit the means</a>
<a id='line_250'>How things are perfected.</a>
<a id='line_251'></a>
<a id='line_252'>ELY.</a>
<a id='line_253'>But, my good lord,</a>
<a id='line_254'>How now for mitigation of this bill</a>
<a id='line_255'>Urged by the Commons? Doth his Majesty</a>
<a id='line_256'>Incline to it, or no?</a>
<a id='line_257'></a>
<a id='line_258'>CANTERBURY.</a>
<a id='line_259'>He seems indifferent,</a>
<a id='line_260'>Or rather swaying more upon our part</a>
<a id='line_261'>Than cherishing th’ exhibitors against us;</a>
<a id='line_262'>For I have made an offer to his Majesty,</a>
<a id='line_263'>Upon our spiritual convocation</a>
<a id='line_264'>And in regard of causes now in hand,</a>
<a id='line_265'>Which I have opened to his Grace at large,</a>
<a id='line_266'>As touching France, to give a greater sum</a>
<a id='line_267'>Than ever at one time the clergy yet</a>
<a id='line_268'>Did to his predecessors part withal.</a>
<a id='line_269'></a>
<a id='line_270'>ELY.</a>
<a id='line_271'>How did this offer seem received, my lord?</a>
<a id='line_272'></a>
<a id='line_273'>CANTERBURY.</a>
<a id='line_274'>With good acceptance of his Majesty;</a>
<a id='line_275'>Save that there was not time enough to hear,</a>
<a id='line_276'>As I perceived his Grace would fain have done,</a>
<a id='line_277'>The severals and unhidden passages</a>
<a id='line_278'>Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms,</a>
<a id='line_279'>And generally to the crown and seat of France,</a>
<a id='line_280'>Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.</a>
<a id='line_281'></a>
<a id='line_282'>ELY.</a>
<a id='line_283'>What was th’ impediment that broke this off?</a>
<a id='line_284'></a>
<a id='line_285'>CANTERBURY.</a>
<a id='line_286'>The French ambassador upon that instant</a>
<a id='line_287'>Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come</a>
<a id='line_288'>To give him hearing. Is it four o’clock?</a>
<a id='line_289'></a>
<a id='line_290'>ELY.</a>
<a id='line_291'>It is.</a>
<a id='line_292'></a>
<a id='line_293'>CANTERBURY.</a>
<a id='line_294'>Then go we in, to know his embassy,</a>
<a id='line_295'>Which I could with a ready guess declare</a>
<a id='line_296'>Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.</a>
<a id='line_297'></a>
<a id='line_298'>ELY.</a>
<a id='line_299'>I’ll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.</a>

<a id='line_320'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_321'>Not yet, my cousin. We would be resolved,</a>

<a id='line_323'>That task our thoughts concerning us and France.</a>
<a id='line_324'></a>

<a id='line_330'></a>
<a id='line_331'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_332'>Sure, we thank you.</a>
<a id='line_333'>My learned lord, we pray you to proceed</a>
<a id='line_334'>And justly and religiously unfold</a>
<a id='line_335'>Why the law Salic that they have in France</a>
<a id='line_336'>Or should or should not bar us in our claim.</a>
<a id='line_337'>And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,</a>
<a id='line_338'>That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,</a>
<a id='line_339'>Or nicely charge your understanding soul</a>
<a id='line_340'>With opening titles miscreate, whose right</a>
<a id='line_341'>Suits not in native colours with the truth;</a>
<a id='line_342'>For God doth know how many now in health</a>
<a id='line_343'>Shall drop their blood in approbation</a>
<a id='line_344'>Of what your reverence shall incite us to.</a>
<a id='line_345'>Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,</a>
<a id='line_346'>How you awake our sleeping sword of war.</a>
<a id='line_347'>We charge you in the name of God, take heed;</a>
<a id='line_348'>For never two such kingdoms did contend</a>
<a id='line_349'>Without much fall of blood, whose guiltless drops</a>
<a id='line_350'>Are every one a woe, a sore complaint</a>
<a id='line_351'>’Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords</a>
<a id='line_352'>That makes such waste in brief mortality.</a>
<a id='line_353'>Under this conjuration speak, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_354'>For we will hear, note, and believe in heart</a>
<a id='line_355'>That what you speak is in your conscience washed</a>
<a id='line_356'>As pure as sin with baptism.</a>
<a id='line_357'></a>
<a id='line_358'>CANTERBURY.</a>
<a id='line_359'>Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,</a>
<a id='line_360'>That owe yourselves, your lives, and services</a>
<a id='line_361'>To this imperial throne. There is no bar</a>
<a id='line_362'>To make against your Highness’ claim to France</a>
<a id='line_363'>But this, which they produce from Pharamond:</a>
<a id='line_364'>_In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant_,</a>
<a id='line_365'>“No woman shall succeed in Salic land;”</a>
<a id='line_366'>Which Salic land the French unjustly gloze</a>
<a id='line_367'>To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</a>
<a id='line_368'>The founder of this law and female bar.</a>
<a id='line_369'>Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</a>
<a id='line_370'>That the land Salic is in Germany,</a>
<a id='line_371'>Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;</a>
<a id='line_372'>Where Charles the Great, having subdu’d the Saxons,</a>
<a id='line_373'>There left behind and settled certain French;</a>
<a id='line_374'>Who, holding in disdain the German women</a>
<a id='line_375'>For some dishonest manners of their life,</a>
<a id='line_376'>Establish’d then this law, to wit, no female</a>
<a id='line_377'>Should be inheritrix in Salic land;</a>
<a id='line_378'>Which Salic, as I said, ’twixt Elbe and Sala,</a>
<a id='line_379'>Is at this day in Germany call’d Meissen.</a>
<a id='line_380'>Then doth it well appear the Salic law</a>
<a id='line_381'>Was not devised for the realm of France;</a>
<a id='line_382'>Nor did the French possess the Salic land</a>
<a id='line_383'>Until four hundred one and twenty years</a>
<a id='line_384'>After defunction of King Pharamond,</a>
<a id='line_385'>Idly suppos’d the founder of this law,</a>
<a id='line_386'>Who died within the year of our redemption</a>
<a id='line_387'>Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</a>
<a id='line_388'>Subdu’d the Saxons, and did seat the French</a>
<a id='line_389'>Beyond the river Sala, in the year</a>
<a id='line_390'>Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</a>
<a id='line_391'>King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,</a>
<a id='line_392'>Did, as heir general, being descended</a>
<a id='line_393'>Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</a>
<a id='line_394'>Make claim and title to the crown of France.</a>
<a id='line_395'>Hugh Capet also, who usurp’d the crown</a>
<a id='line_396'>Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</a>
<a id='line_397'>Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</a>
<a id='line_398'>To find his title with some shows of truth,</a>
<a id='line_399'>Though, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,</a>
<a id='line_400'>Convey’d himself as the heir to the Lady Lingare,</a>
<a id='line_401'>Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son</a>
<a id='line_402'>To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son</a>
<a id='line_403'>Of Charles the Great. Also, King Lewis the Tenth,</a>
<a id='line_404'>Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</a>
<a id='line_405'>Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</a>
<a id='line_406'>Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</a>
<a id='line_407'>That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</a>
<a id='line_408'>Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</a>
<a id='line_409'>Daughter to Charles, the foresaid Duke of Lorraine;</a>
<a id='line_410'>By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</a>
<a id='line_411'>Was re-united to the crown of France.</a>
<a id='line_412'>So that, as clear as is the summer’s sun,</a>
<a id='line_413'>King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim,</a>
<a id='line_414'>King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear</a>
<a id='line_415'>To hold in right and title of the female.</a>
<a id='line_416'>So do the kings of France unto this day,</a>
<a id='line_417'>Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law</a>
<a id='line_418'>To bar your Highness claiming from the female,</a>
<a id='line_419'>And rather choose to hide them in a net</a>

<a id='line_493'>Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,</a>
<a id='line_494'>With ample and brim fullness of his force,</a>
<a id='line_495'>Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,</a>
<a id='line_496'>Girdling with grievous siege castles and towns;</a>
<a id='line_497'>That England, being empty of defence,</a>

<a id='line_499'></a>
<a id='line_500'>CANTERBURY.</a>
<a id='line_501'>She hath been then more fear’d than harm’d, my liege;</a>
<a id='line_502'>For hear her but exampl’d by herself:</a>
<a id='line_503'>When all her chivalry hath been in France,</a>
<a id='line_504'>And she a mourning widow of her nobles,</a>
<a id='line_505'>She hath herself not only well defended</a>
<a id='line_506'>But taken and impounded as a stray</a>
<a id='line_507'>The King of Scots; whom she did send to France</a>
<a id='line_508'>To fill King Edward’s fame with prisoner kings,</a>
<a id='line_509'>And make her chronicle as rich with praise</a>
<a id='line_510'>As is the ooze and bottom of the sea</a>

<a id='line_527'>And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.</a>
<a id='line_528'>While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,</a>
<a id='line_529'>The advised head defends itself at home;</a>

<a id='line_606'>We are no tyrant, but a Christian king,</a>

<a id='line_613'>Thus, then, in few.</a>
<a id='line_614'>Your Highness, lately sending into France,</a>
<a id='line_615'>Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right</a>
<a id='line_616'>Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.</a>
<a id='line_617'>In answer of which claim, the prince our master</a>
<a id='line_618'>Says that you savour too much of your youth,</a>

<a id='line_646'>To barbarous licence; as ’tis ever common</a>
<a id='line_647'>That men are merriest when they are from home.</a>
<a id='line_648'>But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,</a>
<a id='line_649'>Be like a king, and show my sail of greatness</a>

<a id='line_651'>For that I have laid by my majesty</a>

<a id='line_665'>To whom I do appeal; and in whose name</a>
<a id='line_666'>Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on</a>

<a id='line_747'>SCENE I. London. A street.</a>
<a id='line_748'></a>
<a id='line_749'> Enter Corporal Nym and Lieutenant Bardolph.</a>
<a id='line_750'></a>
<a id='line_751'>BARDOLPH.</a>
<a id='line_752'>Well met, Corporal Nym.</a>
<a id='line_753'></a>
<a id='line_754'>NYM.</a>
<a id='line_755'>Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.</a>
<a id='line_756'></a>
<a id='line_757'>BARDOLPH.</a>
<a id='line_758'>What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?</a>
<a id='line_759'></a>
<a id='line_760'>NYM.</a>
<a id='line_761'>For my part, I care not. I say little; but when time shall serve, there</a>
<a id='line_762'>shall be smiles; but that shall be as it may. I dare not fight, but I</a>
<a id='line_763'>will wink and hold out mine iron. It is a simple one, but what though?</a>
<a id='line_764'>It will toast cheese, and it will endure cold as another man’s sword</a>
<a id='line_765'>will; and there’s an end.</a>
<a id='line_766'></a>
<a id='line_767'>BARDOLPH.</a>
<a id='line_768'>I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and we’ll be all three</a>
<a id='line_769'>sworn brothers to France. Let it be so, good Corporal Nym.</a>
<a id='line_770'></a>
<a id='line_771'>NYM.</a>
<a id='line_772'>Faith, I will live so long as I may, that’s the certain of it; and when</a>
<a id='line_773'>I cannot live any longer, I will do as I may. That is my rest, that is</a>
<a id='line_774'>the rendezvous of it.</a>
<a id='line_775'></a>
<a id='line_776'>BARDOLPH.</a>
<a id='line_777'>It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell Quickly; and</a>
<a id='line_778'>certainly she did you wrong, for you were troth-plight to her.</a>
<a id='line_779'></a>
<a id='line_780'>NYM.</a>
<a id='line_781'>I cannot tell. Things must be as they may. Men may sleep, and they may</a>
<a id='line_782'>have their throats about them at that time; and some say knives have</a>
<a id='line_783'>edges. It must be as it may. Though patience be a tired mare, yet she</a>
<a id='line_784'>will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I cannot tell.</a>
<a id='line_785'></a>
<a id='line_786'> Enter Pistol and Hostess.</a>
<a id='line_787'></a>
<a id='line_788'>BARDOLPH.</a>
<a id='line_789'>Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife. Good Corporal, be patient here.</a>

<a id='line_791'></a>
<a id='line_792'>PISTOL.</a>
<a id='line_793'>Base tike, call’st thou me host?</a>
<a id='line_794'>Now, by this hand, I swear I scorn the term;</a>
<a id='line_795'>Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.</a>
<a id='line_796'></a>
<a id='line_797'>HOSTESS.</a>
<a id='line_798'>No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge and board a dozen or</a>
<a id='line_799'>fourteen gentlewomen that live honestly by the prick of their needles,</a>
<a id='line_800'>but it will be thought we keep a bawdy house straight. [_Nym and Pistol</a>
<a id='line_801'>draw._] O well a day, Lady, if he be not drawn now! We shall see wilful</a>
<a id='line_802'>adultery and murder committed.</a>
<a id='line_803'></a>
<a id='line_804'>BARDOLPH.</a>
<a id='line_805'>Good Lieutenant! good corporal! offer nothing here.</a>

<a id='line_813'>HOSTESS.</a>
<a id='line_814'>Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, and put up your sword.</a>

<a id='line_816'>NYM.</a>
<a id='line_817'>Will you shog off? I would have you _solus_.</a>
<a id='line_818'></a>
<a id='line_819'>PISTOL.</a>
<a id='line_820'>_Solus_, egregious dog! O viper vile!</a>
<a id='line_821'>The _solus_ in thy most mervailous face;</a>
<a id='line_822'>The _solus_ in thy teeth, and in thy throat,</a>
<a id='line_823'>And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy,</a>
<a id='line_824'>And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!</a>
<a id='line_825'>I do retort the _solus_ in thy bowels;</a>
<a id='line_826'>For I can take, and Pistol’s cock is up,</a>
<a id='line_827'>And flashing fire will follow.</a>
<a id='line_828'></a>
<a id='line_829'>NYM.</a>
<a id='line_830'>I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I have an humour to knock you</a>
<a id='line_831'>indifferently well. If you grow foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you</a>
<a id='line_832'>with my rapier, as I may, in fair terms. If you would walk off, I would</a>
<a id='line_833'>prick your guts a little, in good terms, as I may; and that’s the</a>
<a id='line_834'>humour of it.</a>
<a id='line_835'></a>
<a id='line_836'>PISTOL.</a>
<a id='line_837'>O braggart vile and damned furious wight!</a>
<a id='line_838'>The grave doth gape, and doting death is near,</a>
<a id='line_839'>Therefore exhale.</a>
<a id='line_840'></a>
<a id='line_841'>BARDOLPH.</a>
<a id='line_842'>Hear me, hear me what I say. He that strikes the first stroke I’ll run</a>
<a id='line_843'>him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.</a>
<a id='line_844'></a>
<a id='line_845'> [_Draws._]</a>
<a id='line_846'></a>
<a id='line_847'>PISTOL.</a>
<a id='line_848'>An oath of mickle might; and fury shall abate.</a>

<a id='line_850'>Thy spirits are most tall.</a>
<a id='line_851'></a>
<a id='line_852'>NYM.</a>
<a id='line_853'>I will cut thy throat, one time or other, in fair terms: that is the</a>

<a id='line_856'>PISTOL.</a>
<a id='line_857'>“Couple a gorge!”</a>
<a id='line_858'>That is the word. I thee defy again.</a>
<a id='line_859'>O hound of Crete, think’st thou my spouse to get?</a>
<a id='line_860'>No! to the spital go,</a>
<a id='line_861'>And from the powdering tub of infamy</a>
<a id='line_862'>Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid’s kind,</a>
<a id='line_863'>Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse.</a>
<a id='line_864'>I have, and I will hold, the quondam Quickly</a>

<a id='line_868'> Enter the Boy.</a>
<a id='line_869'></a>
<a id='line_870'>BOY.</a>
<a id='line_871'>Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master, and you, hostess. He is</a>
<a id='line_872'>very sick, and would to bed. Good Bardolph, put thy face between his</a>
<a id='line_873'>sheets, and do the office of a warming-pan. Faith, he’s very ill.</a>
<a id='line_874'></a>
<a id='line_875'>BARDOLPH.</a>

<a id='line_1680'>not be man to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to a man.</a>
<a id='line_1681'>For Bardolph, he is white-liver’d and red-fac’d; by the means whereof</a>
<a id='line_1682'>’a faces it out, but fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue</a>
<a id='line_1683'>and a quiet sword; by the means whereof ’a breaks words, and keeps</a>
<a id='line_1684'>whole weapons. For Nym, he hath heard that men of few words are the</a>
<a id='line_1685'>best men; and therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest ’a should be</a>
<a id='line_1686'>thought a coward. But his few bad words are match’d with as few good</a>
<a id='line_1687'>deeds; for ’a never broke any man’s head but his own, and that was</a>
<a id='line_1688'>against a post when he was drunk. They will steal anything, and call it</a>
<a id='line_1689'>purchase. Bardolph stole a lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold</a>
<a id='line_1690'>it for three half-pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in</a>
<a id='line_1691'>filching, and in Calais they stole a fire-shovel. I knew by that piece</a>
<a id='line_1692'>of service the men would carry coals. They would have me as familiar</a>
<a id='line_1693'>with men’s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers; which makes</a>
<a id='line_1694'>much against my manhood, if I should take from another’s pocket to put</a>
<a id='line_1695'>into mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I must leave them,</a>
<a id='line_1696'>and seek some better service. Their villainy goes against my weak</a>

<a id='line_2174'>By your patience, Anchient Pistol. Fortune is painted blind, with a</a>
<a id='line_2175'>muffler afore his eyes, to signify to you that Fortune is blind; and</a>
<a id='line_2176'>she is painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which is the moral</a>
<a id='line_2177'>of it, that she is turning, and inconstant, and mutability, and</a>
<a id='line_2178'>variation; and her foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,</a>
<a id='line_2179'>which rolls, and rolls, and rolls. In good truth, the poet makes a most</a>

<a id='line_2187'>And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate.</a>

<a id='line_2303'>ransom; which must proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we</a>
<a id='line_2304'>have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in weight to re-answer,</a>

<a id='line_2391'>What a long night is this! I will not change my horse with any that</a>

<a id='line_2393'>entrails were hairs; _le cheval volant_, the Pegasus, _qui a les</a>
<a id='line_2394'>narines de feu!_ When I bestride him, I soar, I am a hawk. He trots the</a>

<a id='line_2420'>theme as fluent as the sea; turn the sands into eloquent tongues, and</a>
<a id='line_2421'>my horse is argument for them all. ’Tis a subject for a sovereign to</a>

<a id='line_2908'>tide.</a>
<a id='line_2909'></a>
<a id='line_2910'>BATES.</a>
<a id='line_2911'>He hath not told his thought to the King?</a>
<a id='line_2912'></a>
<a id='line_2913'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_2914'>No; nor it is not meet he should. For though I speak it to you, I think</a>
<a id='line_2915'>the King is but a man as I am. The violet smells to him as it doth to</a>
<a id='line_2916'>me; the element shows to him as it doth to me; all his senses have but</a>
<a id='line_2917'>human conditions. His ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears</a>
<a id='line_2918'>but a man; and though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet,</a>
<a id='line_2919'>when they stoop, they stoop with the like wing. Therefore, when he sees</a>
<a id='line_2920'>reason of fears as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same</a>
<a id='line_2921'>relish as ours are; yet, in reason, no man should possess him with any</a>
<a id='line_2922'>appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army.</a>
<a id='line_2923'></a>
<a id='line_2924'>BATES.</a>
<a id='line_2925'>He may show what outward courage he will; but I believe, as cold a</a>
<a id='line_2926'>night as ’tis, he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I</a>
<a id='line_2927'>would he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.</a>
<a id='line_2928'></a>
<a id='line_2929'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_2930'>By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the King: I think he would</a>
<a id='line_2931'>not wish himself anywhere but where he is.</a>
<a id='line_2932'></a>
<a id='line_2933'>BATES.</a>
<a id='line_2934'>Then I would he were here alone; so should he be sure to be ransomed,</a>
<a id='line_2935'>and a many poor men’s lives saved.</a>
<a id='line_2936'></a>
<a id='line_2937'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_2938'>I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here alone, howsoever</a>
<a id='line_2939'>you speak this to feel other men’s minds. Methinks I could not die</a>
<a id='line_2940'>anywhere so contented as in the King’s company, his cause being just</a>
<a id='line_2941'>and his quarrel honourable.</a>
<a id='line_2942'></a>
<a id='line_2943'>WILLIAMS.</a>
<a id='line_2944'>That’s more than we know.</a>
<a id='line_2945'></a>
<a id='line_2946'>BATES.</a>
<a id='line_2947'>Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know enough, if we know</a>
<a id='line_2948'>we are the King’s subjects. If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the</a>
<a id='line_2949'>King wipes the crime of it out of us.</a>
<a id='line_2950'></a>
<a id='line_2951'>WILLIAMS.</a>
<a id='line_2952'>But if the cause be not good, the King himself hath a heavy reckoning</a>
<a id='line_2953'>to make, when all those legs and arms and heads, chopp’d off in a</a>
<a id='line_2954'>battle, shall join together at the latter day and cry all, “We died at</a>
<a id='line_2955'>such a place”; some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon</a>
<a id='line_2956'>their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some</a>
<a id='line_2957'>upon their children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die well that</a>
<a id='line_2958'>die in a battle; for how can they charitably dispose of anything, when</a>
<a id='line_2959'>blood is their argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it will be</a>
<a id='line_2960'>a black matter for the King that led them to it; who to disobey were</a>
<a id='line_2961'>against all proportion of subjection.</a>
<a id='line_2962'></a>
<a id='line_2963'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_2964'>So, if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully</a>
<a id='line_2965'>miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule,</a>
<a id='line_2966'>should be imposed upon his father that sent him; or if a servant, under</a>
<a id='line_2967'>his master’s command transporting a sum of money, be assailed by</a>
<a id='line_2968'>robbers and die in many irreconcil’d iniquities, you may call the</a>
<a id='line_2969'>business of the master the author of the servant’s damnation. But this</a>
<a id='line_2970'>is not so. The King is not bound to answer the particular endings of</a>
<a id='line_2971'>his soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant; for</a>
<a id='line_2972'>they purpose not their death, when they purpose their services.</a>
<a id='line_2973'>Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come</a>
<a id='line_2974'>to the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all unspotted</a>
<a id='line_2975'>soldiers. Some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and</a>
<a id='line_2976'>contrived murder; some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of</a>
<a id='line_2977'>perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that have before gored</a>
<a id='line_2978'>the gentle bosom of Peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men</a>
<a id='line_2979'>have defeated the law and outrun native punishment, though they can</a>
<a id='line_2980'>outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God. War is his beadle,</a>
<a id='line_2981'>war is his vengeance; so that here men are punish’d for before-breach</a>
<a id='line_2982'>of the King’s laws in now the King’s quarrel. Where they feared the</a>
<a id='line_2983'>death, they have borne life away; and where they would be safe, they</a>
<a id='line_2984'>perish. Then if they die unprovided, no more is the King guilty of</a>
<a id='line_2985'>their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the</a>
<a id='line_2986'>which they are now visited. Every subject’s duty is the King’s; but</a>
<a id='line_2987'>every subject’s soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in the</a>
<a id='line_2988'>wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every mote out of his</a>
<a id='line_2989'>conscience; and dying so, death is to him advantage; or not dying, the</a>
<a id='line_2990'>time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained; and in him</a>
<a id='line_2991'>that escapes, it were not sin to think that, making God so free an</a>
<a id='line_2992'>offer, He let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach</a>
<a id='line_2993'>others how they should prepare.</a>
<a id='line_2994'></a>
<a id='line_2995'>WILLIAMS.</a>
<a id='line_2996'>’Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon his own head, the</a>
<a id='line_2997'>King is not to answer for it.</a>
<a id='line_2998'></a>
<a id='line_2999'>BATES.</a>
<a id='line_3000'>I do not desire he should answer for me; and yet I determine to fight</a>
<a id='line_3001'>lustily for him.</a>
<a id='line_3002'></a>
<a id='line_3003'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_3004'>I myself heard the King say he would not be ransom’d.</a>
<a id='line_3005'></a>
<a id='line_3006'>WILLIAMS.</a>
<a id='line_3007'>Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully; but when our throats are</a>
<a id='line_3008'>cut, he may be ransom’d, and we ne’er the wiser.</a>
<a id='line_3009'></a>
<a id='line_3010'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_3011'>If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.</a>
<a id='line_3012'></a>
<a id='line_3013'>WILLIAMS.</a>
<a id='line_3014'>You pay him then. That’s a perilous shot out of an elder-gun, that a</a>
<a id='line_3015'>poor and a private displeasure can do against a monarch! You may as</a>
<a id='line_3016'>well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a</a>
<a id='line_3017'>peacock’s feather. You’ll never trust his word after! Come, ’tis a</a>
<a id='line_3018'>foolish saying.</a>
<a id='line_3019'></a>
<a id='line_3020'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_3021'>Your reproof is something too round. I should be angry with you, if the</a>
<a id='line_3022'>time were convenient.</a>
<a id='line_3023'></a>
<a id='line_3024'>WILLIAMS.</a>
<a id='line_3025'>Let it be a quarrel between us if you live.</a>
<a id='line_3026'></a>

<a id='line_3032'></a>
<a id='line_3033'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_3034'>Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my bonnet; then, if</a>
<a id='line_3035'>ever thou dar’st acknowledge it, I will make it my quarrel.</a>
<a id='line_3036'></a>

<a id='line_3052'>Thou dar’st as well be hang’d.</a>
<a id='line_3053'></a>

<a id='line_3055'>Well, I will do it, though I take thee in the King’s company.</a>
<a id='line_3056'></a>
<a id='line_3057'>WILLIAMS.</a>

<a id='line_3065'>Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to one they will beat</a>

<a id='line_4588'></a>
<a id='line_4589'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_4590'>The Princess is the better Englishwoman. I’ faith, Kate, my wooing is</a>
<a id='line_4591'>fit for thy understanding. I am glad thou canst speak no better</a>
<a id='line_4592'>English; for if thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king</a>
<a id='line_4593'>that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown. I know no</a>
<a id='line_4594'>ways to mince it in love, but directly to say, “I love you”; then if</a>
<a id='line_4595'>you urge me farther than to say, “Do you in faith?” I wear out my suit.</a>
<a id='line_4596'>Give me your answer; i’ faith, do; and so clap hands and a bargain. How</a>
<a id='line_4597'>say you, lady?</a>
<a id='line_4598'></a>
<a id='line_4599'>KATHARINE.</a>
<a id='line_4600'>_Sauf votre honneur_, me understand well.</a>
<a id='line_4601'></a>
<a id='line_4602'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_4603'>Marry, if you would put me to verses, or to dance for your sake, Kate,</a>
<a id='line_4604'>why you undid me; for the one, I have neither words nor measure, and</a>
<a id='line_4605'>for the other I have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure</a>
<a id='line_4606'>in strength. If I could win a lady at leap-frog, or by vaulting into my</a>
<a id='line_4607'>saddle with my armour on my back, under the correction of bragging be</a>
<a id='line_4608'>it spoken, I should quickly leap into a wife. Or if I might buffet for</a>
<a id='line_4609'>my love, or bound my horse for her favours, I could lay on like a</a>
<a id='line_4610'>butcher and sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God, Kate,</a>
<a id='line_4611'>I cannot look greenly, nor gasp out my eloquence, nor I have no cunning</a>
<a id='line_4612'>in protestation; only downright oaths, which I never use till urg’d,</a>
<a id='line_4613'>nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a fellow of this temper,</a>
<a id='line_4614'>Kate, whose face is not worth sunburning, that never looks in his glass</a>
<a id='line_4615'>for love of anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook. I speak</a>
<a id='line_4616'>to thee plain soldier. If thou canst love me for this, take me; if not,</a>
<a id='line_4617'>to say to thee that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the</a>
<a id='line_4618'>Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou liv’st, dear Kate, take a</a>
<a id='line_4619'>fellow of plain and uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee</a>
<a id='line_4620'>right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other places; for these</a>
<a id='line_4621'>fellows of infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into ladies’</a>
<a id='line_4622'>favours, they do always reason themselves out again. What! a speaker is</a>
<a id='line_4623'>but a prater: a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight</a>
<a id='line_4624'>back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl’d pate will grow</a>
<a id='line_4625'>bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good</a>
<a id='line_4626'>heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon; or rather the sun and not the</a>
<a id='line_4627'>moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course</a>
<a id='line_4628'>truly. If thou would have such a one, take me; and take me, take a</a>
<a id='line_4629'>soldier; take a soldier, take a king. And what say’st thou then to my</a>
<a id='line_4630'>love? Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.</a>
<a id='line_4631'></a>
<a id='line_4632'>KATHARINE.</a>
<a id='line_4633'>Is it possible dat I should love de enemy of France?</a>
<a id='line_4634'></a>
<a id='line_4635'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_4636'>No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate; but,</a>
<a id='line_4637'>in loving me, you should love the friend of France; for I love France</a>
<a id='line_4638'>so well that I will not part with a village of it, I will have it all</a>
<a id='line_4639'>mine; and, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then yours is</a>
<a id='line_4640'>France and you are mine.</a>
<a id='line_4641'></a>
<a id='line_4642'>KATHARINE.</a>
<a id='line_4643'>I cannot tell wat is dat.</a>
<a id='line_4644'></a>
<a id='line_4645'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_4646'>No, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I am sure will hang upon my</a>
<a id='line_4647'>tongue like a new-married wife about her husband’s neck, hardly to be</a>
<a id='line_4648'>shook off. _Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand vous avez le</a>
<a id='line_4649'>possession de moi_,—let me see, what then? Saint Denis be my</a>
<a id='line_4650'>speed!—_donc votre est France, et vous êtes mienne._ It is as easy for</a>
<a id='line_4651'>me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French. I</a>
<a id='line_4652'>shall never move thee in French, unless it be to laugh at me.</a>
<a id='line_4653'></a>
<a id='line_4654'>KATHARINE.</a>
<a id='line_4655'>_Sauf votre honneur, le français que vous parlez, il est meilleur que</a>

<a id='line_4657'></a>
<a id='line_4658'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_4659'>No, faith, is’t not, Kate; but thy speaking of my tongue, and I thine,</a>
<a id='line_4660'>most truly-falsely, must needs be granted to be much at one. But, Kate,</a>
<a id='line_4661'>dost thou understand thus much English: canst thou love me?</a>
<a id='line_4662'></a>
<a id='line_4663'>KATHARINE.</a>
<a id='line_4664'>I cannot tell.</a>
<a id='line_4665'></a>
<a id='line_4666'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_4667'>Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I’ll ask them. Come, I know thou</a>
<a id='line_4668'>lovest me; and at night, when you come into your closet, you’ll</a>
<a id='line_4669'>question this gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to her</a>
<a id='line_4670'>dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart. But, good</a>
<a id='line_4671'>Kate, mock me mercifully; the rather, gentle princess, because I love</a>
<a id='line_4672'>thee cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a saving faith</a>
<a id='line_4673'>within me tells me thou shalt, I get thee with scambling, and thou must</a>
<a id='line_4674'>therefore needs prove a good soldier-breeder. Shall not thou and I,</a>
<a id='line_4675'>between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a boy, half French, half</a>
<a id='line_4676'>English, that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the</a>
<a id='line_4677'>beard? Shall we not? What say’st thou, my fair flower-de-luce?</a>
<a id='line_4678'></a>
<a id='line_4679'>KATHARINE.</a>
<a id='line_4680'>I do not know dat.</a>
<a id='line_4681'></a>
<a id='line_4682'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_4683'>No; ’tis hereafter to know, but now to promise. Do but now promise,</a>
<a id='line_4684'>Kate, you will endeavour for your French part of such a boy; and for my</a>
<a id='line_4685'>English moiety, take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer you,</a>
<a id='line_4686'>_la plus belle Katherine du monde, mon très cher et divin déesse?_</a>
<a id='line_4687'></a>
<a id='line_4688'>KATHARINE.</a>
<a id='line_4689'>Your Majestee ’ave _fausse_ French enough to deceive de most _sage</a>

<a id='line_4691'></a>
<a id='line_4692'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_4693'>Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in true English, I love</a>
<a id='line_4694'>thee, Kate; by which honour I dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my</a>
<a id='line_4695'>blood begins to flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor and</a>
<a id='line_4696'>untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew my father’s ambition! He</a>
<a id='line_4697'>was thinking of civil wars when he got me; therefore was I created with</a>
<a id='line_4698'>a stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when I come to woo</a>
<a id='line_4699'>ladies, I fright them. But, in faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the better</a>
<a id='line_4700'>I shall appear. My comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of</a>
<a id='line_4701'>beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face. Thou hast me, if thou hast</a>
<a id='line_4702'>me, at the worst; and thou shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and</a>
<a id='line_4703'>better; and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you have me?</a>
<a id='line_4704'>Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the thoughts of your heart with the</a>
<a id='line_4705'>looks of an empress; take me by the hand, and say, Harry of England, I</a>
<a id='line_4706'>am thine; which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal, but I</a>
<a id='line_4707'>will tell thee aloud, England is thine, Ireland is thine, France is</a>
<a id='line_4708'>thine, and Henry Plantagenet is thine; who, though I speak it before</a>
<a id='line_4709'>his face, if he be not fellow with the best king, thou shalt find the</a>
<a id='line_4710'>best king of good fellows. Come, your answer in broken music; for thy</a>
<a id='line_4711'>voice is music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of all,</a>
<a id='line_4712'>Katharine, break thy mind to me in broken English. Wilt thou have me?</a>
<a id='line_4713'></a>
<a id='line_4714'>KATHARINE.</a>
<a id='line_4715'>Dat is as it shall please _le roi mon père_.</a>
<a id='line_4716'></a>
<a id='line_4717'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_4718'>Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall please him, Kate.</a>
<a id='line_4719'></a>
<a id='line_4720'>KATHARINE.</a>
<a id='line_4721'>Den it sall also content me.</a>
<a id='line_4722'></a>
<a id='line_4723'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_4724'>Upon that I kiss your hand, and call you my queen.</a>

<a id='line_4751'></a>
<a id='line_4752'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_4753'>It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are</a>

<a id='line_4755'></a>
<a id='line_4756'>ALICE.</a>
<a id='line_4757'>_Oui, vraiment._</a>
<a id='line_4758'></a>
<a id='line_4759'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_4760'>O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear Kate, you and I cannot</a>
<a id='line_4761'>be confined within the weak list of a country’s fashion. We are the</a>
<a id='line_4762'>makers of manners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our places stops</a>
<a id='line_4763'>the mouth of all find-faults, as I will do yours, for upholding the</a>
<a id='line_4764'>nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss; therefore, patiently</a>
<a id='line_4765'>and yielding. [_Kissing her._] You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate;</a>
<a id='line_4766'>there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of</a>
<a id='line_4767'>the French council; and they should sooner persuade Harry of England</a>
<a id='line_4768'>than a general petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.</a>
<a id='line_4769'></a>
<a id='line_4770'> Enter the French Power and the English Lords.</a>
<a id='line_4771'></a>
<a id='line_4772'>BURGUNDY.</a>
<a id='line_4773'>God save your Majesty! My royal cousin, teach you our princess English?</a>
<a id='line_4774'></a>
<a id='line_4775'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_4776'>I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I love her; and</a>
<a id='line_4777'>that is good English.</a>
<a id='line_4778'></a>
<a id='line_4779'>BURGUNDY.</a>
<a id='line_4780'>Is she not apt?</a>
<a id='line_4781'></a>
<a id='line_4782'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_4783'>Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not smooth; so that,</a>
<a id='line_4784'>having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot</a>
<a id='line_4785'>so conjure up the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in his</a>
<a id='line_4786'>true likeness.</a>
<a id='line_4787'></a>
<a id='line_4788'>BURGUNDY.</a>
<a id='line_4789'>Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you for that. If you</a>
<a id='line_4790'>would conjure in her, you must make a circle; if conjure up Love in her</a>
<a id='line_4791'>in his true likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you blame her</a>
<a id='line_4792'>then, being a maid yet ros’d over with the virgin crimson of modesty,</a>
<a id='line_4793'>if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing</a>
<a id='line_4794'>self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid to consign to.</a>
<a id='line_4795'></a>
<a id='line_4796'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_4797'>Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.</a>
<a id='line_4798'></a>
<a id='line_4799'>BURGUNDY.</a>
<a id='line_4800'>They are then excus’d, my lord, when they see not what they do.</a>
<a id='line_4801'></a>
<a id='line_4802'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_4803'>Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.</a>
<a id='line_4804'></a>
<a id='line_4805'>BURGUNDY.</a>
<a id='line_4806'>I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will teach her to know</a>
<a id='line_4807'>my meaning; for maids, well summer’d and warm kept, are like flies at</a>
<a id='line_4808'>Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their eyes; and then they</a>
<a id='line_4809'>will endure handling, which before would not abide looking on.</a>
<a id='line_4810'></a>
<a id='line_4811'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_4812'>This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer; and so I shall catch</a>
<a id='line_4813'>the fly, your cousin, in the latter end, and she must be blind too.</a>
<a id='line_4814'></a>
<a id='line_4815'>BURGUNDY.</a>
<a id='line_4816'>As love is, my lord, before it loves.</a>
<a id='line_4817'></a>
<a id='line_4818'>KING HENRY.</a>
<a id='line_4819'>It is so; and you may, some of you, thank love for my blindness, who</a>
<a id='line_4820'>cannot see many a fair French city for one fair French maid that stands</a>

<a id='line_4824'>Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities turn’d into a</a>
