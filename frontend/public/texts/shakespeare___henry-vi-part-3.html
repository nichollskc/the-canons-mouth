<a id='line_41'>WARWICK, and soldiers, with white roses in their hats</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>  WARWICK. I wonder how the King escap'd our hands.</a>
<a id='line_44'>  YORK. While we pursu'd the horsemen of the north,</a>
<a id='line_45'>    He slily stole away and left his men;</a>
<a id='line_46'>    Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,</a>
<a id='line_47'>    Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,</a>
<a id='line_48'>    Cheer'd up the drooping army, and himself,</a>
<a id='line_49'>    Lord Clifford, and Lord Stafford, all abreast,</a>
<a id='line_50'>    Charg'd our main battle's front, and, breaking in,</a>
<a id='line_51'>    Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.</a>
<a id='line_52'>  EDWARD. Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,</a>
<a id='line_53'>    Is either slain or wounded dangerous;</a>
<a id='line_54'>    I cleft his beaver with a downright blow.</a>
<a id='line_55'>    That this is true, father, behold his blood.</a>
<a id='line_56'>  MONTAGUE. And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,</a>
<a id='line_57'>    Whom I encount'red as the battles join'd.</a>
<a id='line_58'>  RICHARD. Speak thou for me, and tell them what I did.</a>
<a id='line_59'>                                 [Throwing down SOMERSET'S head]</a>
<a id='line_60'>  YORK. Richard hath best deserv'd of all my sons.</a>
<a id='line_61'>    But is your Grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?</a>
<a id='line_62'>  NORFOLK. Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!</a>
<a id='line_63'>  RICHARD. Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.</a>
<a id='line_64'>  WARWICK. And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,</a>
<a id='line_65'>    Before I see thee seated in that throne</a>
<a id='line_66'>    Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,</a>
<a id='line_67'>    I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.</a>
<a id='line_68'>    This is the palace of the fearful King,</a>
<a id='line_69'>    And this the regal seat. Possess it, York;</a>
<a id='line_70'>    For this is thine, and not King Henry's heirs'.</a>
<a id='line_71'>  YORK. Assist me then, sweet Warwick, and I will;</a>
<a id='line_72'>    For hither we have broken in by force.</a>
<a id='line_73'>  NORFOLK. We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.</a>
<a id='line_74'>  YORK. Thanks, gentle Norfolk. Stay by me, my lords;</a>
<a id='line_75'>    And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.</a>
<a id='line_76'>                                                    [They go up]</a>
<a id='line_77'>  WARWICK. And when the King comes, offer him no violence.</a>
<a id='line_78'>    Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.</a>
<a id='line_79'>  YORK. The Queen this day here holds her parliament,</a>
<a id='line_80'>    But little thinks we shall be of her council.</a>
<a id='line_81'>    By words or blows here let us win our right.</a>
<a id='line_82'>  RICHARD. Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.</a>
<a id='line_83'>  WARWICK. The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,</a>
<a id='line_84'>    Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be King,</a>
<a id='line_85'>    And bashful Henry depos'd, whose cowardice</a>
<a id='line_86'>    Hath made us by-words to our enemies.</a>
<a id='line_87'>  YORK. Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute:</a>
<a id='line_88'>    I mean to take possession of my right.</a>
<a id='line_89'>  WARWICK. Neither the King, nor he that loves him best,</a>
<a id='line_90'>    The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,</a>
<a id='line_91'>    Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells.</a>
<a id='line_92'>    I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares.</a>
<a id='line_93'>    Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.</a>

<a id='line_99'></a>
<a id='line_100'>  KING HENRY. My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,</a>
<a id='line_101'>    Even in the chair of state! Belike he means,</a>
<a id='line_102'>    Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,</a>
<a id='line_103'>    To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.</a>
<a id='line_104'>    Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father;</a>
<a id='line_105'>    And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge</a>
<a id='line_106'>    On him, his sons, his favourites, and his friends.</a>
<a id='line_107'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. If I be not, heavens be reveng'd on me!</a>
<a id='line_108'>  CLIFFORD. The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.</a>
<a id='line_109'>  WESTMORELAND. What, shall we suffer this? Let's pluck him down;</a>
<a id='line_110'>    My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.</a>
<a id='line_111'>  KING HENRY. Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.</a>
<a id='line_112'>  CLIFFORD. Patience is for poltroons such as he;</a>
<a id='line_113'>    He durst not sit there had your father liv'd.</a>
<a id='line_114'>    My gracious lord, here in the parliament</a>
<a id='line_115'>    Let us assail the family of York.</a>
<a id='line_116'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Well hast thou spoken, cousin; be it so.</a>
<a id='line_117'>  KING HENRY. Ah, know you not the city favours them,</a>
<a id='line_118'>    And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?</a>
<a id='line_119'>  EXETER. But when the Duke is slain they'll quickly fly.</a>
<a id='line_120'>  KING HENRY. Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,</a>
<a id='line_121'>    To make a shambles of the parliament house!</a>
<a id='line_122'>    Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words, and threats,</a>
<a id='line_123'>    Shall be the war that Henry means to use.</a>
<a id='line_124'>    Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne</a>
<a id='line_125'>    And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;</a>
<a id='line_126'>    I am thy sovereign.</a>
<a id='line_127'>  YORK. I am thine.</a>
<a id='line_128'>  EXETER. For shame, come down; he made thee Duke of York.</a>
<a id='line_129'>  YORK. 'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.</a>
<a id='line_130'>  EXETER. Thy father was a traitor to the crown.</a>
<a id='line_131'>  WARWICK. Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown</a>
<a id='line_132'>    In following this usurping Henry.</a>
<a id='line_133'>  CLIFFORD. Whom should he follow but his natural king?</a>
<a id='line_134'>  WARWICK. True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.</a>
<a id='line_135'>  KING HENRY. And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?</a>
<a id='line_136'>  YORK. It must and shall be so; content thyself.</a>
<a id='line_137'>  WARWICK. Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be King.</a>
<a id='line_138'>  WESTMORELAND. He is both King and Duke of Lancaster;</a>
<a id='line_139'>    And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.</a>
<a id='line_140'>  WARWICK. And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget</a>
<a id='line_141'>    That we are those which chas'd you from the field,</a>
<a id='line_142'>    And slew your fathers, and with colours spread</a>
<a id='line_143'>    March'd through the city to the palace gates.</a>
<a id='line_144'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;</a>
<a id='line_145'>    And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.</a>
<a id='line_146'>  WESTMORELAND. Plantagenet, of thee, and these thy sons,</a>
<a id='line_147'>    Thy kinsmen, and thy friends, I'll have more lives</a>
<a id='line_148'>    Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.</a>
<a id='line_149'>  CLIFFORD. Urge it no more; lest that instead of words</a>
<a id='line_150'>    I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger</a>
<a id='line_151'>    As shall revenge his death before I stir.</a>
<a id='line_152'>  WARWICK. Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!</a>
<a id='line_153'>  YORK. Will you we show our title to the crown?</a>
<a id='line_154'>    If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.</a>
<a id='line_155'>  KING HENRY. What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?</a>
<a id='line_156'>    Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;</a>
<a id='line_157'>    Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:</a>
<a id='line_158'>    I am the son of Henry the Fifth,</a>
<a id='line_159'>    Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop,</a>
<a id='line_160'>    And seiz'd upon their towns and provinces.</a>
<a id='line_161'>  WARWICK. Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.</a>
<a id='line_162'>  KING HENRY. The Lord Protector lost it, and not I:</a>
<a id='line_163'>    When I was crown'd, I was but nine months old.</a>
<a id='line_164'>  RICHARD. You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.</a>
<a id='line_165'>    Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.</a>
<a id='line_166'>  EDWARD. Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.</a>
<a id='line_167'>  MONTAGUE. Good brother, as thou lov'st and honourest arms,</a>
<a id='line_168'>    Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.</a>
<a id='line_169'>  RICHARD. Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly.</a>
<a id='line_170'>  YORK. Sons, peace!</a>
<a id='line_171'>  KING HENRY. Peace thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.</a>
<a id='line_172'>  WARWICK. Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords;</a>
<a id='line_173'>    And be you silent and attentive too,</a>
<a id='line_174'>    For he that interrupts him shall not live.</a>
<a id='line_175'>  KING HENRY. Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,</a>
<a id='line_176'>    Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?</a>
<a id='line_177'>    No; first shall war unpeople this my realm;</a>
<a id='line_178'>    Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,</a>
<a id='line_179'>    And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,</a>
<a id='line_180'>    Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?</a>
<a id='line_181'>    My title's good, and better far than his.</a>
<a id='line_182'>  WARWICK. Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.</a>
<a id='line_183'>  KING HENRY. Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.</a>
<a id='line_184'>  YORK. 'Twas by rebellion against his king.</a>
<a id='line_185'>  KING HENRY. [Aside] I know not what to say; my title's weak.-</a>
<a id='line_186'>    Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?</a>
<a id='line_187'>  YORK. What then?</a>
<a id='line_188'>  KING HENRY. An if he may, then am I lawful King;</a>
<a id='line_189'>    For Richard, in the view of many lords,</a>
<a id='line_190'>    Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,</a>
<a id='line_191'>    Whose heir my father was, and I am his.</a>
<a id='line_192'>  YORK. He rose against him, being his sovereign,</a>
<a id='line_193'>    And made him to resign his crown perforce.</a>
<a id='line_194'>  WARWICK. Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,</a>
<a id='line_195'>    Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?</a>
<a id='line_196'>  EXETER. No; for he could not so resign his crown</a>
<a id='line_197'>    But that the next heir should succeed and reign.</a>
<a id='line_198'>  KING HENRY. Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?</a>
<a id='line_199'>  EXETER. His is the right, and therefore pardon me.</a>
<a id='line_200'>  YORK. Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?</a>
<a id='line_201'>  EXETER. My conscience tells me he is lawful King.</a>
<a id='line_202'>  KING HENRY. [Aside] All will revolt from me, and turn to him.</a>
<a id='line_203'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,</a>
<a id='line_204'>    Think not that Henry shall be so depos'd.</a>
<a id='line_205'>  WARWICK. Depos'd he shall be, in despite of all.</a>
<a id='line_206'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Thou art deceiv'd. 'Tis not thy southern power</a>
<a id='line_207'>    Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,</a>
<a id='line_208'>    Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,</a>
<a id='line_209'>    Can set the Duke up in despite of me.</a>
<a id='line_210'>  CLIFFORD. King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,</a>
<a id='line_211'>    Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence.</a>
<a id='line_212'>    May that ground gape, and swallow me alive,</a>
<a id='line_213'>    Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!</a>
<a id='line_214'>  KING HENRY. O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!</a>
<a id='line_215'>  YORK. Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.</a>
<a id='line_216'>    What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?</a>
<a id='line_217'>  WARWICK. Do right unto this princely Duke of York;</a>
<a id='line_218'>    Or I will fill the house with armed men,</a>
<a id='line_219'>    And over the chair of state, where now he sits,</a>

<a id='line_227'>  KING HENRY. I am content. Richard Plantagenet,</a>
<a id='line_228'>    Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.</a>
<a id='line_229'>  CLIFFORD. What wrong is this unto the Prince your son!</a>
<a id='line_230'>  WARWICK. What good is this to England and himself!</a>
<a id='line_231'>  WESTMORELAND. Base, fearful, and despairing Henry!</a>

<a id='line_688'>ACT II. SCENE I. A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire</a>
<a id='line_689'></a>
<a id='line_690'>A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power</a>
<a id='line_691'></a>
<a id='line_692'>  EDWARD. I wonder how our princely father scap'd,</a>
<a id='line_693'>    Or whether he be scap'd away or no</a>
<a id='line_694'>    From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit.</a>
<a id='line_695'>    Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;</a>
<a id='line_696'>    Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;</a>
<a id='line_697'>    Or had he scap'd, methinks we should have heard</a>
<a id='line_698'>    The happy tidings of his good escape.</a>
<a id='line_699'>    How fares my brother? Why is he so sad?</a>
<a id='line_700'>  RICHARD. I cannot joy until I be resolv'd</a>
<a id='line_701'>    Where our right valiant father is become.</a>
<a id='line_702'>    I saw him in the battle range about,</a>
<a id='line_703'>    And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.</a>
<a id='line_704'>    Methought he bore him in the thickest troop</a>
<a id='line_705'>    As doth a lion in a herd of neat;</a>
<a id='line_706'>    Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,</a>
<a id='line_707'>    Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,</a>
<a id='line_708'>    The rest stand all aloof and bark at him.</a>
<a id='line_709'>    So far'd our father with his enemies;</a>
<a id='line_710'>    So fled his enemies my warlike father.</a>
<a id='line_711'>    Methinks 'tis prize enough to be his son.</a>
<a id='line_712'>    See how the morning opes her golden gates</a>
<a id='line_713'>    And takes her farewell of the glorious sun.</a>
<a id='line_714'>    How well resembles it the prime of youth,</a>
<a id='line_715'>    Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!</a>
<a id='line_716'>  EDWARD. Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?</a>
<a id='line_717'>  RICHARD. Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;</a>
<a id='line_718'>    Not separated with the racking clouds,</a>
<a id='line_719'>    But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.</a>
<a id='line_720'>    See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,</a>
<a id='line_721'>    As if they vow'd some league inviolable.</a>
<a id='line_722'>    Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.</a>
<a id='line_723'>    In this the heaven figures some event.</a>
<a id='line_724'>  EDWARD. 'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.</a>
<a id='line_725'>    I think it cites us, brother, to the field,</a>
<a id='line_726'>    That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,</a>
<a id='line_727'>    Each one already blazing by our meeds,</a>
<a id='line_728'>    Should notwithstanding join our lights together</a>
<a id='line_729'>    And overshine the earth, as this the world.</a>
<a id='line_730'>    Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear</a>
<a id='line_731'>    Upon my target three fair shining suns.</a>
<a id='line_732'>  RICHARD. Nay, bear three daughters- by your leave I speak it,</a>
<a id='line_733'>    You love the breeder better than the male.</a>
<a id='line_734'></a>
<a id='line_735'>                 Enter a MESSENGER, blowing</a>
<a id='line_736'></a>
<a id='line_737'>    But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell</a>
<a id='line_738'>    Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?</a>
<a id='line_739'>  MESSENGER. Ah, one that was a woeful looker-on</a>
<a id='line_740'>    When as the noble Duke of York was slain,</a>
<a id='line_741'>    Your princely father and my loving lord!</a>
<a id='line_742'>  EDWARD. O, speak no more! for I have heard too much.</a>
<a id='line_743'>  RICHARD. Say how he died, for I will hear it all.</a>
<a id='line_744'>  MESSENGER. Environed he was with many foes,</a>
<a id='line_745'>    And stood against them as the hope of Troy</a>
<a id='line_746'>    Against the Greeks that would have ent'red Troy.</a>
<a id='line_747'>    But Hercules himself must yield to odds;</a>
<a id='line_748'>    And many strokes, though with a little axe,</a>
<a id='line_749'>    Hews down and fells the hardest-timber'd oak.</a>
<a id='line_750'>    By many hands your father was subdu'd;</a>
<a id='line_751'>    But only slaught'red by the ireful arm</a>
<a id='line_752'>    Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_753'>    Who crown'd the gracious Duke in high despite,</a>
<a id='line_754'>    Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,</a>
<a id='line_755'>    The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks</a>
<a id='line_756'>    A napkin steeped in the harmless blood</a>
<a id='line_757'>    Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain;</a>
<a id='line_758'>    And after many scorns, many foul taunts,</a>
<a id='line_759'>    They took his head, and on the gates of York</a>
<a id='line_760'>    They set the same; and there it doth remain,</a>
<a id='line_761'>    The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.</a>
<a id='line_762'>  EDWARD. Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,</a>
<a id='line_763'>    Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.</a>
<a id='line_764'>    O Clifford, boist'rous Clifford, thou hast slain</a>
<a id='line_765'>    The flow'r of Europe for his chivalry;</a>
<a id='line_766'>    And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,</a>
<a id='line_767'>    For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.</a>
<a id='line_768'>    Now my soul's palace is become a prison.</a>
<a id='line_769'>    Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body</a>
<a id='line_770'>    Might in the ground be closed up in rest!</a>
<a id='line_771'>    For never henceforth shall I joy again;</a>
<a id='line_772'>    Never, O never, shall I see more joy.</a>
<a id='line_773'>  RICHARD. I cannot weep, for all my body's moisture</a>
<a id='line_774'>    Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart;</a>
<a id='line_775'>    Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burden,</a>
<a id='line_776'>    For self-same wind that I should speak withal</a>
<a id='line_777'>    Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,</a>
<a id='line_778'>    And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.</a>
<a id='line_779'>    To weep is to make less the depth of grief.</a>
<a id='line_780'>    Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me!</a>
<a id='line_781'>    Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,</a>
<a id='line_782'>    Or die renowned by attempting it.</a>
<a id='line_783'>  EDWARD. His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;</a>
<a id='line_784'>    His dukedom and his chair with me is left.</a>
<a id='line_785'>  RICHARD. Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,</a>
<a id='line_786'>    Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun;</a>
<a id='line_787'>    For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom, say:</a>
<a id='line_788'>    Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.</a>
<a id='line_789'></a>
<a id='line_790'>         March. Enter WARWICK, MONTAGUE, and their army</a>
<a id='line_791'></a>
<a id='line_792'>  WARWICK. How now, fair lords! What fare? What news abroad?</a>
<a id='line_793'>  RICHARD. Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount</a>
<a id='line_794'>    Our baleful news and at each word's deliverance</a>
<a id='line_795'>    Stab poinards in our flesh till all were told,</a>
<a id='line_796'>    The words would add more anguish than the wounds.</a>
<a id='line_797'>    O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!</a>
<a id='line_798'>  EDWARD. O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet</a>
<a id='line_799'>    Which held thee dearly as his soul's redemption</a>
<a id='line_800'>    Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.</a>
<a id='line_801'>  WARWICK. Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;</a>
<a id='line_802'>    And now, to add more measure to your woes,</a>
<a id='line_803'>    I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.</a>
<a id='line_804'>    After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,</a>
<a id='line_805'>    Where your brave father breath'd his latest gasp,</a>
<a id='line_806'>    Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,</a>
<a id='line_807'>    Were brought me of your loss and his depart.</a>
<a id='line_808'>    I, then in London, keeper of the King,</a>
<a id='line_809'>    Muster'd my soldiers, gathered flocks of friends,</a>
<a id='line_810'>    And very well appointed, as I thought,</a>
<a id='line_811'>    March'd toward Saint Albans to intercept the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_812'>    Bearing the King in my behalf along;</a>
<a id='line_813'>    For by my scouts I was advertised</a>
<a id='line_814'>    That she was coming with a full intent</a>
<a id='line_815'>    To dash our late decree in parliament</a>
<a id='line_816'>    Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.</a>
<a id='line_817'>    Short tale to make- we at Saint Albans met,</a>
<a id='line_818'>    Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought;</a>
<a id='line_819'>    But whether 'twas the coldness of the King,</a>
<a id='line_820'>    Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,</a>
<a id='line_821'>    That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen,</a>
<a id='line_822'>    Or whether 'twas report of her success,</a>
<a id='line_823'>    Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,</a>
<a id='line_824'>    Who thunders to his captives blood and death,</a>
<a id='line_825'>    I cannot judge; but, to conclude with truth,</a>
<a id='line_826'>    Their weapons like to lightning came and went:</a>
<a id='line_827'>    Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight</a>
<a id='line_828'>    Or like an idle thresher with a flail,</a>
<a id='line_829'>    Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.</a>
<a id='line_830'>    I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,</a>
<a id='line_831'>    With promise of high pay and great rewards,</a>
<a id='line_832'>    But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,</a>
<a id='line_833'>    And we in them no hope to win the day;</a>
<a id='line_834'>    So that we fled: the King unto the Queen;</a>
<a id='line_835'>    Lord George your brother, Norfolk, and myself,</a>
<a id='line_836'>    In haste post-haste are come to join with you;</a>
<a id='line_837'>    For in the marches here we heard you were</a>
<a id='line_838'>    Making another head to fight again.</a>
<a id='line_839'>  EDWARD. Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?</a>
<a id='line_840'>    And when came George from Burgundy to England?</a>
<a id='line_841'>  WARWICK. Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers;</a>
<a id='line_842'>    And for your brother, he was lately sent</a>
<a id='line_843'>    From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,</a>
<a id='line_844'>    With aid of soldiers to this needful war.</a>
<a id='line_845'>  RICHARD. 'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled.</a>
<a id='line_846'>    Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,</a>
<a id='line_847'>    But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.</a>
<a id='line_848'>  WARWICK. Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;</a>
<a id='line_849'>    For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine</a>
<a id='line_850'>    Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head</a>
<a id='line_851'>    And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,</a>
<a id='line_852'>    Were he as famous and as bold in war</a>
<a id='line_853'>    As he is fam'd for mildness, peace, and prayer.</a>
<a id='line_854'>  RICHARD. I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not.</a>
<a id='line_855'>    'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.</a>
<a id='line_856'>    But in this troublous time what's to be done?</a>
<a id='line_857'>    Shall we go throw away our coats of steel</a>
<a id='line_858'>    And wrap our bodies in black mourning-gowns,</a>
<a id='line_859'>    Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?</a>
<a id='line_860'>    Or shall we on the helmets of our foes</a>
<a id='line_861'>    Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?</a>
<a id='line_862'>    If for the last, say 'Ay,' and to it, lords.</a>
<a id='line_863'>  WARWICK. Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;</a>
<a id='line_864'>    And therefore comes my brother Montague.</a>
<a id='line_865'>    Attend me, lords. The proud insulting Queen,</a>
<a id='line_866'>    With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,</a>
<a id='line_867'>    And of their feather many moe proud birds,</a>
<a id='line_868'>    Have wrought the easy-melting King like wax.</a>
<a id='line_869'>    He swore consent to your succession,</a>
<a id='line_870'>    His oath enrolled in the parliament;</a>
<a id='line_871'>    And now to London all the crew are gone</a>
<a id='line_872'>    To frustrate both his oath and what beside</a>
<a id='line_873'>    May make against the house of Lancaster.</a>
<a id='line_874'>    Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong.</a>
<a id='line_875'>    Now if the help of Norfolk and myself,</a>
<a id='line_876'>    With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,</a>
<a id='line_877'>    Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,</a>
<a id='line_878'>    Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,</a>
<a id='line_879'>    Why, Via! to London will we march amain,</a>
<a id='line_880'>    And once again bestride our foaming steeds,</a>
<a id='line_881'>    And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'</a>
<a id='line_882'>    But never once again turn back and fly.</a>
<a id='line_883'>  RICHARD. Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.</a>
<a id='line_884'>    Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day</a>
<a id='line_885'>    That cries 'Retire!' if Warwick bid him stay.</a>
<a id='line_886'>  EDWARD. Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;</a>
<a id='line_887'>    And when thou fail'st- as God forbid the hour!-</a>
<a id='line_888'>    Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend.</a>
<a id='line_889'>  WARWICK. No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;</a>
<a id='line_890'>    The next degree is England's royal throne,</a>
<a id='line_891'>    For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd</a>
<a id='line_892'>    In every borough as we pass along;</a>
<a id='line_893'>    And he that throws not up his cap for joy</a>
<a id='line_894'>    Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.</a>
<a id='line_895'>    King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,</a>
<a id='line_896'>    Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,</a>
<a id='line_897'>    But sound the trumpets and about our task.</a>
<a id='line_898'>  RICHARD. Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,</a>
<a id='line_899'>    As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,</a>
<a id='line_900'>    I come to pierce it or to give thee mine.</a>
<a id='line_901'>  EDWARD. Then strike up drums. God and Saint George for us!</a>

<a id='line_916'>NORTHUMBERLAND, with drum and trumpets</a>

<a id='line_918'>  QUEEN MARGARET. Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.</a>
<a id='line_919'>    Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy</a>
<a id='line_920'>    That sought to be encompass'd with your crown.</a>
<a id='line_921'>    Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?</a>
<a id='line_922'>  KING HENRY. Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck-</a>
<a id='line_923'>    To see this sight, it irks my very soul.</a>
<a id='line_924'>    Withhold revenge, dear God; 'tis not my fault,</a>
<a id='line_925'>    Nor wittingly have I infring'd my vow.</a>
<a id='line_926'>  CLIFFORD. My gracious liege, this too much lenity</a>
<a id='line_927'>    And harmful pity must be laid aside.</a>
<a id='line_928'>    To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?</a>
<a id='line_929'>    Not to the beast that would usurp their den.</a>
<a id='line_930'>    Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?</a>
<a id='line_931'>    Not his that spoils her young before her face.</a>
<a id='line_932'>    Who scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?</a>
<a id='line_933'>    Not he that sets his foot upon her back,</a>
<a id='line_934'>    The smallest worm will turn, being trodden on,</a>
<a id='line_935'>    And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.</a>
<a id='line_936'>    Ambitious York did level at thy crown,</a>
<a id='line_937'>    Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows.</a>
<a id='line_938'>    He, but a Duke, would have his son a king,</a>
<a id='line_939'>    And raise his issue like a loving sire:</a>
<a id='line_940'>    Thou, being a king, bless'd with a goodly son,</a>
<a id='line_941'>    Didst yield consent to disinherit him,</a>
<a id='line_942'>    Which argued thee a most unloving father.</a>
<a id='line_943'>    Unreasonable creatures feed their young;</a>
<a id='line_944'>    And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,</a>
<a id='line_945'>    Yet, in protection of their tender ones,</a>
<a id='line_946'>    Who hath not seen them- even with those wings</a>
<a id='line_947'>    Which sometime they have us'd with fearful flight-</a>
<a id='line_948'>    Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,</a>
<a id='line_949'>    Offering their own lives in their young's defence</a>
<a id='line_950'>    For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!</a>
<a id='line_951'>    Were it not pity that this goodly boy</a>
<a id='line_952'>    Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,</a>
<a id='line_953'>    And long hereafter say unto his child</a>
<a id='line_954'>    'What my great-grandfather and grandsire got</a>

<a id='line_956'>    Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;</a>
<a id='line_957'>    And let his manly face, which promiseth</a>
<a id='line_958'>    Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart</a>
<a id='line_959'>    To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.</a>
<a id='line_960'>  KING HENRY. Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,</a>
<a id='line_961'>    Inferring arguments of mighty force.</a>
<a id='line_962'>    But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear</a>
<a id='line_963'>    That things ill got had ever bad success?</a>
<a id='line_964'>    And happy always was it for that son</a>
<a id='line_965'>    Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?</a>
<a id='line_966'>    I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;</a>
<a id='line_967'>    And would my father had left me no more!</a>
<a id='line_968'>    For all the rest is held at such a rate</a>
<a id='line_969'>    As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep</a>
<a id='line_970'>    Than in possession any jot of pleasure.</a>
<a id='line_971'>    Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know</a>
<a id='line_972'>    How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!</a>
<a id='line_973'>  QUEEN MARGARET. My lord, cheer up your spirits; our foes are nigh,</a>
<a id='line_974'>    And this soft courage makes your followers faint.</a>
<a id='line_975'>    You promis'd knighthood to our forward son:</a>
<a id='line_976'>    Unsheathe your sword and dub him presently.</a>
<a id='line_977'>    Edward, kneel down.</a>
<a id='line_978'>  KING HENRY. Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;</a>
<a id='line_979'>    And learn this lesson: Draw thy sword in right.</a>
<a id='line_980'>  PRINCE OF WALES. My gracious father, by your kingly leave,</a>
<a id='line_981'>    I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,</a>
<a id='line_982'>    And in that quarrel use it to the death.</a>
<a id='line_983'>  CLIFFORD. Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.</a>
<a id='line_984'></a>
<a id='line_985'>                      Enter a MESSENGER</a>
<a id='line_986'></a>
<a id='line_987'>  MESSENGER. Royal commanders, be in readiness;</a>
<a id='line_988'>    For with a band of thirty thousand men</a>
<a id='line_989'>    Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York,</a>
<a id='line_990'>    And in the towns, as they do march along,</a>
<a id='line_991'>    Proclaims him king, and many fly to him.</a>
<a id='line_992'>    Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.</a>
<a id='line_993'>  CLIFFORD. I would your Highness would depart the field:</a>
<a id='line_994'>    The Queen hath best success when you are absent.</a>
<a id='line_995'>  QUEEN MARGARET. Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.</a>
<a id='line_996'>  KING HENRY. Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.</a>
<a id='line_997'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Be it with resolution, then, to fight.</a>
<a id='line_998'>  PRINCE OF WALES. My royal father, cheer these noble lords,</a>
<a id='line_999'>    And hearten those that fight in your defence.</a>
<a id='line_1000'>    Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'</a>
<a id='line_1001'></a>
<a id='line_1002'>         March. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, WARWICK,</a>
<a id='line_1003'>                NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, and soldiers</a>

<a id='line_1005'>  EDWARD. Now, perjur'd Henry, wilt thou kneel for grace</a>
<a id='line_1006'>    And set thy diadem upon my head,</a>
<a id='line_1007'>    Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?</a>
<a id='line_1008'>  QUEEN MARGARET. Go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy.</a>
<a id='line_1009'>    Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms</a>
<a id='line_1010'>    Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?</a>
<a id='line_1011'>  EDWARD. I am his king, and he should bow his knee.</a>
<a id='line_1012'>    I was adopted heir by his consent:</a>
<a id='line_1013'>    Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,</a>
<a id='line_1014'>    You that are King, though he do wear the crown,</a>
<a id='line_1015'>    Have caus'd him by new act of parliament</a>
<a id='line_1016'>    To blot out me and put his own son in.</a>
<a id='line_1017'>  CLIFFORD. And reason too:</a>
<a id='line_1018'>    Who should succeed the father but the son?</a>
<a id='line_1019'>  RICHARD. Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!</a>
<a id='line_1020'>  CLIFFORD. Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,</a>
<a id='line_1021'>    Or any he, the proudest of thy sort.</a>
<a id='line_1022'>  RICHARD. 'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?</a>
<a id='line_1023'>  CLIFFORD. Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.</a>
<a id='line_1024'>  RICHARD. For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.</a>
<a id='line_1025'>  WARWICK. What say'st thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown?</a>
<a id='line_1026'>  QUEEN MARGARET. Why, how now, long-tongu'd Warwick! Dare you speak?</a>
<a id='line_1027'>    When you and I met at Saint Albans last</a>
<a id='line_1028'>    Your legs did better service than your hands.</a>
<a id='line_1029'>  WARWICK. Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.</a>
<a id='line_1030'>  CLIFFORD. You said so much before, and yet you fled.</a>
<a id='line_1031'>  WARWICK. 'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.</a>
<a id='line_1032'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.</a>
<a id='line_1033'>  RICHARD. Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.</a>
<a id='line_1034'>    Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain</a>
<a id='line_1035'>    The execution of my big-swol'n heart</a>
<a id='line_1036'>    Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.</a>
<a id='line_1037'>  CLIFFORD. I slew thy father; call'st thou him a child?</a>
<a id='line_1038'>  RICHARD. Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,</a>
<a id='line_1039'>    As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;</a>
<a id='line_1040'>    But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.</a>
<a id='line_1041'>  KING HENRY. Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.</a>
<a id='line_1042'>  QUEEN MARGARET. Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.</a>
<a id='line_1043'>  KING HENRY. I prithee give no limits to my tongue:</a>
<a id='line_1044'>    I am a king, and privileg'd to speak.</a>
<a id='line_1045'>  CLIFFORD. My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here</a>
<a id='line_1046'>    Cannot be cur'd by words; therefore be still.</a>
<a id='line_1047'>  RICHARD. Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword.</a>
<a id='line_1048'>    By Him that made us all, I am resolv'd</a>
<a id='line_1049'>    That Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.</a>
<a id='line_1050'>  EDWARD. Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?</a>
<a id='line_1051'>    A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day</a>
<a id='line_1052'>    That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.</a>
<a id='line_1053'>  WARWICK. If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;</a>
<a id='line_1054'>    For York in justice puts his armour on.</a>
<a id='line_1055'>  PRINCE OF WALES. If that be right which Warwick says is right,</a>
<a id='line_1056'>    There is no wrong, but every thing is right.</a>
<a id='line_1057'>  RICHARD. Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;</a>
<a id='line_1058'>    For well I wot thou hast thy mother's tongue.</a>
<a id='line_1059'>  QUEEN MARGARET. But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;</a>
<a id='line_1060'>    But like a foul misshapen stigmatic,</a>
<a id='line_1061'>    Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,</a>
<a id='line_1062'>    As venom toads or lizards' dreadful stings.</a>
<a id='line_1063'>  RICHARD. Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,</a>
<a id='line_1064'>    Whose father bears the title of a king-</a>
<a id='line_1065'>    As if a channel should be call'd the sea-</a>
<a id='line_1066'>    Sham'st thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,</a>
<a id='line_1067'>    To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?</a>
<a id='line_1068'>  EDWARD. A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns</a>
<a id='line_1069'>    To make this shameless callet know herself.</a>
<a id='line_1070'>    Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,</a>
<a id='line_1071'>    Although thy husband may be Menelaus;</a>
<a id='line_1072'>    And ne'er was Agamemmon's brother wrong'd</a>
<a id='line_1073'>    By that false woman as this king by thee.</a>
<a id='line_1074'>    His father revell'd in the heart of France,</a>
<a id='line_1075'>    And tam'd the King, and made the Dauphin stoop;</a>
<a id='line_1076'>    And had he match'd according to his state,</a>
<a id='line_1077'>    He might have kept that glory to this day;</a>
<a id='line_1078'>    But when he took a beggar to his bed</a>
<a id='line_1079'>    And grac'd thy poor sire with his bridal day,</a>
<a id='line_1080'>    Even then that sunshine brew'd a show'r for him</a>
<a id='line_1081'>    That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France</a>
<a id='line_1082'>    And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.</a>
<a id='line_1083'>    For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?</a>
<a id='line_1084'>    Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;</a>
<a id='line_1085'>    And we, in pity of the gentle King,</a>
<a id='line_1086'>    Had slipp'd our claim until another age.</a>
<a id='line_1087'>  GEORGE. But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,</a>
<a id='line_1088'>    And that thy summer bred us no increase,</a>
<a id='line_1089'>    We set the axe to thy usurping root;</a>
<a id='line_1090'>    And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,</a>
<a id='line_1091'>    Yet know thou, since we have begun to strike,</a>
<a id='line_1092'>    We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,</a>
<a id='line_1093'>    Or bath'd thy growing with our heated bloods.</a>
<a id='line_1094'>  EDWARD. And in this resolution I defy thee;</a>
<a id='line_1095'>    Not willing any longer conference,</a>
<a id='line_1096'>    Since thou deniest the gentle King to speak.</a>
<a id='line_1097'>    Sound trumpets; let our bloody colours wave,</a>
<a id='line_1098'>    And either victory or else a grave!</a>
<a id='line_1099'>  QUEEN MARGARET. Stay, Edward.</a>
<a id='line_1100'>  EDWARD. No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay;</a>
<a id='line_1101'>    These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.</a>
<a id='line_1102'>                                                          Exeunt</a>

<a id='line_1429'>    Because he would avoid such bitter taunts</a>
<a id='line_1430'>    Which in the time of death he gave our father.</a>
<a id='line_1431'>  GEORGE. If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.</a>
<a id='line_1432'>  RICHARD. Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.</a>
<a id='line_1433'>  EDWARD. Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.</a>
<a id='line_1434'>  WARWICK. Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.</a>
<a id='line_1435'>  GEORGE. While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.</a>
<a id='line_1436'>  RICHARD. Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.</a>
<a id='line_1437'>  EDWARD. Thou pitied'st Rutland, I will pity thee.</a>
<a id='line_1438'>  GEORGE. Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?</a>
<a id='line_1439'>  WARWICK. They mock thee, Clifford; swear as thou wast wont.</a>
<a id='line_1440'>  RICHARD. What, not an oath? Nay, then the world goes hard</a>
<a id='line_1441'>    When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.</a>
<a id='line_1442'>    I know by that he's dead; and by my soul,</a>
<a id='line_1443'>    If this right hand would buy two hours' life,</a>
<a id='line_1444'>    That I in all despite might rail at him,</a>
<a id='line_1445'>    This hand should chop it off, and with the issuing blood</a>
<a id='line_1446'>    Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst</a>
<a id='line_1447'>    York and young Rutland could not satisfy.</a>
<a id='line_1448'>  WARWICK. Ay, but he's dead. Off with the traitor's head,</a>
<a id='line_1449'>    And rear it in the place your father's stands.</a>
<a id='line_1450'>    And now to London with triumphant march,</a>
<a id='line_1451'>    There to be crowned England's royal King;</a>
<a id='line_1452'>    From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,</a>
<a id='line_1453'>    And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen.</a>
<a id='line_1454'>    So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;</a>
<a id='line_1455'>    And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread</a>
<a id='line_1456'>    The scatt'red foe that hopes to rise again;</a>
<a id='line_1457'>    For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,</a>
<a id='line_1458'>    Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.</a>
<a id='line_1459'>    First will I see the coronation;</a>
<a id='line_1460'>    And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea</a>
<a id='line_1461'>    To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.</a>
<a id='line_1462'>  EDWARD. Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;</a>
<a id='line_1463'>    For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,</a>
<a id='line_1464'>    And never will I undertake the thing</a>
<a id='line_1465'>    Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.</a>
<a id='line_1466'>    Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester;</a>

<a id='line_1469'>  RICHARD. Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;</a>
<a id='line_1470'>    For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.</a>
<a id='line_1471'>  WARWICK. Tut, that's a foolish observation.</a>
<a id='line_1472'>    Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London</a>

<a id='line_1483'>  SECOND KEEPER. I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.</a>

<a id='line_1492'>        Enter KING HENRY, disguised, with a prayer-book</a>
<a id='line_1493'></a>
<a id='line_1494'>  KING HENRY. From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,</a>
<a id='line_1495'>    To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.</a>
<a id='line_1496'>    No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;</a>

<a id='line_1501'>    No, not a man comes for redress of thee;</a>
<a id='line_1502'>    For how can I help them and not myself?</a>
<a id='line_1503'>  FIRST KEEPER. Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee.</a>
<a id='line_1504'>    This is the quondam King; let's seize upon him.</a>
<a id='line_1505'>  KING HENRY. Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,</a>
<a id='line_1506'>    For wise men say it is the wisest course.</a>
<a id='line_1507'>  SECOND KEEPER. Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.</a>
<a id='line_1508'>  FIRST KEEPER. Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.</a>
<a id='line_1509'>  KING HENRY. My Queen and son are gone to France for aid;</a>
<a id='line_1510'>    And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick</a>
<a id='line_1511'>    Is thither gone to crave the French King's sister</a>
<a id='line_1512'>    To wife for Edward. If this news be true,</a>
<a id='line_1513'>    Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;</a>
<a id='line_1514'>    For Warwick is a subtle orator,</a>
<a id='line_1515'>    And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.</a>
<a id='line_1516'>    By this account, then, Margaret may win him;</a>
<a id='line_1517'>    For she's a woman to be pitied much.</a>
<a id='line_1518'>    Her sighs will make a batt'ry in his breast;</a>
<a id='line_1519'>    Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;</a>
<a id='line_1520'>    The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;</a>
<a id='line_1521'>    And Nero will be tainted with remorse</a>
<a id='line_1522'>    To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.</a>
<a id='line_1523'>    Ay, but she's come to beg: Warwick, to give.</a>
<a id='line_1524'>    She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry:</a>
<a id='line_1525'>    He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.</a>
<a id='line_1526'>    She weeps, and says her Henry is depos'd:</a>
<a id='line_1527'>    He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;</a>
<a id='line_1528'>    That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;</a>
<a id='line_1529'>    Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,</a>
<a id='line_1530'>    Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,</a>
<a id='line_1531'>    And in conclusion wins the King from her</a>
<a id='line_1532'>    With promise of his sister, and what else,</a>
<a id='line_1533'>    To strengthen and support King Edward's place.</a>
<a id='line_1534'>    O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,</a>
<a id='line_1535'>    Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!</a>
<a id='line_1536'>  SECOND KEEPER. Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?</a>
<a id='line_1537'>  KING HENRY. More than I seem, and less than I was born to:</a>
<a id='line_1538'>    A man at least, for less I should not be;</a>
<a id='line_1539'>    And men may talk of kings, and why not I?</a>
<a id='line_1540'>  SECOND KEEPER. Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.</a>
<a id='line_1541'>  KING HENRY. Why, so I am- in mind; and that's enough.</a>
<a id='line_1542'>  SECOND KEEPER. But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?</a>
<a id='line_1543'>  KING HENRY. My crown is in my heart, not on my head;</a>
<a id='line_1544'>    Not deck'd with diamonds and Indian stones,</a>
<a id='line_1545'>    Not to be seen. My crown is call'd content;</a>
<a id='line_1546'>    A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.</a>
<a id='line_1547'>  SECOND KEEPER. Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,</a>
<a id='line_1548'>    Your crown content and you must be contented</a>
<a id='line_1549'>    To go along with us; for as we think,</a>
<a id='line_1550'>    You are the king King Edward hath depos'd;</a>
<a id='line_1551'>    And we his subjects, sworn in all allegiance,</a>
<a id='line_1552'>    Will apprehend you as his enemy.</a>
<a id='line_1553'>  KING HENRY. But did you never swear, and break an oath?</a>
<a id='line_1554'>  SECOND KEEPER. No, never such an oath; nor will not now.</a>
<a id='line_1555'>  KING HENRY. Where did you dwell when I was King of England?</a>
<a id='line_1556'>  SECOND KEEPER. Here in this country, where we now remain.</a>
<a id='line_1557'>  KING HENRY. I was anointed king at nine months old;</a>
<a id='line_1558'>    My father and my grandfather were kings;</a>
<a id='line_1559'>    And you were sworn true subjects unto me;</a>
<a id='line_1560'>    And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?</a>
<a id='line_1561'>  FIRST KEEPER. No;</a>
<a id='line_1562'>    For we were subjects but while you were king.</a>
<a id='line_1563'>  KING HENRY. Why, am I dead? Do I not breathe a man?</a>
<a id='line_1564'>    Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!</a>
<a id='line_1565'>    Look, as I blow this feather from my face,</a>
<a id='line_1566'>    And as the air blows it to me again,</a>
<a id='line_1567'>    Obeying with my wind when I do blow,</a>
<a id='line_1568'>    And yielding to another when it blows,</a>
<a id='line_1569'>    Commanded always by the greater gust,</a>
<a id='line_1570'>    Such is the lightness of you common men.</a>
<a id='line_1571'>    But do not break your oaths; for of that sin</a>
<a id='line_1572'>    My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.</a>
<a id='line_1573'>    Go where you will, the King shall be commanded;</a>
<a id='line_1574'>    And be you kings: command, and I'll obey.</a>
<a id='line_1575'>  FIRST KEEPER. We are true subjects to the King, King Edward.</a>
<a id='line_1576'>  KING HENRY. So would you be again to Henry,</a>
<a id='line_1577'>    If he were seated as King Edward is.</a>
<a id='line_1578'>  FIRST KEEPER. We charge you, in God's name and the King's,</a>
<a id='line_1579'>    To go with us unto the officers.</a>
<a id='line_1580'>  KING HENRY. In God's name, lead; your King's name be obey'd;</a>
<a id='line_1581'>    And what God will, that let your King perform;</a>
<a id='line_1582'>    And what he will, I humbly yield unto.                Exeunt</a>

<a id='line_1595'>  GLOUCESTER. Your Highness shall do well to grant her suit;</a>

<a id='line_1599'>    I see the lady hath a thing to grant,</a>

<a id='line_1643'>  KING EDWARD. Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.</a>
<a id='line_1644'>  LADY GREY. Why, then I will do what your Grace commands.</a>
<a id='line_1645'>  GLOUCESTER. He plies her hard; and much rain wears the marble.</a>

<a id='line_1653'>  KING EDWARD. But stay thee- 'tis the fruits of love I mean.</a>
<a id='line_1654'>  LADY GREY. The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.</a>

<a id='line_1656'>    What love, thinkst thou, I sue so much to get?</a>
<a id='line_1657'>  LADY GREY. My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;</a>

<a id='line_1664'>  KING EDWARD. To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.</a>
<a id='line_1665'>  LADY GREY. To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.</a>
<a id='line_1666'>  KING EDWARD. Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.</a>
<a id='line_1667'>  LADY GREY. Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;</a>

<a id='line_1701'>    Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.</a>
<a id='line_1702'>  GLOUCESTER. The ghostly father now hath done his shrift.</a>

<a id='line_1704'>  KING EDWARD. Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.</a>
<a id='line_1705'>  GLOUCESTER. The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.</a>
<a id='line_1706'>  KING EDWARD. You'd think it strange if I should marry her.</a>
<a id='line_1707'>  CLARENCE. To who, my lord?</a>
<a id='line_1708'>  KING EDWARD. Why, Clarence, to myself.</a>
<a id='line_1709'>  GLOUCESTER. That would be ten days' wonder at the least.</a>
<a id='line_1710'>  CLARENCE. That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.</a>
<a id='line_1711'>  GLOUCESTER. By so much is the wonder in extremes.</a>
<a id='line_1712'>  KING EDWARD. Well, jest on, brothers; I can tell you both</a>
<a id='line_1713'>    Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.</a>
<a id='line_1714'></a>
<a id='line_1715'>                       Enter a NOBLEMAN</a>
<a id='line_1716'></a>
<a id='line_1717'>  NOBLEMAN. My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken</a>
<a id='line_1718'>    And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.</a>
<a id='line_1719'>  KING EDWARD. See that he be convey'd unto the Tower.</a>
<a id='line_1720'>    And go we, brothers, to the man that took him</a>
<a id='line_1721'>    To question of his apprehension.</a>
<a id='line_1722'>    Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.</a>
<a id='line_1723'>                                       Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER</a>
<a id='line_1724'>  GLOUCESTER. Ay, Edward will use women honourably.</a>
<a id='line_1725'>    Would he were wasted, marrow, bones, and all,</a>
<a id='line_1726'>    That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring</a>
<a id='line_1727'>    To cross me from the golden time I look for!</a>
<a id='line_1728'>    And yet, between my soul's desire and me-</a>
<a id='line_1729'>    The lustful Edward's title buried-</a>
<a id='line_1730'>    Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,</a>
<a id='line_1731'>    And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,</a>
<a id='line_1732'>    To take their rooms ere I can place myself.</a>
<a id='line_1733'>    A cold premeditation for my purpose!</a>
<a id='line_1734'>    Why, then I do but dream on sovereignty;</a>
<a id='line_1735'>    Like one that stands upon a promontory</a>
<a id='line_1736'>    And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,</a>
<a id='line_1737'>    Wishing his foot were equal with his eye;</a>
<a id='line_1738'>    And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,</a>
<a id='line_1739'>    Saying he'll lade it dry to have his way-</a>
<a id='line_1740'>    So do I wish the crown, being so far off;</a>
<a id='line_1741'>    And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;</a>
<a id='line_1742'>    And so I say I'll cut the causes off,</a>
<a id='line_1743'>    Flattering me with impossibilities.</a>
<a id='line_1744'>    My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,</a>
<a id='line_1745'>    Unless my hand and strength could equal them.</a>
<a id='line_1746'>    Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;</a>
<a id='line_1747'>    What other pleasure can the world afford?</a>
<a id='line_1748'>    I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,</a>
<a id='line_1749'>    And deck my body in gay ornaments,</a>
<a id='line_1750'>    And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.</a>
<a id='line_1751'>    O miserable thought! and more unlikely</a>
<a id='line_1752'>    Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns.</a>
<a id='line_1753'>    Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb;</a>
<a id='line_1754'>    And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,</a>
<a id='line_1755'>    She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe</a>
<a id='line_1756'>    To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub</a>
<a id='line_1757'>    To make an envious mountain on my back,</a>
<a id='line_1758'>    Where sits deformity to mock my body;</a>
<a id='line_1759'>    To shape my legs of an unequal size;</a>
<a id='line_1760'>    To disproportion me in every part,</a>
<a id='line_1761'>    Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp</a>
<a id='line_1762'>    That carries no impression like the dam.</a>
<a id='line_1763'>    And am I, then, a man to be belov'd?</a>
<a id='line_1764'>    O monstrous fault to harbour such a thought!</a>
<a id='line_1765'>    Then, since this earth affords no joy to me</a>
<a id='line_1766'>    But to command, to check, to o'erbear such</a>
<a id='line_1767'>    As are of better person than myself,</a>
<a id='line_1768'>    I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,</a>
<a id='line_1769'>    And whiles I live t' account this world but hell,</a>
<a id='line_1770'>    Until my misshap'd trunk that bear this head</a>
<a id='line_1771'>    Be round impaled with a glorious crown.</a>
<a id='line_1772'>    And yet I know not how to get the crown,</a>
<a id='line_1773'>    For many lives stand between me and home;</a>
<a id='line_1774'>    And I- like one lost in a thorny wood</a>
<a id='line_1775'>    That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns,</a>
<a id='line_1776'>    Seeking a way and straying from the way</a>
<a id='line_1777'>    Not knowing how to find the open air,</a>
<a id='line_1778'>    But toiling desperately to find it out-</a>
<a id='line_1779'>    Torment myself to catch the English crown;</a>
<a id='line_1780'>    And from that torment I will free myself</a>
<a id='line_1781'>    Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.</a>
<a id='line_1782'>    Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,</a>
<a id='line_1783'>    And cry 'Content!' to that which grieves my heart,</a>
<a id='line_1784'>    And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,</a>
<a id='line_1785'>    And frame my face to all occasions.</a>
<a id='line_1786'>    I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;</a>
<a id='line_1787'>    I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;</a>
<a id='line_1788'>    I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,</a>
<a id='line_1789'>    Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,</a>
<a id='line_1790'>    And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.</a>
<a id='line_1791'>    I can add colours to the chameleon,</a>
<a id='line_1792'>    Change shapes with Protheus for advantages,</a>
<a id='line_1793'>    And set the murderous Machiavel to school.</a>
<a id='line_1794'>    Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?</a>
<a id='line_1795'>    Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.           Exit</a>

<a id='line_1798'></a>
<a id='line_1799'>Flourish.  Enter LEWIS the French King, his sister BONA, his Admiral</a>
<a id='line_1800'>call'd BOURBON; PRINCE EDWARD, QUEEN MARGARET, and the EARL of OXFORD.</a>
<a id='line_1801'>LEWIS sits, and riseth up again</a>
<a id='line_1802'></a>
<a id='line_1803'>  LEWIS. Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,</a>
<a id='line_1804'>    Sit down with us. It ill befits thy state</a>
<a id='line_1805'>    And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.</a>
<a id='line_1806'>  QUEEN MARGARET. No, mighty King of France. Now Margaret</a>
<a id='line_1807'>    Must strike her sail and learn a while to serve</a>
<a id='line_1808'>    Where kings command. I was, I must confess,</a>
<a id='line_1809'>    Great Albion's Queen in former golden days;</a>
<a id='line_1810'>    But now mischance hath trod my title down</a>
<a id='line_1811'>    And with dishonour laid me on the ground,</a>
<a id='line_1812'>    Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,</a>
<a id='line_1813'>    And to my humble seat conform myself.</a>
<a id='line_1814'>  LEWIS. Why, say, fair Queen, whence springs this deep despair?</a>
<a id='line_1815'>  QUEEN MARGARET. From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears</a>
<a id='line_1816'>    And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.</a>
<a id='line_1817'>  LEWIS. Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,</a>
<a id='line_1818'>    And sit thee by our side. [Seats her by him] Yield not thy neck</a>
<a id='line_1819'>    To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind</a>
<a id='line_1820'>    Still ride in triumph over all mischance.</a>
<a id='line_1821'>    Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;</a>
<a id='line_1822'>    It shall be eas'd, if France can yield relief.</a>
<a id='line_1823'>  QUEEN MARGARET. Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts</a>
<a id='line_1824'>    And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.</a>
<a id='line_1825'>    Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis</a>
<a id='line_1826'>    That Henry, sole possessor of my love,</a>
<a id='line_1827'>    Is, of a king, become a banish'd man,</a>
<a id='line_1828'>    And forc'd to live in Scotland a forlorn;</a>
<a id='line_1829'>    While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York</a>
<a id='line_1830'>    Usurps the regal title and the seat</a>
<a id='line_1831'>    Of England's true-anointed lawful King.</a>
<a id='line_1832'>    This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,</a>
<a id='line_1833'>    With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,</a>
<a id='line_1834'>    Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;</a>
<a id='line_1835'>    And if thou fail us, all our hope is done.</a>
<a id='line_1836'>    Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;</a>
<a id='line_1837'>    Our people and our peers are both misled,</a>
<a id='line_1838'>    Our treasure seiz'd, our soldiers put to flight,</a>
<a id='line_1839'>    And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.</a>
<a id='line_1840'>  LEWIS. Renowned Queen, with patience calm the storm,</a>
<a id='line_1841'>    While we bethink a means to break it off.</a>
<a id='line_1842'>  QUEEN MARGARET. The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.</a>
<a id='line_1843'>  LEWIS. The more I stay, the more I'll succour thee.</a>
<a id='line_1844'>  QUEEN MARGARET. O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_1845'>    And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!</a>
<a id='line_1846'></a>
<a id='line_1847'>                        Enter WARWICK</a>
<a id='line_1848'></a>
<a id='line_1849'>  LEWIS. What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?</a>
<a id='line_1850'>  QUEEN MARGARET. Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.</a>
<a id='line_1851'>  LEWIS. Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?</a>
<a id='line_1852'>                                      [He descends. She ariseth]</a>
<a id='line_1853'>  QUEEN MARGARET. Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;</a>
<a id='line_1854'>    For this is he that moves both wind and tide.</a>
<a id='line_1855'>  WARWICK. From worthy Edward, King of Albion,</a>
<a id='line_1856'>    My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,</a>
<a id='line_1857'>    I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,</a>
<a id='line_1858'>    First to do greetings to thy royal person,</a>
<a id='line_1859'>    And then to crave a league of amity,</a>
<a id='line_1860'>    And lastly to confirm that amity</a>
<a id='line_1861'>    With nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant</a>
<a id='line_1862'>    That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,</a>
<a id='line_1863'>    To England's King in lawful marriage.</a>
<a id='line_1864'>  QUEEN MARGARET. [Aside] If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.</a>
<a id='line_1865'>  WARWICK. [To BONA] And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,</a>
<a id='line_1866'>    I am commanded, with your leave and favour,</a>
<a id='line_1867'>    Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue</a>
<a id='line_1868'>    To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;</a>
<a id='line_1869'>    Where fame, late ent'ring at his heedful ears,</a>
<a id='line_1870'>    Hath plac'd thy beauty's image and thy virtue.</a>
<a id='line_1871'>  QUEEN MARGARET. King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak</a>
<a id='line_1872'>    Before you answer Warwick. His demand</a>
<a id='line_1873'>    Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,</a>
<a id='line_1874'>    But from deceit bred by necessity;</a>
<a id='line_1875'>    For how can tyrants safely govern home</a>
<a id='line_1876'>    Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?</a>
<a id='line_1877'>    To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,</a>
<a id='line_1878'>    That Henry liveth still; but were he dead,</a>
<a id='line_1879'>    Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.</a>
<a id='line_1880'>    Look therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage</a>
<a id='line_1881'>    Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;</a>
<a id='line_1882'>    For though usurpers sway the rule a while</a>
<a id='line_1883'>    Yet heav'ns are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.</a>
<a id='line_1884'>  WARWICK. Injurious Margaret!</a>
<a id='line_1885'>  PRINCE OF WALES. And why not Queen?</a>
<a id='line_1886'>  WARWICK. Because thy father Henry did usurp;</a>
<a id='line_1887'>    And thou no more art prince than she is queen.</a>
<a id='line_1888'>  OXFORD. Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,</a>
<a id='line_1889'>    Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;</a>
<a id='line_1890'>    And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,</a>
<a id='line_1891'>    Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;</a>
<a id='line_1892'>    And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,</a>
<a id='line_1893'>    Who by his prowess conquered all France.</a>
<a id='line_1894'>    From these our Henry lineally descends.</a>
<a id='line_1895'>  WARWICK. Oxford, how haps it in this smooth discourse</a>
<a id='line_1896'>    You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost</a>
<a id='line_1897'>    All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten?</a>
<a id='line_1898'>    Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.</a>
<a id='line_1899'>    But for the rest: you tell a pedigree</a>
<a id='line_1900'>    Of threescore and two years- a silly time</a>
<a id='line_1901'>    To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.</a>
<a id='line_1902'>  OXFORD. Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,</a>
<a id='line_1903'>    Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,</a>
<a id='line_1904'>    And not betray thy treason with a blush?</a>
<a id='line_1905'>  WARWICK. Can Oxford that did ever fence the right</a>
<a id='line_1906'>    Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?</a>
<a id='line_1907'>    For shame! Leave Henry, and call Edward king.</a>
<a id='line_1908'>  OXFORD. Call him my king by whose injurious doom</a>
<a id='line_1909'>    My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,</a>
<a id='line_1910'>    Was done to death; and more than so, my father,</a>
<a id='line_1911'>    Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,</a>
<a id='line_1912'>    When nature brought him to the door of death?</a>
<a id='line_1913'>    No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,</a>
<a id='line_1914'>    This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.</a>
<a id='line_1915'>  WARWICK. And I the house of York.</a>
<a id='line_1916'>  LEWIS. Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,</a>
<a id='line_1917'>    Vouchsafe at our request to stand aside</a>
<a id='line_1918'>    While I use further conference with Warwick.</a>
<a id='line_1919'>                                              [They stand aloof]</a>
<a id='line_1920'>  QUEEN MARGARET. Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!</a>
<a id='line_1921'>  LEWIS. Now, Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,</a>
<a id='line_1922'>    Is Edward your true king? for I were loath</a>
<a id='line_1923'>    To link with him that were not lawful chosen.</a>
<a id='line_1924'>  WARWICK. Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.</a>
<a id='line_1925'>  LEWIS. But is he gracious in the people's eye?</a>
<a id='line_1926'>  WARWICK. The more that Henry was unfortunate.</a>
<a id='line_1927'>  LEWIS. Then further: all dissembling set aside,</a>
<a id='line_1928'>    Tell me for truth the measure of his love</a>
<a id='line_1929'>    Unto our sister Bona.</a>
<a id='line_1930'>  WARWICK. Such it seems</a>
<a id='line_1931'>    As may beseem a monarch like himself.</a>
<a id='line_1932'>    Myself have often heard him say and swear</a>
<a id='line_1933'>    That this his love was an eternal plant</a>
<a id='line_1934'>    Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,</a>
<a id='line_1935'>    The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,</a>
<a id='line_1936'>    Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,</a>
<a id='line_1937'>    Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.</a>
<a id='line_1938'>  LEWIS. Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.</a>
<a id='line_1939'>  BONA. Your grant or your denial shall be mine.</a>
<a id='line_1940'>    [To WARWICK] Yet I confess that often ere this day,</a>
<a id='line_1941'>    When I have heard your king's desert recounted,</a>
<a id='line_1942'>    Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.</a>
<a id='line_1943'>  LEWIS. Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's.</a>
<a id='line_1944'>    And now forthwith shall articles be drawn</a>
<a id='line_1945'>    Touching the jointure that your king must make,</a>
<a id='line_1946'>    Which with her dowry shall be counterpois'd.</a>
<a id='line_1947'>    Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness</a>
<a id='line_1948'>    That Bona shall be wife to the English king.</a>
<a id='line_1949'>  PRINCE OF WALES. To Edward, but not to the English king.</a>
<a id='line_1950'>  QUEEN MARGARET. Deceitful Warwick, it was thy device</a>
<a id='line_1951'>    By this alliance to make void my suit.</a>
<a id='line_1952'>    Before thy coming, Lewis was Henry's friend.</a>
<a id='line_1953'>  LEWIS. And still is friend to him and Margaret.</a>
<a id='line_1954'>    But if your title to the crown be weak,</a>
<a id='line_1955'>    As may appear by Edward's good success,</a>
<a id='line_1956'>    Then 'tis but reason that I be releas'd</a>
<a id='line_1957'>    From giving aid which late I promised.</a>
<a id='line_1958'>    Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand</a>
<a id='line_1959'>    That your estate requires and mine can yield.</a>
<a id='line_1960'>  WARWICK. Henry now lives in Scotland at his case,</a>
<a id='line_1961'>    Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.</a>
<a id='line_1962'>    And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,</a>
<a id='line_1963'>    You have a father able to maintain you,</a>
<a id='line_1964'>    And better 'twere you troubled him than France.</a>

<a id='line_1987'>  WARWICK. Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.</a>
<a id='line_1988'>  LEWIS. What, has your king married the Lady Grey?</a>
<a id='line_1989'>    And now, to soothe your forgery and his,</a>
<a id='line_1990'>    Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?</a>
<a id='line_1991'>    Is this th' alliance that he seeks with France?</a>
<a id='line_1992'>    Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?</a>
<a id='line_1993'>  QUEEN MARGARET. I told your Majesty as much before.</a>
<a id='line_1994'>    This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.</a>
<a id='line_1995'>  WARWICK. King Lewis, I here protest in sight of heaven,</a>
<a id='line_1996'>    And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,</a>
<a id='line_1997'>    That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's-</a>
<a id='line_1998'>    No more my king, for he dishonours me,</a>
<a id='line_1999'>    But most himself, if he could see his shame.</a>
<a id='line_2000'>    Did I forget that by the house of York</a>
<a id='line_2001'>    My father came untimely to his death?</a>
<a id='line_2002'>    Did I let pass th' abuse done to my niece?</a>
<a id='line_2003'>    Did I impale him with the regal crown?</a>
<a id='line_2004'>    Did I put Henry from his native right?</a>
<a id='line_2005'>    And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?</a>
<a id='line_2006'>    Shame on himself! for my desert is honour;</a>
<a id='line_2007'>    And to repair my honour lost for him</a>
<a id='line_2008'>    I here renounce him and return to Henry.</a>
<a id='line_2009'>    My noble Queen, let former grudges pass,</a>
<a id='line_2010'>    And henceforth I am thy true servitor.</a>
<a id='line_2011'>    I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,</a>
<a id='line_2012'>    And replant Henry in his former state.</a>
<a id='line_2013'>  QUEEN MARGARET. Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;</a>
<a id='line_2014'>    And I forgive and quite forget old faults,</a>
<a id='line_2015'>    And joy that thou becom'st King Henry's friend.</a>
<a id='line_2016'>  WARWICK. So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,</a>
<a id='line_2017'>    That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us</a>
<a id='line_2018'>    With some few bands of chosen soldiers,</a>
<a id='line_2019'>    I'll undertake to land them on our coast</a>
<a id='line_2020'>    And force the tyrant from his seat by war.</a>
<a id='line_2021'>    'Tis not his new-made bride shall succour him;</a>
<a id='line_2022'>    And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,</a>
<a id='line_2023'>    He's very likely now to fall from him</a>
<a id='line_2024'>    For matching more for wanton lust than honour</a>
<a id='line_2025'>    Or than for strength and safety of our country.</a>
<a id='line_2026'>  BONA. Dear brother, how shall Bona be reveng'd</a>
<a id='line_2027'>    But by thy help to this distressed queen?</a>
<a id='line_2028'>  QUEEN MARGARET. Renowned Prince, how shall poor Henry live</a>
<a id='line_2029'>    Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?</a>
<a id='line_2030'>  BONA. My quarrel and this English queen's are one.</a>
<a id='line_2031'>  WARWICK. And mine, fair Lady Bona, joins with yours.</a>
<a id='line_2032'>  LEWIS. And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.</a>
<a id='line_2033'>    Therefore, at last, I firmly am resolv'd</a>
<a id='line_2034'>    You shall have aid.</a>
<a id='line_2035'>  QUEEN MARGARET. Let me give humble thanks for all at once.</a>
<a id='line_2036'>  LEWIS. Then, England's messenger, return in post</a>
<a id='line_2037'>    And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,</a>
<a id='line_2038'>    That Lewis of France is sending over masquers</a>
<a id='line_2039'>    To revel it with him and his new bride.</a>
<a id='line_2040'>    Thou seest what's past; go fear thy king withal.</a>
<a id='line_2041'>  BONA. Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,</a>
<a id='line_2042'>    I'll wear the willow-garland for his sake.</a>
<a id='line_2043'>  QUEEN MARGARET. Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside,</a>
<a id='line_2044'>    And I am ready to put armour on.</a>
<a id='line_2045'>  WARWICK. Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,</a>
<a id='line_2046'>    And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.</a>
<a id='line_2047'>    There's thy reward; be gone.                       Exit POST</a>
<a id='line_2048'>  LEWIS. But, Warwick,</a>
<a id='line_2049'>    Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,</a>
<a id='line_2050'>    Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle:</a>

<a id='line_2053'>    Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt:</a>
<a id='line_2054'>    What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?</a>
<a id='line_2055'>  WARWICK. This shall assure my constant loyalty:</a>
<a id='line_2056'>    That if our Queen and this young Prince agree,</a>
<a id='line_2057'>    I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy</a>
<a id='line_2058'>    To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.</a>
<a id='line_2059'>  QUEEN MARGARET. Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.</a>
<a id='line_2060'>    Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,</a>
<a id='line_2061'>    Therefore delay not- give thy hand to Warwick;</a>
<a id='line_2062'>    And with thy hand thy faith irrevocable</a>

<a id='line_2079'>    I was the chief that rais'd him to the crown,</a>

<a id='line_2099'>  GLOUCESTER. And his well-chosen bride.</a>
<a id='line_2100'>  CLARENCE. I mind to tell him plainly what I think.</a>
<a id='line_2101'>  KING EDWARD. Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice</a>
<a id='line_2102'>    That you stand pensive as half malcontent?</a>
<a id='line_2103'>  CLARENCE. As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick,</a>
<a id='line_2104'>    Which are so weak of courage and in judgment</a>
<a id='line_2105'>    That they'll take no offence at our abuse.</a>
<a id='line_2106'>  KING EDWARD. Suppose they take offence without a cause;</a>
<a id='line_2107'>    They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,</a>
<a id='line_2108'>    Your King and Warwick's and must have my will.</a>
<a id='line_2109'>  GLOUCESTER. And shall have your will, because our King.</a>
<a id='line_2110'>    Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.</a>
<a id='line_2111'>  KING EDWARD. Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?</a>
<a id='line_2112'>  GLOUCESTER. Not I.</a>
<a id='line_2113'>    No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd</a>
<a id='line_2114'>    Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity</a>

<a id='line_2116'>  KING EDWARD. Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,</a>
<a id='line_2117'>    Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey</a>
<a id='line_2118'>    Should not become my wife and England's Queen.</a>
<a id='line_2119'>    And you too, Somerset and Montague,</a>
<a id='line_2120'>    Speak freely what you think.</a>
<a id='line_2121'>  CLARENCE. Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis</a>
<a id='line_2122'>    Becomes your enemy for mocking him</a>
<a id='line_2123'>    About the marriage of the Lady Bona.</a>
<a id='line_2124'>  GLOUCESTER. And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,</a>
<a id='line_2125'>    Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.</a>
<a id='line_2126'>  KING EDWARD. What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas'd</a>
<a id='line_2127'>    By such invention as I can devise?</a>
<a id='line_2128'>  MONTAGUE. Yet to have join'd with France in such alliance</a>
<a id='line_2129'>    Would more have strength'ned this our commonwealth</a>
<a id='line_2130'>    'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.</a>
<a id='line_2131'>  HASTINGS. Why, knows not Montague that of itself</a>
<a id='line_2132'>    England is safe, if true within itself?</a>
<a id='line_2133'>  MONTAGUE. But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.</a>
<a id='line_2134'>  HASTINGS. 'Tis better using France than trusting France.</a>
<a id='line_2135'>    Let us be back'd with God, and with the seas</a>
<a id='line_2136'>    Which He hath giv'n for fence impregnable,</a>
<a id='line_2137'>    And with their helps only defend ourselves.</a>
<a id='line_2138'>    In them and in ourselves our safety lies.</a>
<a id='line_2139'>  CLARENCE. For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves</a>
<a id='line_2140'>    To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.</a>
<a id='line_2141'>  KING EDWARD. Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;</a>
<a id='line_2142'>    And for this once my will shall stand for law.</a>
<a id='line_2143'>  GLOUCESTER. And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well</a>
<a id='line_2144'>    To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales</a>
<a id='line_2145'>    Unto the brother of your loving bride.</a>
<a id='line_2146'>    She better would have fitted me or Clarence;</a>
<a id='line_2147'>    But in your bride you bury brotherhood.</a>
<a id='line_2148'>  CLARENCE. Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir</a>
<a id='line_2149'>    Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,</a>
<a id='line_2150'>    And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.</a>

<a id='line_2152'>    That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.</a>
<a id='line_2153'>  CLARENCE. In choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment,</a>

<a id='line_2155'>    To play the broker in mine own behalf;</a>
<a id='line_2156'>    And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.</a>
<a id='line_2157'>  KING EDWARD. Leave me or tarry, Edward will be King,</a>
<a id='line_2158'>    And not be tied unto his brother's will.</a>
<a id='line_2159'>  QUEEN ELIZABETH. My lords, before it pleas'd his Majesty</a>

<a id='line_2161'>    Do me but right, and you must all confess</a>

<a id='line_2165'>    So your dislikes, to whom I would be pleasing,</a>
<a id='line_2166'>    Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_2167'>  KING EDWARD. My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns.</a>

<a id='line_2170'>    And their true sovereign whom they must obey?</a>
<a id='line_2171'>    Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,</a>
<a id='line_2172'>    Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;</a>
<a id='line_2173'>    Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,</a>

<a id='line_2185'>    Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.</a>
<a id='line_2186'>    What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?</a>
<a id='line_2187'>  MESSENGER. At my depart, these were his very words:</a>

<a id='line_2191'>  KING EDWARD. IS Lewis so brave? Belike he thinks me Henry.</a>
<a id='line_2192'>    But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?</a>

<a id='line_2194'>    'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,</a>
<a id='line_2195'>    I'll wear the willow-garland for his sake.'</a>
<a id='line_2196'>  KING EDWARD. I blame not her: she could say little less;</a>
<a id='line_2197'>    She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?</a>
<a id='line_2198'>    For I have heard that she was there in place.</a>
<a id='line_2199'>  MESSENGER. 'Tell him' quoth she 'my mourning weeds are done,</a>

<a id='line_2201'>  KING EDWARD. Belike she minds to play the Amazon.</a>
<a id='line_2202'>    But what said Warwick to these injuries?</a>
<a id='line_2203'>  MESSENGER. He, more incens'd against your Majesty</a>
<a id='line_2204'>    Than all the rest, discharg'd me with these words:</a>
<a id='line_2205'>    'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong;</a>

<a id='line_2208'>    Well, I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd.</a>
<a id='line_2209'>    They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.</a>

<a id='line_2271'>    We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?</a>
<a id='line_2272'>    Our scouts have found the adventure very easy;</a>
<a id='line_2273'>    That as Ulysses and stout Diomede</a>

<a id='line_2277'>    At unawares may beat down Edward's guard</a>

<a id='line_3159'>    You have no children, butchers, if you had,</a>

<a id='line_3193'>  GLOUCESTER. Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?</a>
<a id='line_3194'>  KING HENRY. Ay, my good lord- my lord, I should say rather.</a>
<a id='line_3195'>    'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better.</a>
<a id='line_3196'>    'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,</a>

<a id='line_3203'>    What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?</a>
<a id='line_3204'>  GLOUCESTER. Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind:</a>

<a id='line_3239'>    Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;</a>
<a id='line_3240'>    The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,</a>
<a id='line_3241'>    And chatt'ring pies in dismal discords sung;</a>
<a id='line_3242'>    Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,</a>
<a id='line_3243'>    And yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,</a>
<a id='line_3244'>    To wit, an indigest deformed lump,</a>
<a id='line_3245'>    Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.</a>

<a id='line_3264'>    Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;</a>
<a id='line_3265'>    For I have often heard my mother say</a>
<a id='line_3266'>    I came into the world with my legs forward.</a>
<a id='line_3267'>    Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste</a>
<a id='line_3268'>    And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?</a>
<a id='line_3269'>    The midwife wonder'd; and the women cried</a>
<a id='line_3270'>    'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'</a>
<a id='line_3271'>    And so I was, which plainly signified</a>
<a id='line_3272'>    That I should snarl, and bite, and play the dog.</a>
<a id='line_3273'>    Then, since the heavens have shap'd my body so,</a>

<a id='line_3286'>    Counting myself but bad till I be best.</a>
<a id='line_3287'>    I'll throw thy body in another room,</a>
