                    <a id='line_0'>The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto</a>
<a id='line_4'>Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, 1:2 And to our</a>
<a id='line_5'>beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in</a>
<a id='line_6'>thy house: 1:3 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the</a>
<a id='line_7'>Lord Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>1:4 I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, 1:5</a>
<a id='line_10'>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus,</a>
<a id='line_11'>and toward all saints; 1:6 That the communication of thy faith may</a>
<a id='line_12'>become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in</a>
<a id='line_13'>you in Christ Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_14'></a>
<a id='line_15'>1:7 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the</a>
<a id='line_16'>bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</a>
<a id='line_17'></a>
<a id='line_18'>1:8 Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee</a>
<a id='line_19'>that which is convenient, 1:9 Yet for loveâ€™s sake I rather beseech</a>
<a id='line_20'>thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of</a>
<a id='line_21'>Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_22'></a>
<a id='line_23'>1:10 I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my</a>
<a id='line_24'>bonds: 1:11 Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now</a>
<a id='line_25'>profitable to thee and to me: 1:12 Whom I have sent again: thou</a>
<a id='line_26'>therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: 1:13 Whom I would</a>
<a id='line_27'>have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto</a>
<a id='line_28'>me in the bonds of the gospel: 1:14 But without thy mind would I do</a>
<a id='line_29'>nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but</a>
<a id='line_30'>willingly.</a>
<a id='line_31'></a>
<a id='line_32'>1:15 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou</a>
<a id='line_33'>shouldest receive him for ever; 1:16 Not now as a servant, but above a</a>
<a id='line_34'>servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto</a>
<a id='line_35'>thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?  1:17 If thou count me</a>
<a id='line_36'>therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>1:18 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine</a>
<a id='line_39'>account; 1:19 I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay</a>
<a id='line_40'>it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own</a>
<a id='line_41'>self besides.</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>1:20 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my</a>
<a id='line_44'>bowels in the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_45'></a>
<a id='line_46'>1:21 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing</a>
<a id='line_47'>that thou wilt also do more than I say.</a>
<a id='line_48'></a>
<a id='line_49'>1:22 But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through</a>
<a id='line_50'>your prayers I shall be given unto you.</a>
<a id='line_51'></a>
<a id='line_52'>1:23 There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</a>
<a id='line_53'>1:24 Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</a>
<a id='line_54'></a>
<a id='line_55'>1:25 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</a>
