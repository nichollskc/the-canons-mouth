<a id='line_7'>     And Death Of Mahomet The Second.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>      The siege of Constantinople by the Turks attracts our first</a>
<a id='line_10'>      attention to the person and character of the great destroyer.</a>
<a id='line_11'>      Mahomet the Second 1 was the son of the second Amurath; and</a>
<a id='line_12'>      though his mother has been decorated with the titles of Christian</a>
<a id='line_13'>      and princess, she is more probably confounded with the numerous</a>
<a id='line_14'>      concubines who peopled from every climate the harem of the</a>
<a id='line_15'>      sultan. His first education and sentiments were those of a devout</a>
<a id='line_16'>      Mussulman; and as often as he conversed with an infidel, he</a>
<a id='line_17'>      purified his hands and face by the legal rites of ablution. Age</a>
<a id='line_18'>      and empire appear to have relaxed this narrow bigotry: his</a>
<a id='line_19'>      aspiring genius disdained to acknowledge a power above his own;</a>
<a id='line_20'>      and in his looser hours he presumed (it is said) to brand the</a>
<a id='line_21'>      prophet of Mecca as a robber and impostor. Yet the sultan</a>
<a id='line_22'>      persevered in a decent reverence for the doctrine and discipline</a>
<a id='line_23'>      of the Koran: 2 his private indiscretion must have been sacred</a>
<a id='line_24'>      from the vulgar ear; and we should suspect the credulity of</a>
<a id='line_25'>      strangers and sectaries, so prone to believe that a mind which is</a>
<a id='line_26'>      hardened against truth must be armed with superior contempt for</a>
<a id='line_27'>      absurdity and error. Under the tuition of the most skilful</a>
<a id='line_28'>      masters, Mahomet advanced with an early and rapid progress in the</a>
<a id='line_29'>      paths of knowledge; and besides his native tongue it is affirmed</a>
<a id='line_30'>      that he spoke or understood five languages, 3 the Arabic, the</a>
<a id='line_31'>      Persian, the Chaldæan or Hebrew, the Latin, and the Greek. The</a>
<a id='line_32'>      Persian might indeed contribute to his amusement, and the Arabic</a>
<a id='line_33'>      to his edification; and such studies are familiar to the Oriental</a>
<a id='line_34'>      youth. In the intercourse of the Greeks and Turks, a conqueror</a>
<a id='line_35'>      might wish to converse with the people over which he was</a>
<a id='line_36'>      ambitious to reign: his own praises in Latin poetry 4 or prose 5</a>
<a id='line_37'>      might find a passage to the royal ear; but what use or merit</a>
<a id='line_38'>      could recommend to the statesman or the scholar the uncouth</a>
<a id='line_39'>      dialect of his Hebrew slaves? The history and geography of the</a>
<a id='line_40'>      world were familiar to his memory: the lives of the heroes of the</a>
<a id='line_41'>      East, perhaps of the West, 6 excited his emulation: his skill in</a>
<a id='line_42'>      astrology is excused by the folly of the times, and supposes some</a>
<a id='line_43'>      rudiments of mathematical science; and a profane taste for the</a>
<a id='line_44'>      arts is betrayed in his liberal invitation and reward of the</a>
<a id='line_45'>      painters of Italy. 7 But the influence of religion and learning</a>
<a id='line_46'>      were employed without effect on his savage and licentious nature.</a>
<a id='line_47'>      I will not transcribe, nor do I firmly believe, the stories of</a>
<a id='line_48'>      his fourteen pages, whose bellies were ripped open in search of a</a>
<a id='line_49'>      stolen melon; or of the beauteous slave, whose head he severed</a>
<a id='line_50'>      from her body, to convince the Janizaries that their master was</a>
<a id='line_51'>      not the votary of love. 701 His sobriety is attested by the</a>
<a id='line_52'>      silence of the Turkish annals, which accuse three, and three</a>
<a id='line_53'>      only, of the Ottoman line of the vice of drunkenness. 8 But it</a>
<a id='line_54'>      cannot be denied that his passions were at once furious and</a>
<a id='line_55'>      inexorable; that in the palace, as in the field, a torrent of</a>
<a id='line_56'>      blood was spilt on the slightest provocation; and that the</a>
<a id='line_57'>      noblest of the captive youth were often dishonored by his</a>
<a id='line_58'>      unnatural lust. In the Albanian war he studied the lessons, and</a>
<a id='line_59'>      soon surpassed the example, of his father; and the conquest of</a>
<a id='line_60'>      two empires, twelve kingdoms, and two hundred cities, a vain and</a>
<a id='line_61'>      flattering account, is ascribed to his invincible sword. He was</a>
<a id='line_62'>      doubtless a soldier, and possibly a general; Constantinople has</a>
<a id='line_63'>      sealed his glory; but if we compare the means, the obstacles, and</a>
<a id='line_64'>      the achievements, Mahomet the Second must blush to sustain a</a>
<a id='line_65'>      parallel with Alexander or Timour. Under his command, the Ottoman</a>
<a id='line_66'>      forces were always more numerous than their enemies; yet their</a>
<a id='line_67'>      progress was bounded by the Euphrates and the Adriatic; and his</a>
<a id='line_68'>      arms were checked by Huniades and Scanderbeg, by the Rhodian</a>
<a id='line_69'>      knights and by the Persian king.</a>

<a id='line_136'>      revels.]</a>
<a id='line_137'></a>
<a id='line_138'>      In the reign of Amurath, he twice tasted of royalty, and twice</a>
<a id='line_139'>      descended from the throne: his tender age was incapable of</a>
<a id='line_140'>      opposing his father’s restoration, but never could he forgive the</a>
<a id='line_141'>      viziers who had recommended that salutary measure. His nuptials</a>
<a id='line_142'>      were celebrated with the daughter of a Turkman emir; and, after a</a>
<a id='line_143'>      festival of two months, he departed from Adrianople with his</a>
<a id='line_144'>      bride, to reside in the government of Magnesia. Before the end of</a>
<a id='line_145'>      six weeks, he was recalled by a sudden message from the divan,</a>
<a id='line_146'>      which announced the decease of Amurath, and the mutinous spirit</a>
<a id='line_147'>      of the Janizaries. His speed and vigor commanded their obedience:</a>
<a id='line_148'>      he passed the Hellespont with a chosen guard: and at the distance</a>
<a id='line_149'>      of a mile from Adrianople, the viziers and emirs, the imams and</a>
<a id='line_150'>      cadhis, the soldiers and the people, fell prostrate before the</a>
<a id='line_151'>      new sultan. They affected to weep, they affected to rejoice: he</a>
<a id='line_152'>      ascended the throne at the age of twenty-one years, and removed</a>
<a id='line_153'>      the cause of sedition by the death, the inevitable death, of his</a>
<a id='line_154'>      infant brothers. 9 901 The ambassadors of Europe and Asia soon</a>
<a id='line_155'>      appeared to congratulate his accession and solicit his</a>
<a id='line_156'>      friendship; and to all he spoke the language of moderation and</a>
<a id='line_157'>      peace. The confidence of the Greek emperor was revived by the</a>
<a id='line_158'>      solemn oaths and fair assurances with which he sealed the</a>
<a id='line_159'>      ratification of the treaty: and a rich domain on the banks of the</a>
<a id='line_160'>      Strymon was assigned for the annual payment of three hundred</a>
<a id='line_161'>      thousand aspers, the pension of an Ottoman prince, who was</a>
<a id='line_162'>      detained at his request in the Byzantine court. Yet the neighbors</a>
<a id='line_163'>      of Mahomet might tremble at the severity with which a youthful</a>
<a id='line_164'>      monarch reformed the pomp of his father’s household: the expenses</a>
<a id='line_165'>      of luxury were applied to those of ambition, and a useless train</a>
<a id='line_166'>      of seven thousand falconers was either dismissed from his</a>
<a id='line_167'>      service, or enlisted in his troops. 902 In the first summer of</a>
<a id='line_168'>      his reign, he visited with an army the Asiatic provinces; but</a>
<a id='line_169'>      after humbling the pride, Mahomet accepted the submission, of the</a>
<a id='line_170'>      Caramanian, that he might not be diverted by the smallest</a>
<a id='line_171'>      obstacle from the execution of his great design. 10</a>

<a id='line_190'></a>
<a id='line_191'>      The Mahometan, and more especially the Turkish casuists, have</a>
<a id='line_192'>      pronounced that no promise can bind the faithful against the</a>
<a id='line_193'>      interest and duty of their religion; and that the sultan may</a>
<a id='line_194'>      abrogate his own treaties and those of his predecessors. The</a>
<a id='line_195'>      justice and magnanimity of Amurath had scorned this immoral</a>
<a id='line_196'>      privilege; but his son, though the proudest of men, could stoop</a>
<a id='line_197'>      from ambition to the basest arts of dissimulation and deceit.</a>
<a id='line_198'>      Peace was on his lips, while war was in his heart: he incessantly</a>
<a id='line_199'>      sighed for the possession of Constantinople; and the Greeks, by</a>
<a id='line_200'>      their own indiscretion, afforded the first pretence of the fatal</a>
<a id='line_201'>      rupture. 11 Instead of laboring to be forgotten, their</a>
<a id='line_202'>      ambassadors pursued his camp, to demand the payment, and even the</a>
<a id='line_203'>      increase, of their annual stipend: the divan was importuned by</a>
<a id='line_204'>      their complaints, and the vizier, a secret friend of the</a>
<a id='line_205'>      Christians, was constrained to deliver the sense of his brethren.</a>
<a id='line_206'>      “Ye foolish and miserable Romans,” said Calil, “we know your</a>
<a id='line_207'>      devices, and ye are ignorant of your own danger! The scrupulous</a>
<a id='line_208'>      Amurath is no more; his throne is occupied by a young conqueror,</a>
<a id='line_209'>      whom no laws can bind, and no obstacles can resist: and if you</a>
<a id='line_210'>      escape from his hands, give praise to the divine clemency, which</a>
<a id='line_211'>      yet delays the chastisement of your sins. Why do ye seek to</a>
<a id='line_212'>      affright us by vain and indirect menaces? Release the fugitive</a>
<a id='line_213'>      Orchan, crown him sultan of Romania; call the Hungarians from</a>
<a id='line_214'>      beyond the Danube; arm against us the nations of the West; and be</a>
<a id='line_215'>      assured, that you will only provoke and precipitate your ruin.”</a>
<a id='line_216'>      But if the fears of the ambassadors were alarmed by the stern</a>
<a id='line_217'>      language of the vizier, they were soothed by the courteous</a>
<a id='line_218'>      audience and friendly speeches of the Ottoman prince; and Mahomet</a>
<a id='line_219'>      assured them that on his return to Adrianople he would redress</a>
<a id='line_220'>      the grievances, and consult the true interests, of the Greeks. No</a>
<a id='line_221'>      sooner had he repassed the Hellespont, than he issued a mandate</a>
<a id='line_222'>      to suppress their pension, and to expel their officers from the</a>
<a id='line_223'>      banks of the Strymon: in this measure he betrayed a hostile mind;</a>
<a id='line_224'>      and the second order announced, and in some degree commenced, the</a>
<a id='line_225'>      siege of Constantinople. In the narrow pass of the Bosphorus, an</a>
<a id='line_226'>      Asiatic fortress had formerly been raised by his grandfather; in</a>
<a id='line_227'>      the opposite situation, on the European side, he resolved to</a>
<a id='line_228'>      erect a more formidable castle; and a thousand masons were</a>
<a id='line_229'>      commanded to assemble in the spring on a spot named Asomaton,</a>
<a id='line_230'>      about five miles from the Greek metropolis. 12 Persuasion is the</a>
<a id='line_231'>      resource of the feeble; and the feeble can seldom persuade: the</a>
<a id='line_232'>      ambassadors of the emperor attempted, without success, to divert</a>
<a id='line_233'>      Mahomet from the execution of his design. They represented, that</a>
<a id='line_234'>      his grandfather had solicited the permission of Manuel to build a</a>
<a id='line_235'>      castle on his own territories; but that this double</a>
<a id='line_236'>      fortification, which would command the strait, could only tend to</a>
<a id='line_237'>      violate the alliance of the nations; to intercept the Latins who</a>
<a id='line_238'>      traded in the Black Sea, and perhaps to annihilate the</a>
<a id='line_239'>      subsistence of the city. “I form no enterprise,” replied the</a>
<a id='line_240'>      perfidious sultan, “against the city; but the empire of</a>
<a id='line_241'>      Constantinople is measured by her walls. Have you forgot the</a>
<a id='line_242'>      distress to which my father was reduced when you formed a league</a>
<a id='line_243'>      with the Hungarians; when they invaded our country by land, and</a>
<a id='line_244'>      the Hellespont was occupied by the French galleys? Amurath was</a>
<a id='line_245'>      compelled to force the passage of the Bosphorus; and your</a>
<a id='line_246'>      strength was not equal to your malevolence. I was then a child at</a>

<a id='line_260'>      determined to unsheathe the sword, and to resist the approach and</a>

<a id='line_263'>      recommended a system less generous, and even less prudent, than</a>

<a id='line_331'>      was cut down in the woods of Heraclea and Nicomedia; and the</a>
<a id='line_332'>      stones were dug from the Anatolian quarries. Each of the thousand</a>
<a id='line_333'>      masons was assisted by two workmen; and a measure of two cubits</a>
<a id='line_334'>      was marked for their daily task. The fortress 16 was built in a</a>
<a id='line_335'>      triangular form; each angle was flanked by a strong and massy</a>
<a id='line_336'>      tower; one on the declivity of the hill, two along the sea-shore:</a>
<a id='line_337'>      a thickness of twenty-two feet was assigned for the walls, thirty</a>

<a id='line_339'>      platform of lead. Mahomet himself pressed and directed the work</a>
<a id='line_340'>      with indefatigable ardor: his three viziers claimed the honor of</a>
<a id='line_341'>      finishing their respective towers; the zeal of the cadhis</a>

<a id='line_343'>      by the service of God and the sultan; and the diligence of the</a>
<a id='line_344'>      multitude was quickened by the eye of a despot, whose smile was</a>
<a id='line_345'>      the hope of fortune, and whose frown was the messenger of death.</a>
<a id='line_346'>      The Greek emperor beheld with terror the irresistible progress of</a>
<a id='line_347'>      the work; and vainly strove, by flattery and gifts, to assuage an</a>

<a id='line_349'>      occasion of a quarrel. Such occasions must soon and inevitably be</a>
<a id='line_350'>      found. The ruins of stately churches, and even the marble columns</a>
<a id='line_351'>      which had been consecrated to Saint Michael the archangel, were</a>
<a id='line_352'>      employed without scruple by the profane and rapacious Moslems;</a>
<a id='line_353'>      and some Christians, who presumed to oppose the removal, received</a>
<a id='line_354'>      from their hands the crown of martyrdom. Constantine had</a>
<a id='line_355'>      solicited a Turkish guard to protect the fields and harvests of</a>
<a id='line_356'>      his subjects: the guard was fixed; but their first order was to</a>
<a id='line_357'>      allow free pasture to the mules and horses of the camp, and to</a>
<a id='line_358'>      defend their brethren if they should be molested by the natives.</a>
<a id='line_359'>      The retinue of an Ottoman chief had left their horses to pass the</a>
<a id='line_360'>      night among the ripe corn; the damage was felt; the insult was</a>
<a id='line_361'>      resented; and several of both nations were slain in a tumultuous</a>
<a id='line_362'>      conflict. Mahomet listened with joy to the complaint; and a</a>
<a id='line_363'>      detachment was commanded to exterminate the guilty village: the</a>
<a id='line_364'>      guilty had fled; but forty innocent and unsuspecting reapers were</a>
<a id='line_365'>      massacred by the soldiers. Till this provocation, Constantinople</a>
<a id='line_366'>      had been opened to the visits of commerce and curiosity: on the</a>
<a id='line_367'>      first alarm, the gates were shut; but the emperor, still anxious</a>
<a id='line_368'>      for peace, released on the third day his Turkish captives; 17 and</a>
<a id='line_369'>      expressed, in a last message, the firm resignation of a Christian</a>
<a id='line_370'>      and a soldier. “Since neither oaths, nor treaty, nor submission,</a>
<a id='line_371'>      can secure peace, pursue,” said he to Mahomet, “your impious</a>
<a id='line_372'>      warfare. My trust is in God alone; if it should please him to</a>
<a id='line_373'>      mollify your heart, I shall rejoice in the happy change; if he</a>
<a id='line_374'>      delivers the city into your hands, I submit without a murmur to</a>
<a id='line_375'>      his holy will. But until the Judge of the earth shall pronounce</a>
<a id='line_376'>      between us, it is my duty to live and die in the defence of my</a>
<a id='line_377'>      people.” The sultan’s answer was hostile and decisive: his</a>
<a id='line_378'>      fortifications were completed; and before his departure for</a>
<a id='line_379'>      Adrianople, he stationed a vigilant Aga and four hundred</a>
<a id='line_380'>      Janizaries, to levy a tribute on the ships of every nation that</a>
<a id='line_381'>      should pass within the reach of their cannon. A Venetian vessel,</a>
<a id='line_382'>      refusing obedience to the new lords of the Bosphorus, was sunk</a>
<a id='line_383'>      with a single bullet. 171 The master and thirty sailors escaped</a>
<a id='line_384'>      in the boat; but they were dragged in chains to the _Porte_: the</a>
<a id='line_385'>      chief was impaled; his companions were beheaded; and the</a>

<a id='line_389'>      divert the force of the brothers of Constantine. At this æra of</a>

<a id='line_428'>      palace of Jehan Numa, (the watchtower of the world;) but his</a>
<a id='line_429'>      serious thoughts were irrevocably bent on the conquest of the</a>

<a id='line_442'>      entertained a venal and treasonable correspondence, which was</a>
<a id='line_443'>      detected and punished after the conclusion of the war. On</a>
<a id='line_444'>      receiving the royal mandate, he embraced, perhaps for the last</a>
<a id='line_445'>      time, his wife and children; filled a cup with pieces of gold,</a>
<a id='line_446'>      hastened to the palace, adored the sultan, and offered, according</a>
<a id='line_447'>      to the Oriental custom, the slight tribute of his duty and</a>
<a id='line_448'>      gratitude. 22 “It is not my wish,” said Mahomet, “to resume my</a>
<a id='line_449'>      gifts, but rather to heap and multiply them on thy head. In my</a>
<a id='line_450'>      turn, I ask a present far more valuable and</a>
<a id='line_451'>      important;—Constantinople.” As soon as the vizier had recovered</a>
<a id='line_452'>      from his surprise, “The same God,” said he, “who has already</a>
<a id='line_453'>      given thee so large a portion of the Roman empire, will not deny</a>
<a id='line_454'>      the remnant, and the capital. His providence, and thy power,</a>

<a id='line_456'>      slaves, will sacrifice our lives and fortunes.”—“Lala,” 23 (or</a>
<a id='line_457'>      preceptor,) continued the sultan, “do you see this pillow? All</a>

<a id='line_507'>      artillery surpassed whatever had yet appeared in the world. A</a>
<a id='line_508'>      founder of cannon, a Dane 231 or Hungarian, who had been almost</a>
<a id='line_509'>      starved in the Greek service, deserted to the Moslems, and was</a>
<a id='line_510'>      liberally entertained by the Turkish sultan. Mahomet was</a>
<a id='line_511'>      satisfied with the answer to his first question, which he eagerly</a>
<a id='line_512'>      pressed on the artist. “Am I able to cast a cannon capable of</a>
<a id='line_513'>      throwing a ball or stone of sufficient size to batter the walls</a>
<a id='line_514'>      of Constantinople? I am not ignorant of their strength; but were</a>
<a id='line_515'>      they more solid than those of Babylon, I could oppose an engine</a>
<a id='line_516'>      of superior power: the position and management of that engine</a>
<a id='line_517'>      must be left to your engineers.” On this assurance, a foundry was</a>
<a id='line_518'>      established at Adrianople: the metal was prepared; and at the end</a>
<a id='line_519'>      of three months, Urban produced a piece of brass ordnance of</a>
<a id='line_520'>      stupendous, and almost incredible magnitude; a measure of twelve</a>
<a id='line_521'>      palms is assigned to the bore; and the stone bullet weighed above</a>
<a id='line_522'>      six hundred pounds. 24 241 A vacant place before the new palace</a>
<a id='line_523'>      was chosen for the first experiment; but to prevent the sudden</a>
<a id='line_524'>      and mischievous effects of astonishment and fear, a proclamation</a>
<a id='line_525'>      was issued, that the cannon would be discharged the ensuing day.</a>
<a id='line_526'>      The explosion was felt or heard in a circuit of a hundred</a>
<a id='line_527'>      furlongs: the ball, by the force of gunpowder, was driven above a</a>
<a id='line_528'>      mile; and on the spot where it fell, it buried itself a fathom</a>
<a id='line_529'>      deep in the ground. For the conveyance of this destructive</a>
<a id='line_530'>      engine, a frame or carriage of thirty wagons was linked together</a>
<a id='line_531'>      and drawn along by a team of sixty oxen: two hundred men on both</a>
<a id='line_532'>      sides were stationed, to poise and support the rolling weight;</a>
<a id='line_533'>      two hundred and fifty workmen marched before to smooth the way</a>
<a id='line_534'>      and repair the bridges; and near two months were employed in a</a>
<a id='line_535'>      laborious journey of one hundred and fifty miles. A lively</a>
<a id='line_536'>      philosopher 25 derides on this occasion the credulity of the</a>
<a id='line_537'>      Greeks, and observes, with much reason, that we should always</a>
<a id='line_538'>      distrust the exaggerations of a vanquished people. He calculates,</a>
<a id='line_539'>      that a ball, even of two hundred pounds, would require a charge</a>
<a id='line_540'>      of one hundred and fifty pounds of powder; and that the stroke</a>
<a id='line_541'>      would be feeble and impotent, since not a fifteenth part of the</a>
<a id='line_542'>      mass could be inflamed at the same moment. A stranger as I am to</a>
<a id='line_543'>      the art of destruction, I can discern that the modern</a>
<a id='line_544'>      improvements of artillery prefer the number of pieces to the</a>
<a id='line_545'>      weight of metal; the quickness of the fire to the sound, or even</a>

<a id='line_552'>      inconvenient, it has been found on a late trial that the effect</a>
<a id='line_553'>      was far from contemptible. A stone bullet of _eleven_ hundred</a>

<a id='line_595'>      was considered as imaginary by others as inevitable: the Western</a>
<a id='line_596'>      princes were involved in their endless and domestic quarrels; and</a>
<a id='line_597'>      the Roman pontiff was exasperated by the falsehood or obstinacy</a>
<a id='line_598'>      of the Greeks. Instead of employing in their favor the arms and</a>
<a id='line_599'>      treasures of Italy, Nicholas the Fifth had foretold their</a>
<a id='line_600'>      approaching ruin; and his honor was engaged in the accomplishment</a>
<a id='line_601'>      of his prophecy. 261 Perhaps he was softened by the last</a>
<a id='line_602'>      extremity of their distress; but his compassion was tardy; his</a>
<a id='line_603'>      efforts were faint and unavailing; and Constantinople had fallen,</a>
<a id='line_604'>      before the squadrons of Genoa and Venice could sail from their</a>
<a id='line_605'>      harbors. 27 Even the princes of the Morea and of the Greek</a>
<a id='line_606'>      islands affected a cold neutrality: the Genoese colony of Galata</a>
<a id='line_607'>      negotiated a private treaty; and the sultan indulged them in the</a>
<a id='line_608'>      delusive hope, that by his clemency they might survive the ruin</a>
<a id='line_609'>      of the empire. A plebeian crowd, and some Byzantine nobles basely</a>
<a id='line_610'>      withdrew from the danger of their country; and the avarice of the</a>

<a id='line_615'>      were equal to the peril, his strength was inadequate to the</a>

<a id='line_678'>      fifty-eight thousand does not exceed the measure of experience</a>
<a id='line_679'>      and probability. 30 The navy of the besiegers was less</a>
<a id='line_680'>      formidable: the Propontis was overspread with three hundred and</a>
<a id='line_681'>      twenty sail; but of these no more than eighteen could be rated as</a>
<a id='line_682'>      galleys of war; and the far greater part must be degraded to the</a>
<a id='line_683'>      condition of store-ships and transports, which poured into the</a>
<a id='line_684'>      camp fresh supplies of men, ammunition, and provisions. In her</a>
<a id='line_685'>      last decay, Constantinople was still peopled with more than a</a>
<a id='line_686'>      hundred thousand inhabitants; but these numbers are found in the</a>
<a id='line_687'>      accounts, not of war, but of captivity; and they mostly consisted</a>

<a id='line_693'>      children and his property, has lost in society the first and most</a>
<a id='line_694'>      active energies of nature. By the emperor’s command, a particular</a>
<a id='line_695'>      inquiry had been made through the streets and houses, how many of</a>
<a id='line_696'>      the citizens, or even of the monks, were able and willing to bear</a>
<a id='line_697'>      arms for their country. The lists were intrusted to Phranza; 31</a>
<a id='line_698'>      and, after a diligent addition, he informed his master, with</a>
<a id='line_699'>      grief and surprise, that the national defence was reduced to four</a>
<a id='line_700'>      thousand nine hundred and seventy _Romans_. Between Constantine</a>
<a id='line_701'>      and his faithful minister this comfortless secret was preserved;</a>
<a id='line_702'>      and a sufficient proportion of shields, cross-bows, and muskets,</a>
<a id='line_703'>      were distributed from the arsenal to the city bands. They derived</a>
<a id='line_704'>      some accession from a body of two thousand strangers, under the</a>
<a id='line_705'>      command of John Justiniani, a noble Genoese; a liberal donative</a>
<a id='line_706'>      was advanced to these auxiliaries; and a princely recompense, the</a>
<a id='line_707'>      Isle of Lemnos, was promised to the valor and victory of their</a>
<a id='line_708'>      chief. A strong chain was drawn across the mouth of the harbor:</a>

<a id='line_760'>      the act of union, as it had been ratified in the council of</a>
<a id='line_761'>      Florence. On the twelfth of December, the two nations, in the</a>
<a id='line_762'>      church of St. Sophia, joined in the communion of sacrifice and</a>
<a id='line_763'>      prayer; and the names of the two pontiffs were solemnly</a>
<a id='line_764'>      commemorated; the names of Nicholas the Fifth, the vicar of</a>
<a id='line_765'>      Christ, and of the patriarch Gregory, who had been driven into</a>

<a id='line_769'>      only partial, but imperfect. The bishop of Pamiers died in 1642,</a>
<a id='line_770'>      and the history of Ducas, which represents these scenes (c. 36,</a>
<a id='line_771'>      37) with such truth and spirit, was not printed till the year</a>
<a id='line_772'>      1649.]</a>
<a id='line_773'></a>
<a id='line_774'>      But the dress and language of the Latin priest who officiated at</a>
<a id='line_775'>      the altar were an object of scandal; and it was observed with</a>
<a id='line_776'>      horror, that he consecrated a cake or wafer of _unleavened_</a>
<a id='line_777'>      bread, and poured cold water into the cup of the sacrament. A</a>
<a id='line_778'>      national historian acknowledges with a blush, that none of his</a>
<a id='line_779'>      countrymen, not the emperor himself, were sincere in this</a>
<a id='line_780'>      occasional conformity. 33 Their hasty and unconditional</a>
<a id='line_781'>      submission was palliated by a promise of future revisal; but the</a>
<a id='line_782'>      best, or the worst, of their excuses was the confession of their</a>
<a id='line_783'>      own perjury. When they were pressed by the reproaches of their</a>
<a id='line_784'>      honest brethren, “Have patience,” they whispered, “have patience</a>
<a id='line_785'>      till God shall have delivered the city from the great dragon who</a>
<a id='line_786'>      seeks to devour us. You shall then perceive whether we are truly</a>
<a id='line_787'>      reconciled with the Azymites.” But patience is not the attribute</a>
<a id='line_788'>      of zeal; nor can the arts of a court be adapted to the freedom</a>
<a id='line_789'>      and violence of popular enthusiasm. From the dome of St. Sophia</a>
<a id='line_790'>      the inhabitants of either sex, and of every degree, rushed in</a>
<a id='line_791'>      crowds to the cell of the monk Gennadius, 34 to consult the</a>
<a id='line_792'>      oracle of the church. The holy man was invisible; entranced, as</a>
<a id='line_793'>      it should seem, in deep meditation, or divine rapture: but he had</a>
<a id='line_794'>      exposed on the door of his cell a speaking tablet; and they</a>
<a id='line_795'>      successively withdrew, after reading those tremendous words: “O</a>
<a id='line_796'>      miserable Romans, why will ye abandon the truth? and why, instead</a>
<a id='line_797'>      of confiding in God, will ye put your trust in the Italians? In</a>
<a id='line_798'>      losing your faith you will lose your city. Have mercy on me, O</a>
<a id='line_799'>      Lord! I protest in thy presence that I am innocent of the crime.</a>
<a id='line_800'>      O miserable Romans, consider, pause, and repent. At the same</a>
<a id='line_801'>      moment that you renounce the religion of your fathers, by</a>
<a id='line_802'>      embracing impiety, you submit to a foreign servitude.” According</a>
<a id='line_803'>      to the advice of Gennadius, the religious virgins, as pure as</a>
<a id='line_804'>      angels, and as proud as dæmons, rejected the act of union, and</a>
<a id='line_805'>      abjured all communion with the present and future associates of</a>
<a id='line_806'>      the Latins; and their example was applauded and imitated by the</a>
<a id='line_807'>      greatest part of the clergy and people. From the monastery, the</a>
<a id='line_808'>      devout Greeks dispersed themselves in the taverns; drank</a>
<a id='line_809'>      confusion to the slaves of the pope; emptied their glasses in</a>
<a id='line_810'>      honor of the image of the holy Virgin; and besought her to defend</a>
<a id='line_811'>      against Mahomet the city which she had formerly saved from</a>
<a id='line_812'>      Chosroes and the Chagan. In the double intoxication of zeal and</a>
<a id='line_813'>      wine, they valiantly exclaimed, “What occasion have we for</a>
<a id='line_814'>      succor, or union, or Latins? Far from us be the worship of the</a>
<a id='line_815'>      Azymites!” During the winter that preceded the Turkish conquest,</a>
<a id='line_816'>      the nation was distracted by this epidemical frenzy; and the</a>
<a id='line_817'>      season of Lent, the approach of Easter, instead of breathing</a>
<a id='line_818'>      charity and love, served only to fortify the obstinacy and</a>
<a id='line_819'>      influence of the zealots. The confessors scrutinized and alarmed</a>
<a id='line_820'>      the conscience of their votaries, and a rigorous penance was</a>
<a id='line_821'>      imposed on those who had received the communion from a priest who</a>
<a id='line_822'>      had given an express or tacit consent to the union. His service</a>
<a id='line_823'>      at the altar propagated the infection to the mute and simple</a>
<a id='line_824'>      spectators of the ceremony: they forfeited, by the impure</a>
<a id='line_825'>      spectacle, the virtue of the sacerdotal character; nor was it</a>
<a id='line_826'>      lawful, even in danger of sudden death, to invoke the assistance</a>
<a id='line_827'>      of their prayers or absolution. No sooner had the church of St.</a>
<a id='line_828'>      Sophia been polluted by the Latin sacrifice, than it was deserted</a>
<a id='line_829'>      as a Jewish synagogue, or a heathen temple, by the clergy and</a>
<a id='line_830'>      people; and a vast and gloomy silence prevailed in that venerable</a>
<a id='line_831'>      dome, which had so often smoked with a cloud of incense, blazed</a>
<a id='line_832'>      with innumerable lights, and resounded with the voice of prayer</a>
<a id='line_833'>      and thanksgiving. The Latins were the most odious of heretics and</a>
<a id='line_834'>      infidels; and the first minister of the empire, the great duke,</a>
<a id='line_835'>      was heard to declare, that he had rather behold in Constantinople</a>

<a id='line_862'>      Of the triangle which composes the figure of Constantinople, the</a>
<a id='line_863'>      two sides along the sea were made inaccessible to an enemy; the</a>

<a id='line_865'>      waters, the basis of the triangle, the land side was protected by</a>
<a id='line_866'>      a double wall, and a deep ditch of the depth of one hundred feet.</a>
<a id='line_867'>      Against this line of fortification, which Phranza, an</a>
<a id='line_868'>      eye-witness, prolongs to the measure of six miles, 36 the</a>

<a id='line_870'>      distributing the service and command of the most perilous</a>

<a id='line_873'>      ditch, or sallied into the field; but they soon discovered, that,</a>
<a id='line_874'>      in the proportion of their numbers, one Christian was of more</a>
<a id='line_875'>      value than twenty Turks: and, after these bold preludes, they</a>
<a id='line_876'>      were prudently content to maintain the rampart with their missile</a>

<a id='line_878'>      The nation was indeed pusillanimous and base; but the last</a>
<a id='line_879'>      Constantine deserves the name of a hero: his noble band of</a>
<a id='line_880'>      volunteers was inspired with Roman virtue; and the foreign</a>
<a id='line_881'>      auxiliaries supported the honor of the Western chivalry. The</a>
<a id='line_882'>      incessant volleys of lances and arrows were accompanied with the</a>
<a id='line_883'>      smoke, the sound, and the fire, of their musketry and cannon.</a>
<a id='line_884'>      Their small arms discharged at the same time either five, or even</a>
<a id='line_885'>      ten, balls of lead, of the size of a walnut; and, according to</a>
<a id='line_886'>      the closeness of the ranks and the force of the powder, several</a>
<a id='line_887'>      breastplates and bodies were transpierced by the same shot. But</a>

<a id='line_889'>      with ruins. Each day added to the science of the Christians; but</a>
<a id='line_890'>      their inadequate stock of gunpowder was wasted in the operations</a>
<a id='line_891'>      of each day. Their ordnance was not powerful, either in size or</a>
<a id='line_892'>      number; and if they possessed some heavy cannon, they feared to</a>
<a id='line_893'>      plant them on the walls, lest the aged structure should be shaken</a>
<a id='line_894'>      and overthrown by the explosion. 37 The same destructive secret</a>
<a id='line_895'>      had been revealed to the Moslems; by whom it was employed with</a>
<a id='line_896'>      the superior energy of zeal, riches, and despotism. The great</a>
<a id='line_897'>      cannon of Mahomet has been separately noticed; an important and</a>
<a id='line_898'>      visible object in the history of the times: but that enormous</a>
<a id='line_899'>      engine was flanked by two fellows almost of equal magnitude: 38</a>
<a id='line_900'>      the long order of the Turkish artillery was pointed against the</a>
<a id='line_901'>      walls; fourteen batteries thundered at once on the most</a>

<a id='line_962'>      that distinguishes the siege of Constantinople is the reunion of</a>
<a id='line_963'>      the ancient and modern artillery. The cannon were intermingled</a>

<a id='line_965'>      bullet and the battering-ram 411 were directed against the same</a>
<a id='line_966'>      walls: nor had the discovery of gunpowder superseded the use of</a>
<a id='line_967'>      the liquid and unextinguishable fire. A wooden turret of the</a>
<a id='line_968'>      largest size was advanced on rollers; this portable magazine of</a>
<a id='line_969'>      ammunition and fascines was protected by a threefold covering of</a>
<a id='line_970'>      bulls’ hides: incessant volleys were securely discharged from the</a>
<a id='line_971'>      loop-holes; in the front, three doors were contrived for the</a>
<a id='line_972'>      alternate sally and retreat of the soldiers and workmen. They</a>
<a id='line_973'>      ascended by a staircase to the upper platform, and, as high as</a>
<a id='line_974'>      the level of that platform, a scaling-ladder could be raised by</a>
<a id='line_975'>      pulleys to form a bridge, and grapple with the adverse rampart.</a>
<a id='line_976'>      By these various arts of annoyance, some as new as they were</a>
<a id='line_977'>      pernicious to the Greeks, the tower of St. Romanus was at length</a>
<a id='line_978'>      overturned: after a severe struggle, the Turks were repulsed from</a>

<a id='line_1017'>      The generosity of the Christian princes was cold and tardy; but</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      in the first apprehension of a siege, Constantine had negotiated,</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      in the isles of the Archipelago, the Morea, and Sicily, the most</a>
<a id='line_1020'>      indispensable supplies. As early as the beginning of April, five</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      42 great ships, equipped for merchandise and war, would have</a>
<a id='line_1022'>      sailed from the harbor of Chios, had not the wind blown</a>
<a id='line_1023'>      obstinately from the north. 43 One of these ships bore the</a>
<a id='line_1024'>      Imperial flag; the remaining four belonged to the Genoese; and</a>
<a id='line_1025'>      they were laden with wheat and barley, with wine, oil, and</a>
<a id='line_1026'>      vegetables, and, above all, with soldiers and mariners for the</a>
<a id='line_1027'>      service of the capital. After a tedious delay, a gentle breeze,</a>
<a id='line_1028'>      and, on the second day, a strong gale from the south, carried</a>
<a id='line_1029'>      them through the Hellespont and the Propontis: but the city was</a>
<a id='line_1030'>      already invested by sea and land; and the Turkish fleet, at the</a>
<a id='line_1031'>      entrance of the Bosphorus, was stretched from shore to shore, in</a>
<a id='line_1032'>      the form of a crescent, to intercept, or at least to repel, these</a>
<a id='line_1033'>      bold auxiliaries. The reader who has present to his mind the</a>
<a id='line_1034'>      geographical picture of Constantinople, will conceive and admire</a>
<a id='line_1035'>      the greatness of the spectacle. The five Christian ships</a>
<a id='line_1036'>      continued to advance with joyful shouts, and a full press both of</a>
<a id='line_1037'>      sails and oars, against a hostile fleet of three hundred vessels;</a>
<a id='line_1038'>      and the rampart, the camp, the coasts of Europe and Asia, were</a>
<a id='line_1039'>      lined with innumerable spectators, who anxiously awaited the</a>
<a id='line_1040'>      event of this momentous succor. At the first view that event</a>
<a id='line_1041'>      could not appear doubtful; the superiority of the Moslems was</a>
<a id='line_1042'>      beyond all measure or account: and, in a calm, their numbers and</a>
<a id='line_1043'>      valor must inevitably have prevailed. But their hasty and</a>
<a id='line_1044'>      imperfect navy had been created, not by the genius of the people,</a>
<a id='line_1045'>      but by the will of the sultan: in the height of their prosperity,</a>
<a id='line_1046'>      the Turks have acknowledged, that if God had given them the</a>
<a id='line_1047'>      earth, he had left the sea to the infidels; 44 and a series of</a>
<a id='line_1048'>      defeats, a rapid progress of decay, has established the truth of</a>
<a id='line_1049'>      their modest confession. Except eighteen galleys of some force,</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      the rest of their fleet consisted of open boats, rudely</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      constructed and awkwardly managed, crowded with troops, and</a>
<a id='line_1052'>      destitute of cannon; and since courage arises in a great measure</a>
<a id='line_1053'>      from the consciousness of strength, the bravest of the Janizaries</a>
<a id='line_1054'>      might tremble on a new element. In the Christian squadron, five</a>
<a id='line_1055'>      stout and lofty ships were guided by skilful pilots, and manned</a>
<a id='line_1056'>      with the veterans of Italy and Greece, long practised in the arts</a>
<a id='line_1057'>      and perils of the sea. Their weight was directed to sink or</a>
<a id='line_1058'>      scatter the weak obstacles that impeded their passage: their</a>
<a id='line_1059'>      artillery swept the waters: their liquid fire was poured on the</a>
<a id='line_1060'>      heads of the adversaries, who, with the design of boarding,</a>
<a id='line_1061'>      presumed to approach them; and the winds and waves are always on</a>
<a id='line_1062'>      the side of the ablest navigators. In this conflict, the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_1063'>      vessel, which had been almost overpowered, was rescued by the</a>
<a id='line_1064'>      Genoese; but the Turks, in a distant and closer attack, were</a>
<a id='line_1065'>      twice repulsed with considerable loss. Mahomet himself sat on</a>
<a id='line_1066'>      horseback on the beach to encourage their valor by his voice and</a>
<a id='line_1067'>      presence, by the promise of reward, and by fear more potent than</a>
<a id='line_1068'>      the fear of the enemy. The passions of his soul, and even the</a>
<a id='line_1069'>      gestures of his body, 45 seemed to imitate the actions of the</a>
<a id='line_1070'>      combatants; and, as if he had been the lord of nature, he spurred</a>
<a id='line_1071'>      his horse with a fearless and impotent effort into the sea. His</a>
<a id='line_1072'>      loud reproaches, and the clamors of the camp, urged the Ottomans</a>
<a id='line_1073'>      to a third attack, more fatal and bloody than the two former; and</a>
<a id='line_1074'>      I must repeat, though I cannot credit, the evidence of Phranza,</a>
<a id='line_1075'>      who affirms, from their own mouth, that they lost above twelve</a>
<a id='line_1076'>      thousand men in the slaughter of the day. They fled in disorder</a>
<a id='line_1077'>      to the shores of Europe and Asia, while the Christian squadron,</a>
<a id='line_1078'>      triumphant and unhurt, steered along the Bosphorus, and securely</a>
<a id='line_1079'>      anchored within the chain of the harbor. In the confidence of</a>
<a id='line_1080'>      victory, they boasted that the whole Turkish power must have</a>
<a id='line_1081'>      yielded to their arms; but the admiral, or captain bashaw, found</a>
<a id='line_1082'>      some consolation for a painful wound in his eye, by representing</a>
<a id='line_1083'>      that accident as the cause of his defeat. Balthi Ogli was a</a>
<a id='line_1084'>      renegade of the race of the Bulgarian princes: his military</a>
<a id='line_1085'>      character was tainted with the unpopular vice of avarice; and</a>
<a id='line_1086'>      under the despotism of the prince or people, misfortune is a</a>
<a id='line_1087'>      sufficient evidence of guilt. 451 His rank and services were</a>
<a id='line_1088'>      annihilated by the displeasure of Mahomet. In the royal presence,</a>
<a id='line_1089'>      the captain bashaw was extended on the ground by four slaves, and</a>
<a id='line_1090'>      received one hundred strokes with a golden rod: 46 his death had</a>
<a id='line_1091'>      been pronounced; and he adored the clemency of the sultan, who</a>
<a id='line_1092'>      was satisfied with the milder punishment of confiscation and</a>
<a id='line_1093'>      exile. The introduction of this supply revived the hopes of the</a>
<a id='line_1094'>      Greeks, and accused the supineness of their Western allies.</a>
<a id='line_1095'>      Amidst the deserts of Anatolia and the rocks of Palestine, the</a>
<a id='line_1096'>      millions of the crusades had buried themselves in a voluntary and</a>
<a id='line_1097'>      inevitable grave; but the situation of the Imperial city was</a>
<a id='line_1098'>      strong against her enemies, and accessible to her friends; and a</a>
<a id='line_1099'>      rational and moderate armament of the marine states might have</a>
<a id='line_1100'>      saved the relics of the Roman name, and maintained a Christian</a>
<a id='line_1101'>      fortress in the heart of the Ottoman empire. Yet this was the</a>
<a id='line_1102'>      sole and feeble attempt for the deliverance of Constantinople:</a>
<a id='line_1103'>      the more distant powers were insensible of its danger; and the</a>

<a id='line_1145'>      It was difficult for the Greeks to penetrate the secret of the</a>
<a id='line_1146'>      divan; yet the Greeks are persuaded, that a resistance so</a>
<a id='line_1147'>      obstinate and surprising, had fatigued the perseverance of</a>
<a id='line_1148'>      Mahomet. He began to meditate a retreat; and the siege would have</a>
<a id='line_1149'>      been speedily raised, if the ambition and jealousy of the second</a>
<a id='line_1150'>      vizier had not opposed the perfidious advice of Calil Bashaw, who</a>
<a id='line_1151'>      still maintained a secret correspondence with the Byzantine</a>
<a id='line_1152'>      court. The reduction of the city appeared to be hopeless, unless</a>
<a id='line_1153'>      a double attack could be made from the harbor as well as from the</a>
<a id='line_1154'>      land; but the harbor was inaccessible: an impenetrable chain was</a>
<a id='line_1155'>      now defended by eight large ships, more than twenty of a smaller</a>
<a id='line_1156'>      size, with several galleys and sloops; and, instead of forcing</a>
<a id='line_1157'>      this barrier, the Turks might apprehend a naval sally, and a</a>
<a id='line_1158'>      second encounter in the open sea. In this perplexity, the genius</a>
<a id='line_1159'>      of Mahomet conceived and executed a plan of a bold and marvellous</a>
<a id='line_1160'>      cast, of transporting by land his lighter vessels and military</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      stores from the Bosphorus into the higher part of the harbor. The</a>
<a id='line_1162'>      distance is about ten 471 miles; the ground is uneven, and was</a>
<a id='line_1163'>      overspread with thickets; and, as the road must be opened behind</a>
<a id='line_1164'>      the suburb of Galata, their free passage or total destruction</a>
<a id='line_1165'>      must depend on the option of the Genoese. But these selfish</a>
<a id='line_1166'>      merchants were ambitious of the favor of being the last devoured;</a>
<a id='line_1167'>      and the deficiency of art was supplied by the strength of</a>
<a id='line_1168'>      obedient myriads. A level way was covered with a broad platform</a>
<a id='line_1169'>      of strong and solid planks; and to render them more slippery and</a>
<a id='line_1170'>      smooth, they were anointed with the fat of sheep and oxen.</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      Fourscore light galleys and brigantines, of fifty and thirty</a>
<a id='line_1172'>      oars, were disembarked on the Bosphorus shore; arranged</a>
<a id='line_1173'>      successively on rollers; and drawn forwards by the power of men</a>
<a id='line_1174'>      and pulleys. Two guides or pilots were stationed at the helm, and</a>
<a id='line_1175'>      the prow, of each vessel: the sails were unfurled to the winds;</a>
<a id='line_1176'>      and the labor was cheered by song and acclamation. In the course</a>
<a id='line_1177'>      of a single night, this Turkish fleet painfully climbed the hill,</a>
<a id='line_1178'>      steered over the plain, and was launched from the declivity into</a>
<a id='line_1179'>      the shallow waters of the harbor, far above the molestation of</a>
<a id='line_1180'>      the deeper vessels of the Greeks. The real importance of this</a>
<a id='line_1181'>      operation was magnified by the consternation and confidence which</a>
<a id='line_1182'>      it inspired: but the notorious, unquestionable fact was displayed</a>
<a id='line_1183'>      before the eyes, and is recorded by the pens, of the two nations.</a>
<a id='line_1184'>      48 A similar stratagem had been repeatedly practised by the</a>
<a id='line_1185'>      ancients; 49 the Ottoman galleys (I must again repeat) should be</a>
<a id='line_1186'>      considered as large boats; and, if we compare the magnitude and</a>
<a id='line_1187'>      the distance, the obstacles and the means, the boasted miracle 50</a>
<a id='line_1188'>      has perhaps been equalled by the industry of our own times. 51 As</a>
<a id='line_1189'>      soon as Mahomet had occupied the upper harbor with a fleet and</a>
<a id='line_1190'>      army, he constructed, in the narrowest part, a bridge, or rather</a>
<a id='line_1191'>      mole, of fifty cubits in breadth, and one hundred in length: it</a>
<a id='line_1192'>      was formed of casks and hogsheads; joined with rafters, linked</a>
<a id='line_1193'>      with iron, and covered with a solid floor. On this floating</a>
<a id='line_1194'>      battery he planted one of his largest cannon, while the fourscore</a>
<a id='line_1195'>      galleys, with troops and scaling ladders, approached the most</a>
<a id='line_1196'>      accessible side, which had formerly been stormed by the Latin</a>
<a id='line_1197'>      conquerors. The indolence of the Christians has been accused for</a>
<a id='line_1198'>      not destroying these unfinished works; 511 but their fire, by a</a>
<a id='line_1199'>      superior fire, was controlled and silenced; nor were they wanting</a>
<a id='line_1200'>      in a nocturnal attempt to burn the vessels as well as the bridge</a>
<a id='line_1201'>      of the sultan. His vigilance prevented their approach; their</a>
<a id='line_1202'>      foremost galiots were sunk or taken; forty youths, the bravest of</a>
<a id='line_1203'>      Italy and Greece, were inhumanly massacred at his command; nor</a>
<a id='line_1204'>      could the emperor’s grief be assuaged by the just though cruel</a>
<a id='line_1205'>      retaliation, of exposing from the walls the heads of two hundred</a>
<a id='line_1206'>      and sixty Mussulman captives. After a siege of forty days, the</a>
<a id='line_1207'>      fate of Constantinople could no longer be averted. The diminutive</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      garrison was exhausted by a double attack: the fortifications,</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      which had stood for ages against hostile violence, were</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      dismantled on all sides by the Ottoman cannon: many breaches were</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      opened; and near the gate of St. Romanus, four towers had been</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      levelled with the ground. For the payment of his feeble and</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      mutinous troops, Constantine was compelled to despoil the</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      churches with the promise of a fourfold restitution; and his</a>
<a id='line_1215'>      sacrilege offered a new reproach to the enemies of the union. A</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      spirit of discord impaired the remnant of the Christian strength;</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      the Genoese and Venetian auxiliaries asserted the preeminence of</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      their respective service; and Justiniani and the great duke,</a>
<a id='line_1219'>      whose ambition was not extinguished by the common danger, accused</a>

<a id='line_1252'>      had passed between the camp and the city. 52 The Greek emperor</a>
<a id='line_1253'>      was humbled by adversity; and would have yielded to any terms</a>

<a id='line_1259'>      Mahomet might have been satisfied with an annual sum of one</a>
<a id='line_1260'>      hundred thousand ducats; but his ambition grasped the capital of</a>
<a id='line_1261'>      the East: to the prince he offered a rich equivalent, to the</a>
<a id='line_1262'>      people a free toleration, or a safe departure: but after some</a>
<a id='line_1263'>      fruitless treaty, he declared his resolution of finding either a</a>
<a id='line_1264'>      throne, or a grave, under the walls of Constantinople. A sense of</a>
<a id='line_1265'>      honor, and the fear of universal reproach, forbade Palæologus to</a>
<a id='line_1266'>      resign the city into the hands of the Ottomans; and he determined</a>

<a id='line_1269'>      was granted by his favorite science of astrology, which had fixed</a>
<a id='line_1270'>      on the twenty-ninth of May, as the fortunate and fatal hour. On</a>
<a id='line_1271'>      the evening of the twenty-seventh, he issued his final orders;</a>
<a id='line_1272'>      assembled in his presence the military chiefs, and dispersed his</a>
<a id='line_1273'>      heralds through the camp to proclaim the duty, and the motives,</a>
<a id='line_1274'>      of the perilous enterprise. Fear is the first principle of a</a>
<a id='line_1275'>      despotic government; and his menaces were expressed in the</a>
<a id='line_1276'>      Oriental style, that the fugitives and deserters, had they the</a>
<a id='line_1277'>      wings of a bird, 53 should not escape from his inexorable</a>
<a id='line_1278'>      justice. The greatest part of his bashaws and Janizaries were the</a>
<a id='line_1279'>      offspring of Christian parents: but the glories of the Turkish</a>
<a id='line_1280'>      name were perpetuated by successive adoption; and in the gradual</a>

<a id='line_1284'>      prayer, their bodies with seven ablutions; and to abstain from</a>
<a id='line_1285'>      food till the close of the ensuing day. A crowd of dervises</a>

<a id='line_1290'>      temporal and visible rewards. A double pay was promised to the</a>
<a id='line_1291'>      victorious troops: “The city and the buildings,” said Mahomet,</a>

<a id='line_1405'>      Under pain of death, silence was enjoined: but the physical laws</a>

<a id='line_1408'>      but the march and labor of thousands must inevitably produce a</a>
<a id='line_1409'>      strange confusion of dissonant clamors, which reached the ears of</a>
<a id='line_1410'>      the watchmen of the towers. At daybreak, without the customary</a>
<a id='line_1411'>      signal of the morning gun, the Turks assaulted the city by sea</a>
<a id='line_1412'>      and land; and the similitude of a twined or twisted thread has</a>
<a id='line_1413'>      been applied to the closeness and continuity of their line of</a>
<a id='line_1414'>      attack. 57 The foremost ranks consisted of the refuse of the</a>
<a id='line_1415'>      host, a voluntary crowd who fought without order or command; of</a>
<a id='line_1416'>      the feebleness of age or childhood, of peasants and vagrants, and</a>
<a id='line_1417'>      of all who had joined the camp in the blind hope of plunder and</a>
<a id='line_1418'>      martyrdom. The common impulse drove them onwards to the wall; the</a>
<a id='line_1419'>      most audacious to climb were instantly precipitated; and not a</a>
<a id='line_1420'>      dart, not a bullet, of the Christians, was idly wasted on the</a>
<a id='line_1421'>      accumulated throng. But their strength and ammunition were</a>
<a id='line_1422'>      exhausted in this laborious defence: the ditch was filled with</a>
<a id='line_1423'>      the bodies of the slain; they supported the footsteps of their</a>
<a id='line_1424'>      companions; and of this devoted vanguard the death was more</a>
<a id='line_1425'>      serviceable than the life. Under their respective bashaws and</a>
<a id='line_1426'>      sanjaks, the troops of Anatolia and Romania were successively led</a>
<a id='line_1427'>      to the charge: their progress was various and doubtful; but,</a>
<a id='line_1428'>      after a conflict of two hours, the Greeks still maintained, and</a>
<a id='line_1429'>      improved their advantage; and the voice of the emperor was heard,</a>
<a id='line_1430'>      encouraging his soldiers to achieve, by a last effort, the</a>
<a id='line_1431'>      deliverance of their country. In that fatal moment, the</a>
<a id='line_1432'>      Janizaries arose, fresh, vigorous, and invincible. The sultan</a>
<a id='line_1433'>      himself on horseback, with an iron mace in his hand, was the</a>
<a id='line_1434'>      spectator and judge of their valor: he was surrounded by ten</a>
<a id='line_1435'>      thousand of his domestic troops, whom he reserved for the</a>
<a id='line_1436'>      decisive occasion; and the tide of battle was directed and</a>
<a id='line_1437'>      impelled by his voice and eye. His numerous ministers of justice</a>
<a id='line_1438'>      were posted behind the line, to urge, to restrain, and to punish;</a>
<a id='line_1439'>      and if danger was in the front, shame and inevitable death were</a>
<a id='line_1440'>      in the rear, of the fugitives. The cries of fear and of pain were</a>
<a id='line_1441'>      drowned in the martial music of drums, trumpets, and attaballs;</a>
<a id='line_1442'>      and experience has proved, that the mechanical operation of</a>
<a id='line_1443'>      sounds, by quickening the circulation of the blood and spirits,</a>
<a id='line_1444'>      will act on the human machine more forcibly than the eloquence of</a>
<a id='line_1445'>      reason and honor. From the lines, the galleys, and the bridge,</a>

<a id='line_1480'>      Ottomans was fifty, perhaps a hundred, times superior to that of</a>
<a id='line_1481'>      the Christians; the double walls were reduced by the cannon to a</a>

<a id='line_1493'>      success had proved that the achievement was possible: the walls</a>
<a id='line_1494'>      and towers were instantly covered with a swarm of Turks; and the</a>
<a id='line_1495'>      Greeks, now driven from the vantage ground, were overwhelmed by</a>
<a id='line_1496'>      increasing multitudes. Amidst these multitudes, the emperor, 59</a>
<a id='line_1497'>      who accomplished all the duties of a general and a soldier, was</a>
<a id='line_1498'>      long seen and finally lost. The nobles, who fought round his</a>
<a id='line_1499'>      person, sustained, till their last breath, the honorable names of</a>
<a id='line_1500'>      Palæologus and Cantacuzene: his mournful exclamation was heard,</a>
<a id='line_1501'>      “Cannot there be found a Christian to cut off my head?” 60 and</a>
<a id='line_1502'>      his last fear was that of falling alive into the hands of the</a>
<a id='line_1503'>      infidels. 61 The prudent despair of Constantine cast away the</a>
<a id='line_1504'>      purple: amidst the tumult he fell by an unknown hand, and his</a>
<a id='line_1505'>      body was buried under a mountain of the slain. After his death,</a>
<a id='line_1506'>      resistance and order were no more: the Greeks fled towards the</a>
<a id='line_1507'>      city; and many were pressed and stifled in the narrow pass of the</a>
<a id='line_1508'>      gate of St. Romanus. The victorious Turks rushed through the</a>
<a id='line_1509'>      breaches of the inner wall; and as they advanced into the</a>

<a id='line_1640'>      captivity, the ranks of society were confounded; the ties of</a>
<a id='line_1641'>      nature were cut asunder; and the inexorable soldier was careless</a>
<a id='line_1642'>      of the father’s groans, the tears of the mother, and the</a>

<a id='line_1648'>      these domestic animals, whole strings were rudely driven through</a>
<a id='line_1649'>      the streets; and as the conquerors were eager to return for more</a>

<a id='line_1662'>      slavery, he recovered his freedom: in the ensuing winter he</a>
<a id='line_1663'>      ventured to Adrianople, and ransomed his wife from the _mir</a>
<a id='line_1664'>      bashi_, or master of the horse; but his two children, in the</a>
<a id='line_1665'>      flower of youth and beauty, had been seized for the use of</a>
<a id='line_1666'>      Mahomet himself. The daughter of Phranza died in the seraglio,</a>
<a id='line_1667'>      perhaps a virgin: his son, in the fifteenth year of his age,</a>
<a id='line_1668'>      preferred death to infamy, and was stabbed by the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_1669'>      royal lover. 66 A deed thus inhuman cannot surely be expiated by</a>
<a id='line_1670'>      the taste and liberality with which he released a Grecian matron</a>
<a id='line_1671'>      and her two daughters, on receiving a Latin doe From ode from</a>
<a id='line_1672'>      Philelphus, who had chosen a wife in that noble family. 67 The</a>
<a id='line_1673'>      pride or cruelty of Mahomet would have been most sensibly</a>

<a id='line_1933'>      groves and fountains, for the devotion and refreshment of the</a>

<a id='line_1946'>      obeyed the royal mandate, which enjoined them, under pain of</a>
<a id='line_1947'>      death, to occupy their new habitations in the capital. The throne</a>
<a id='line_1948'>      of Mahomet was guarded by the numbers and fidelity of his Moslem</a>
<a id='line_1949'>      subjects: but his rational policy aspired to collect the remnant</a>

<a id='line_2031'>      misery. The _hexamilion_, the rampart of the Isthmus, so often</a>

<a id='line_2033'>      three hundred Italian archers: the keys of Corinth were seized by</a>

<a id='line_2041'>      conduct. Neither the ties of blood, nor the oaths which they</a>
<a id='line_2042'>      repeatedly pledged in the communion and before the altar, nor the</a>
<a id='line_2043'>      stronger pressure of necessity, could reconcile or suspend their</a>

<a id='line_2045'>      and sword: the alms and succors of the West were consumed in</a>
<a id='line_2046'>      civil hostility; and their power was only exerted in savage and</a>
<a id='line_2047'>      arbitrary executions. The distress and revenge of the weaker</a>
<a id='line_2048'>      rival invoked their supreme lord; and, in the season of maturity</a>
<a id='line_2049'>      and revenge, Mahomet declared himself the friend of Demetrius,</a>
<a id='line_2050'>      and marched into the Morea with an irresistible force. When he</a>
<a id='line_2051'>      had taken possession of Sparta, “You are too weak,” said the</a>
<a id='line_2052'>      sultan, “to control this turbulent province: I will take your</a>
<a id='line_2053'>      daughter to my bed; and you shall pass the remainder of your life</a>
<a id='line_2054'>      in security and honor.” Demetrius sighed and obeyed; surrendered</a>
<a id='line_2055'>      his daughter and his castles; followed to Adrianople his</a>
<a id='line_2056'>      sovereign and his son; and received for his own maintenance, and</a>

<a id='line_2060'>      after the taking of Constantinople by the Latins, had founded a</a>
<a id='line_2061'>      new empire on the coast of the Black Sea. 87 In the progress of</a>
<a id='line_2062'>      his Anatolian conquest, Mahomet invested with a fleet and army</a>
<a id='line_2063'>      the capital of David, who presumed to style himself emperor of</a>
<a id='line_2064'>      Trebizond; 88 and the negotiation was comprised in a short and</a>
<a id='line_2065'>      peremptory question, “Will you secure your life and treasures by</a>
<a id='line_2066'>      resigning your kingdom? or had you rather forfeit your kingdom,</a>
<a id='line_2067'>      your treasures, and your life?” The feeble Comnenus was subdued</a>
<a id='line_2068'>      by his own fears, 881 and the example of a Mussulman neighbor,</a>
<a id='line_2069'>      the prince of Sinope, 89 who, on a similar summons, had yielded a</a>
<a id='line_2070'>      fortified city, with four hundred cannon and ten or twelve</a>

<a id='line_2072'>      performed: 891 and the emperor, with his family, was transported</a>
<a id='line_2073'>      to a castle in Romania; but on a slight suspicion of</a>
<a id='line_2074'>      corresponding with the Persian king, David, and the whole</a>
<a id='line_2075'>      Comnenian race, were sacrificed to the jealousy or avarice of the</a>
<a id='line_2076'>      conqueror. 892 Nor could the name of father long protect the</a>
<a id='line_2077'>      unfortunate Demetrius from exile and confiscation; his abject</a>
<a id='line_2078'>      submission moved the pity and contempt of the sultan; his</a>
<a id='line_2079'>      followers were transplanted to Constantinople; and his poverty</a>
<a id='line_2080'>      was alleviated by a pension of fifty thousand aspers, till a</a>
<a id='line_2081'>      monastic habit and a tardy death released Palæologus from an</a>
<a id='line_2082'>      earthly master. It is not easy to pronounce whether the servitude</a>
<a id='line_2083'>      of Demetrius, or the exile of his brother Thomas, 90 be the most</a>
<a id='line_2084'>      inglorious. On the conquest of the Morea, the despot escaped to</a>
<a id='line_2085'>      Corfu, and from thence to Italy, with some naked adherents: his</a>
<a id='line_2086'>      name, his sufferings, and the head of the apostle St. Andrew,</a>
<a id='line_2087'>      entitled him to the hospitality of the Vatican; and his misery</a>
<a id='line_2088'>      was prolonged by a pension of six thousand ducats from the pope</a>
<a id='line_2089'>      and cardinals. His two sons, Andrew and Manuel, were educated in</a>
<a id='line_2090'>      Italy; but the eldest, contemptible to his enemies and burdensome</a>
<a id='line_2091'>      to his friends, was degraded by the baseness of his life and</a>
<a id='line_2092'>      marriage. A title was his sole inheritance; and that inheritance</a>

<a id='line_2094'>      During his transient prosperity, Charles the Eighth was ambitious</a>

<a id='line_2217'>      who composed every epistle, and attended every meeting, Æneas</a>
<a id='line_2218'>      Sylvius, 95 a statesman and orator, describes from his own</a>
<a id='line_2219'>      experience the repugnant state and spirit of Christendom. “It is</a>
<a id='line_2220'>      a body,” says he, “without a head; a republic without laws or</a>
<a id='line_2221'>      magistrates. The pope and the emperor may shine as lofty titles,</a>
<a id='line_2222'>      as splendid images; but _they_ are unable to command, and none</a>
<a id='line_2223'>      are willing to obey: every state has a separate prince, and every</a>
<a id='line_2224'>      prince has a separate interest. What eloquence could unite so</a>
<a id='line_2225'>      many discordant and hostile powers under the same standard? Could</a>
<a id='line_2226'>      they be assembled in arms, who would dare to assume the office of</a>
<a id='line_2227'>      general? What order could be maintained?—what military</a>
<a id='line_2228'>      discipline? Who would undertake to feed such an enormous</a>
<a id='line_2229'>      multitude? Who would understand their various languages, or</a>
<a id='line_2230'>      direct their stranger and incompatible manners? What mortal could</a>
<a id='line_2231'>      reconcile the Germans with the French, Genoa with Arragon, the</a>
<a id='line_2232'>      Germans with the natives of Hungary and Bohemia? If a small</a>
<a id='line_2233'>      number enlisted in the holy war, they must be overthrown by the</a>
<a id='line_2234'>      infidels; if many, by their own weight and confusion.” Yet the</a>
<a id='line_2235'>      same Æneas, when he was raised to the papal throne, under the</a>
<a id='line_2236'>      name of Pius the Second, devoted his life to the prosecution of</a>
<a id='line_2237'>      the Turkish war. In the council of Mantua he excited some sparks</a>
<a id='line_2238'>      of a false or feeble enthusiasm; but when the pontiff appeared at</a>
<a id='line_2239'>      Ancona, to embark in person with the troops, engagements vanished</a>
<a id='line_2240'>      in excuses; a precise day was adjourned to an indefinite term;</a>
<a id='line_2241'>      and his effective army consisted of some German pilgrims, whom he</a>
<a id='line_2242'>      was obliged to disband with indulgences and arms. Regardless of</a>
<a id='line_2243'>      futurity, his successors and the powers of Italy were involved in</a>
<a id='line_2244'>      the schemes of present and domestic ambition; and the distance or</a>
<a id='line_2245'>      proximity of each object determined in their eyes its apparent</a>
<a id='line_2246'>      magnitude. A more enlarged view of their interest would have</a>
<a id='line_2247'>      taught them to maintain a defensive and naval war against the</a>
<a id='line_2248'>      common enemy; and the support of Scanderbeg and his brave</a>
<a id='line_2249'>      Albanians might have prevented the subsequent invasion of the</a>
<a id='line_2250'>      kingdom of Naples. The siege and sack of Otranto by the Turks</a>
<a id='line_2251'>      diffused a general consternation; and Pope Sixtus was preparing</a>
<a id='line_2252'>      to fly beyond the Alps, when the storm was instantly dispelled by</a>
<a id='line_2253'>      the death of Mahomet the Second, in the fifty-first year of his</a>
<a id='line_2254'>      age. 96 His lofty genius aspired to the conquest of Italy: he was</a>
<a id='line_2255'>      possessed of a strong city and a capacious harbor; and the same</a>
<a id='line_2256'>      reign might have been decorated with the trophies of the New and</a>

<a id='line_2300'>      is not less inferior in correctness than in magnificence to that</a>
