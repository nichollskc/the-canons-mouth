<a id='line_52'>    give the dozen white luces in their coat.</a>
<a id='line_53'>  SHALLOW. It is an old coat.</a>
<a id='line_54'>  EVANS. The dozen white louses do become an old coat well;</a>
<a id='line_55'>    it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to man, and</a>
<a id='line_56'>    signifies love.</a>
<a id='line_57'>  SHALLOW. The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old</a>

<a id='line_63'>  EVANS. Yes, py'r lady! If he has a quarter of your coat, there</a>
<a id='line_64'>    is but three skirts for yourself, in my simple conjectures;</a>
<a id='line_65'>    but that is all one. If Sir John Falstaff have committed</a>
<a id='line_66'>    disparagements unto you, I am of the church, and will be</a>
<a id='line_67'>    glad to do my benevolence, to make atonements and</a>
<a id='line_68'>    compremises between you.</a>
<a id='line_69'>  SHALLOW. The Council shall hear it; it is a riot.</a>
<a id='line_70'>  EVANS. It is not meet the Council hear a riot; there is no</a>
<a id='line_71'>    fear of Got in a riot; the Council, look you, shall desire</a>
<a id='line_72'>    to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a riot; take your</a>
<a id='line_73'>    vizaments in that.</a>
<a id='line_74'>  SHALLOW. Ha! o' my life, if I were young again, the sword</a>
<a id='line_75'>    should end it.</a>

<a id='line_81'>  SLENDER. Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and</a>

<a id='line_146'>  FALSTAFF. But not kiss'd your keeper's daughter.</a>

<a id='line_149'>    That is now answer'd.</a>
<a id='line_150'>  SHALLOW. The Council shall know this.</a>
<a id='line_151'>  FALSTAFF. 'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel:</a>
<a id='line_152'>    you'll be laugh'd at.</a>
<a id='line_153'>  EVANS. Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.</a>
<a id='line_154'>  FALSTAFF. Good worts! good cabbage! Slender, I broke your</a>
<a id='line_155'>    head; what matter have you against me?</a>
<a id='line_156'>  SLENDER. Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you;</a>
<a id='line_157'>    and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph, Nym,</a>
<a id='line_158'>    and Pistol. They carried me to the tavern, and made me</a>
<a id='line_159'>    drunk, and afterwards pick'd my pocket.</a>
<a id='line_160'>  BARDOLPH. You Banbury cheese!</a>
<a id='line_161'>  SLENDER. Ay, it is no matter.</a>
<a id='line_162'>  PISTOL. How now, Mephostophilus!</a>
<a id='line_163'>  SLENDER. Ay, it is no matter.</a>
<a id='line_164'>  NYM. Slice, I say! pauca, pauca; slice! That's my humour.</a>
<a id='line_165'>  SLENDER. Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?</a>
<a id='line_166'>  EVANS. Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is</a>
<a id='line_167'>    three umpires in this matter, as I understand: that is,</a>
<a id='line_168'>    Master Page, fidelicet Master Page; and there is myself,</a>
<a id='line_169'>    fidelicet myself; and the three party is, lastly and</a>
<a id='line_170'>    finally, mine host of the Garter.</a>
<a id='line_171'>  PAGE. We three to hear it and end it between them.</a>
<a id='line_172'>  EVANS. Fery goot. I will make a prief of it in my note-book;</a>
<a id='line_173'>    and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with as great</a>
<a id='line_174'>    discreetly as we can.</a>
<a id='line_175'>  FALSTAFF. Pistol!</a>
<a id='line_176'>  PISTOL. He hears with ears.</a>
<a id='line_177'>  EVANS. The tevil and his tam! What phrase is this, 'He hears</a>
<a id='line_178'>    with ear'? Why, it is affectations.</a>
<a id='line_179'>  FALSTAFF. Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?</a>
<a id='line_180'>  SLENDER. Ay, by these gloves, did he-or I would I might</a>
<a id='line_181'>    never come in mine own great chamber again else!-of</a>
<a id='line_182'>    seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward</a>
<a id='line_183'>    shovel-boards that cost me two shilling and two pence apiece</a>
<a id='line_184'>    of Yead Miller, by these gloves.</a>
<a id='line_185'>  FALSTAFF. Is this true, Pistol?</a>
<a id='line_186'>  EVANS. No, it is false, if it is a pick-purse.</a>
<a id='line_187'>  PISTOL. Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and master</a>
<a id='line_188'>    mine,</a>
<a id='line_189'>    I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.</a>
<a id='line_190'>    Word of denial in thy labras here!</a>
<a id='line_191'>    Word of denial! Froth and scum, thou liest.</a>
<a id='line_192'>  SLENDER. By these gloves, then, 'twas he.</a>
<a id='line_193'>  NYM. Be avis'd, sir, and pass good humours; I will say</a>
<a id='line_194'>    'marry trap' with you, if you run the nuthook's humour on</a>
<a id='line_195'>    me; that is the very note of it.</a>
<a id='line_196'>  SLENDER. By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for</a>
<a id='line_197'>    though I cannot remember what I did when you made me</a>
<a id='line_198'>    drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.</a>
<a id='line_199'>  FALSTAFF. What say you, Scarlet and John?</a>
<a id='line_200'>  BARDOLPH. Why, sir, for my part, I say the gentleman had</a>
<a id='line_201'>    drunk himself out of his five sentences.</a>
<a id='line_202'>  EVANS. It is his five senses; fie, what the ignorance is!</a>
<a id='line_203'>  BARDOLPH. And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashier'd;</a>
<a id='line_204'>    and so conclusions pass'd the careers.</a>
<a id='line_205'>  SLENDER. Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but 'tis no matter;</a>
<a id='line_206'>    I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again, but in honest,</a>
<a id='line_207'>    civil, godly company, for this trick. If I be drunk, I'll be</a>
<a id='line_208'>    drunk with those that have the fear of God, and not with</a>
<a id='line_209'>    drunken knaves.</a>
<a id='line_210'>  EVANS. So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.</a>
<a id='line_211'>  FALSTAFF. You hear all these matters deni'd, gentlemen; you</a>

<a id='line_244'>  SHALLOW. Nay, but understand me.</a>
<a id='line_245'>  SLENDER. So I do, sir.</a>
<a id='line_246'>  EVANS. Give ear to his motions: Master Slender, I will</a>
<a id='line_247'>    description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.</a>
<a id='line_248'>  SLENDER. Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says; I pray</a>
<a id='line_249'>    you pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his country,</a>
<a id='line_250'>    simple though I stand here.</a>
<a id='line_251'>  EVANS. But that is not the question. The question is</a>
<a id='line_252'>    concerning your marriage.</a>
<a id='line_253'>  SHALLOW. Ay, there's the point, sir.</a>
<a id='line_254'>  EVANS. Marry is it; the very point of it; to Mistress Anne</a>
<a id='line_255'>    Page.</a>
<a id='line_256'>  SLENDER. Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any</a>
<a id='line_257'>    reasonable demands.</a>
<a id='line_258'>  EVANS. But can you affection the oman? Let us command to</a>
<a id='line_259'>    know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers philosophers</a>
<a id='line_260'>    hold that the lips is parcel of the mouth. Therefore,</a>
<a id='line_261'>    precisely, can you carry your good will to the maid?</a>
<a id='line_262'>  SHALLOW. Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?</a>
<a id='line_263'>  SLENDER. I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that</a>
<a id='line_264'>    would do reason.</a>
<a id='line_265'>  EVANS. Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak possitable,</a>
<a id='line_266'>    if you can carry her your desires towards her.</a>
<a id='line_267'>  SHALLOW. That you must. Will you, upon good dowry,</a>
<a id='line_268'>    marry her?</a>
<a id='line_269'>  SLENDER. I will do a greater thing than that upon your request,</a>
<a id='line_270'>    cousin, in any reason.</a>
<a id='line_271'>  SHALLOW. Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz; what</a>
<a id='line_272'>    I do is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?</a>
<a id='line_273'>  SLENDER. I will marry her, sir, at your request; but if there</a>
<a id='line_274'>    be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may decrease</a>
<a id='line_275'>    it upon better acquaintance, when we are married and</a>
<a id='line_276'>    have more occasion to know one another. I hope upon</a>
<a id='line_277'>    familiarity will grow more contempt. But if you say</a>
<a id='line_278'>    'marry her,' I will marry her; that I am freely dissolved,</a>
<a id='line_279'>    and dissolutely.</a>
<a id='line_280'>  EVANS. It is a fery discretion answer, save the fall is in the</a>
<a id='line_281'>    ord 'dissolutely': the ort is, according to our meaning,</a>
<a id='line_282'>    'resolutely'; his meaning is good.</a>

<a id='line_408'>    gives the leer of invitation; I can construe the action of her</a>

<a id='line_695'>    to all uncomeliness that I would have sworn his disposition</a>
<a id='line_696'>    would have gone to the truth of his words; but they do no</a>

<a id='line_729'>  MRS. FORD. Nay, I will consent to act any villainy against</a>
<a id='line_730'>    him that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O</a>

<a id='line_733'>  MRS. PAGE. Why, look where he comes; and my good man</a>
<a id='line_734'>    too; he's as far from jealousy as I am from giving him</a>
<a id='line_735'>    cause; and that, I hope, is an unmeasurable distance.</a>

<a id='line_849'>  SHALLOW. Have with you, mine host.</a>
<a id='line_850'>  PAGE. I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in his</a>

<a id='line_854'>    I know not what. 'Tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis here,</a>

<a id='line_857'>  HOST. Here, boys, here, here! Shall we wag?</a>
<a id='line_858'>  PAGE. Have with you. I had rather hear them scold than</a>

<a id='line_862'>    easily. She was in his company at Page's house, and what</a>
<a id='line_863'>    they made there I know not. Well, I will look further into</a>
<a id='line_864'>    't, and I have a disguise to sound Falstaff. If I find her</a>

<a id='line_913'>  FALSTAFF. Good maid, then.</a>
<a id='line_914'>  QUICKLY. I'll be sworn;</a>
<a id='line_915'>    As my mother was, the first hour I was born.</a>
<a id='line_916'>  FALSTAFF. I do believe the swearer. What with me?</a>

<a id='line_926'>  FALSTAFF. I warrant thee nobody hears-mine own people,</a>

<a id='line_931'>  QUICKLY. Why, sir, she's a good creature. Lord, Lord, your</a>

<a id='line_933'>    us, I pray.</a>
<a id='line_934'>  FALSTAFF. Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford-</a>
<a id='line_935'>  QUICKLY. Marry, this is the short and the long of it: you</a>
<a id='line_936'>    have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis wonderful.</a>
<a id='line_937'>    The best courtier of them all, when the court lay at Windsor,</a>
<a id='line_938'>    could never have brought her to such a canary. Yet</a>
<a id='line_939'>    there has been knights, and lords, and gentlemen, with</a>
<a id='line_940'>    their coaches; I warrant you, coach after coach, letter after</a>
<a id='line_941'>    letter, gift after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so</a>
<a id='line_942'>    rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in such alligant</a>
<a id='line_943'>    terms; and in such wine and sugar of the best and the</a>
<a id='line_944'>    fairest, that would have won any woman's heart; and I</a>
<a id='line_945'>    warrant you, they could never get an eye-wink of her.</a>
<a id='line_946'>    I had myself twenty angels given me this morning; but I</a>
<a id='line_947'>    defy all angels, in any such sort, as they say, but in the</a>
<a id='line_948'>    way of honesty; and, I warrant you, they could never get</a>
<a id='line_949'>    her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them all;</a>
<a id='line_950'>    and yet there has been earls, nay, which is more,</a>
<a id='line_951'>    pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.</a>
<a id='line_952'>  FALSTAFF. But what says she to me? Be brief, my good she-</a>
<a id='line_953'>    Mercury.</a>
<a id='line_954'>  QUICKLY. Marry, she hath receiv'd your letter; for the</a>
<a id='line_955'>    which she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you</a>
<a id='line_956'>    to notify that her husband will be absence from his house</a>
<a id='line_957'>    between ten and eleven.</a>
<a id='line_958'>  FALSTAFF. Ten and eleven?</a>
<a id='line_959'>  QUICKLY. Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see</a>
<a id='line_960'>    the picture, she says, that you wot of. Master Ford, her</a>
<a id='line_961'>    husband, will be from home. Alas, the sweet woman leads</a>
<a id='line_962'>    an ill life with him! He's a very jealousy man; she leads a</a>
<a id='line_963'>    very frampold life with him, good heart.</a>
<a id='line_964'>  FALSTAFF. Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I</a>
<a id='line_965'>    will not fail her.</a>
<a id='line_966'>  QUICKLY. Why, you say well. But I have another messenger</a>
<a id='line_967'>    to your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty commendations</a>
<a id='line_968'>    to you too; and let me tell you in your ear, she's as</a>
<a id='line_969'>    fartuous a civil modest wife, and one, I tell you, that will</a>
<a id='line_970'>    not miss you morning nor evening prayer, as any is in</a>
<a id='line_971'>    Windsor, whoe'er be the other; and she bade me tell your</a>
<a id='line_972'>    worship that her husband is seldom from home, but she</a>
<a id='line_973'>    hopes there will come a time. I never knew a woman so</a>
<a id='line_974'>    dote upon a man: surely I think you have charms, la! Yes,</a>
<a id='line_975'>    in truth.</a>
<a id='line_976'>  FALSTAFF. Not I, I assure thee; setting the attraction of my</a>
<a id='line_977'>    good parts aside, I have no other charms.</a>
<a id='line_978'>  QUICKLY. Blessing on your heart for 't!</a>
<a id='line_979'>  FALSTAFF. But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and</a>
<a id='line_980'>    Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?</a>
<a id='line_981'>  QUICKLY. That were a jest indeed! They have not so little</a>
<a id='line_982'>    grace, I hope-that were a trick indeed! But Mistress Page</a>
<a id='line_983'>    would desire you to send her your little page of all loves.</a>
<a id='line_984'>    Her husband has a marvellous infection to the little page;</a>
<a id='line_985'>    and truly Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in</a>
<a id='line_986'>    Windsor leads a better life than she does; do what she will,</a>
<a id='line_987'>    say what she will, take all, pay all, go to bed when she</a>
<a id='line_988'>    list, rise when she list, all is as she will; and truly she</a>
<a id='line_989'>    deserves it; for if there be a kind woman in Windsor, she</a>
<a id='line_990'>    is one. You must send her your page; no remedy.</a>
<a id='line_991'>  FALSTAFF. Why, I will.</a>
<a id='line_992'>  QUICKLY. Nay, but do so then; and, look you, he may come</a>
<a id='line_993'>    and go between you both; and in any case have a</a>
<a id='line_994'>    nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and the boy</a>
<a id='line_995'>    never need to understand any thing; for 'tis not good that</a>
<a id='line_996'>    children should know any wickedness. Old folks, you</a>
<a id='line_997'>    know, have discretion, as they say, and know the world.</a>
<a id='line_998'>  FALSTAFF. Fare thee well; commend me to them both.</a>
<a id='line_999'>    There's my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with</a>
<a id='line_1000'>    this woman.  [Exeunt QUICKLY and ROBIN]  This news</a>
<a id='line_1001'>    distracts me.</a>
<a id='line_1002'>  PISTOL.  [Aside]  This punk is one of Cupid's carriers;</a>
<a id='line_1003'>    Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights;</a>
<a id='line_1004'>    Give fire; she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!    Exit</a>
<a id='line_1005'>  FALSTAFF. Say'st thou so, old Jack; go thy ways; I'll make</a>
<a id='line_1006'>    more of thy old body than I have done. Will they yet look</a>
<a id='line_1007'>    after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense of so much money,</a>
<a id='line_1008'>    be now a gainer? Good body, I thank thee. Let them say</a>
<a id='line_1009'>    'tis grossly done; so it be fairly done, no matter.</a>

<a id='line_1013'>  BARDOLPH. Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would</a>

<a id='line_1016'>  FALSTAFF. Brook is his name?</a>
<a id='line_1017'>  BARDOLPH. Ay, sir.</a>
<a id='line_1018'>  FALSTAFF. Call him in.  [Exit BARDOLPH]  Such Brooks are</a>
<a id='line_1019'>    welcome to me, that o'erflows such liquor. Ah, ha! Mistress</a>
<a id='line_1020'>    Ford and Mistress Page, have I encompass'd you? Go to;</a>
<a id='line_1021'>    via!</a>
<a id='line_1022'></a>
<a id='line_1023'>              Re-enter BARDOLPH, with FORD disguised</a>
<a id='line_1024'></a>
<a id='line_1025'>  FORD. Bless you, sir! FALSTAFF. And you, sir! Would you speak with</a>
<a id='line_1026'>  me? FORD. I make bold to press with so little preparation upon you.</a>
<a id='line_1027'>  FALSTAFF. You're welcome. What's your will? Give us leave, drawer.</a>
<a id='line_1028'>                                      Exit BARDOLPH FORD. Sir, I am a</a>
<a id='line_1029'>  gentleman that have spent much; my name is Brook. FALSTAFF. Good</a>
<a id='line_1030'>  Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you. FORD. Good Sir John,</a>
<a id='line_1031'>  I sue for yours-not to charge you; for I must let you understand I</a>
<a id='line_1032'>  think myself in better plight for a lender than you are; the which</a>
<a id='line_1033'>  hath something embold'ned me to this unseason'd intrusion; for they</a>
<a id='line_1034'>  say, if money go before, all ways do lie open. FALSTAFF. Money is a</a>
<a id='line_1035'>  good soldier, sir, and will on. FORD. Troth, and I have a bag of</a>
<a id='line_1036'>  money here troubles me; if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take</a>
<a id='line_1037'>  all, or half, for easing me of the carriage. FALSTAFF. Sir, I know</a>
<a id='line_1038'>  not how I may deserve to be your porter. FORD. I will tell you, sir,</a>
<a id='line_1039'>  if you will give me the hearing. FALSTAFF. Speak, good Master Brook;</a>
<a id='line_1040'>  I shall be glad to be your servant. FORD. Sir, I hear you are a</a>
<a id='line_1041'>  scholar-I will be brief with you -and you have been a man long known</a>
<a id='line_1042'>  to me, though I had never so good means as desire to make myself</a>
<a id='line_1043'>  acquainted with you. I shall discover a thing to you, wherein I must</a>
<a id='line_1044'>  very much lay open mine own imperfection; but, good Sir John, as you</a>
<a id='line_1045'>  have one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded, turn another</a>
<a id='line_1046'>  into the register of your own, that I may pass with a reproof the</a>
<a id='line_1047'>  easier, sith you yourself know how easy is it to be such an offender.</a>
<a id='line_1048'>  FALSTAFF. Very well, sir; proceed. FORD. There is a gentlewoman in</a>
<a id='line_1049'>  this town, her husband's name is Ford. FALSTAFF. Well, sir. FORD. I</a>
<a id='line_1050'>  have long lov'd her, and, I protest to you, bestowed much on her;</a>
<a id='line_1051'>  followed her with a doting observance; engross'd opportunities to</a>
<a id='line_1052'>  meet her; fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly give</a>
<a id='line_1053'>  me sight of her; not only bought many presents to give her, but have</a>
<a id='line_1054'>  given largely to many to know what she would have given; briefly, I</a>
<a id='line_1055'>  have pursu'd her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the wing</a>
<a id='line_1056'>  of all occasions. But whatsoever I have merited, either in my mind or</a>
<a id='line_1057'>  in my means, meed, I am sure, I have received none, unless experience</a>
<a id='line_1058'>  be a jewel; that I have purchased at an infinite rate, and that hath</a>
<a id='line_1059'>  taught me to say this: 'Love like a shadow flies when substance love</a>
<a id='line_1060'>  pursues; Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'</a>
<a id='line_1061'>  FALSTAFF. Have you receiv'd no promise of satisfaction at her hands?</a>
<a id='line_1062'>  FORD. Never. FALSTAFF. Have you importun'd her to such a purpose?</a>
<a id='line_1063'>  FORD. Never. FALSTAFF. Of what quality was your love, then? FORD.</a>
<a id='line_1064'>  Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so that I have lost</a>
<a id='line_1065'>  my edifice by mistaking the place where erected it. FALSTAFF. To what</a>
<a id='line_1066'>  purpose have you unfolded this to me? FORD. When I have told you</a>
<a id='line_1067'>  that, I have told you all. Some say that though she appear honest to</a>
<a id='line_1068'>  me, yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is</a>
<a id='line_1069'>  shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir John, here is the heart of</a>
<a id='line_1070'>  my purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable</a>
<a id='line_1071'>  discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your place and person,</a>
<a id='line_1072'>  generally allow'd for your many war-like, courtlike, and learned</a>
<a id='line_1073'>  preparations. FALSTAFF. O, sir! FORD. Believe it, for you know it.</a>
<a id='line_1074'>  There is money; spend it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have;</a>
<a id='line_1075'>  only give me so much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an</a>
<a id='line_1076'>  amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford's wife; use your art of</a>
<a id='line_1077'>  wooing, win her to consent to you; if any man may, you may as soon as</a>
<a id='line_1078'>  any. FALSTAFF. Would it apply well to the vehemency of your</a>
<a id='line_1079'>  affection, that I should win what you would enjoy? Methinks you</a>
<a id='line_1080'>  prescribe to yourself very preposterously. FORD. O, understand my</a>
<a id='line_1081'>  drift. She dwells so securely on the excellency of her honour that</a>
<a id='line_1082'>  the folly of my soul dares not present itself; she is too bright to</a>
<a id='line_1083'>  be look'd against. Now, could I come to her with any detection in my</a>
<a id='line_1084'>  hand, my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves; I</a>
<a id='line_1085'>  could drive her then from the ward of her purity, her reputation, her</a>
<a id='line_1086'>  marriage vow, and a thousand other her defences, which now are too</a>
<a id='line_1087'>  too strongly embattl'd against me. What say you to't, Sir John?</a>
<a id='line_1088'>  FALSTAFF. Master Brook, I will first make bold with your money; next,</a>
<a id='line_1089'>  give me your hand; and last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, if you</a>
<a id='line_1090'>  will, enjoy Ford's wife. FORD. O good sir! FALSTAFF. I say you shall.</a>
<a id='line_1091'>  FORD. Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none. FALSTAFF. Want no</a>
<a id='line_1092'>  Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want none. I shall be with</a>
<a id='line_1093'>  her, I may tell you, by her own appointment; even as you came in to</a>
<a id='line_1094'>  me her assistant, or go-between, parted from me; I say I shall be</a>
<a id='line_1095'>  with her between ten and eleven; for at that time the jealous</a>
<a id='line_1096'>  rascally knave, her husband, will be forth. Come you to me at night;</a>
<a id='line_1097'>  you shall know how I speed. FORD. I am blest in your acquaintance. Do</a>
<a id='line_1098'>  you know Ford, Sir? FALSTAFF. Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know</a>
<a id='line_1099'>  him not; yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the jealous</a>
<a id='line_1100'>  wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the which his wife seems to</a>
<a id='line_1101'>  me well-favour'd. I will use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's</a>
<a id='line_1102'>  coffer; and there's my harvest-home. FORD. I would you knew Ford,</a>
<a id='line_1103'>  sir, that you might avoid him if you saw him. FALSTAFF. Hang him,</a>
<a id='line_1104'>  mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will stare him out of his wits; I</a>
<a id='line_1105'>  will awe him with my cudgel; it shall hang like a meteor o'er the</a>
<a id='line_1106'>  cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I will predominate</a>
<a id='line_1107'>  over the peasant, and thou shalt lie with his wife. Come to me soon</a>
<a id='line_1108'>  at night. Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style; thou,</a>

<a id='line_1927'>    search'd it; but Fate, ordaining he should be a cuckold,</a>
<a id='line_1928'>    held his hand. Well, on went he for a search, and away</a>
<a id='line_1929'>    went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master</a>

<a id='line_1934'>    then, to be stopp'd in, like a strong distillation, with</a>
<a id='line_1935'>    stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease. Think of that</a>
<a id='line_1936'>    -a man of my kidney. Think of that-that am as subject to</a>
<a id='line_1937'>    heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution and thaw. It</a>
<a id='line_1938'>    was a miracle to scape suffocation. And in the height of</a>
<a id='line_1939'>    this bath, when I was more than half-stew'd in grease, like</a>
<a id='line_1940'>    a Dutch dish, to be thrown into the Thames, and cool'd,</a>
<a id='line_1941'>    glowing hot, in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of that</a>

<a id='line_2823'>  FORD. Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,</a>
<a id='line_2824'>    Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his horns,</a>

<a id='line_2829'>  MRS. FORD. Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never</a>

<a id='line_2831'>    always count you my deer.</a>
<a id='line_2832'>  FALSTAFF. I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.</a>
<a id='line_2833'>  FORD. Ay, and an ox too; both the proofs are extant.</a>
<a id='line_2834'>  FALSTAFF. And these are not fairies? I was three or four</a>
<a id='line_2835'>    times in the thought they were not fairies; and yet the</a>
<a id='line_2836'>    guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my powers,</a>
<a id='line_2837'>    drove the grossness of the foppery into a receiv'd belief,</a>
<a id='line_2838'>    in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason, that they</a>
<a id='line_2839'>    were fairies. See now how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent</a>
<a id='line_2840'>    when 'tis upon ill employment.</a>
<a id='line_2841'>  EVANS. Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your desires,</a>

<a id='line_2847'>  FALSTAFF. Have I laid my brain in the sun, and dried it, that</a>
<a id='line_2848'>    it wants matter to prevent so gross, o'er-reaching as this?</a>
<a id='line_2849'>    Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? Shall I have a cox-comb</a>

<a id='line_2854'>  FALSTAFF. 'Seese' and 'putter'! Have I liv'd to stand at the</a>
