<a id='line_3'>     The Conduct Of The Roman Government Towards The Christians, From</a>
<a id='line_4'>     The Reign Of Nero To That Of Constantine. 1111</a>

<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>      1111 (return) [ The sixteenth chapter I cannot help considering</a>
<a id='line_8'>      as a very ingenious and specious, but very disgraceful</a>
<a id='line_9'>      extenuation of the cruelties perpetrated by the Roman magistrates</a>
<a id='line_10'>      against the Christians. It is written in the most contemptibly</a>
<a id='line_11'>      factious spirit of prejudice against the sufferers; it is</a>
<a id='line_12'>      unworthy of a philosopher and of humanity. Let the narrative of</a>
<a id='line_13'>      CyprianÕs death be examined. He had to relate the murder of an</a>
<a id='line_14'>      innocent man of advanced age, and in a station deemed venerable</a>
<a id='line_15'>      by a considerable body of the provincials of Africa, put to death</a>
<a id='line_16'>      because he refused to sacrifice to Jupiter. Instead of pointing</a>
<a id='line_17'>      the indignation of posterity against such an atrocious act of</a>
<a id='line_18'>      tyranny, he dwells, with visible art, on the small circumstances</a>
<a id='line_19'>      of decorum and politeness which attended this murder, and which</a>
<a id='line_20'>      he relates with as much parade as if they were the most important</a>
<a id='line_21'>      particulars of the event. Dr. Robertson has been the subject of</a>
<a id='line_22'>      much blame for his real or supposed lenity towards the Spanish</a>
<a id='line_23'>      murderers and tyrants in America. That the sixteenth chapter of</a>
<a id='line_24'>      Mr. G. did not excite the same or greater disapprobation, is a</a>
<a id='line_25'>      proof of the unphilosophical and indeed fanatical animosity</a>
<a id='line_26'>      against Christianity, which was so prevalent during the latter</a>
<a id='line_27'>      part of the eighteenth century.Ñ_Mackintosh:_ see Life, i. p.</a>
<a id='line_28'>      244, 245.]</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>      If we seriously consider the purity of the Christian religion,</a>
<a id='line_31'>      the sanctity of its moral precepts, and the innocent as well as</a>
<a id='line_32'>      austere lives of the greater number of those who during the first</a>
<a id='line_33'>      ages embraced the faith of the gospel, we should naturally</a>
<a id='line_34'>      suppose, that so benevolent a doctrine would have been received</a>
<a id='line_35'>      with due reverence, even by the unbelieving world; that the</a>
<a id='line_36'>      learned and the polite, however they may deride the miracles,</a>
<a id='line_37'>      would have esteemed the virtues, of the new sect; and that the</a>
<a id='line_38'>      magistrates, instead of persecuting, would have protected an</a>
<a id='line_39'>      order of men who yielded the most passive obedience to the laws,</a>
<a id='line_40'>      though they declined the active cares of war and government. If,</a>
<a id='line_41'>      on the other hand, we recollect the universal toleration of</a>
<a id='line_42'>      Polytheism, as it was invariably maintained by the faith of the</a>
<a id='line_43'>      people, the incredulity of philosophers, and the policy of the</a>
<a id='line_44'>      Roman senate and emperors, we are at a loss to discover what new</a>
<a id='line_45'>      offence the Christians had committed, what new provocation could</a>
<a id='line_46'>      exasperate the mild indifference of antiquity, and what new</a>
<a id='line_47'>      motives could urge the Roman princes, who beheld without concern</a>
<a id='line_48'>      a thousand forms of religion subsisting in peace under their</a>
<a id='line_49'>      gentle sway, to inflict a severe punishment on any part of their</a>
<a id='line_50'>      subjects, who had chosen for themselves a singular but an</a>
<a id='line_51'>      inoffensive mode of faith and worship.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>      The religious policy of the ancient world seems to have assumed a</a>
<a id='line_54'>      more stern and intolerant character, to oppose the progress of</a>
<a id='line_55'>      Christianity. About fourscore years after the death of Christ,</a>
<a id='line_56'>      his innocent disciples were punished with death by the sentence</a>
<a id='line_57'>      of a proconsul of the most amiable and philosophic character, and</a>
<a id='line_58'>      according to the laws of an emperor distinguished by the wisdom</a>
<a id='line_59'>      and justice of his general administration. The apologies which</a>
<a id='line_60'>      were repeatedly addressed to the successors of Trajan are filled</a>
<a id='line_61'>      with the most pathetic complaints, that the Christians, who</a>
<a id='line_62'>      obeyed the dictates, and solicited the liberty, of conscience,</a>
<a id='line_63'>      were alone, among all the subjects of the Roman empire, excluded</a>
<a id='line_64'>      from the common benefits of their auspicious government. The</a>
<a id='line_65'>      deaths of a few eminent martyrs have been recorded with care; and</a>
<a id='line_66'>      from the time that Christianity was invested with the supreme</a>
<a id='line_67'>      power, the governors of the church have been no less diligently</a>
<a id='line_68'>      employed in displaying the cruelty, than in imitating the</a>
<a id='line_69'>      conduct, of their Pagan adversaries. To separate (if it be</a>
<a id='line_70'>      possible) a few authentic as well as interesting facts from an</a>
<a id='line_71'>      undigested mass of fiction and error, and to relate, in a clear</a>
<a id='line_72'>      and rational manner, the causes, the extent, the duration, and</a>
<a id='line_73'>      the most important circumstances of the persecutions to which the</a>
<a id='line_74'>      first Christians were exposed, is the design of the present</a>
<a id='line_75'>      chapter. 1222</a>
<a id='line_76'></a>
<a id='line_77'>      1222 (return) [ The history of the first age of Christianity is</a>
<a id='line_78'>      only found in the Acts of the Apostles, and in order to speak of</a>
<a id='line_79'>      the first persecutions experienced by the Christians, that book</a>
<a id='line_80'>      should naturally have been consulted; those persecutions, then</a>
<a id='line_81'>      limited to individuals and to a narrow sphere, interested only</a>
<a id='line_82'>      the persecuted, and have been related by them alone. Gibbon</a>
<a id='line_83'>      making the persecutions ascend no higher than Nero, has entirely</a>
<a id='line_84'>      omitted those which preceded this epoch, and of which St. Luke</a>
<a id='line_85'>      has preserved the memory. The only way to justify this omission</a>
<a id='line_86'>      was, to attack the authenticity of the Acts of the Apostles; for,</a>
<a id='line_87'>      if authentic, they must necessarily be consulted and quoted. Now,</a>
<a id='line_88'>      antiquity has left very few works of which the authenticity is so</a>
<a id='line_89'>      well established as that of the Acts of the Apostles. (See</a>
<a id='line_90'>      LardnerÕs Cred. of Gospel Hist. part iii.) It is therefore,</a>
<a id='line_91'>      without sufficient reason, that Gibbon has maintained silence</a>
<a id='line_92'>      concerning the narrative of St. Luke, and this omission is not</a>
<a id='line_93'>      without importance.ÑG.]</a>
<a id='line_94'></a>
<a id='line_95'>      The sectaries of a persecuted religion, depressed by fear</a>
<a id='line_96'>      animated with resentment, and perhaps heated by enthusiasm, are</a>
<a id='line_97'>      seldom in a proper temper of mind calmly to investigate, or</a>
<a id='line_98'>      candidly to appreciate, the motives of their enemies, which often</a>
<a id='line_99'>      escape the impartial and discerning view even of those who are</a>
<a id='line_100'>      placed at a secure distance from the flames of persecution. A</a>
<a id='line_101'>      reason has been assigned for the conduct of the emperors towards</a>
<a id='line_102'>      the primitive Christians, which may appear the more specious and</a>
<a id='line_103'>      probable as it is drawn from the acknowledged genius of</a>
<a id='line_104'>      Polytheism. It has already been observed, that the religious</a>
<a id='line_105'>      concord of the world was principally supported by the implicit</a>
<a id='line_106'>      assent and reverence which the nations of antiquity expressed for</a>
<a id='line_107'>      their respective traditions and ceremonies. It might therefore be</a>
<a id='line_108'>      expected, that they would unite with indignation against any sect</a>
<a id='line_109'>      or people which should separate itself from the communion of</a>
<a id='line_110'>      mankind, and claiming the exclusive possession of divine</a>
<a id='line_111'>      knowledge, should disdain every form of worship, except its own,</a>
<a id='line_112'>      as impious and idolatrous. The rights of toleration were held by</a>
<a id='line_113'>      mutual indulgence: they were justly forfeited by a refusal of the</a>
<a id='line_114'>      accustomed tribute. As the payment of this tribute was inflexibly</a>
<a id='line_115'>      refused by the Jews, and by them alone, the consideration of the</a>
<a id='line_116'>      treatment which they experienced from the Roman magistrates, will</a>
<a id='line_117'>      serve to explain how far these speculations are justified by</a>
<a id='line_118'>      facts, and will lead us to discover the true causes of the</a>
<a id='line_119'>      persecution of Christianity.</a>
<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>      Without repeating what has already been mentioned of the</a>
<a id='line_122'>      reverence of the Roman princes and governors for the temple of</a>
<a id='line_123'>      Jerusalem, we shall only observe, that the destruction of the</a>
<a id='line_124'>      temple and city was accompanied and followed by every</a>
<a id='line_125'>      circumstance that could exasperate the minds of the conquerors,</a>
<a id='line_126'>      and authorize religious persecution by the most specious</a>
<a id='line_127'>      arguments of political justice and the public safety. From the</a>
<a id='line_128'>      reign of Nero to that of Antoninus Pius, the Jews discovered a</a>
<a id='line_129'>      fierce impatience of the dominion of Rome, which repeatedly broke</a>
<a id='line_130'>      out in the most furious massacres and insurrections. Humanity is</a>
<a id='line_131'>      shocked at the recital of the horrid cruelties which they</a>
<a id='line_132'>      committed in the cities of Egypt, of Cyprus, and of Cyrene, where</a>
<a id='line_133'>      they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting</a>
<a id='line_134'>      natives; 1 and we are tempted to applaud the severe retaliation</a>
<a id='line_135'>      which was exercised by the arms of the legions against a race of</a>
<a id='line_136'>      fanatics, whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render</a>
<a id='line_137'>      them the implacable enemies not only of the Roman government, but</a>
<a id='line_138'>      of human kind. 2 The enthusiasm of the Jews was supported by the</a>
<a id='line_139'>      opinion, that it was unlawful for them to pay taxes to an</a>
<a id='line_140'>      idolatrous master; and by the flattering promise which they</a>
<a id='line_141'>      derived from their ancient oracles, that a conquering Messiah</a>
<a id='line_142'>      would soon arise, destined to break their fetters, and to invest</a>
<a id='line_143'>      the favorites of heaven with the empire of the earth. It was by</a>
<a id='line_144'>      announcing himself as their long-expected deliverer, and by</a>
<a id='line_145'>      calling on all the descendants of Abraham to assert the hope of</a>
<a id='line_146'>      Israel, that the famous Barchochebas collected a formidable army,</a>
<a id='line_147'>      with which he resisted during two years the power of the emperor</a>

<a id='line_152'>      victims were sawn asunder, according to a precedent to which</a>

<a id='line_163'>      HadrianÕs war 580,000 Jews were cut off by the sword, besides an</a>
<a id='line_164'>      infinite number which perished by famine, by disease, and by</a>

<a id='line_172'>      Notwithstanding these repeated provocations, the resentment of</a>
<a id='line_173'>      the Roman princes expired after the victory; nor were their</a>
<a id='line_174'>      apprehensions continued beyond the period of war and danger. By</a>
<a id='line_175'>      the general indulgence of polytheism, and by the mild temper of</a>
<a id='line_176'>      Antoninus Pius, the Jews were restored to their ancient</a>
<a id='line_177'>      privileges, and once more obtained the permission of circumcising</a>
<a id='line_178'>      their children, with the easy restraint, that they should never</a>
<a id='line_179'>      confer on any foreign proselyte that distinguishing mark of the</a>
<a id='line_180'>      Hebrew race. 4 The numerous remains of that people, though they</a>
<a id='line_181'>      were still excluded from the precincts of Jerusalem, were</a>
<a id='line_182'>      permitted to form and to maintain considerable establishments</a>
<a id='line_183'>      both in Italy and in the provinces, to acquire the freedom of</a>
<a id='line_184'>      Rome, to enjoy municipal honors, and to obtain at the same time</a>
<a id='line_185'>      an exemption from the burdensome and expensive offices of</a>
<a id='line_186'>      society. The moderation or the contempt of the Romans gave a</a>
<a id='line_187'>      legal sanction to the form of ecclesiastical police which was</a>
<a id='line_188'>      instituted by the vanquished sect. The patriarch, who had fixed</a>
<a id='line_189'>      his residence at Tiberias, was empowered to appoint his</a>
<a id='line_190'>      subordinate ministers and apostles, to exercise a domestic</a>
<a id='line_191'>      jurisdiction, and to receive from his dispersed brethren an</a>
<a id='line_192'>      annual contribution. 5 New synagogues were frequently erected in</a>
<a id='line_193'>      the principal cities of the empire; and the sabbaths, the fasts,</a>
<a id='line_194'>      and the festivals, which were either commanded by the Mosaic law,</a>
<a id='line_195'>      or enjoined by the traditions of the Rabbis, were celebrated in</a>
<a id='line_196'>      the most solemn and public manner. 6 Such gentle treatment</a>
<a id='line_197'>      insensibly assuaged the stern temper of the Jews. Awakened from</a>
<a id='line_198'>      their dream of prophecy and conquest, they assumed the behavior</a>
<a id='line_199'>      of peaceable and industrious subjects. Their irreconcilable</a>
<a id='line_200'>      hatred of mankind, instead of flaming out in acts of blood and</a>
<a id='line_201'>      violence, evaporated in less dangerous gratifications. They</a>
<a id='line_202'>      embraced every opportunity of overreaching the idolaters in</a>

<a id='line_238'>      Since the Jews, who rejected with abhorrence the deities adored</a>
<a id='line_239'>      by their sovereign and by their fellow-subjects, enjoyed,</a>
<a id='line_240'>      however, the free exercise of their unsocial religion, there must</a>
<a id='line_241'>      have existed some other cause, which exposed the disciples of</a>
<a id='line_242'>      Christ to those severities from which the posterity of Abraham</a>
<a id='line_243'>      was exempt. The difference between them is simple and obvious;</a>
<a id='line_244'>      but, according to the sentiments of antiquity, it was of the</a>
<a id='line_245'>      highest importance. The Jews were a _nation;_ the Christians were</a>
<a id='line_246'>      a _sect:_ and if it was natural for every community to respect</a>
<a id='line_247'>      the sacred institutions of their neighbors, it was incumbent on</a>
<a id='line_248'>      them to persevere in those of their ancestors. The voice of</a>
<a id='line_249'>      oracles, the precepts of philosophers, and the authority of the</a>
<a id='line_250'>      laws, unanimously enforced this national obligation. By their</a>
<a id='line_251'>      lofty claim of superior sanctity the Jews might provoke the</a>
<a id='line_252'>      Polytheists to consider them as an odious and impure race. By</a>
<a id='line_253'>      disdaining the intercourse of other nations, they might deserve</a>
<a id='line_254'>      their contempt. The laws of Moses might be for the most part</a>
<a id='line_255'>      frivolous or absurd; yet, since they had been received during</a>
<a id='line_256'>      many ages by a large society, his followers were justified by the</a>

<a id='line_590'>      acquired a just knowledge of the rights of conscience, of the</a>

<a id='line_596'>      have prompted them to refuse a legal, and as it were a natural,</a>
<a id='line_597'>      submission to the sacred institutions of their country. The same</a>
<a id='line_598'>      reason which contributes to alleviate the guilt, must have tended</a>
<a id='line_599'>      to abate the vigor, of their persecutions. As they were actuated,</a>
<a id='line_600'>      not by the furious zeal of bigots, but by the temperate policy of</a>

<a id='line_636'>      to protect them not only from the malice but even from the</a>
<a id='line_637'>      knowledge of the Pagan world. The slow and gradual abolition of</a>
<a id='line_638'>      the Mosaic ceremonies afforded a safe and innocent disguise to</a>
<a id='line_639'>      the more early proselytes of the gospel. As they were, for the</a>
<a id='line_640'>      greater part, of the race of Abraham, they were distinguished by</a>

<a id='line_644'>      Deity. The Gentile converts, who by a spiritual adoption had been</a>
<a id='line_645'>      associated to the hope of Israel, were likewise confounded under</a>
<a id='line_646'>      the garb and appearance of Jews, 25 and as the Polytheists paid</a>
<a id='line_647'>      less regard to articles of faith than to the external worship,</a>
<a id='line_648'>      the new sect, which carefully concealed, or faintly announced,</a>
<a id='line_649'>      its future greatness and ambition, was permitted to shelter</a>
<a id='line_650'>      itself under the general toleration which was granted to an</a>
<a id='line_651'>      ancient and celebrated people in the Roman empire. It was not</a>
<a id='line_652'>      long, perhaps, before the Jews themselves, animated with a</a>
<a id='line_653'>      fiercer zeal and a more jealous faith, perceived the gradual</a>
<a id='line_654'>      separation of their Nazarene brethren from the doctrine of the</a>
<a id='line_655'>      synagogue; and they would gladly have extinguished the dangerous</a>
<a id='line_656'>      heresy in the blood of its adherents. But the decrees of Heaven</a>
<a id='line_657'>      had already disarmed their malice; and though they might</a>

<a id='line_659'>      longer possessed the administration of criminal justice; nor did</a>
<a id='line_660'>      they find it easy to infuse into the calm breast of a Roman</a>

<a id='line_665'>      words, a dispute relating only to the interpretation of the</a>
<a id='line_666'>      Jewish laws and prophecies, they deemed it unworthy of the</a>
<a id='line_667'>      majesty of Rome seriously to discuss the obscure differences</a>
<a id='line_668'>      which might arise among a barbarous and superstitious people. The</a>
<a id='line_669'>      innocence of the first Christians was protected by ignorance and</a>

<a id='line_710'>      was afflicted by a fire which raged beyond the memory or example</a>
<a id='line_711'>      of former ages. 28 The monuments of Grecian art and of Roman</a>
<a id='line_712'>      virtue, the trophies of the Punic and Gallic wars, the most holy</a>
<a id='line_713'>      temples, and the most splendid palaces, were involved in one</a>
<a id='line_714'>      common destruction. Of the fourteen regions or quarters into</a>
<a id='line_715'>      which Rome was divided, four only subsisted entire, three were</a>
<a id='line_716'>      levelled with the ground, and the remaining seven, which had</a>
<a id='line_717'>      experienced the fury of the flames, displayed a melancholy</a>
<a id='line_718'>      prospect of ruin and desolation. The vigilance of government</a>
<a id='line_719'>      appears not to have neglected any of the precautions which might</a>
<a id='line_720'>      alleviate the sense of so dreadful a calamity. The Imperial</a>
<a id='line_721'>      gardens were thrown open to the distressed multitude, temporary</a>
<a id='line_722'>      buildings were erected for their accommodation, and a plentiful</a>
<a id='line_723'>      supply of corn and provisions was distributed at a very moderate</a>
<a id='line_724'>      price. 29 The most generous policy seemed to have dictated the</a>
<a id='line_725'>      edicts which regulated the disposition of the streets and the</a>
<a id='line_726'>      construction of private houses; and as it usually happens, in an</a>
<a id='line_727'>      age of prosperity, the conflagration of Rome, in the course of a</a>
<a id='line_728'>      few years, produced a new city, more regular and more beautiful</a>
<a id='line_729'>      than the former. But all the prudence and humanity affected by</a>
<a id='line_730'>      Nero on this occasion were insufficient to preserve him from the</a>
<a id='line_731'>      popular suspicion. Every crime might be imputed to the assassin</a>
<a id='line_732'>      of his wife and mother; nor could the prince who prostituted his</a>
<a id='line_733'>      person and dignity on the theatre be deemed incapable of the most</a>
<a id='line_734'>      extravagant folly. The voice of rumor accused the emperor as the</a>
<a id='line_735'>      incendiary of his own capital; and as the most incredible stories</a>
<a id='line_736'>      are the best adapted to the genius of an enraged people, it was</a>
<a id='line_737'>      gravely reported, and firmly believed, that Nero, enjoying the</a>
<a id='line_738'>      calamity which he had occasioned, amused himself with singing to</a>
<a id='line_739'>      his lyre the destruction of ancient Troy. 30 To divert a</a>
<a id='line_740'>      suspicion, which the power of despotism was unable to suppress,</a>
<a id='line_741'>      the emperor resolved to substitute in his own place some</a>
<a id='line_742'>      fictitious criminals. ÒWith this view,Ó continues Tacitus, Òhe</a>
<a id='line_743'>      inflicted the most exquisite tortures on those men, who, under</a>
<a id='line_744'>      the vulgar appellation of Christians, were already branded with</a>
<a id='line_745'>      deserved infamy. They derived their name and origin from Christ,</a>
<a id='line_746'>      who in the reign of Tiberius had suffered death by the sentence</a>
<a id='line_747'>      of the procurator Pontius Pilate. 31 For a while this dire</a>
<a id='line_748'>      superstition was checked; but it again burst forth; 3111 and not</a>
<a id='line_749'>      only spread itself over Jud¾a, the first seat of this mischievous</a>
<a id='line_750'>      sect, but was even introduced into Rome, the common asylum which</a>
<a id='line_751'>      receives and protects whatever is impure, whatever is atrocious.</a>
<a id='line_752'>      The confessions of those who were seized discovered a great</a>
<a id='line_753'>      multitude of their accomplices, and they were all convicted, not</a>
<a id='line_754'>      so much for the crime of setting fire to the city, as for their</a>
<a id='line_755'>      hatred of human kind. 32 They died in torments, and their</a>
<a id='line_756'>      torments were imbittered by insult and derision. Some were nailed</a>
<a id='line_757'>      on crosses; others sewn up in the skins of wild beasts, and</a>
<a id='line_758'>      exposed to the fury of dogs; others again, smeared over with</a>
<a id='line_759'>      combustible materials, were used as torches to illuminate the</a>
<a id='line_760'>      darkness of the night. The gardens of Nero were destined for the</a>
<a id='line_761'>      melancholy spectacle, which was accompanied with a horse-race and</a>
<a id='line_762'>      honored with the presence of the emperor, who mingled with the</a>
<a id='line_763'>      populace in the dress and attitude of a charioteer. The guilt of</a>
<a id='line_764'>      the Christians deserved indeed the most exemplary punishment, but</a>
<a id='line_765'>      the public abhorrence was changed into commiseration, from the</a>
<a id='line_766'>      opinion that those unhappy wretches were sacrificed, not so much</a>
<a id='line_767'>      to the public welfare, as to the cruelty of a jealous tyrant.Ó 33</a>
<a id='line_768'>      Those who survey with a curious eye the revolutions of mankind,</a>
<a id='line_769'>      may observe, that the gardens and circus of Nero on the Vatican,</a>
<a id='line_770'>      which were polluted with the blood of the first Christians, have</a>
<a id='line_771'>      been rendered still more famous by the triumph and by the abuse</a>
<a id='line_772'>      of the persecuted religion. On the same spot, 34 a temple, which</a>
<a id='line_773'>      far surpasses the ancient glories of the Capitol, has been since</a>

<a id='line_842'></a>
<a id='line_843'>      1. The most sceptical criticism is obliged to respect the truth</a>
<a id='line_844'>      of this extraordinary fact, and the integrity of this celebrated</a>
<a id='line_845'>      passage of Tacitus. The former is confirmed by the diligent and</a>
<a id='line_846'>      accurate Suetonius, who mentions the punishment which Nero</a>
<a id='line_847'>      inflicted on the Christians, a sect of men who had embraced a new</a>
<a id='line_848'>      and criminal superstition. 35 The latter may be proved by the</a>
<a id='line_849'>      consent of the most ancient manuscripts; by the inimitable</a>
<a id='line_850'>      character of the style of Tacitus by his reputation, which</a>
<a id='line_851'>      guarded his text from the interpolations of pious fraud; and by</a>
<a id='line_852'>      the purport of his narration, which accused the first Christians</a>
<a id='line_853'>      of the most atrocious crimes, without insinuating that they</a>
<a id='line_854'>      possessed any miraculous or even magical powers above the rest of</a>
<a id='line_855'>      mankind. 36 2. Notwithstanding it is probable that Tacitus was</a>
<a id='line_856'>      born some years before the fire of Rome, 37 he could derive only</a>
<a id='line_857'>      from reading and conversation the knowledge of an event which</a>
<a id='line_858'>      happened during his infancy. Before he gave himself to the</a>
<a id='line_859'>      public, he calmly waited till his genius had attained its full</a>
<a id='line_860'>      maturity, and he was more than forty years of age, when a</a>
<a id='line_861'>      grateful regard for the memory of the virtuous Agricola extorted</a>
<a id='line_862'>      from him the most early of those historical compositions which</a>
<a id='line_863'>      will delight and instruct the most distant posterity. After</a>
<a id='line_864'>      making a trial of his strength in the life of Agricola and the</a>
<a id='line_865'>      description of Germany, he conceived, and at length executed, a</a>
<a id='line_866'>      more arduous work; the history of Rome, in thirty books, from the</a>
<a id='line_867'>      fall of Nero to the accession of Nerva. The administration of</a>
<a id='line_868'>      Nerva introduced an age of justice and propriety, which Tacitus</a>
<a id='line_869'>      had destined for the occupation of his old age; 38 but when he</a>
<a id='line_870'>      took a nearer view of his subject, judging, perhaps, that it was</a>
<a id='line_871'>      a more honorable or a less invidious office to record the vices</a>
<a id='line_872'>      of past tyrants, than to celebrate the virtues of a reigning</a>
<a id='line_873'>      monarch, he chose rather to relate, under the form of annals, the</a>
<a id='line_874'>      actions of the four immediate successors of Augustus. To collect,</a>
<a id='line_875'>      to dispose, and to adorn a series of fourscore years, in an</a>
<a id='line_876'>      immortal work, every sentence of which is pregnant with the</a>
<a id='line_877'>      deepest observations and the most lively images, was an</a>
<a id='line_878'>      undertaking sufficient to exercise the genius of Tacitus himself</a>
<a id='line_879'>      during the greatest part of his life. In the last years of the</a>
<a id='line_880'>      reign of Trajan, whilst the victorious monarch extended the power</a>
<a id='line_881'>      of Rome beyond its ancient limits, the historian was describing,</a>
<a id='line_882'>      in the second and fourth books of his annals, the tyranny of</a>
<a id='line_883'>      Tiberius; 39 and the emperor Hadrian must have succeeded to the</a>
<a id='line_884'>      throne, before Tacitus, in the regular prosecution of his work,</a>
<a id='line_885'>      could relate the fire of the capital, and the cruelty of Nero</a>
<a id='line_886'>      towards the unfortunate Christians. At the distance of sixty</a>
<a id='line_887'>      years, it was the duty of the annalist to adopt the narratives of</a>
<a id='line_888'>      contemporaries; but it was natural for the philosopher to indulge</a>
<a id='line_889'>      himself in the description of the origin, the progress, and the</a>
<a id='line_890'>      character of the new sect, not so much according to the knowledge</a>
<a id='line_891'>      or prejudices of the age of Nero, as according to those of the</a>
<a id='line_892'>      time of Hadrian. 3 Tacitus very frequently trusts to the</a>
<a id='line_893'>      curiosity or reflection of his readers to supply those</a>
<a id='line_894'>      intermediate circumstances and ideas, which, in his extreme</a>
<a id='line_895'>      conciseness, he has thought proper to suppress. We may therefore</a>
<a id='line_896'>      presume to imagine some probable cause which could direct the</a>
<a id='line_897'>      cruelty of Nero against the Christians of Rome, whose obscurity,</a>
<a id='line_898'>      as well as innocence, should have shielded them from his</a>
<a id='line_899'>      indignation, and even from his notice. The Jews, who were</a>
<a id='line_900'>      numerous in the capital, and oppressed in their own country, were</a>
<a id='line_901'>      a much fitter object for the suspicions of the emperor and of the</a>
<a id='line_902'>      people: nor did it seem unlikely that a vanquished nation, who</a>
<a id='line_903'>      already discovered their abhorrence of the Roman yoke, might have</a>
<a id='line_904'>      recourse to the most atrocious means of gratifying their</a>
<a id='line_905'>      implacable revenge. But the Jews possessed very powerful</a>
<a id='line_906'>      advocates in the palace, and even in the heart of the tyrant; his</a>
<a id='line_907'>      wife and mistress, the beautiful Popp¾a, and a favorite player of</a>
<a id='line_908'>      the race of Abraham, who had already employed their intercession</a>
<a id='line_909'>      in behalf of the obnoxious people. 40 In their room it was</a>
<a id='line_910'>      necessary to offer some other victims, and it might easily be</a>
<a id='line_911'>      suggested that, although the genuine followers of Moses were</a>
<a id='line_912'>      innocent of the fire of Rome, there had arisen among them a new</a>
<a id='line_913'>      and pernicious sect of Galil¾ans, which was capable of the most</a>
<a id='line_914'>      horrid crimes. Under the appellation of Galil¾ans, two</a>
<a id='line_915'>      distinctions of men were confounded, the most opposite to each</a>
<a id='line_916'>      other in their manners and principles; the disciples who had</a>
<a id='line_917'>      embraced the faith of Jesus of Nazareth, 41 and the zealots who</a>
<a id='line_918'>      had followed the standard of Judas the Gaulonite. 42 The former</a>
<a id='line_919'>      were the friends, the latter were the enemies, of human kind; and</a>
<a id='line_920'>      the only resemblance between them consisted in the same</a>
<a id='line_921'>      inflexible constancy, which, in the defence of their cause,</a>
<a id='line_922'>      rendered them insensible of death and tortures. The followers of</a>
<a id='line_923'>      Judas, who impelled their countrymen into rebellion, were soon</a>
<a id='line_924'>      buried under the ruins of Jerusalem; whilst those of Jesus, known</a>
<a id='line_925'>      by the more celebrated name of Christians, diffused themselves</a>
<a id='line_926'>      over the Roman empire. How natural was it for Tacitus, in the</a>
<a id='line_927'>      time of Hadrian, to appropriate to the Christians the guilt and</a>
<a id='line_928'>      the sufferings, 4211 which he might, with far greater truth and</a>
<a id='line_929'>      justice, have attributed to a sect whose odious memory was almost</a>
<a id='line_930'>      extinguished! 4. Whatever opinion may be entertained of this</a>
<a id='line_931'>      conjecture, (for it is no more than a conjecture,) it is evident</a>
<a id='line_932'>      that the effect, as well as the cause, of NeroÕs persecution, was</a>
<a id='line_933'>      confined to the walls of Rome, 43 that the religious tenets of</a>

<a id='line_935'>      punishment, or even of inquiry; and that, as the idea of their</a>
<a id='line_936'>      sufferings was for a long time connected with the idea of cruelty</a>
<a id='line_937'>      and injustice, the moderation of succeeding princes inclined them</a>
<a id='line_938'>      to spare a sect, oppressed by a tyrant, whose rage had been</a>

<a id='line_1033'>      at the same time, the temple of Jerusalem and the Capitol of</a>
<a id='line_1034'>      Rome; 44 and it appears no less singular, that the tribute which</a>
<a id='line_1035'>      devotion had destined to the former, should have been converted</a>
<a id='line_1036'>      by the power of an assaulting victor to restore and adorn the</a>
<a id='line_1037'>      splendor of the latter. 45 The emperors levied a general</a>
<a id='line_1038'>      capitation tax on the Jewish people; and although the sum</a>
<a id='line_1039'>      assessed on the head of each individual was inconsiderable, the</a>
<a id='line_1040'>      use for which it was designed, and the severity with which it was</a>
<a id='line_1041'>      exacted, were considered as an intolerable grievance. 46 Since</a>
<a id='line_1042'>      the officers of the revenue extended their unjust claim to many</a>
<a id='line_1043'>      persons who were strangers to the blood or religion of the Jews,</a>
<a id='line_1044'>      it was impossible that the Christians, who had so often sheltered</a>
<a id='line_1045'>      themselves under the shade of the synagogue, should now escape</a>
<a id='line_1046'>      this rapacious persecution. Anxious as they were to avoid the</a>
<a id='line_1047'>      slightest infection of idolatry, their conscience forbade them to</a>
<a id='line_1048'>      contribute to the honor of that d¾mon who had assumed the</a>
<a id='line_1049'>      character of the Capitoline Jupiter. As a very numerous though</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      declining party among the Christians still adhered to the law of</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      Moses, their efforts to dissemble their Jewish origin were</a>
<a id='line_1052'>      detected by the decisive test of circumcision; 47 nor were the</a>
<a id='line_1053'>      Roman magistrates at leisure to inquire into the difference of</a>
<a id='line_1054'>      their religious tenets. Among the Christians who were brought</a>
<a id='line_1055'>      before the tribunal of the emperor, or, as it seems more</a>

<a id='line_1059'>      were the grandsons of St. Jude the apostle, who himself was the</a>
<a id='line_1060'>      brother of Jesus Christ. 48 Their natural pretensions to the</a>
<a id='line_1061'>      throne of David might perhaps attract the respect of the people,</a>
<a id='line_1062'>      and excite the jealousy of the governor; but the meanness of</a>
<a id='line_1063'>      their garb, and the simplicity of their answers, soon convinced</a>
<a id='line_1064'>      him that they were neither desirous nor capable of disturbing the</a>

<a id='line_1067'>      disclaimed any temporal views, and professed that his kingdom,</a>
<a id='line_1068'>      which they devoutly expected, was purely of a spiritual and</a>

<a id='line_1342'>      severest tortures, and venturing to accuse by name some of the</a>

<a id='line_1369'>      confession, still retained in their own power the alternative of</a>
<a id='line_1370'>      life or death. It was not so much the past offence, as the actual</a>
<a id='line_1371'>      resistance, which excited the indignation of the magistrate. He</a>
<a id='line_1372'>      was persuaded that he offered them an easy pardon, since, if they</a>
<a id='line_1373'>      consented to cast a few grains of incense upon the altar, they</a>
<a id='line_1374'>      were dismissed from the tribunal in safety and with applause. It</a>
<a id='line_1375'>      was esteemed the duty of a humane judge to endeavor to reclaim,</a>
<a id='line_1376'>      rather than to punish, those deluded enthusiasts. Varying his</a>
<a id='line_1377'>      tone according to the age, the sex, or the situation of the</a>

<a id='line_1381'>      they would show some compassion to themselves, to their families,</a>
<a id='line_1382'>      and to their friends. 63 If threats and persuasions proved</a>
<a id='line_1383'>      ineffectual, he had often recourse to violence; the scourge and</a>

<a id='line_1385'>      every art of cruelty was employed to subdue such inflexible, and,</a>
<a id='line_1386'>      as it appeared to the Pagans, such criminal, obstinacy. The</a>

<a id='line_1391'>      denial, of the crime which was the object of their inquiry. 64</a>
<a id='line_1392'>      The monks of succeeding ages, who, in their peaceful solitudes,</a>
<a id='line_1393'>      entertained themselves with diversifying the deaths and</a>
<a id='line_1394'>      sufferings of the primitive martyrs, have frequently invented</a>
<a id='line_1395'>      torments of a much more refined and ingenious nature. In</a>
<a id='line_1396'>      particular, it has pleased them to suppose, that the zeal of the</a>
<a id='line_1397'>      Roman magistrates, disdaining every consideration of moral virtue</a>
<a id='line_1398'>      or public decency, endeavored to seduce those whom they were</a>
<a id='line_1399'>      unable to vanquish, and that by their orders the most brutal</a>
<a id='line_1400'>      violence was offered to those whom they found it impossible to</a>
<a id='line_1401'>      seduce. It is related, that females, who were prepared to despise</a>
<a id='line_1402'>      death, were sometimes condemned to a more severe trial, 6411 and</a>
<a id='line_1403'>      called upon to determine whether they set a higher value on their</a>
<a id='line_1404'>      religion or on their chastity. The youths to whose licentious</a>
<a id='line_1405'>      embraces they were abandoned, received a solemn exhortation from</a>
<a id='line_1406'>      the judge, to exert their most strenuous efforts to maintain the</a>
<a id='line_1407'>      honor of Venus against the impious virgin who refused to burn</a>
<a id='line_1408'>      incense on her altars. Their violence, however, was commonly</a>

<a id='line_1457'>      resentment. 66 But it is certain, and we may appeal to the</a>
<a id='line_1458'>      grateful confessions of the first Christians, that the greatest</a>
<a id='line_1459'>      part of those magistrates who exercised in the provinces the</a>
<a id='line_1460'>      authority of the emperor, or of the senate, and to whose hands</a>
<a id='line_1461'>      alone the jurisdiction of life and death was intrusted, behaved</a>
<a id='line_1462'>      like men of polished manners and liberal education, who respected</a>
<a id='line_1463'>      the rules of justice, and who were conversant with the precepts</a>

<a id='line_1466'>      the accused Christian some legal evasion, by which he might elude</a>
<a id='line_1467'>      the severity of the laws. 67 Whenever they were invested with a</a>
<a id='line_1468'>      discretionary power, 68 they used it much less for the</a>
<a id='line_1469'>      oppression, than for the relief and benefit of the afflicted</a>
<a id='line_1470'>      church. They were far from condemning all the Christians who were</a>
<a id='line_1471'>      accused before their tribunal, and very far from punishing with</a>
<a id='line_1472'>      death all those who were convicted of an obstinate adherence to</a>
<a id='line_1473'>      the new superstition. Contenting themselves, for the most part,</a>
<a id='line_1474'>      with the milder chastisements of imprisonment, exile, or slavery</a>
<a id='line_1475'>      in the mines, 69 they left the unhappy victims of their justice</a>
<a id='line_1476'>      some reason to hope, that a prosperous event, the accession, the</a>
<a id='line_1477'>      marriage, or the triumph of an emperor, might speedily restore</a>
<a id='line_1478'>      them, by a general pardon, to their former state. The martyrs,</a>
<a id='line_1479'>      devoted to immediate execution by the Roman magistrates, appear</a>
<a id='line_1480'>      to have been selected from the most opposite extremes. They were</a>

<a id='line_1484'>      were the meanest and most abject among them, particularly those</a>
<a id='line_1485'>      of the servile condition, whose lives were esteemed of little</a>
<a id='line_1486'>      value, and whose sufferings were viewed by the ancients with too</a>

<a id='line_2904'>      produced by his own father 1441 before the magistrate as a</a>

<a id='line_2906'>      declaring, that his conscience would not permit him to embrace</a>
<a id='line_2907'>      the profession of a soldier. 145 It could scarcely be expected</a>
<a id='line_2908'>      that any government should suffer the action of Marcellus the</a>
<a id='line_2909'>      Centurion to pass with impunity. On the day of a public festival,</a>
<a id='line_2910'>      that officer threw away his belt, his arms, and the ensigns of</a>
<a id='line_2911'>      his office, and exclaimed with a loud voice, that he would obey</a>
<a id='line_2912'>      none but Jesus Christ the eternal King, and that he renounced</a>
<a id='line_2913'>      forever the use of carnal weapons, and the service of an</a>

<a id='line_3507'>      numbers and opulence. 168 Even the conduct of Maxentius towards</a>
<a id='line_3508'>      the bishops of Rome and Carthage may be considered as the proof</a>
<a id='line_3509'>      of his toleration, since it is probable that the most orthodox</a>
<a id='line_3510'>      princes would adopt the same measures with regard to their</a>
<a id='line_3511'>      established clergy. Marcellus, the former of these prelates, had</a>
<a id='line_3512'>      thrown the capital into confusion, by the severe penance which he</a>
<a id='line_3513'>      imposed on a great number of Christians, who, during the late</a>
<a id='line_3514'>      persecution, had renounced or dissembled their religion. The rage</a>
<a id='line_3515'>      of faction broke out in frequent and violent seditions; the blood</a>
<a id='line_3516'>      of the faithful was shed by each otherÕs hands, and the exile of</a>
<a id='line_3517'>      Marcellus, whose prudence seems to have been less eminent than</a>
<a id='line_3518'>      his zeal, was found to be the only measure capable of restoring</a>
<a id='line_3519'>      peace to the distracted church of Rome. 169 The behavior of</a>
<a id='line_3520'>      Mensurius, bishop of Carthage, appears to have been still more</a>
<a id='line_3521'>      reprehensible. A deacon of that city had published a libel</a>
<a id='line_3522'>      against the emperor. The offender took refuge in the episcopal</a>
<a id='line_3523'>      palace; and though it was somewhat early to advance any claims of</a>
<a id='line_3524'>      ecclesiastical immunities, the bishop refused to deliver him up</a>
<a id='line_3525'>      to the officers of justice. For this treasonable resistance,</a>
<a id='line_3526'>      Mensurius was summoned to court, and instead of receiving a legal</a>
<a id='line_3527'>      sentence of death or banishment, he was permitted, after a short</a>
<a id='line_3528'>      examination, to return to his diocese. 170 Such was the happy</a>
<a id='line_3529'>      condition of the Christian subjects of Maxentius, that whenever</a>
<a id='line_3530'>      they were desirous of procuring for their own use any bodies of</a>
<a id='line_3531'>      martyrs, they were obliged to purchase them from the most distant</a>
<a id='line_3532'>      provinces of the East. A story is related of Aglae, a Roman lady,</a>
<a id='line_3533'>      descended from a consular family, and possessed of so ample an</a>
<a id='line_3534'>      estate, that it required the management of seventy-three</a>

<a id='line_3537'>      admitted to share her bed. Her fortune enabled her to gratify the</a>
<a id='line_3538'>      pious desire of obtaining some sacred relics from the East. She</a>
<a id='line_3539'>      intrusted Boniface with a considerable sum of gold, and a large</a>
<a id='line_3540'>      quantity of aromatics; and her lover, attended by twelve horsemen</a>

<a id='line_3727'>      A system of government was therefore instituted, which was</a>
<a id='line_3728'>      evidently copied from the policy of the church. In all the great</a>

<a id='line_3822'>      very strict regard to the observance of the other; and the</a>

<a id='line_3825'>      practised in the arts of courts, than that of almost any of his</a>
<a id='line_3826'>      contemporaries. On some particular occasions, when the</a>
<a id='line_3827'>      magistrates were exasperated by some personal motives of interest</a>
<a id='line_3828'>      or resentment, the rules of prudence, and perhaps of decency, to</a>

<a id='line_3841'>      check and to censure the forward zeal of the Christians, who</a>
<a id='line_3842'>      voluntarily threw themselves into the hands of the magistrates.</a>
<a id='line_3843'>      Some of these were persons oppressed by poverty and debts, who</a>

<a id='line_3975'>      that no more than ninety-two Christians were entitled to that</a>

<a id='line_3982'>      the sixteenth part of the Eastern empire: 183 and since there</a>
<a id='line_3983'>      were some governors, who from a real or affected clemency had</a>
<a id='line_3984'>      preserved their hands unstained with the blood of the faithful,</a>
<a id='line_3985'>      184 it is reasonable to believe, that the country which had given</a>
<a id='line_3986'>      birth to Christianity, produced at least the sixteenth part of</a>
<a id='line_3987'>      the martyrs who suffered death within the dominions of Galerius</a>
<a id='line_3988'>      and Maximin; the whole might consequently amount to about fifteen</a>
<a id='line_3989'>      hundred, a number which, if it is equally divided between the ten</a>
<a id='line_3990'>      years of the persecution, will allow an annual consumption of one</a>
<a id='line_3991'>      hundred and fifty martyrs. Allotting the same proportion to the</a>
<a id='line_3992'>      provinces of Italy, Africa, and perhaps Spain, where, at the end</a>
<a id='line_3993'>      of two or three years, the rigor of the penal laws was either</a>

<a id='line_4022'>      exquisite cruelty the most remote and sequestered country of the</a>
<a id='line_4023'>      Roman empire, he relates that in Thebais from ten to one hundred</a>

<a id='line_4025'>      when he proceeds to mention his own journey into Egypt, his</a>
<a id='line_4026'>      language insensibly becomes more cautious and moderate. Instead</a>
<a id='line_4027'>      of a large, but definite number, he speaks of many Christians,</a>
<a id='line_4028'>      and most artfully selects two ambiguous words, which may signify</a>
<a id='line_4029'>      either what he had seen, or what he had heard; either the</a>

<a id='line_4092'>      each other, than they had experienced from the zeal of infidels.</a>
<a id='line_4093'>      During the ages of ignorance which followed the subversion of the</a>

<a id='line_4095'>      extended their dominion over the laity as well as clergy of the</a>

<a id='line_4097'>      and which might long have defied the feeble efforts of reason,</a>
<a id='line_4098'>      was at length assaulted by a crowd of daring fanatics, who from</a>
<a id='line_4099'>      the twelfth to the sixteenth century assumed the popular</a>
<a id='line_4100'>      character of reformers. The church of Rome defended by violence</a>
<a id='line_4101'>      the empire which she had acquired by fraud; a system of peace and</a>
<a id='line_4102'>      benevolence was soon disgraced by proscriptions, war, massacres,</a>
<a id='line_4103'>      and the institution of the holy office. And as the reformers were</a>
<a id='line_4104'>      animated by the love of civil as well as of religious freedom,</a>
<a id='line_4105'>      the Catholic princes connected their own interest with that of</a>
<a id='line_4106'>      the clergy, and enforced by fire and the sword the terrors of</a>
<a id='line_4107'>      spiritual censures. In the Netherlands alone, more than one</a>
<a id='line_4108'>      hundred thousand of the subjects of Charles V. are said to have</a>
<a id='line_4109'>      suffered by the hand of the executioner; and this extraordinary</a>
<a id='line_4110'>      number is attested by Grotius, 185 a man of genius and learning,</a>
<a id='line_4111'>      who preserved his moderation amidst the fury of contending sects,</a>
<a id='line_4112'>      and who composed the annals of his own age and country, at a time</a>
<a id='line_4113'>      when the invention of printing had facilitated the means of</a>
