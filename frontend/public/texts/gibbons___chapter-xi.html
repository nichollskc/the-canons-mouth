                    <a id='line_0'>Chapter XI: Reign Of Claudius, Defeat Of The Goths.—Part II.</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'>      The death of Claudius had revived the fainting spirit of the</a>
<a id='line_3'>      Goths. The troops which guarded the passes of Mount Hæmus, and</a>
<a id='line_4'>      the banks of the Danube, had been drawn away by the apprehension</a>
<a id='line_5'>      of a civil war; and it seems probable that the remaining body of</a>
<a id='line_6'>      the Gothic and Vandalic tribes embraced the favorable</a>
<a id='line_7'>      opportunity, abandoned their settlements of the Ukraine,</a>
<a id='line_8'>      traversed the rivers, and swelled with new multitudes the</a>
<a id='line_9'>      destroying host of their countrymen. Their united numbers were at</a>
<a id='line_10'>      length encountered by Aurelian, and the bloody and doubtful</a>
<a id='line_11'>      conflict ended only with the approach of night. 20 Exhausted by</a>
<a id='line_12'>      so many calamities, which they had mutually endured and inflicted</a>
<a id='line_13'>      during a twenty years’ war, the Goths and the Romans consented to</a>
<a id='line_14'>      a lasting and beneficial treaty. It was earnestly solicited by</a>
<a id='line_15'>      the barbarians, and cheerfully ratified by the legions, to whose</a>
<a id='line_16'>      suffrage the prudence of Aurelian referred the decision of that</a>
<a id='line_17'>      important question. The Gothic nation engaged to supply the</a>
<a id='line_18'>      armies of Rome with a body of two thousand auxiliaries,</a>
<a id='line_19'>      consisting entirely of cavalry, and stipulated in return an</a>
<a id='line_20'>      undisturbed retreat, with a regular market as far as the Danube,</a>
<a id='line_21'>      provided by the emperor’s care, but at their own expense. The</a>
<a id='line_22'>      treaty was observed with such religious fidelity, that when a</a>
<a id='line_23'>      party of five hundred men straggled from the camp in quest of</a>
<a id='line_24'>      plunder, the king or general of the barbarians commanded that the</a>
<a id='line_25'>      guilty leader should be apprehended and shot to death with darts,</a>
<a id='line_26'>      as a victim devoted to the sanctity of their engagements. 201 It</a>
<a id='line_27'>      is, however, not unlikely, that the precaution of Aurelian, who</a>
<a id='line_28'>      had exacted as hostages the sons and daughters of the Gothic</a>
<a id='line_29'>      chiefs, contributed something to this pacific temper. The youths</a>
<a id='line_30'>      he trained in the exercise of arms, and near his own person: to</a>
<a id='line_31'>      the damsels he gave a liberal and Roman education, and by</a>
<a id='line_32'>      bestowing them in marriage on some of his principal officers,</a>
<a id='line_33'>      gradually introduced between the two nations the closest and most</a>
<a id='line_34'>      endearing connections. 21</a>

<a id='line_40'>      21 (return) [ Dexipphus (ap. Excerpta Legat. p. 12) relates the</a>
<a id='line_41'>      whole transaction under the name of Vandals. Aurelian married one</a>
<a id='line_42'>      of the Gothic ladies to his general Bonosus, who was able to</a>
<a id='line_43'>      drink with the Goths and discover their secrets. Hist. August. p.</a>
<a id='line_44'>      247.]</a>
<a id='line_45'></a>
<a id='line_46'>      But the most important condition of peace was understood rather</a>
<a id='line_47'>      than expressed in the treaty. Aurelian withdrew the Roman forces</a>
<a id='line_48'>      from Dacia, and tacitly relinquished that great province to the</a>
<a id='line_49'>      Goths and Vandals. 22 His manly judgment convinced him of the</a>
<a id='line_50'>      solid advantages, and taught him to despise the seeming disgrace,</a>
<a id='line_51'>      of thus contracting the frontiers of the monarchy. The Dacian</a>
<a id='line_52'>      subjects, removed from those distant possessions which they were</a>
<a id='line_53'>      unable to cultivate or defend, added strength and populousness to</a>
<a id='line_54'>      the southern side of the Danube. A fertile territory, which the</a>
<a id='line_55'>      repetition of barbarous inroads had changed into a desert, was</a>
<a id='line_56'>      yielded to their industry, and a new province of Dacia still</a>
<a id='line_57'>      preserved the memory of Trajan’s conquests. The old country of</a>
<a id='line_58'>      that name detained, however, a considerable number of its</a>
<a id='line_59'>      inhabitants, who dreaded exile more than a Gothic master. 23</a>
<a id='line_60'>      These degenerate Romans continued to serve the empire, whose</a>
<a id='line_61'>      allegiance they had renounced, by introducing among their</a>
<a id='line_62'>      conquerors the first notions of agriculture, the useful arts, and</a>
<a id='line_63'>      the conveniences of civilized life. An intercourse of commerce</a>
<a id='line_64'>      and language was gradually established between the opposite banks</a>
<a id='line_65'>      of the Danube; and after Dacia became an independent state, it</a>
<a id='line_66'>      often proved the firmest barrier of the empire against the</a>
<a id='line_67'>      invasions of the savages of the North. A sense of interest</a>
<a id='line_68'>      attached these more settled barbarians to the alliance of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_69'>      and a permanent interest very frequently ripens into sincere and</a>
<a id='line_70'>      useful friendship. This various colony, which filled the ancient</a>
<a id='line_71'>      province, and was insensibly blended into one great people, still</a>
<a id='line_72'>      acknowledged the superior renown and authority of the Gothic</a>
<a id='line_73'>      tribe, and claimed the fancied honor of a Scandinavian origin. At</a>
<a id='line_74'>      the same time, the lucky though accidental resemblance of the</a>
<a id='line_75'>      name of Getæ, 231 infused among the credulous Goths a vain</a>
<a id='line_76'>      persuasion, that in a remote age, their own ancestors, already</a>
<a id='line_77'>      seated in the Dacian provinces, had received the instructions of</a>
<a id='line_78'>      Zamolxis, and checked the victorious arms of Sesostris and</a>
<a id='line_79'>      Darius. 24</a>

<a id='line_87'>      barbarians. See a Memoir of M. d’Anville on ancient Dacia, in the</a>

<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>      231 (return) [ The connection between the Getæ and the Goths is</a>

<a id='line_94'>      24 (return) [See the first chapter of Jornandes. The Vandals,</a>

<a id='line_97'>      the Teiss.]</a>
<a id='line_98'></a>
<a id='line_99'>      While the vigorous and moderate conduct of Aurelian restored the</a>
<a id='line_100'>      Illyrian frontier, the nation of the Alemanni 25 violated the</a>
<a id='line_101'>      conditions of peace, which either Gallienus had purchased, or</a>
<a id='line_102'>      Claudius had imposed, and, inflamed by their impatient youth,</a>
<a id='line_103'>      suddenly flew to arms. Forty thousand horse appeared in the</a>
<a id='line_104'>      field, 26 and the numbers of the infantry doubled those of the</a>
<a id='line_105'>      cavalry. 27 The first objects of their avarice were a few cities</a>
<a id='line_106'>      of the Rhætian frontier; but their hopes soon rising with</a>
<a id='line_107'>      success, the rapid march of the Alemanni traced a line of</a>
<a id='line_108'>      devastation from the Danube to the Po. 28</a>

<a id='line_116'>      26 (return) [ Cantoclarus, with his usual accuracy, chooses to</a>

<a id='line_118'>      repugnant to sense and to grammar.]</a>
<a id='line_119'></a>
<a id='line_120'>      27 (return) [ We may remark, as an instance of bad taste, that</a>
<a id='line_121'>      Dexippus applies to the light infantry of the Alemanni the</a>
<a id='line_122'>      technical terms proper only to the Grecian phalanx.]</a>
<a id='line_123'></a>
<a id='line_124'>      28 (return) [ In Dexippus, we at present read Rhodanus: M. de</a>
<a id='line_125'>      Valois very judiciously alters the word to Eridanus.]</a>
<a id='line_126'></a>
<a id='line_127'>      The emperor was almost at the same time informed of the</a>
<a id='line_128'>      irruption, and of the retreat, of the barbarians. Collecting an</a>
<a id='line_129'>      active body of troops, he marched with silence and celerity along</a>
<a id='line_130'>      the skirts of the Hercynian forest; and the Alemanni, laden with</a>
<a id='line_131'>      the spoils of Italy, arrived at the Danube, without suspecting,</a>
<a id='line_132'>      that on the opposite bank, and in an advantageous post, a Roman</a>
<a id='line_133'>      army lay concealed and prepared to intercept their return.</a>
<a id='line_134'>      Aurelian indulged the fatal security of the barbarians, and</a>
<a id='line_135'>      permitted about half their forces to pass the river without</a>
<a id='line_136'>      disturbance and without precaution. Their situation and</a>
<a id='line_137'>      astonishment gave him an easy victory; his skilful conduct</a>
<a id='line_138'>      improved the advantage. Disposing the legions in a semicircular</a>
<a id='line_139'>      form, he advanced the two horns of the crescent across the</a>
<a id='line_140'>      Danube, and wheeling them on a sudden towards the centre,</a>
<a id='line_141'>      enclosed the rear of the German host. The dismayed barbarians, on</a>
<a id='line_142'>      whatsoever side they cast their eyes, beheld, with despair, a</a>
<a id='line_143'>      wasted country, a deep and rapid stream, a victorious and</a>
<a id='line_144'>      implacable enemy.</a>
<a id='line_145'></a>
<a id='line_146'>      Reduced to this distressed condition, the Alemanni no longer</a>
<a id='line_147'>      disdained to sue for peace. Aurelian received their ambassadors</a>
<a id='line_148'>      at the head of his camp, and with every circumstance of martial</a>
<a id='line_149'>      pomp that could display the greatness and discipline of Rome. The</a>
<a id='line_150'>      legions stood to their arms in well-ordered ranks and awful</a>
<a id='line_151'>      silence. The principal commanders, distinguished by the ensigns</a>
<a id='line_152'>      of their rank, appeared on horseback on either side of the</a>
<a id='line_153'>      Imperial throne. Behind the throne the consecrated images of the</a>
<a id='line_154'>      emperor, and his predecessors, 29 the golden eagles, and the</a>
<a id='line_155'>      various titles of the legions, engraved in letters of gold, were</a>
<a id='line_156'>      exalted in the air on lofty pikes covered with silver. When</a>
<a id='line_157'>      Aurelian assumed his seat, his manly grace and majestic figure 30</a>
<a id='line_158'>      taught the barbarians to revere the person as well as the purple</a>
<a id='line_159'>      of their conqueror. The ambassadors fell prostrate on the ground</a>
<a id='line_160'>      in silence. They were commanded to rise, and permitted to speak.</a>
<a id='line_161'>      By the assistance of interpreters they extenuated their perfidy,</a>
<a id='line_162'>      magnified their exploits, expatiated on the vicissitudes of</a>
<a id='line_163'>      fortune and the advantages of peace, and, with an ill-timed</a>
<a id='line_164'>      confidence, demanded a large subsidy, as the price of the</a>
<a id='line_165'>      alliance which they offered to the Romans. The answer of the</a>
<a id='line_166'>      emperor was stern and imperious. He treated their offer with</a>
<a id='line_167'>      contempt, and their demand with indignation, reproached the</a>
<a id='line_168'>      barbarians, that they were as ignorant of the arts of war as of</a>
<a id='line_169'>      the laws of peace, and finally dismissed them with the choice</a>
<a id='line_170'>      only of submitting to this unconditional mercy, or awaiting the</a>
<a id='line_171'>      utmost severity of his resentment. 31 Aurelian had resigned a</a>
<a id='line_172'>      distant province to the Goths; but it was dangerous to trust or</a>
<a id='line_173'>      to pardon these perfidious barbarians, whose formidable power</a>
<a id='line_174'>      kept Italy itself in perpetual alarms.</a>

<a id='line_177'>      but we are ignorant how far this mark of respect was extended; if</a>
<a id='line_178'>      to Cæsar and Augustus, it must have produced a very awful</a>
<a id='line_179'>      spectacle; a long line of the masters of the world.]</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>      30 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 210.]</a>

<a id='line_184'>      worthy of a Grecian sophist.]</a>
<a id='line_185'></a>
<a id='line_186'>      Immediately after this conference, it should seem that some</a>
<a id='line_187'>      unexpected emergency required the emperor’s presence in Pannonia.</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>      He devolved on his lieutenants the care of finishing the</a>
<a id='line_190'>      destruction of the Alemanni, either by the sword, or by the surer</a>
<a id='line_191'>      operation of famine. But an active despair has often triumphed</a>
<a id='line_192'>      over the indolent assurance of success. The barbarians, finding</a>
<a id='line_193'>      it impossible to traverse the Danube and the Roman camp, broke</a>
<a id='line_194'>      through the posts in their rear, which were more feebly or less</a>
<a id='line_195'>      carefully guarded; and with incredible diligence, but by a</a>
<a id='line_196'>      different road, returned towards the mountains of Italy. 32</a>
<a id='line_197'>      Aurelian, who considered the war as totally extinguished,</a>
<a id='line_198'>      received the mortifying intelligence of the escape of the</a>
<a id='line_199'>      Alemanni, and of the ravage which they already committed in the</a>
<a id='line_200'>      territory of Milan. The legions were commanded to follow, with as</a>
<a id='line_201'>      much expedition as those heavy bodies were capable of exerting,</a>
<a id='line_202'>      the rapid flight of an enemy whose infantry and cavalry moved</a>
<a id='line_203'>      with almost equal swiftness. A few days afterwards, the emperor</a>
<a id='line_204'>      himself marched to the relief of Italy, at the head of a chosen</a>
<a id='line_205'>      body of auxiliaries, (among whom were the hostages and cavalry of</a>
<a id='line_206'>      the Vandals,) and of all the Prætorian guards who had served in</a>
<a id='line_207'>      the wars on the Danube. 33</a>

<a id='line_212'></a>
<a id='line_213'>      As the light troops of the Alemanni had spread themselves from</a>
<a id='line_214'>      the Alps to the Apennine, the incessant vigilance of Aurelian and</a>
<a id='line_215'>      his officers was exercised in the discovery, the attack, and the</a>
<a id='line_216'>      pursuit of the numerous detachments. Notwithstanding this</a>
<a id='line_217'>      desultory war, three considerable battles are mentioned, in which</a>
<a id='line_218'>      the principal force of both armies was obstinately engaged. 34</a>
<a id='line_219'>      The success was various. In the first, fought near Placentia, the</a>
<a id='line_220'>      Romans received so severe a blow, that, according to the</a>
<a id='line_221'>      expression of a writer extremely partial to Aurelian, the</a>
<a id='line_222'>      immediate dissolution of the empire was apprehended. 35 The</a>
<a id='line_223'>      crafty barbarians, who had lined the woods, suddenly attacked the</a>
<a id='line_224'>      legions in the dusk of the evening, and, it is most probable,</a>
<a id='line_225'>      after the fatigue and disorder of a long march.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>      The fury of their charge was irresistible; but, at length, after</a>
<a id='line_228'>      a dreadful slaughter, the patient firmness of the emperor rallied</a>
<a id='line_229'>      his troops, and restored, in some degree, the honor of his arms.</a>
<a id='line_230'>      The second battle was fought near Fano in Umbria; on the spot</a>
<a id='line_231'>      which, five hundred years before, had been fatal to the brother</a>
<a id='line_232'>      of Hannibal. 36 Thus far the successful Germans had advanced</a>
<a id='line_233'>      along the Æmilian and Flaminian way, with a design of sacking the</a>
<a id='line_234'>      defenceless mistress of the world. But Aurelian, who, watchful</a>
<a id='line_235'>      for the safety of Rome, still hung on their rear, found in this</a>
<a id='line_236'>      place the decisive moment of giving them a total and</a>
<a id='line_237'>      irretrievable defeat. 37 The flying remnant of their host was</a>
<a id='line_238'>      exterminated in a third and last battle near Pavia; and Italy was</a>
<a id='line_239'>      delivered from the inroads of the Alemanni.</a>

<a id='line_256'>      consternation, when the barbarians were hourly expected at the</a>

<a id='line_523'>      treason, and his favorite amusement of hunting was the cause, or</a>
<a id='line_524'>      at least the occasion, of his death. 56 His nephew Mæonius</a>
<a id='line_525'>      presumed to dart his javelin before that of his uncle; and though</a>
<a id='line_526'>      admonished of his error, repeated the same insolence. As a</a>
<a id='line_527'>      monarch, and as a sportsman, Odenathus was provoked, took away</a>
<a id='line_528'>      his horse, a mark of ignominy among the barbarians, and chastised</a>
<a id='line_529'>      the rash youth by a short confinement. The offence was soon</a>

<a id='line_531'>      few daring associates, assassinated his uncle in the midst of a</a>
<a id='line_532'>      great entertainment. Herod, the son of Odenathus, though not of</a>
<a id='line_533'>      Zenobia, a young man of a soft and effeminate temper, 57 was</a>
<a id='line_534'>      killed with his father. But Mæonius obtained only the pleasure of</a>
<a id='line_535'>      revenge by this bloody deed. He had scarcely time to assume the</a>
<a id='line_536'>      title of Augustus, before he was sacrificed by Zenobia to the</a>

<a id='line_554'>      Odenathus, that authority was at an end which the senate had</a>
<a id='line_555'>      granted him only as a personal distinction; but his martial</a>
<a id='line_556'>      widow, disdaining both the senate and Gallienus, obliged one of</a>
<a id='line_557'>      the Roman generals, who was sent against her, to retreat into</a>
<a id='line_558'>      Europe, with the loss of his army and his reputation. 59 Instead</a>
<a id='line_559'>      of the little passions which so frequently perplex a female</a>
<a id='line_560'>      reign, the steady administration of Zenobia was guided by the</a>
<a id='line_561'>      most judicious maxims of policy. If it was expedient to pardon,</a>
<a id='line_562'>      she could calm her resentment; if it was necessary to punish, she</a>
<a id='line_563'>      could impose silence on the voice of pity. Her strict economy was</a>
<a id='line_564'>      accused of avarice; yet on every proper occasion she appeared</a>
<a id='line_565'>      magnificent and liberal. The neighboring states of Arabia,</a>
<a id='line_566'>      Armenia, and Persia, dreaded her enmity, and solicited her</a>
<a id='line_567'>      alliance. To the dominions of Odenathus, which extended from the</a>
<a id='line_568'>      Euphrates to the frontiers of Bithynia, his widow added the</a>

<a id='line_572'>      assert the dignity of the empire in the East. The conduct,</a>
<a id='line_573'>      however, of Zenobia was attended with some ambiguity; not is it</a>
<a id='line_574'>      unlikely that she had conceived the design of erecting an</a>
<a id='line_575'>      independent and hostile monarchy. She blended with the popular</a>

<a id='line_577'>      and exacted from her subjects the same adoration that was paid to</a>
<a id='line_578'>      the successor of Cyrus. She bestowed on her three sons 61 a Latin</a>
<a id='line_579'>      education, and often showed them to the troops adorned with the</a>
<a id='line_580'>      Imperial purple. For herself she reserved the diadem, with the</a>

<a id='line_641'>      the most part of light archers, and of heavy cavalry clothed in</a>
<a id='line_642'>      complete steel. The Moorish and Illyrian horse of Aurelian were</a>
<a id='line_643'>      unable to sustain the ponderous charge of their antagonists. They</a>
<a id='line_644'>      fled in real or affected disorder, engaged the Palmyrenians in a</a>

<a id='line_654'>      far as the frontier of Egypt, the nations subject to her empire</a>
<a id='line_655'>      had joined the standard of the conqueror, who detached Probus,</a>

<a id='line_723'>      Roman people,” says Aurelian, in an original letter, “speak with</a>

<a id='line_780'>      When the Syrian queen was brought into the presence of Aurelian,</a>
<a id='line_781'>      he sternly asked her, How she had presumed to rise in arms</a>
<a id='line_782'>      against the emperors of Rome! The answer of Zenobia was a prudent</a>
<a id='line_783'>      mixture of respect and firmness. “Because I disdained to consider</a>
<a id='line_784'>      as Roman emperors an Aureolus or a Gallienus. You alone I</a>
<a id='line_785'>      acknowledge as my conqueror and my sovereign.” 73 But as female</a>
<a id='line_786'>      fortitude is commonly artificial, so it is seldom steady or</a>
<a id='line_787'>      consistent. The courage of Zenobia deserted her in the hour of</a>
<a id='line_788'>      trial; she trembled at the angry clamors of the soldiers, who</a>
<a id='line_789'>      called aloud for her immediate execution, forgot the generous</a>
<a id='line_790'>      despair of Cleopatra, which she had proposed as her model, and</a>
<a id='line_791'>      ignominiously purchased life by the sacrifice of her fame and her</a>
<a id='line_792'>      friends. It was to their counsels, which governed the weakness of</a>
<a id='line_793'>      her sex, that she imputed the guilt of her obstinate resistance;</a>
<a id='line_794'>      it was on their heads that she directed the vengeance of the</a>
<a id='line_795'>      cruel Aurelian. The fame of Longinus, who was included among the</a>
<a id='line_796'>      numerous and perhaps innocent victims of her fear, will survive</a>
<a id='line_797'>      that of the queen who betrayed, or the tyrant who condemned him.</a>
<a id='line_798'>      Genius and learning were incapable of moving a fierce unlettered</a>
<a id='line_799'>      soldier, but they had served to elevate and harmonize the soul of</a>
<a id='line_800'>      Longinus. Without uttering a complaint, he calmly followed the</a>
<a id='line_801'>      executioner, pitying his unhappy mistress, and bestowing comfort</a>
<a id='line_802'>      on his afflicted friends. 74</a>

<a id='line_809'>      Returning from the conquest of the East, Aurelian had already</a>
<a id='line_810'>      crossed the Straits which divided Europe from Asia, when he was</a>
<a id='line_811'>      provoked by the intelligence that the Palmyrenians had massacred</a>
<a id='line_812'>      the governor and garrison which he had left among them, and again</a>
<a id='line_813'>      erected the standard of revolt. Without a moment’s deliberation,</a>
<a id='line_814'>      he once more turned his face towards Syria. Antioch was alarmed</a>
<a id='line_815'>      by his rapid approach, and the helpless city of Palmyra felt the</a>
<a id='line_816'>      irresistible weight of his resentment. We have a letter of</a>
<a id='line_817'>      Aurelian himself, in which he acknowledges, 75 that old men,</a>
<a id='line_818'>      women, children, and peasants, had been involved in that dreadful</a>
<a id='line_819'>      execution, which should have been confined to armed rebellion;</a>
<a id='line_820'>      and although his principal concern seems directed to the</a>
<a id='line_821'>      reëstablishment of a temple of the Sun, he discovers some pity</a>
<a id='line_822'>      for the remnant of the Palmyrenians, to whom he grants the</a>
<a id='line_823'>      permission of rebuilding and inhabiting their city. But it is</a>
<a id='line_824'>      easier to destroy than to restore. The seat of commerce, of arts,</a>
<a id='line_825'>      and of Zenobia, gradually sunk into an obscure town, a trifling</a>
<a id='line_826'>      fortress, and at length a miserable village. The present citizens</a>
<a id='line_827'>      of Palmyra, consisting of thirty or forty families, have erected</a>
<a id='line_828'>      their mud cottages within the spacious court of a magnificent</a>

<a id='line_833'>      Another and a last labor still awaited the indefatigable</a>
<a id='line_834'>      Aurelian; to suppress a dangerous though obscure rebel, who,</a>
<a id='line_835'>      during the revolt of Palmyra, had arisen on the banks of the</a>
<a id='line_836'>      Nile. Firmus, the friend and ally, as he proudly styled himself,</a>
<a id='line_837'>      of Odenathus and Zenobia, was no more than a wealthy merchant of</a>
<a id='line_838'>      Egypt. In the course of his trade to India, he had formed very</a>
<a id='line_839'>      intimate connections with the Saracens and the Blemmyes, whose</a>
<a id='line_840'>      situation on either coast of the Red Sea gave them an easy</a>
<a id='line_841'>      introduction into the Upper Egypt. The Egyptians he inflamed with</a>
<a id='line_842'>      the hope of freedom, and, at the head of their furious multitude,</a>
<a id='line_843'>      broke into the city of Alexandria, where he assumed the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_844'>      purple, coined money, published edicts, and raised an army,</a>
<a id='line_845'>      which, as he vainly boasted, he was capable of maintaining from</a>
<a id='line_846'>      the sole profits of his paper trade. Such troops were a feeble</a>
<a id='line_847'>      defence against the approach of Aurelian; and it seems almost</a>
<a id='line_848'>      unnecessary to relate, that Firmus was routed, taken, tortured,</a>
<a id='line_849'>      and put to death. 76 Aurelian might now congratulate the senate,</a>
<a id='line_850'>      the people, and himself, that in little more than three years, he</a>
<a id='line_851'>      had restored universal peace and order to the Roman world.</a>

<a id='line_857'>      Firmus was the last of the rebels, and consequently that Tetricus</a>
<a id='line_858'>      was already suppressed.]</a>

<a id='line_860'>      Since the foundation of Rome, no general had more nobly deserved</a>
<a id='line_861'>      a triumph than Aurelian; nor was a triumph ever celebrated with</a>

<a id='line_863'>      elephants, four royal tigers, and above two hundred of the most</a>
<a id='line_864'>      curious animals from every climate of the North, the East, and</a>
<a id='line_865'>      the South. They were followed by sixteen hundred gladiators,</a>
<a id='line_866'>      devoted to the cruel amusement of the amphitheatre. The wealth of</a>
<a id='line_867'>      Asia, the arms and ensigns of so many conquered nations, and the</a>
<a id='line_868'>      magnificent plate and wardrobe of the Syrian queen, were disposed</a>

<a id='line_871'>      Bactriana, India, and China, all remarkable by their rich or</a>

<a id='line_876'></a>
<a id='line_877'>      The victories of Aurelian were attested by the long train of</a>
<a id='line_878'>      captives who reluctantly attended his triumph, Goths, Vandals,</a>
<a id='line_879'>      Sarmatians, Alemanni, Franks, Gauls, Syrians, and Egyptians. Each</a>
<a id='line_880'>      people was distinguished by its peculiar inscription, and the</a>
<a id='line_881'>      title of Amazons was bestowed on ten martial heroines of the</a>
<a id='line_882'>      Gothic nation who had been taken in arms. 78 But every eye,</a>
<a id='line_883'>      disregarding the crowd of captives, was fixed on the emperor</a>
<a id='line_884'>      Tetricus and the queen of the East. The former, as well as his</a>
<a id='line_885'>      son, whom he had created Augustus, was dressed in Gallic</a>
<a id='line_886'>      trousers, 79 a saffron tunic, and a robe of purple. The beauteous</a>
<a id='line_887'>      figure of Zenobia was confined by fetters of gold; a slave</a>
<a id='line_888'>      supported the gold chain which encircled her neck, and she almost</a>
<a id='line_889'>      fainted under the intolerable weight of jewels. She preceded on</a>
<a id='line_890'>      foot the magnificent chariot, in which she once hoped to enter</a>
<a id='line_891'>      the gates of Rome. It was followed by two other chariots, still</a>

<a id='line_1044'>      We might content ourselves with relating this extraordinary</a>
<a id='line_1045'>      transaction, but we cannot dissemble how much in its present form</a>
<a id='line_1046'>      it appears to us inconsistent and incredible. The debasement of</a>
<a id='line_1047'>      the coin is indeed well suited to the administration of</a>
<a id='line_1048'>      Gallienus; nor is it unlikely that the instruments of the</a>
<a id='line_1049'>      corruption might dread the inflexible justice of Aurelian. But</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      the guilt, as well as the profit, must have been confined to a</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      very few; nor is it easy to conceive by what arts they could arm</a>
<a id='line_1052'>      a people whom they had injured, against a monarch whom they had</a>
<a id='line_1053'>      betrayed. We might naturally expect that such miscreants should</a>
<a id='line_1054'>      have shared the public detestation with the informers and the</a>
<a id='line_1055'>      other ministers of oppression; and that the reformation of the</a>
<a id='line_1056'>      coin should have been an action equally popular with the</a>
<a id='line_1057'>      destruction of those obsolete accounts, which by the emperor’s</a>
<a id='line_1058'>      order were burnt in the forum of Trajan. 90 In an age when the</a>
<a id='line_1059'>      principles of commerce were so imperfectly understood, the most</a>
<a id='line_1060'>      desirable end might perhaps be effected by harsh and injudicious</a>
<a id='line_1061'>      means; but a temporary grievance of such a nature can scarcely</a>
<a id='line_1062'>      excite and support a serious civil war. The repetition of</a>
<a id='line_1063'>      intolerable taxes, imposed either on the land or on the</a>
<a id='line_1064'>      necessaries of life, may at last provoke those who will not, or</a>
<a id='line_1065'>      who cannot, relinquish their country. But the case is far</a>
<a id='line_1066'>      otherwise in every operation which, by whatsoever expedients,</a>
<a id='line_1067'>      restores the just value of money. The transient evil is soon</a>
<a id='line_1068'>      obliterated by the permanent benefit, the loss is divided among</a>
<a id='line_1069'>      multitudes; and if a few wealthy individuals experience a</a>
<a id='line_1070'>      sensible diminution of treasure, with their riches, they at the</a>
<a id='line_1071'>      same time lose the degree of weight and importance which they</a>
<a id='line_1072'>      derived from the possession of them. However Aurelian might</a>
<a id='line_1073'>      choose to disguise the real cause of the insurrection, his</a>
<a id='line_1074'>      reformation of the coin could furnish only a faint pretence to a</a>
<a id='line_1075'>      party already powerful and discontented. Rome, though deprived of</a>
<a id='line_1076'>      freedom, was distracted by faction. The people, towards whom the</a>
<a id='line_1077'>      emperor, himself a plebeian, always expressed a peculiar</a>
<a id='line_1078'>      fondness, lived in perpetual dissension with the senate, the</a>
<a id='line_1079'>      equestrian order, and the Prætorian guards. 91 Nothing less than</a>
<a id='line_1080'>      the firm though secret conspiracy of those orders, of the</a>
<a id='line_1081'>      authority of the first, the wealth of the second, and the arms of</a>
<a id='line_1082'>      the third, could have displayed a strength capable of contending</a>
<a id='line_1083'>      in battle with the veteran legions of the Danube, which, under</a>
<a id='line_1084'>      the conduct of a martial sovereign, had achieved the conquest of</a>
<a id='line_1085'>      the West and of the East.</a>

<a id='line_1093'>      Whatever was the cause or the object of this rebellion, imputed</a>
<a id='line_1094'>      with so little probability to the workmen of the mint, Aurelian</a>
<a id='line_1095'>      used his victory with unrelenting rigor. 92 He was naturally of a</a>
<a id='line_1096'>      severe disposition. A peasant and a soldier, his nerves yielded</a>
<a id='line_1097'>      not easily to the impressions of sympathy, and he could sustain</a>
<a id='line_1098'>      without emotion the sight of tortures and death. Trained from his</a>
<a id='line_1099'>      earliest youth in the exercise of arms, he set too small a value</a>
<a id='line_1100'>      on the life of a citizen, chastised by military execution the</a>
<a id='line_1101'>      slightest offences, and transferred the stern discipline of the</a>
<a id='line_1102'>      camp into the civil administration of the laws. His love of</a>
<a id='line_1103'>      justice often became a blind and furious passion; and whenever he</a>
<a id='line_1104'>      deemed his own or the public safety endangered, he disregarded</a>
<a id='line_1105'>      the rules of evidence, and the proportion of punishments. The</a>
<a id='line_1106'>      unprovoked rebellion with which the Romans rewarded his services,</a>
<a id='line_1107'>      exasperated his haughty spirit. The noblest families of the</a>
<a id='line_1108'>      capital were involved in the guilt or suspicion of this dark</a>
<a id='line_1109'>      conspiracy. A nasty spirit of revenge urged the bloody</a>
<a id='line_1110'>      prosecution, and it proved fatal to one of the nephews of the</a>
<a id='line_1111'>      emperor. The executioners (if we may use the expression of a</a>
<a id='line_1112'>      contemporary poet) were fatigued, the prisons were crowded, and</a>
<a id='line_1113'>      the unhappy senate lamented the death or absence of its most</a>
<a id='line_1114'>      illustrious members. 93 Nor was the pride of Aurelian less</a>
<a id='line_1115'>      offensive to that assembly than his cruelty. Ignorant or</a>
<a id='line_1116'>      impatient of the restraints of civil institutions, he disdained</a>
<a id='line_1117'>      to hold his power by any other title than that of the sword, and</a>
<a id='line_1118'>      governed by right of conquest an empire which he had saved and</a>

<a id='line_1132'>      It was observed by one of the most sagacious of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1133'>      princes, that the talents of his predecessor Aurelian were better</a>
<a id='line_1134'>      suited to the command of an army, than to the government of an</a>
<a id='line_1135'>      empire. 95 Conscious of the character in which nature and</a>
<a id='line_1136'>      experience had enabled him to excel, he again took the field a</a>
<a id='line_1137'>      few months after his triumph. It was expedient to exercise the</a>
<a id='line_1138'>      restless temper of the legions in some foreign war, and the</a>
<a id='line_1139'>      Persian monarch, exulting in the shame of Valerian, still braved</a>
<a id='line_1140'>      with impunity the offended majesty of Rome. At the head of an</a>
<a id='line_1141'>      army, less formidable by its numbers than by its discipline and</a>
<a id='line_1142'>      valor, the emperor advanced as far as the Straits which divide</a>
<a id='line_1143'>      Europe from Asia. He there experienced that the most absolute</a>
<a id='line_1144'>      power is a weak defence against the effects of despair. He had</a>
<a id='line_1145'>      threatened one of his secretaries who was accused of extortion;</a>
<a id='line_1146'>      and it was known that he seldom threatened in vain. The last hope</a>
<a id='line_1147'>      which remained for the criminal was to involve some of the</a>
<a id='line_1148'>      principal officers of the army in his danger, or at least in his</a>
<a id='line_1149'>      fears. Artfully counterfeiting his master’s hand, he showed them,</a>
<a id='line_1150'>      in a long and bloody list, their own names devoted to death.</a>
<a id='line_1151'>      Without suspecting or examining the fraud, they resolved to</a>
<a id='line_1152'>      secure their lives by the murder of the emperor. On his march,</a>
<a id='line_1153'>      between Byzantium and Heraclea, Aurelian was suddenly attacked by</a>
<a id='line_1154'>      the conspirators, whose stations gave them a right to surround</a>
<a id='line_1155'>      his person, and after a short resistance, fell by the hand of</a>
<a id='line_1156'>      Mucapor, a general whom he had always loved and trusted. He died</a>
<a id='line_1157'>      regretted by the army, detested by the senate, but universally</a>
