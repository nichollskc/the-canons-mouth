<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>      During the last years of Justinian, his infirm mind was devoted</a>
<a id='line_9'>      to heavenly contemplation, and he neglected the business of the</a>
<a id='line_10'>      lower world. His subjects were impatient of the long continuance</a>
<a id='line_11'>      of his life and reign: yet all who were capable of reflection</a>
<a id='line_12'>      apprehended the moment of his death, which might involve the</a>
<a id='line_13'>      capital in tumult, and the empire in civil war. Seven nephews 1</a>
<a id='line_14'>      of the childless monarch, the sons or grandsons of his brother</a>
<a id='line_15'>      and sister, had been educated in the splendor of a princely</a>
<a id='line_16'>      fortune; they had been shown in high commands to the provinces</a>
<a id='line_17'>      and armies; their characters were known, their followers were</a>
<a id='line_18'>      zealous, and, as the jealousy of age postponed the declaration of</a>
<a id='line_19'>      a successor, they might expect with equal hopes the inheritance</a>
<a id='line_20'>      of their uncle. He expired in his palace, after a reign of</a>
<a id='line_21'>      thirty-eight years; and the decisive opportunity was embraced by</a>
<a id='line_22'>      the friends of Justin, the son of Vigilantia. 2 At the hour of</a>
<a id='line_23'>      midnight, his domestics were awakened by an importunate crowd,</a>
<a id='line_24'>      who thundered at his door, and obtained admittance by revealing</a>
<a id='line_25'>      themselves to be the principal members of the senate. These</a>
<a id='line_26'>      welcome deputies announced the recent and momentous secret of the</a>
<a id='line_27'>      emperor’s decease; reported, or perhaps invented, his dying</a>
<a id='line_28'>      choice of the best beloved and most deserving of his nephews, and</a>
<a id='line_29'>      conjured Justin to prevent the disorders of the multitude, if</a>
<a id='line_30'>      they should perceive, with the return of light, that they were</a>
<a id='line_31'>      left without a master. After composing his countenance to</a>
<a id='line_32'>      surprise, sorrow, and decent modesty, Justin, by the advice of</a>
<a id='line_33'>      his wife Sophia, submitted to the authority of the senate. He was</a>
<a id='line_34'>      conducted with speed and silence to the palace; the guards</a>
<a id='line_35'>      saluted their new sovereign; and the martial and religious rites</a>
<a id='line_36'>      of his coronation were diligently accomplished. By the hands of</a>
<a id='line_37'>      the proper officers he was invested with the Imperial garments,</a>
<a id='line_38'>      the red buskins, white tunic, and purple robe.</a>
<a id='line_39'></a>
<a id='line_40'>      A fortunate soldier, whom he instantly promoted to the rank of</a>
<a id='line_41'>      tribune, encircled his neck with a military collar; four robust</a>
<a id='line_42'>      youths exalted him on a shield; he stood firm and erect to</a>
<a id='line_43'>      receive the adoration of his subjects; and their choice was</a>
<a id='line_44'>      sanctified by the benediction of the patriarch, who imposed the</a>
<a id='line_45'>      diadem on the head of an orthodox prince. The hippodrome was</a>
<a id='line_46'>      already filled with innumerable multitudes; and no sooner did the</a>
<a id='line_47'>      emperor appear on his throne, than the voices of the blue and the</a>
<a id='line_48'>      green factions were confounded in the same loyal acclamations. In</a>
<a id='line_49'>      the speeches which Justin addressed to the senate and people, he</a>
<a id='line_50'>      promised to correct the abuses which had disgraced the age of his</a>
<a id='line_51'>      predecessor, displayed the maxims of a just and beneficent</a>
<a id='line_52'>      government, and declared that, on the approaching calends of</a>
<a id='line_53'>      January, 3 he would revive in his own person the name and liberty</a>
<a id='line_54'>      of a Roman consul. The immediate discharge of his uncle’s debts</a>
<a id='line_55'>      exhibited a solid pledge of his faith and generosity: a train of</a>
<a id='line_56'>      porters, laden with bags of gold, advanced into the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_57'>      hippodrome, and the hopeless creditors of Justinian accepted this</a>
<a id='line_58'>      equitable payment as a voluntary gift. Before the end of three</a>
<a id='line_59'>      years, his example was imitated and surpassed by the empress</a>
<a id='line_60'>      Sophia, who delivered many indigent citizens from the weight of</a>
<a id='line_61'>      debt and usury: an act of benevolence the best entitled to</a>
<a id='line_62'>      gratitude, since it relieves the most intolerable distress; but</a>
<a id='line_63'>      in which the bounty of a prince is the most liable to be abused</a>
<a id='line_64'>      by the claims of prodigality and fraud. 4</a>

<a id='line_86'></a>
<a id='line_87'>      On the seventh day of his reign, Justin gave audience to the</a>
<a id='line_88'>      ambassadors of the Avars, and the scene was decorated to impress</a>
<a id='line_89'>      the Barbarians with astonishment, veneration, and terror. From</a>
<a id='line_90'>      the palace gate, the spacious courts and long porticos were lined</a>
<a id='line_91'>      with the lofty crests and gilt bucklers of the guards, who</a>
<a id='line_92'>      presented their spears and axes with more confidence than they</a>
<a id='line_93'>      would have shown in a field of battle. The officers who exercised</a>
<a id='line_94'>      the power, or attended the person, of the prince, were attired in</a>
<a id='line_95'>      their richest habits, and arranged according to the military and</a>
<a id='line_96'>      civil order of the hierarchy. When the veil of the sanctuary was</a>
<a id='line_97'>      withdrawn, the ambassadors beheld the emperor of the East on his</a>
<a id='line_98'>      throne, beneath a canopy, or dome, which was supported by four</a>
<a id='line_99'>      columns, and crowned with a winged figure of Victory. In the</a>
<a id='line_100'>      first emotions of surprise, they submitted to the servile</a>
<a id='line_101'>      adoration of the Byzantine court; but as soon as they rose from</a>
<a id='line_102'>      the ground, Targetius, the chief of the embassy, expressed the</a>
<a id='line_103'>      freedom and pride of a Barbarian. He extolled, by the tongue of</a>
<a id='line_104'>      his interpreter, the greatness of the chagan, by whose clemency</a>
<a id='line_105'>      the kingdoms of the South were permitted to exist, whose</a>
<a id='line_106'>      victorious subjects had traversed the frozen rivers of Scythia,</a>
<a id='line_107'>      and who now covered the banks of the Danube with innumerable</a>
<a id='line_108'>      tents. The late emperor had cultivated, with annual and costly</a>
<a id='line_109'>      gifts, the friendship of a grateful monarch, and the enemies of</a>
<a id='line_110'>      Rome had respected the allies of the Avars. The same prudence</a>
<a id='line_111'>      would instruct the nephew of Justinian to imitate the liberality</a>
<a id='line_112'>      of his uncle, and to purchase the blessings of peace from an</a>
<a id='line_113'>      invincible people, who delighted and excelled in the exercise of</a>
<a id='line_114'>      war. The reply of the emperor was delivered in the same strain of</a>
<a id='line_115'>      haughty defiance, and he derived his confidence from the God of</a>
<a id='line_116'>      the Christians, the ancient glory of Rome, and the recent</a>
<a id='line_117'>      triumphs of Justinian. “The empire,” said he, “abounds with men</a>
<a id='line_118'>      and horses, and arms sufficient to defend our frontiers, and to</a>
<a id='line_119'>      chastise the Barbarians. You offer aid, you threaten hostilities:</a>
<a id='line_120'>      we despise your enmity and your aid. The conquerors of the Avars</a>
<a id='line_121'>      solicit our alliance; shall we dread their fugitives and exiles?</a>
<a id='line_122'>      5 The bounty of our uncle was granted to your misery, to your</a>
<a id='line_123'>      humble prayers. From us you shall receive a more important</a>
<a id='line_124'>      obligation, the knowledge of your own weakness. Retire from our</a>
<a id='line_125'>      presence; the lives of ambassadors are safe; and, if you return</a>
<a id='line_126'>      to implore our pardon, perhaps you will taste of our</a>
<a id='line_127'>      benevolence.” 6 On the report of his ambassadors, the chagan was</a>
<a id='line_128'>      awed by the apparent firmness of a Roman emperor of whose</a>
<a id='line_129'>      character and resources he was ignorant. Instead of executing his</a>
<a id='line_130'>      threats against the Eastern empire, he marched into the poor and</a>
<a id='line_131'>      savage countries of Germany, which were subject to the dominion</a>
<a id='line_132'>      of the Franks. After two doubtful battles, he consented to</a>
<a id='line_133'>      retire, and the Austrasian king relieved the distress of his camp</a>
<a id='line_134'>      with an immediate supply of corn and cattle. 7 Such repeated</a>
<a id='line_135'>      disappointments had chilled the spirit of the Avars, and their</a>
<a id='line_136'>      power would have dissolved away in the Sarmatian desert, if the</a>
<a id='line_137'>      alliance of Alboin, king of the Lombards, had not given a new</a>
<a id='line_138'>      object to their arms, and a lasting settlement to their wearied</a>
<a id='line_139'>      fortunes.</a>

<a id='line_164'></a>
<a id='line_165'>      While Alboin served under his father’s standard, he encountered</a>
<a id='line_166'>      in battle, and transpierced with his lance, the rival prince of</a>
<a id='line_167'>      the Gepidae. The Lombards, who applauded such early prowess,</a>
<a id='line_168'>      requested his father, with unanimous acclamations, that the</a>
<a id='line_169'>      heroic youth, who had shared the dangers of the field, might be</a>
<a id='line_170'>      admitted to the feast of victory. “You are not unmindful,”</a>
<a id='line_171'>      replied the inflexible Audoin, “of the wise customs of our</a>
<a id='line_172'>      ancestors. Whatever may be his merit, a prince is incapable of</a>
<a id='line_173'>      sitting at table with his father till he has received his arms</a>
<a id='line_174'>      from a foreign and royal hand.” Alboin bowed with reverence to</a>
<a id='line_175'>      the institutions of his country, selected forty companions, and</a>
<a id='line_176'>      boldly visited the court of Turisund, king of the Gepidae, who</a>
<a id='line_177'>      embraced and entertained, according to the laws of hospitality,</a>
<a id='line_178'>      the murderer of his son. At the banquet, whilst Alboin occupied</a>
<a id='line_179'>      the seat of the youth whom he had slain, a tender remembrance</a>
<a id='line_180'>      arose in the mind of Turisund. “How dear is that place! how</a>
<a id='line_181'>      hateful is that person!” were the words that escaped, with a</a>
<a id='line_182'>      sigh, from the indignant father. His grief exasperated the</a>
<a id='line_183'>      national resentment of the Gepidae; and Cunimund, his surviving</a>
<a id='line_184'>      son, was provoked by wine, or fraternal affection, to the desire</a>
<a id='line_185'>      of vengeance. “The Lombards,” said the rude Barbarian, “resemble,</a>
<a id='line_186'>      in figure and in smell, the mares of our Sarmatian plains.” And</a>
<a id='line_187'>      this insult was a coarse allusion to the white bands which</a>
<a id='line_188'>      enveloped their legs. “Add another resemblance,” replied an</a>
<a id='line_189'>      audacious Lombard; “you have felt how strongly they kick. Visit</a>
<a id='line_190'>      the plain of Asfield, and seek for the bones of thy brother: they</a>
<a id='line_191'>      are mingled with those of the vilest animals.” The Gepidae, a</a>
<a id='line_192'>      nation of warriors, started from their seats, and the fearless</a>
<a id='line_193'>      Alboin, with his forty companions, laid their hands on their</a>
<a id='line_194'>      swords. The tumult was appeased by the venerable interposition of</a>
<a id='line_195'>      Turisund. He saved his own honor, and the life of his guest; and,</a>
<a id='line_196'>      after the solemn rites of investiture, dismissed the stranger in</a>
<a id='line_197'>      the bloody arms of his son; the gift of a weeping parent. Alboin</a>
<a id='line_198'>      returned in triumph; and the Lombards, who celebrated his</a>
<a id='line_199'>      matchless intrepidity, were compelled to praise the virtues of an</a>
<a id='line_200'>      enemy. 8 In this extraordinary visit he had probably seen the</a>
<a id='line_201'>      daughter of Cunimund, who soon after ascended the throne of the</a>
<a id='line_202'>      Gepidae. Her name was Rosamond, an appellation expressive of</a>
<a id='line_203'>      female beauty, and which our own history or romance has</a>
<a id='line_204'>      consecrated to amorous tales. The king of the Lombards (the</a>
<a id='line_205'>      father of Alboin no longer lived) was contracted to the</a>
<a id='line_206'>      granddaughter of Clovis; but the restraints of faith and policy</a>
<a id='line_207'>      soon yielded to the hope of possessing the fair Rosamond, and of</a>
<a id='line_208'>      insulting her family and nation. The arts of persuasion were</a>
<a id='line_209'>      tried without success; and the impatient lover, by force and</a>
<a id='line_210'>      stratagem, obtained the object of his desires. War was the</a>
<a id='line_211'>      consequence which he foresaw and solicited; but the Lombards</a>
<a id='line_212'>      could not long withstand the furious assault of the Gepidae, who</a>
<a id='line_213'>      were sustained by a Roman army. And, as the offer of marriage was</a>
<a id='line_214'>      rejected with contempt, Alboin was compelled to relinquish his</a>
<a id='line_215'>      prey, and to partake of the disgrace which he had inflicted on</a>
<a id='line_216'>      the house of Cunimund. 9</a>

<a id='line_227'>      When a public quarrel is envenomed by private injuries, a blow</a>

<a id='line_230'>      arms for a new encounter. The strength of Alboin had been found</a>
<a id='line_231'>      unequal to the gratification of his love, ambition, and revenge:</a>
<a id='line_232'>      he condescended to implore the formidable aid of the chagan; and</a>
<a id='line_233'>      the arguments that he employed are expressive of the art and</a>
<a id='line_234'>      policy of the Barbarians. In the attack of the Gepidae, he had</a>
<a id='line_235'>      been prompted by the just desire of extirpating a people whom</a>
<a id='line_236'>      their alliance with the Roman empire had rendered the common</a>
<a id='line_237'>      enemies of the nations, and the personal adversaries of the</a>
<a id='line_238'>      chagan. If the forces of the Avars and the Lombards should unite</a>
<a id='line_239'>      in this glorious quarrel, the victory was secure, and the reward</a>
<a id='line_240'>      inestimable: the Danube, the Hebrus, Italy, and Constantinople,</a>
<a id='line_241'>      would be exposed, without a barrier, to their invincible arms.</a>
<a id='line_242'>      But, if they hesitated or delayed to prevent the malice of the</a>
<a id='line_243'>      Romans, the same spirit which had insulted would pursue the Avars</a>
<a id='line_244'>      to the extremity of the earth. These specious reasons were heard</a>
<a id='line_245'>      by the chagan with coldness and disdain: he detained the Lombard</a>
<a id='line_246'>      ambassadors in his camp, protracted the negotiation, and by turns</a>
<a id='line_247'>      alleged his want of inclination, or his want of ability, to</a>
<a id='line_248'>      undertake this important enterprise. At length he signified the</a>
<a id='line_249'>      ultimate price of his alliance, that the Lombards should</a>
<a id='line_250'>      immediately present him with a tithe of their cattle; that the</a>
<a id='line_251'>      spoils and captives should be equally divided; but that the lands</a>
<a id='line_252'>      of the Gepidae should become the sole patrimony of the Avars.</a>
<a id='line_253'>      Such hard conditions were eagerly accepted by the passions of</a>
<a id='line_254'>      Alboin; and, as the Romans were dissatisfied with the ingratitude</a>
<a id='line_255'>      and perfidy of the Gepidae, Justin abandoned that incorrigible</a>
<a id='line_256'>      people to their fate, and remained the tranquil spectator of this</a>
<a id='line_257'>      unequal conflict. The despair of Cunimund was active and</a>
<a id='line_258'>      dangerous. He was informed that the Avars had entered his</a>
<a id='line_259'>      confines; but, on the strong assurance that, after the defeat of</a>
<a id='line_260'>      the Lombards, these foreign invaders would easily be repelled, he</a>
<a id='line_261'>      rushed forwards to encounter the implacable enemy of his name and</a>
<a id='line_262'>      family. But the courage of the Gepidae could secure them no more</a>
<a id='line_263'>      than an honorable death. The bravest of the nation fell in the</a>
<a id='line_264'>      field of battle; the king of the Lombards contemplated with</a>
<a id='line_265'>      delight the head of Cunimund; and his skull was fashioned into a</a>
<a id='line_266'>      cup to satiate the hatred of the conqueror, or, perhaps, to</a>
<a id='line_267'>      comply with the savage custom of his country. 10 After this</a>
<a id='line_268'>      victory, no further obstacle could impede the progress of the</a>
<a id='line_269'>      confederates, and they faithfully executed the terms of their</a>
<a id='line_270'>      agreement. 11 The fair countries of Walachia, Moldavia,</a>
<a id='line_271'>      Transylvania, and the other parts of Hungary beyond the Danube,</a>
<a id='line_272'>      were occupied, without resistance, by a new colony of Scythians;</a>
<a id='line_273'>      and the Dacian empire of the chagans subsisted with splendor</a>
<a id='line_274'>      above two hundred and thirty years. The nation of the Gepidae was</a>
<a id='line_275'>      dissolved; but, in the distribution of the captives, the slaves</a>
<a id='line_276'>      of the Avars were less fortunate than the companions of the</a>
<a id='line_277'>      Lombards, whose generosity adopted a valiant foe, and whose</a>
<a id='line_278'>      freedom was incompatible with cool and deliberate tyranny. One</a>
<a id='line_279'>      moiety of the spoil introduced into the camp of Alboin more</a>
<a id='line_280'>      wealth than a Barbarian could readily compute. The fair Rosamond</a>
<a id='line_281'>      was persuaded, or compelled, to acknowledge the rights of her</a>
<a id='line_282'>      victorious lover; and the daughter of Cunimund appeared to</a>

<a id='line_371'>      the general discontent was expressed with freedom by the deputies</a>
<a id='line_372'>      of Rome. Before the throne of Justinian they boldly declared,</a>

<a id='line_378'>      over the merit of Belisarius. A new exarch, Longinus, was</a>

<a id='line_380'>      motives of his recall were revealed in the insulting mandate of</a>
<a id='line_381'>      the empress Sophia, “that he should leave to men the exercise of</a>
<a id='line_382'>      arms, and return to his proper station among the maidens of the</a>
<a id='line_383'>      palace, where a distaff should be again placed in the hand of the</a>

<a id='line_385'>      unravel!” is said to have been the reply which indignation and</a>
<a id='line_386'>      conscious virtue extorted from the hero. Instead of attending, a</a>

<a id='line_508'>      domestic treason and female revenge. In a palace near Verona,</a>
<a id='line_509'>      which had not been erected for the Barbarians, he feasted the</a>
<a id='line_510'>      companions of his arms; intoxication was the reward of valor, and</a>
<a id='line_511'>      the king himself was tempted by appetite, or vanity, to exceed</a>
<a id='line_512'>      the ordinary measure of his intemperance. After draining many</a>
<a id='line_513'>      capacious bowls of Rhaetian or Falernian wine, he called for the</a>
<a id='line_514'>      skull of Cunimund, the noblest and most precious ornament of his</a>
<a id='line_515'>      sideboard. The cup of victory was accepted with horrid applause</a>
<a id='line_516'>      by the circle of the Lombard chiefs. “Fill it again with wine,”</a>
<a id='line_517'>      exclaimed the inhuman conqueror, “fill it to the brim: carry this</a>
<a id='line_518'>      goblet to the queen, and request in my name that she would</a>
<a id='line_519'>      rejoice with her father.” In an agony of grief and rage, Rosamond</a>
<a id='line_520'>      had strength to utter, “Let the will of my lord be obeyed!” and,</a>
<a id='line_521'>      touching it with her lips, pronounced a silent imprecation, that</a>
<a id='line_522'>      the insult should be washed away in the blood of Alboin. Some</a>
<a id='line_523'>      indulgence might be due to the resentment of a daughter, if she</a>
<a id='line_524'>      had not already violated the duties of a wife. Implacable in her</a>
<a id='line_525'>      enmity, or inconstant in her love, the queen of Italy had stooped</a>
<a id='line_526'>      from the throne to the arms of a subject, and Helmichis, the</a>
<a id='line_527'>      king’s armor-bearer, was the secret minister of her pleasure and</a>
<a id='line_528'>      revenge. Against the proposal of the murder, he could no longer</a>
<a id='line_529'>      urge the scruples of fidelity or gratitude; but Helmichis</a>
<a id='line_530'>      trembled when he revolved the danger as well as the guilt, when</a>
<a id='line_531'>      he recollected the matchless strength and intrepidity of a</a>
<a id='line_532'>      warrior whom he had so often attended in the field of battle. He</a>
<a id='line_533'>      pressed and obtained, that one of the bravest champions of the</a>
<a id='line_534'>      Lombards should be associated to the enterprise; but no more than</a>
<a id='line_535'>      a promise of secrecy could be drawn from the gallant Peredeus,</a>
<a id='line_536'>      and the mode of seduction employed by Rosamond betrays her</a>
<a id='line_537'>      shameless insensibility both to honor and love. She supplied the</a>
<a id='line_538'>      place of one of her female attendants who was beloved by</a>
<a id='line_539'>      Peredeus, and contrived some excuse for darkness and silence,</a>
<a id='line_540'>      till she could inform her companion that he had enjoyed the queen</a>
<a id='line_541'>      of the Lombards, and that his own death, or the death of Alboin,</a>
<a id='line_542'>      must be the consequence of such treasonable adultery. In this</a>
<a id='line_543'>      alternative he chose rather to be the accomplice than the victim</a>
<a id='line_544'>      of Rosamond, 21 whose undaunted spirit was incapable of fear or</a>
<a id='line_545'>      remorse. She expected and soon found a favorable moment, when the</a>
<a id='line_546'>      king, oppressed with wine, had retired from the table to his</a>
<a id='line_547'>      afternoon slumbers. His faithless spouse was anxious for his</a>
<a id='line_548'>      health and repose: the gates of the palace were shut, the arms</a>
<a id='line_549'>      removed, the attendants dismissed, and Rosamond, after lulling</a>
<a id='line_550'>      him to rest by her tender caresses, unbolted the chamber door,</a>
<a id='line_551'>      and urged the reluctant conspirators to the instant execution of</a>
<a id='line_552'>      the deed. On the first alarm, the warrior started from his couch:</a>
<a id='line_553'>      his sword, which he attempted to draw, had been fastened to the</a>
<a id='line_554'>      scabbard by the hand of Rosamond; and a small stool, his only</a>
<a id='line_555'>      weapon, could not long protect him from the spears of the</a>
<a id='line_556'>      assassins. The daughter of Cunimund smiled in his fall: his body</a>
<a id='line_557'>      was buried under the staircase of the palace; and the grateful</a>
<a id='line_558'>      posterity of the Lombards revered the tomb and the memory of</a>

<a id='line_574'>      the city and palace of Verona were awed by her power; and a</a>
<a id='line_575'>      faithful band of her native Gepidae was prepared to applaud the</a>

<a id='line_577'>      Lombard chiefs, who fled in the first moments of consternation</a>
<a id='line_578'>      and disorder, had resumed their courage and collected their</a>
<a id='line_579'>      powers; and the nation, instead of submitting to her reign,</a>
<a id='line_580'>      demanded, with unanimous cries, that justice should be executed</a>
<a id='line_581'>      on the guilty spouse and the murderers of their king. She sought</a>
<a id='line_582'>      a refuge among the enemies of her country; and a criminal who</a>
<a id='line_583'>      deserved the abhorrence of mankind was protected by the selfish</a>
<a id='line_584'>      policy of the exarch. With her daughter, the heiress of the</a>
<a id='line_585'>      Lombard throne, her two lovers, her trusty Gepidae, and the</a>
<a id='line_586'>      spoils of the palace of Verona, Rosamond descended the Adige and</a>
<a id='line_587'>      the Po, and was transported by a Greek vessel to the safe harbor</a>
<a id='line_588'>      of Ravenna. Longinus beheld with delight the charms and the</a>
<a id='line_589'>      treasures of the widow of Alboin: her situation and her past</a>
<a id='line_590'>      conduct might justify the most licentious proposals; and she</a>
<a id='line_591'>      readily listened to the passion of a minister, who, even in the</a>
<a id='line_592'>      decline of the empire, was respected as the equal of kings. The</a>
<a id='line_593'>      death of a jealous lover was an easy and grateful sacrifice; and,</a>
<a id='line_594'>      as Helmichis issued from the bath, he received the deadly potion</a>
<a id='line_595'>      from the hand of his mistress. The taste of the liquor, its</a>
<a id='line_596'>      speedy operation, and his experience of the character of</a>
<a id='line_597'>      Rosamond, convinced him that he was poisoned: he pointed his</a>
<a id='line_598'>      dagger to her breast, compelled her to drain the remainder of the</a>
<a id='line_599'>      cup, and expired in a few minutes, with the consolation that she</a>

<a id='line_625'>      When the nephew of Justinian ascended the throne, he proclaimed a</a>
<a id='line_626'>      new aera of happiness and glory. The annals of the second Justin</a>
<a id='line_627'>      23 are marked with disgrace abroad and misery at home. In the</a>
<a id='line_628'>      West, the Roman empire was afflicted by the loss of Italy, the</a>
<a id='line_629'>      desolation of Africa, and the conquests of the Persians.</a>
<a id='line_630'>      Injustice prevailed both in the capital and the provinces: the</a>
<a id='line_631'>      rich trembled for their property, the poor for their safety, the</a>
<a id='line_632'>      ordinary magistrates were ignorant or venal, the occasional</a>

<a id='line_636'>      imputes to the prince all the calamities of his times may be</a>
<a id='line_637'>      countenanced by the historian as a serious truth or a salutary</a>
<a id='line_638'>      prejudice. Yet a candid suspicion will arise, that the sentiments</a>
<a id='line_639'>      of Justin were pure and benevolent, and that he might have filled</a>
<a id='line_640'>      his station without reproach, if the faculties of his mind had</a>
<a id='line_641'>      not been impaired by disease, which deprived the emperor of the</a>
<a id='line_642'>      use of his feet, and confined him to the palace, a stranger to</a>
<a id='line_643'>      the complaints of the people and the vices of the government. The</a>
<a id='line_644'>      tardy knowledge of his own impotence determined him to lay down</a>
<a id='line_645'>      the weight of the diadem; and, in the choice of a worthy</a>
<a id='line_646'>      substitute, he showed some symptoms of a discerning and even</a>
<a id='line_647'>      magnanimous spirit. The only son of Justin and Sophia died in his</a>
<a id='line_648'>      infancy; their daughter Arabia was the wife of Baduarius, 24</a>
<a id='line_649'>      superintendent of the palace, and afterwards commander of the</a>
<a id='line_650'>      Italian armies, who vainly aspired to confirm the rights of</a>
<a id='line_651'>      marriage by those of adoption. While the empire appeared an</a>
<a id='line_652'>      object of desire, Justin was accustomed to behold with jealousy</a>
<a id='line_653'>      and hatred his brothers and cousins, the rivals of his hopes; nor</a>
<a id='line_654'>      could he depend on the gratitude of those who would accept the</a>
<a id='line_655'>      purple as a restitution, rather than a gift. Of these</a>
<a id='line_656'>      competitors, one had been removed by exile, and afterwards by</a>
<a id='line_657'>      death; and the emperor himself had inflicted such cruel insults</a>
<a id='line_658'>      on another, that he must either dread his resentment or despise</a>
<a id='line_659'>      his patience. This domestic animosity was refined into a generous</a>
<a id='line_660'>      resolution of seeking a successor, not in his family, but in the</a>
<a id='line_661'>      republic; and the artful Sophia recommended Tiberius, 25 his</a>
<a id='line_662'>      faithful captain of the guards, whose virtues and fortune the</a>
<a id='line_663'>      emperor might cherish as the fruit of his judicious choice. The</a>
<a id='line_664'>      ceremony of his elevation to the rank of Caesar, or Augustus, was</a>
<a id='line_665'>      performed in the portico of the palace, in the presence of the</a>
<a id='line_666'>      patriarch and the senate. Justin collected the remaining strength</a>
<a id='line_667'>      of his mind and body; but the popular belief that his speech was</a>
<a id='line_668'>      inspired by the Deity betrays a very humble opinion both of the</a>
<a id='line_669'>      man and of the times. 26 “You behold,” said the emperor, “the</a>
<a id='line_670'>      ensigns of supreme power. You are about to receive them, not from</a>
<a id='line_671'>      my hand, but from the hand of God. Honor them, and from them you</a>
<a id='line_672'>      will derive honor. Respect the empress your mother: you are now</a>

<a id='line_674'>      abstain from revenge; avoid those actions by which I have</a>

<a id='line_676'>      than the example, of your predecessor. As a man, I have sinned;</a>
<a id='line_677'>      as a sinner, even in this life, I have been severely punished:</a>
<a id='line_678'>      but these servants, (and he pointed to his ministers,) who have</a>
<a id='line_679'>      abused my confidence, and inflamed my passions, will appear with</a>
<a id='line_680'>      me before the tribunal of Christ. I have been dazzled by the</a>
<a id='line_681'>      splendor of the diadem: be thou wise and modest; remember what</a>
<a id='line_682'>      you have been, remember what you are. You see around us your</a>
<a id='line_683'>      slaves, and your children: with the authority, assume the</a>

<a id='line_686'>      protect the fortunes of the rich, relieve the necessities of the</a>
<a id='line_687'>      poor.” 27 The assembly, in silence and in tears, applauded the</a>
<a id='line_688'>      counsels, and sympathized with the repentance, of their prince</a>
<a id='line_689'>      the patriarch rehearsed the prayers of the church; Tiberius</a>
<a id='line_690'>      received the diadem on his knees; and Justin, who in his</a>
<a id='line_691'>      abdication appeared most worthy to reign, addressed the new</a>
<a id='line_692'>      monarch in the following words: “If you consent, I live; if you</a>
<a id='line_693'>      command, I die: may the God of heaven and earth infuse into your</a>
<a id='line_694'>      heart whatever I have neglected or forgotten.” The four last</a>
<a id='line_695'>      years of the emperor Justin were passed in tranquil obscurity:</a>
<a id='line_696'>      his conscience was no longer tormented by the remembrance of</a>
<a id='line_697'>      those duties which he was incapable of discharging; and his</a>

<a id='line_748'>      adopted son; on solemn occasions he attended and consulted the</a>
<a id='line_749'>      widow of his benefactor; but her ambition disdained the vain</a>
<a id='line_750'>      semblance of royalty, and the respectful appellation of mother</a>
<a id='line_751'>      served to exasperate, rather than appease, the rage of an injured</a>
<a id='line_752'>      woman. While she accepted, and repaid with a courtly smile, the</a>
<a id='line_753'>      fair expressions of regard and confidence, a secret alliance was</a>
<a id='line_754'>      concluded between the dowager empress and her ancient enemies;</a>
<a id='line_755'>      and Justinian, the son of Germanus, was employed as the</a>
<a id='line_756'>      instrument of her revenge. The pride of the reigning house</a>
<a id='line_757'>      supported, with reluctance, the dominion of a stranger: the youth</a>
<a id='line_758'>      was deservedly popular; his name, after the death of Justin, had</a>
<a id='line_759'>      been mentioned by a tumultuous faction; and his own submissive</a>
<a id='line_760'>      offer of his head with a treasure of sixty thousand pounds, might</a>
<a id='line_761'>      be interpreted as an evidence of guilt, or at least of fear.</a>
<a id='line_762'>      Justinian received a free pardon, and the command of the eastern</a>
<a id='line_763'>      army. The Persian monarch fled before his arms; and the</a>
<a id='line_764'>      acclamations which accompanied his triumph declared him worthy of</a>
<a id='line_765'>      the purple. His artful patroness had chosen the month of the</a>
<a id='line_766'>      vintage, while the emperor, in a rural solitude, was permitted to</a>
<a id='line_767'>      enjoy the pleasures of a subject. On the first intelligence of</a>
<a id='line_768'>      her designs, he returned to Constantinople, and the conspiracy</a>
<a id='line_769'>      was suppressed by his presence and firmness. From the pomp and</a>
<a id='line_770'>      honors which she had abused, Sophia was reduced to a modest</a>
<a id='line_771'>      allowance: Tiberius dismissed her train, intercepted her</a>
<a id='line_772'>      correspondence, and committed to a faithful guard the custody of</a>
<a id='line_773'>      her person. But the services of Justinian were not considered by</a>
<a id='line_774'>      that excellent prince as an aggravation of his offences: after a</a>
<a id='line_775'>      mild reproof, his treason and ingratitude were forgiven; and it</a>
<a id='line_776'>      was commonly believed, that the emperor entertained some thoughts</a>
<a id='line_777'>      of contracting a double alliance with the rival of his throne.</a>
<a id='line_778'>      The voice of an angel (such a fable was propagated) might reveal</a>
<a id='line_779'>      to the emperor, that he should always triumph over his domestic</a>
<a id='line_780'>      foes; but Tiberius derived a firmer assurance from the innocence</a>
<a id='line_781'>      and generosity of his own mind.</a>

<a id='line_790'>      With the odious name of Tiberius, he assumed the more popular</a>
<a id='line_791'>      appellation of Constantine, and imitated the purer virtues of the</a>
<a id='line_792'>      Antonines. After recording the vice or folly of so many Roman</a>
<a id='line_793'>      princes, it is pleasing to repose, for a moment, on a character</a>
<a id='line_794'>      conspicuous by the qualities of humanity, justice, temperance,</a>
<a id='line_795'>      and fortitude; to contemplate a sovereign affable in his palace,</a>
<a id='line_796'>      pious in the church, impartial on the seat of judgment, and</a>
<a id='line_797'>      victorious, at least by his generals, in the Persian war. The</a>
<a id='line_798'>      most glorious trophy of his victory consisted in a multitude of</a>
<a id='line_799'>      captives, whom Tiberius entertained, redeemed, and dismissed to</a>
<a id='line_800'>      their native homes with the charitable spirit of a Christian</a>
<a id='line_801'>      hero. The merit or misfortunes of his own subjects had a dearer</a>
<a id='line_802'>      claim to his beneficence, and he measured his bounty not so much</a>
<a id='line_803'>      by their expectations as by his own dignity. This maxim, however</a>
<a id='line_804'>      dangerous in a trustee of the public wealth, was balanced by a</a>
<a id='line_805'>      principle of humanity and justice, which taught him to abhor, as</a>
<a id='line_806'>      of the basest alloy, the gold that was extracted from the tears</a>
<a id='line_807'>      of the people. For their relief, as often as they had suffered by</a>
<a id='line_808'>      natural or hostile calamities, he was impatient to remit the</a>
<a id='line_809'>      arrears of the past, or the demands of future taxes: he sternly</a>
<a id='line_810'>      rejected the servile offerings of his ministers, which were</a>
<a id='line_811'>      compensated by tenfold oppression; and the wise and equitable</a>
<a id='line_812'>      laws of Tiberius excited the praise and regret of succeeding</a>
<a id='line_813'>      times. Constantinople believed that the emperor had discovered a</a>
<a id='line_814'>      treasure: but his genuine treasure consisted in the practice of</a>
<a id='line_815'>      liberal economy, and the contempt of all vain and superfluous</a>
<a id='line_816'>      expense. The Romans of the East would have been happy, if the</a>
<a id='line_817'>      best gift of Heaven, a patriot king, had been confirmed as a</a>
<a id='line_818'>      proper and permanent blessing. But in less than four years after</a>
<a id='line_819'>      the death of Justin, his worthy successor sunk into a mortal</a>
<a id='line_820'>      disease, which left him only sufficient time to restore the</a>
<a id='line_821'>      diadem, according to the tenure by which he held it, to the most</a>
<a id='line_822'>      deserving of his fellow-citizens. He selected Maurice from the</a>
<a id='line_823'>      crowd, a judgment more precious than the purple itself: the</a>
<a id='line_824'>      patriarch and senate were summoned to the bed of the dying</a>
<a id='line_825'>      prince: he bestowed his daughter and the empire; and his last</a>
<a id='line_826'>      advice was solemnly delivered by the voice of the quaestor.</a>
<a id='line_827'>      Tiberius expressed his hope that the virtues of his son and</a>
<a id='line_828'>      successor would erect the noblest mausoleum to his memory. His</a>
<a id='line_829'>      memory was embalmed by the public affliction; but the most</a>
<a id='line_830'>      sincere grief evaporates in the tumult of a new reign, and the</a>
<a id='line_831'>      eyes and acclamations of mankind were speedily directed to the</a>
<a id='line_832'>      rising sun. The emperor Maurice derived his origin from ancient</a>
<a id='line_833'>      Rome; 29 but his immediate parents were settled at Arabissus in</a>
<a id='line_834'>      Cappadocia, and their singular felicity preserved them alive to</a>
<a id='line_835'>      behold and partake the fortune of their august son. The youth of</a>
<a id='line_836'>      Maurice was spent in the profession of arms: Tiberius promoted</a>
<a id='line_837'>      him to the command of a new and favorite legion of twelve</a>
<a id='line_838'>      thousand confederates; his valor and conduct were signalized in</a>
<a id='line_839'>      the Persian war; and he returned to Constantinople to accept, as</a>
<a id='line_840'>      his just reward, the inheritance of the empire. Maurice ascended</a>
<a id='line_841'>      the throne at the mature age of forty-three years; and he reigned</a>
<a id='line_842'>      above twenty years over the East and over himself; 30 expelling</a>
<a id='line_843'>      from his mind the wild democracy of passions, and establishing</a>
<a id='line_844'>      (according to the quaint expression of Evagrius) a perfect</a>
<a id='line_845'>      aristocracy of reason and virtue. Some suspicion will degrade the</a>
<a id='line_846'>      testimony of a subject, though he protests that his secret praise</a>
<a id='line_847'>      should never reach the ear of his sovereign, 31 and some failings</a>
<a id='line_848'>      seem to place the character of Maurice below the purer merit of</a>
<a id='line_849'>      his predecessor. His cold and reserved demeanor might be imputed</a>
<a id='line_850'>      to arrogance; his justice was not always exempt from cruelty, nor</a>
<a id='line_851'>      his clemency from weakness; and his rigid economy too often</a>
<a id='line_852'>      exposed him to the reproach of avarice. But the rational wishes</a>
<a id='line_853'>      of an absolute monarch must tend to the happiness of his people.</a>
<a id='line_854'>      Maurice was endowed with sense and courage to promote that</a>
<a id='line_855'>      happiness, and his administration was directed by the principles</a>
<a id='line_856'>      and example of Tiberius. The pusillanimity of the Greeks had</a>
<a id='line_857'>      introduced so complete a separation between the offices of king</a>
<a id='line_858'>      and of general, that a private soldier, who had deserved and</a>
<a id='line_859'>      obtained the purple, seldom or never appeared at the head of his</a>
<a id='line_860'>      armies. Yet the emperor Maurice enjoyed the glory of restoring</a>
<a id='line_861'>      the Persian monarch to his throne; his lieutenants waged a</a>
<a id='line_862'>      doubtful war against the Avars of the Danube; and he cast an eye</a>
<a id='line_863'>      of pity, of ineffectual pity, on the abject and distressful state</a>

<a id='line_883'>      From Italy the emperors were incessantly tormented by tales of</a>
<a id='line_884'>      misery and demands of succor, which extorted the humiliating</a>
<a id='line_885'>      confession of their own weakness. The expiring dignity of Rome</a>
<a id='line_886'>      was only marked by the freedom and energy of her complaints: “If</a>
<a id='line_887'>      you are incapable,” she said, “of delivering us from the sword of</a>
<a id='line_888'>      the Lombards, save us at least from the calamity of famine.”</a>
<a id='line_889'>      Tiberius forgave the reproach, and relieved the distress: a</a>
<a id='line_890'>      supply of corn was transported from Egypt to the Tyber; and the</a>
<a id='line_891'>      Roman people, invoking the name, not of Camillus, but of St.</a>
<a id='line_892'>      Peter repulsed the Barbarians from their walls. But the relief</a>
<a id='line_893'>      was accidental, the danger was perpetual and pressing; and the</a>
<a id='line_894'>      clergy and senate, collecting the remains of their ancient</a>
<a id='line_895'>      opulence, a sum of three thousand pounds of gold, despatched the</a>
<a id='line_896'>      patrician Pamphronius to lay their gifts and their complaints at</a>
<a id='line_897'>      the foot of the Byzantine throne. The attention of the court, and</a>
<a id='line_898'>      the forces of the East, were diverted by the Persian war: but the</a>
<a id='line_899'>      justice of Tiberius applied the subsidy to the defence of the</a>
<a id='line_900'>      city; and he dismissed the patrician with his best advice, either</a>
<a id='line_901'>      to bribe the Lombard chiefs, or to purchase the aid of the kings</a>
<a id='line_902'>      of France. Notwithstanding this weak invention, Italy was still</a>
<a id='line_903'>      afflicted, Rome was again besieged, and the suburb of Classe,</a>
<a id='line_904'>      only three miles from Ravenna, was pillaged and occupied by the</a>
<a id='line_905'>      troops of a simple duke of Spoleto. Maurice gave audience to a</a>
<a id='line_906'>      second deputation of priests and senators: the duties and the</a>
<a id='line_907'>      menaces of religion were forcibly urged in the letters of the</a>
<a id='line_908'>      Roman pontiff; and his nuncio, the deacon Gregory, was alike</a>
<a id='line_909'>      qualified to solicit the powers either of heaven or of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_910'></a>
<a id='line_911'>      The emperor adopted, with stronger effect, the measures of his</a>
<a id='line_912'>      predecessor: some formidable chiefs were persuaded to embrace the</a>
<a id='line_913'>      friendship of the Romans; and one of them, a mild and faithful</a>
<a id='line_914'>      Barbarian, lived and died in the service of the exarchs: the</a>
<a id='line_915'>      passes of the Alps were delivered to the Franks; and the pope</a>
<a id='line_916'>      encouraged them to violate, without scruple, their oaths and</a>
<a id='line_917'>      engagements to the misbelievers. Childebert, the great-grandson</a>
<a id='line_918'>      of Clovis, was persuaded to invade Italy by the payment of fifty</a>
<a id='line_919'>      thousand pieces; but, as he had viewed with delight some</a>
<a id='line_920'>      Byzantine coin of the weight of one pound of gold, the king of</a>
<a id='line_921'>      Austrasia might stipulate, that the gift should be rendered more</a>
<a id='line_922'>      worthy of his acceptance, by a proper mixture of these</a>
<a id='line_923'>      respectable medals. The dukes of the Lombards had provoked by</a>
<a id='line_924'>      frequent inroads their powerful neighbors of Gaul. As soon as</a>
<a id='line_925'>      they were apprehensive of a just retaliation, they renounced</a>
<a id='line_926'>      their feeble and disorderly independence: the advantages of real</a>
<a id='line_927'>      government, union, secrecy, and vigor, were unanimously</a>
<a id='line_928'>      confessed; and Autharis, the son of Clepho, had already attained</a>
<a id='line_929'>      the strength and reputation of a warrior. Under the standard of</a>
<a id='line_930'>      their new king, the conquerors of Italy withstood three</a>
<a id='line_931'>      successive invasions, one of which was led by Childebert himself,</a>
<a id='line_932'>      the last of the Merovingian race who descended from the Alps. The</a>
<a id='line_933'>      first expedition was defeated by the jealous animosity of the</a>
<a id='line_934'>      Franks and Alemanni. In the second they were vanquished in a</a>
<a id='line_935'>      bloody battle, with more loss and dishonor than they had</a>
<a id='line_936'>      sustained since the foundation of their monarchy. Impatient for</a>
<a id='line_937'>      revenge, they returned a third time with accumulated force, and</a>
<a id='line_938'>      Autharis yielded to the fury of the torrent. The troops and</a>
<a id='line_939'>      treasures of the Lombards were distributed in the walled towns</a>
<a id='line_940'>      between the Alps and the Apennine. A nation, less sensible of</a>
<a id='line_941'>      danger than of fatigue and delay, soon murmured against the folly</a>
<a id='line_942'>      of their twenty commanders; and the hot vapors of an Italian sun</a>
<a id='line_943'>      infected with disease those tramontane bodies which had already</a>
<a id='line_944'>      suffered the vicissitudes of intemperance and famine. The powers</a>
<a id='line_945'>      that were inadequate to the conquest, were more than sufficient</a>
<a id='line_946'>      for the desolation, of the country; nor could the trembling</a>
<a id='line_947'>      natives distinguish between their enemies and their deliverers.</a>
<a id='line_948'>      If the junction of the Merovingian and Imperial forces had been</a>
<a id='line_949'>      effected in the neighborhood of Milan, perhaps they might have</a>

<a id='line_951'>      days the signal of a flaming village, and the arms of the Greeks</a>
<a id='line_952'>      were idly employed in the reduction of Modena and Parma, which</a>
<a id='line_953'>      were torn from them after the retreat of their transalpine</a>
<a id='line_954'>      allies. The victorious Autharis asserted his claim to the</a>
<a id='line_955'>      dominion of Italy. At the foot of the Rhaetian Alps, he subdued</a>
<a id='line_956'>      the resistance, and rifled the hidden treasures, of a sequestered</a>
<a id='line_957'>      island in the Lake of Comum. At the extreme point of the</a>

<a id='line_999'>      the dukes of Naples was circumscribed by the bay and the adjacent</a>
<a id='line_1000'>      isles, by the hostile territory of Capua, and by the Roman colony</a>
<a id='line_1001'>      of Amalphi, 35 whose industrious citizens, by the invention of</a>
<a id='line_1002'>      the mariner’s compass, have unveiled the face of the globe. The</a>
<a id='line_1003'>      three islands of Sardinia, Corsica, and Sicily, still adhered to</a>
<a id='line_1004'>      the empire; and the acquisition of the farther Calabria removed</a>
<a id='line_1005'>      the landmark of Autharis from the shore of Rhegium to the Isthmus</a>
<a id='line_1006'>      of Consentia. In Sardinia, the savage mountaineers preserved the</a>
<a id='line_1007'>      liberty and religion of their ancestors; and the husbandmen of</a>
<a id='line_1008'>      Sicily were chained to their rich and cultivated soil. Rome was</a>
<a id='line_1009'>      oppressed by the iron sceptre of the exarchs, and a Greek,</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      perhaps a eunuch, insulted with impunity the ruins of the</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      Capitol. But Naples soon acquired the privilege of electing her</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      own dukes: 36 the independence of Amalphi was the fruit of</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      commerce; and the voluntary attachment of Venice was finally</a>
<a id='line_1014'>      ennobled by an equal alliance with the Eastern empire. On the map</a>
<a id='line_1015'>      of Italy, the measure of the exarchate occupies a very inadequate</a>
<a id='line_1016'>      space, but it included an ample proportion of wealth, industry,</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      and population. The most faithful and valuable subjects escaped</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      from the Barbarian yoke; and the banners of Pavia and Verona, of</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      Milan and Padua, were displayed in their respective quarters by</a>
<a id='line_1020'>      the new inhabitants of Ravenna. The remainder of Italy was</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      possessed by the Lombards; and from Pavia, the royal seat, their</a>
<a id='line_1022'>      kingdom was extended to the east, the north, and the west, as far</a>

<a id='line_1029'>      and at length the princes, of Beneventum, survived the monarchy,</a>

<a id='line_1058'>      Lombards of Italy, and the Visigoths of Spain, were less numerous</a>
<a id='line_1059'>      than the Franks or Burgundians; and the conquerors of Gaul must</a>
<a id='line_1060'>      yield, in their turn, to the multitude of Saxons and Angles who</a>
<a id='line_1061'>      almost eradicated the idioms of Britain. The modern Italian has</a>
<a id='line_1062'>      been insensibly formed by the mixture of nations: the awkwardness</a>
<a id='line_1063'>      of the Barbarians in the nice management of declensions and</a>
<a id='line_1064'>      conjugations reduced them to the use of articles and auxiliary</a>
<a id='line_1065'>      verbs; and many new ideas have been expressed by Teutonic</a>
<a id='line_1066'>      appellations. Yet the principal stock of technical and familiar</a>
<a id='line_1067'>      words is found to be of Latin derivation; 38 and, if we were</a>
<a id='line_1068'>      sufficiently conversant with the obsolete, the rustic, and the</a>
<a id='line_1069'>      municipal dialects of ancient Italy, we should trace the origin</a>
<a id='line_1070'>      of many terms which might, perhaps, be rejected by the classic</a>
<a id='line_1071'>      purity of Rome. A numerous army constitutes but a small nation,</a>
<a id='line_1072'>      and the powers of the Lombards were soon diminished by the</a>
<a id='line_1073'>      retreat of twenty thousand Saxons, who scorned a dependent</a>
<a id='line_1074'>      situation, and returned, after many bold and perilous adventures,</a>
<a id='line_1075'>      to their native country. 39 The camp of Alboin was of formidable</a>
<a id='line_1076'>      extent, but the extent of a camp would be easily circumscribed</a>
<a id='line_1077'>      within the limits of a city; and its martial inhabitants must be</a>
<a id='line_1078'>      thinly scattered over the face of a large country. When Alboin</a>
<a id='line_1079'>      descended from the Alps, he invested his nephew, the first duke</a>
<a id='line_1080'>      of Friuli, with the command of the province and the people: but</a>
<a id='line_1081'>      the prudent Gisulf would have declined the dangerous office,</a>
<a id='line_1082'>      unless he had been permitted to choose, among the nobles of the</a>
<a id='line_1083'>      Lombards, a sufficient number of families 40 to form a perpetual</a>
<a id='line_1084'>      colony of soldiers and subjects. In the progress of conquest, the</a>
<a id='line_1085'>      same option could not be granted to the dukes of Brescia or</a>
<a id='line_1086'>      Bergamo, or Pavia or Turin, of Spoleto or Beneventum; but each of</a>
<a id='line_1087'>      these, and each of their colleagues, settled in his appointed</a>
<a id='line_1088'>      district with a band of followers who resorted to his standard in</a>
<a id='line_1089'>      war and his tribunal in peace. Their attachment was free and</a>
<a id='line_1090'>      honorable: resigning the gifts and benefits which they had</a>
<a id='line_1091'>      accepted, they might emigrate with their families into the</a>
<a id='line_1092'>      jurisdiction of another duke; but their absence from the kingdom</a>
<a id='line_1093'>      was punished with death, as a crime of military desertion. 41 The</a>
<a id='line_1094'>      posterity of the first conquerors struck a deeper root into the</a>
<a id='line_1095'>      soil, which, by every motive of interest and honor, they were</a>
<a id='line_1096'>      bound to defend. A Lombard was born the soldier of his king and</a>
<a id='line_1097'>      his duke; and the civil assemblies of the nation displayed the</a>
<a id='line_1098'>      banners, and assumed the appellation, of a regular army. Of this</a>
<a id='line_1099'>      army, the pay and the rewards were drawn from the conquered</a>
<a id='line_1100'>      provinces; and the distribution, which was not effected till</a>
<a id='line_1101'>      after the death of Alboin, is disgraced by the foul marks of</a>
<a id='line_1102'>      injustice and rapine. Many of the most wealthy Italians were</a>
<a id='line_1103'>      slain or banished; the remainder were divided among the</a>
<a id='line_1104'>      strangers, and a tributary obligation was imposed (under the name</a>
<a id='line_1105'>      of hospitality) of paying to the Lombards a third part of the</a>
<a id='line_1106'>      fruits of the earth. Within less than seventy years, this</a>
<a id='line_1107'>      artificial system was abolished by a more simple and solid</a>
<a id='line_1108'>      tenure. 42 Either the Roman landlord was expelled by his strong</a>
<a id='line_1109'>      and insolent guest, or the annual payment, a third of the</a>
<a id='line_1110'>      produce, was exchanged by a more equitable transaction for an</a>
<a id='line_1111'>      adequate proportion of landed property. Under these foreign</a>
<a id='line_1112'>      masters, the business of agriculture, in the cultivation of corn,</a>
<a id='line_1113'>      wines, and olives, was exercised with degenerate skill and</a>
<a id='line_1114'>      industry by the labor of the slaves and natives. But the</a>
<a id='line_1115'>      occupations of a pastoral life were more pleasing to the idleness</a>
<a id='line_1116'>      of the Barbarian. In the rich meadows of Venetia, they restored</a>
<a id='line_1117'>      and improved the breed of horses, for which that province had</a>
<a id='line_1118'>      once been illustrious; 43 and the Italians beheld with</a>
<a id='line_1119'>      astonishment a foreign race of oxen or buffaloes. 44 The</a>
<a id='line_1120'>      depopulation of Lombardy, and the increase of forests, afforded</a>

<a id='line_1240'>      but that he alone was the friend of Autharis, who had trusted him</a>
<a id='line_1241'>      with the delicate commission of making a faithful report of the</a>
<a id='line_1242'>      charms of his spouse. Theudelinda was summoned to undergo this</a>
<a id='line_1243'>      important examination; and, after a pause of silent rapture, he</a>
<a id='line_1244'>      hailed her as the queen of Italy, and humbly requested that,</a>
<a id='line_1245'>      according to the custom of the nation, she would present a cup of</a>
<a id='line_1246'>      wine to the first of her new subjects. By the command of her</a>
<a id='line_1247'>      father she obeyed: Autharis received the cup in his turn, and, in</a>
<a id='line_1248'>      restoring it to the princess, he secretly touched her hand, and</a>
<a id='line_1249'>      drew his own finger over his face and lips. In the evening,</a>
<a id='line_1250'>      Theudelinda imparted to her nurse the indiscreet familiarity of</a>
<a id='line_1251'>      the stranger, and was comforted by the assurance, that such</a>
<a id='line_1252'>      boldness could proceed only from the king her husband, who, by</a>
<a id='line_1253'>      his beauty and courage, appeared worthy of her love. The</a>
<a id='line_1254'>      ambassadors were dismissed: no sooner did they reach the confines</a>
<a id='line_1255'>      of Italy than Autharis, raising himself on his horse, darted his</a>
<a id='line_1256'>      battle-axe against a tree with incomparable strength and</a>
<a id='line_1257'>      dexterity. “Such,” said he to the astonished Bavarians, “such are</a>
<a id='line_1258'>      the strokes of the king of the Lombards.” On the approach of a</a>
<a id='line_1259'>      French army, Garribald and his daughter took refuge in the</a>
<a id='line_1260'>      dominions of their ally; and the marriage was consummated in the</a>
<a id='line_1261'>      palace of Verona. At the end of one year, it was dissolved by the</a>
<a id='line_1262'>      death of Autharis: but the virtues of Theudelinda 51 had endeared</a>

<a id='line_1287'>      The public revenue arose from the produce of land and the profits</a>

<a id='line_1290'>      office with a fair moiety of their respective domains. The</a>

<a id='line_1294'>      the injuries of war by the rich foundation of monasteries and</a>
<a id='line_1295'>      churches. In peace a judge, a leader in war, he never usurped the</a>
<a id='line_1296'>      powers of a sole and absolute legislator. The king of Italy</a>
<a id='line_1297'>      convened the national assemblies in the palace, or more probably</a>
<a id='line_1298'>      in the fields, of Pavia: his great council was composed of the</a>

<a id='line_1301'>      the approbation of the faithful people, the fortunate army of the</a>
<a id='line_1302'>      Lombards. About fourscore years after the conquest of Italy,</a>
<a id='line_1303'>      their traditional customs were transcribed in Teutonic Latin, 53</a>
<a id='line_1304'>      and ratified by the consent of the prince and people: some new</a>
<a id='line_1305'>      regulations were introduced, more suitable to their present</a>
<a id='line_1306'>      condition; the example of Rotharis was imitated by the wisest of</a>
<a id='line_1307'>      his successors; and the laws of the Lombards have been esteemed</a>
<a id='line_1308'>      the least imperfect of the Barbaric codes. 54 Secure by their</a>
<a id='line_1309'>      courage in the possession of liberty, these rude and hasty</a>
<a id='line_1310'>      legislators were incapable of balancing the powers of the</a>
<a id='line_1311'>      constitution, or of discussing the nice theory of political</a>
<a id='line_1312'>      government. Such crimes as threatened the life of the sovereign,</a>
<a id='line_1313'>      or the safety of the state, were adjudged worthy of death; but</a>
<a id='line_1314'>      their attention was principally confined to the defence of the</a>
<a id='line_1315'>      person and property of the subject. According to the strange</a>
<a id='line_1316'>      jurisprudence of the times, the guilt of blood might be redeemed</a>
<a id='line_1317'>      by a fine; yet the high price of nine hundred pieces of gold</a>
<a id='line_1318'>      declares a just sense of the value of a simple citizen. Less</a>
<a id='line_1319'>      atrocious injuries, a wound, a fracture, a blow, an opprobrious</a>
<a id='line_1320'>      word, were measured with scrupulous and almost ridiculous</a>
<a id='line_1321'>      diligence; and the prudence of the legislator encouraged the</a>
<a id='line_1322'>      ignoble practice of bartering honor and revenge for a pecuniary</a>
<a id='line_1323'>      compensation. The ignorance of the Lombards in the state of</a>
<a id='line_1324'>      Paganism or Christianity gave implicit credit to the malice and</a>
<a id='line_1325'>      mischief of witchcraft, but the judges of the seventeenth century</a>
<a id='line_1326'>      might have been instructed and confounded by the wisdom of</a>
<a id='line_1327'>      Rotharis, who derides the absurd superstition, and protects the</a>
<a id='line_1328'>      wretched victims of popular or judicial cruelty. 55 The same</a>

<a id='line_1382'>      leaves and branches, and the sapless trunk was left to wither on</a>

<a id='line_1385'>      hostile approach of the Lombards was often felt, and continually</a>

<a id='line_1394'>      pleasures and interrupt the labors of a rural life; and the</a>
<a id='line_1395'>      Campagna of Rome was speedily reduced to the state of a dreary</a>

<a id='line_1397'>      and the air is infectious. Curiosity and ambition no longer</a>
<a id='line_1398'>      attracted the nations to the capital of the world: but, if chance</a>

<a id='line_1406'>      fourscore persons expired in an hour in the midst of a solemn</a>
<a id='line_1407'>      procession, which implored the mercy of Heaven. 59 A society in</a>

<a id='line_1409'>      the accidental losses of pestilence and war: but, as the far</a>
<a id='line_1410'>      greater part of the Romans was condemned to hopeless indigence</a>
<a id='line_1411'>      and celibacy, the depopulation was constant and visible, and the</a>
<a id='line_1412'>      gloomy enthusiasts might expect the approaching failure of the</a>
<a id='line_1413'>      human race. 60 Yet the number of citizens still exceeded the</a>
<a id='line_1414'>      measure of subsistence: their precarious food was supplied from</a>

<a id='line_1482'>      presumed to disturb the repose of the sanctuary, were affrighted</a>
<a id='line_1483'>      by visions, or punished with sudden death. The unreasonable</a>
<a id='line_1484'>      request of an empress, who wished to deprive the Romans of their</a>
<a id='line_1485'>      sacred treasure, the head of St. Paul, was rejected with the</a>
<a id='line_1486'>      deepest abhorrence; and the pope asserted, most probably with</a>
<a id='line_1487'>      truth, that a linen which had been sanctified in the neighborhood</a>
<a id='line_1488'>      of his body, or the filings of his chain, which it was sometimes</a>
<a id='line_1489'>      easy and sometimes impossible to obtain, possessed an equal</a>
<a id='line_1490'>      degree of miraculous virtue. 63 But the power as well as virtue</a>
<a id='line_1491'>      of the apostles resided with living energy in the breast of their</a>
<a id='line_1492'>      successors; and the chair of St. Peter was filled under the reign</a>
<a id='line_1493'>      of Maurice by the first and greatest of the name of Gregory. 64</a>
<a id='line_1494'>      His grandfather Felix had himself been pope, and as the bishops</a>
<a id='line_1495'>      were already bound by the laws of celibacy, his consecration must</a>
<a id='line_1496'>      have been preceded by the death of his wife. The parents of</a>
<a id='line_1497'>      Gregory, Sylvia, and Gordian, were the noblest of the senate, and</a>
<a id='line_1498'>      the most pious of the church of Rome; his female relations were</a>
<a id='line_1499'>      numbered among the saints and virgins; and his own figure, with</a>
<a id='line_1500'>      those of his father and mother, were represented near three</a>
<a id='line_1501'>      hundred years in a family portrait, 65 which he offered to the</a>
<a id='line_1502'>      monastery of St. Andrew. The design and coloring of this picture</a>
<a id='line_1503'>      afford an honorable testimony that the art of painting was</a>
<a id='line_1504'>      cultivated by the Italians of the sixth century; but the most</a>
<a id='line_1505'>      abject ideas must be entertained of their taste and learning,</a>
<a id='line_1506'>      since the epistles of Gregory, his sermons, and his dialogues,</a>
<a id='line_1507'>      are the work of a man who was second in erudition to none of his</a>
<a id='line_1508'>      contemporaries: 66 his birth and abilities had raised him to the</a>
<a id='line_1509'>      office of praefect of the city, and he enjoyed the merit of</a>
<a id='line_1510'>      renouncing the pomps and vanities of this world. His ample</a>
<a id='line_1511'>      patrimony was dedicated to the foundation of seven monasteries,</a>
<a id='line_1512'>      67 one in Rome, 68 and six in Sicily; and it was the wish of</a>
<a id='line_1513'>      Gregory that he might be unknown in this life, and glorious only</a>
<a id='line_1514'>      in the next. Yet his devotion (and it might be sincere) pursued</a>
<a id='line_1515'>      the path which would have been chosen by a crafty and ambitious</a>
<a id='line_1516'>      statesman. The talents of Gregory, and the splendor which</a>
<a id='line_1517'>      accompanied his retreat, rendered him dear and useful to the</a>
<a id='line_1518'>      church; and implicit obedience has always been inculcated as the</a>
<a id='line_1519'>      first duty of a monk. As soon as he had received the character of</a>
<a id='line_1520'>      deacon, Gregory was sent to reside at the Byzantine court, the</a>
<a id='line_1521'>      nuncio or minister of the apostolic see; and he boldly assumed,</a>
<a id='line_1522'>      in the name of St. Peter, a tone of independent dignity, which</a>
<a id='line_1523'>      would have been criminal and dangerous in the most illustrious</a>
<a id='line_1524'>      layman of the empire. He returned to Rome with a just increase of</a>
<a id='line_1525'>      reputation, and, after a short exercise of the monastic virtues,</a>
<a id='line_1526'>      he was dragged from the cloister to the papal throne, by the</a>
<a id='line_1527'>      unanimous voice of the clergy, the senate, and the people. He</a>
<a id='line_1528'>      alone resisted, or seemed to resist, his own elevation; and his</a>
<a id='line_1529'>      humble petition, that Maurice would be pleased to reject the</a>
<a id='line_1530'>      choice of the Romans, could only serve to exalt his character in</a>
<a id='line_1531'>      the eyes of the emperor and the public. When the fatal mandate</a>
<a id='line_1532'>      was proclaimed, Gregory solicited the aid of some friendly</a>
<a id='line_1533'>      merchants to convey him in a basket beyond the gates of Rome, and</a>
<a id='line_1534'>      modestly concealed himself some days among the woods and</a>

<a id='line_1598'>      his station and to the temper of the times. In his rival, the</a>

<a id='line_1600'>      title of universal bishop, which the successor of St. Peter was</a>
<a id='line_1601'>      too haughty to concede, and too feeble to assume; and the</a>

<a id='line_1603'>      character of Bishop of Rome, Primate of Italy, and Apostle of the</a>
<a id='line_1604'>      West. He frequently ascended the pulpit, and kindled, by his</a>
<a id='line_1605'>      rude, though pathetic, eloquence, the congenial passions of his</a>
<a id='line_1606'>      audience: the language of the Jewish prophets was interpreted and</a>

<a id='line_1608'>      calamities, were directed to the hopes and fears of the invisible</a>
<a id='line_1609'>      world. His precepts and example defined the model of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1610'>      liturgy; 69 the distribution of the parishes, the calendar of the</a>
<a id='line_1611'>      festivals, the order of processions, the service of the priests</a>
<a id='line_1612'>      and deacons, the variety and change of sacerdotal garments. Till</a>
<a id='line_1613'>      the last days of his life, he officiated in the canon of the</a>

<a id='line_1615'>      has preserved the vocal and instrumental music of the theatre,</a>
<a id='line_1616'>      and the rough voices of the Barbarians attempted to imitate the</a>
<a id='line_1617'>      melody of the Roman school. 71 Experience had shown him the</a>
<a id='line_1618'>      efficacy of these solemn and pompous rites, to soothe the</a>
<a id='line_1619'>      distress, to confirm the faith, to mitigate the fierceness, and</a>
<a id='line_1620'>      to dispel the dark enthusiasm of the vulgar, and he readily</a>
<a id='line_1621'>      forgave their tendency to promote the reign of priesthood and</a>
<a id='line_1622'>      superstition. The bishops of Italy and the adjacent islands</a>
<a id='line_1623'>      acknowledged the Roman pontiff as their special metropolitan.</a>
<a id='line_1624'>      Even the existence, the union, or the translation of episcopal</a>
<a id='line_1625'>      seats was decided by his absolute discretion: and his successful</a>

<a id='line_1627'>      might countenance the more lofty pretensions of succeeding popes.</a>
<a id='line_1628'>      He interposed to prevent the abuses of popular elections; his</a>
<a id='line_1629'>      jealous care maintained the purity of faith and discipline; and</a>
<a id='line_1630'>      the apostolic shepherd assiduously watched over the faith and</a>
<a id='line_1631'>      discipline of the subordinate pastors. Under his reign, the</a>
<a id='line_1632'>      Arians of Italy and Spain were reconciled to the Catholic church,</a>
<a id='line_1633'>      and the conquest of Britain reflects less glory on the name of</a>
<a id='line_1634'>      Caesar, than on that of Gregory the First. Instead of six</a>
<a id='line_1635'>      legions, forty monks were embarked for that distant island, and</a>
<a id='line_1636'>      the pontiff lamented the austere duties which forbade him to</a>
<a id='line_1637'>      partake the perils of their spiritual warfare. In less than two</a>
<a id='line_1638'>      years, he could announce to the archbishop of Alexandria, that</a>
<a id='line_1639'>      they had baptized the king of Kent with ten thousand of his</a>
<a id='line_1640'>      Anglo-Saxons, and that the Roman missionaries, like those of the</a>
<a id='line_1641'>      primitive church, were armed only with spiritual and supernatural</a>
<a id='line_1642'>      powers. The credulity or the prudence of Gregory was always</a>

<a id='line_1644'>      ghosts, miracles, and resurrections; 72 and posterity has paid to</a>

<a id='line_1722'>      be styled the Father of his Country; and such was the extreme</a>
<a id='line_1723'>      sensibility of his conscience, that, for the death of a beggar</a>
<a id='line_1724'>      who had perished in the streets, he interdicted himself during</a>
<a id='line_1725'>      several days from the exercise of sacerdotal functions. II. The</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      misfortunes of Rome involved the apostolical pastor in the</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      business of peace and war; and it might be doubtful to himself,</a>
<a id='line_1728'>      whether piety or ambition prompted him to supply the place of his</a>
<a id='line_1729'>      absent sovereign. Gregory awakened the emperor from a long</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      slumber; exposed the guilt or incapacity of the exarch and his</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      inferior ministers; complained that the veterans were withdrawn</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      from Rome for the defence of Spoleto; encouraged the Italians to</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      guard their cities and altars; and condescended, in the crisis of</a>
<a id='line_1734'>      danger, to name the tribunes, and to direct the operations, of</a>
<a id='line_1735'>      the provincial troops. But the martial spirit of the pope was</a>
<a id='line_1736'>      checked by the scruples of humanity and religion: the imposition</a>
<a id='line_1737'>      of tribute, though it was employed in the Italian war, he freely</a>
<a id='line_1738'>      condemned as odious and oppressive; whilst he protected, against</a>
<a id='line_1739'>      the Imperial edicts, the pious cowardice of the soldiers who</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      deserted a military for a monastic life. If we may credit his own</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      declarations, it would have been easy for Gregory to exterminate</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      the Lombards by their domestic factions, without leaving a king,</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      a duke, or a count, to save that unfortunate nation from the</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      vengeance of their foes. As a Christian bishop, he preferred the</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      salutary offices of peace; his mediation appeased the tumult of</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      arms: but he was too conscious of the arts of the Greeks, and the</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      passions of the Lombards, to engage his sacred promise for the</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      observance of the truce. Disappointed in the hope of a general</a>
<a id='line_1749'>      and lasting treaty, he presumed to save his country without the</a>
<a id='line_1750'>      consent of the emperor or the exarch. The sword of the enemy was</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      suspended over Rome; it was averted by the mild eloquence and</a>
<a id='line_1752'>      seasonable gifts of the pontiff, who commanded the respect of</a>
<a id='line_1753'>      heretics and Barbarians. The merits of Gregory were treated by</a>
<a id='line_1754'>      the Byzantine court with reproach and insult; but in the</a>
<a id='line_1755'>      attachment of a grateful people, he found the purest reward of a</a>
<a id='line_1756'>      citizen, and the best right of a sovereign. 75</a>
