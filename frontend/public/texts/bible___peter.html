                    <a id='line_0'>The First Epistle General of Peter</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered</a>
<a id='line_4'>throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 1:2 Elect</a>
<a id='line_5'>according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through</a>
<a id='line_6'>sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the</a>
<a id='line_7'>blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which</a>
<a id='line_10'>according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively</a>
<a id='line_11'>hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 1:4 To an</a>
<a id='line_12'>inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away,</a>
<a id='line_13'>reserved in heaven for you, 1:5 Who are kept by the power of God</a>
<a id='line_14'>through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</a>
<a id='line_15'></a>
<a id='line_16'>1:6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be,</a>
<a id='line_17'>ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: 1:7 That the trial</a>
<a id='line_18'>of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth,</a>
<a id='line_19'>though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour</a>
<a id='line_20'>and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: 1:8 Whom having not seen,</a>
<a id='line_21'>ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice</a>
<a id='line_22'>with joy unspeakable and full of glory: 1:9 Receiving the end of your</a>
<a id='line_23'>faith, even the salvation of your souls.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'>1:10 Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched</a>
<a id='line_26'>diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:</a>
<a id='line_27'>1:11 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which</a>
<a id='line_28'>was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings</a>
<a id='line_29'>of Christ, and the glory that should follow.</a>
<a id='line_30'></a>
<a id='line_31'>1:12 Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us</a>
<a id='line_32'>they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them</a>
<a id='line_33'>that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down</a>
<a id='line_34'>from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.</a>
<a id='line_35'></a>
<a id='line_36'>1:13 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to</a>
<a id='line_37'>the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation</a>
<a id='line_38'>of Jesus Christ; 1:14 As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves</a>
<a id='line_39'>according to the former lusts in your ignorance: 1:15 But as he which</a>
<a id='line_40'>hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;</a>
<a id='line_41'>1:16 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>1:17 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons</a>
<a id='line_44'>judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your</a>
<a id='line_45'>sojourning here in fear: 1:18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not</a>
<a id='line_46'>redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain</a>
<a id='line_47'>conversation received by tradition from your fathers; 1:19 But with</a>
<a id='line_48'>the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without</a>
<a id='line_49'>spot: 1:20 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the</a>
<a id='line_50'>world, but was manifest in these last times for you, 1:21 Who by him</a>
<a id='line_51'>do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him</a>
<a id='line_52'>glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.</a>
<a id='line_53'></a>
<a id='line_54'>1:22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through</a>
<a id='line_55'>the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one</a>
<a id='line_56'>another with a pure heart fervently: 1:23 Being born again, not of</a>
<a id='line_57'>corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which</a>
<a id='line_58'>liveth and abideth for ever.</a>
<a id='line_59'></a>
<a id='line_60'>1:24 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower</a>
<a id='line_61'>of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:</a>
<a id='line_62'>1:25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word</a>
<a id='line_63'>which by the gospel is preached unto you.</a>
<a id='line_64'></a>
<a id='line_65'>2:1 Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies,</a>
<a id='line_66'>and envies, all evil speakings, 2:2 As newborn babes, desire the</a>
<a id='line_67'>sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: 2:3 If so be ye</a>
<a id='line_68'>have tasted that the Lord is gracious.</a>
<a id='line_69'></a>
<a id='line_70'>2:4 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men,</a>
<a id='line_71'>but chosen of God, and precious, 2:5 Ye also, as lively stones, are</a>
<a id='line_72'>built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual</a>
<a id='line_73'>sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_74'></a>
<a id='line_75'>2:6 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in</a>
<a id='line_76'>Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on</a>
<a id='line_77'>him shall not be confounded.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>2:7 Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them</a>
<a id='line_80'>which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the</a>
<a id='line_81'>same is made the head of the corner, 2:8 And a stone of stumbling, and</a>
<a id='line_82'>a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being</a>
<a id='line_83'>disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</a>
<a id='line_84'></a>
<a id='line_85'>2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy</a>
<a id='line_86'>nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of</a>
<a id='line_87'>him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;</a>
<a id='line_88'>2:10 Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of</a>
<a id='line_89'>God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</a>
<a id='line_90'></a>
<a id='line_91'>2:11 Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain</a>
<a id='line_92'>from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; 2:12 Having your</a>
<a id='line_93'>conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak</a>
<a id='line_94'>against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they</a>
<a id='line_95'>shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</a>
<a id='line_96'></a>
<a id='line_97'>2:13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake:</a>
<a id='line_98'>whether it be to the king, as supreme; 2:14 Or unto governors, as unto</a>
<a id='line_99'>them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the</a>
<a id='line_100'>praise of them that do well.</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>2:15 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to</a>
<a id='line_103'>silence the ignorance of foolish men: 2:16 As free, and not using your</a>
<a id='line_104'>liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>2:17 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'>2:18 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to</a>
<a id='line_109'>the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</a>
<a id='line_110'></a>
<a id='line_111'>2:19 For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God</a>
<a id='line_112'>endure grief, suffering wrongfully.</a>
<a id='line_113'></a>
<a id='line_114'>2:20 For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye</a>
<a id='line_115'>shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it,</a>
<a id='line_116'>ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</a>
<a id='line_117'></a>
<a id='line_118'>2:21 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered</a>
<a id='line_119'>for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: 2:22</a>
<a id='line_120'>Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: 2:23 Who, when</a>
<a id='line_121'>he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened</a>
<a id='line_122'>not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: 2:24 Who</a>
<a id='line_123'>his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being</a>
<a id='line_124'>dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were</a>
<a id='line_125'>healed.</a>
<a id='line_126'></a>
<a id='line_127'>2:25 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the</a>
<a id='line_128'>Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</a>
<a id='line_129'></a>
<a id='line_130'>3:1 Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that,</a>
<a id='line_131'>if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the</a>
<a id='line_132'>conversation of the wives; 3:2 While they behold your chaste</a>
<a id='line_133'>conversation coupled with fear.</a>
<a id='line_134'></a>
<a id='line_135'>3:3 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the</a>
<a id='line_136'>hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; 3:4 But let</a>
<a id='line_137'>it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible,</a>
<a id='line_138'>even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of</a>
<a id='line_139'>God of great price.</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>3:5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who</a>
<a id='line_142'>trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own</a>
<a id='line_143'>husbands: 3:6 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose</a>
<a id='line_144'>daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any</a>
<a id='line_145'>amazement.</a>
<a id='line_146'></a>
<a id='line_147'>3:7 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge,</a>
<a id='line_148'>giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being</a>
<a id='line_149'>heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not</a>
<a id='line_150'>hindered.</a>
<a id='line_151'></a>
<a id='line_152'>3:8 Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another,</a>
<a id='line_153'>love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: 3:9 Not rendering evil for</a>
<a id='line_154'>evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that</a>
<a id='line_155'>ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>3:10 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain</a>
<a id='line_158'>his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: 3:11 Let</a>
<a id='line_159'>him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.</a>
<a id='line_160'></a>
<a id='line_161'>3:12 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are</a>
<a id='line_162'>open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that</a>
<a id='line_163'>do evil.</a>
<a id='line_164'></a>
<a id='line_165'>3:13 And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that</a>
<a id='line_166'>which is good?  3:14 But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake,</a>
<a id='line_167'>happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;</a>
<a id='line_168'>3:15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to</a>
<a id='line_169'>give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that</a>
<a id='line_170'>is in you with meekness and fear: 3:16 Having a good conscience; that,</a>
<a id='line_171'>whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed</a>
<a id='line_172'>that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.</a>
<a id='line_173'></a>
<a id='line_174'>3:17 For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for</a>
<a id='line_175'>well doing, than for evil doing.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>3:18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the</a>
<a id='line_178'>unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the</a>
<a id='line_179'>flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: 3:19 By which also he went and</a>
<a id='line_180'>preached unto the spirits in prison; 3:20 Which sometime were</a>
<a id='line_181'>disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of</a>
<a id='line_182'>Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls</a>
<a id='line_183'>were saved by water.</a>
<a id='line_184'></a>
<a id='line_185'>3:21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not</a>
<a id='line_186'>the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good</a>
<a id='line_187'>conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ: 3:22 Who</a>
<a id='line_188'>is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and</a>
<a id='line_189'>authorities and powers being made subject unto him.</a>
<a id='line_190'></a>
<a id='line_191'>4:1 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm</a>
<a id='line_192'>yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in</a>
<a id='line_193'>the flesh hath ceased from sin; 4:2 That he no longer should live the</a>
<a id='line_194'>rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of</a>
<a id='line_195'>God.</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>4:3 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the</a>
<a id='line_198'>will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess</a>
<a id='line_199'>of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries: 4:4</a>
<a id='line_200'>Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same</a>
<a id='line_201'>excess of riot, speaking evil of you: 4:5 Who shall give account to</a>
<a id='line_202'>him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</a>
<a id='line_203'></a>
<a id='line_204'>4:6 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are</a>
<a id='line_205'>dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but</a>
<a id='line_206'>live according to God in the spirit.</a>
<a id='line_207'></a>
<a id='line_208'>4:7 But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and</a>
<a id='line_209'>watch unto prayer.</a>
<a id='line_210'></a>
<a id='line_211'>4:8 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for</a>
<a id='line_212'>charity shall cover the multitude of sins.</a>
<a id='line_213'></a>
<a id='line_214'>4:9 Use hospitality one to another without grudging.</a>
<a id='line_215'></a>
<a id='line_216'>4:10 As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same</a>
<a id='line_217'>one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</a>
<a id='line_218'></a>
<a id='line_219'>4:11 If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man</a>
<a id='line_220'>minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God</a>
<a id='line_221'>in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise</a>
<a id='line_222'>and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>4:12 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is</a>
<a id='line_225'>to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: 4:13 But</a>
<a id='line_226'>rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that,</a>
<a id='line_227'>when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding</a>
<a id='line_228'>joy.</a>
<a id='line_229'></a>
<a id='line_230'>4:14 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the</a>
<a id='line_231'>spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil</a>
<a id='line_232'>spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.</a>
<a id='line_233'></a>
<a id='line_234'>4:15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an</a>
<a id='line_235'>evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>4:16 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but</a>
<a id='line_238'>let him glorify God on this behalf.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>4:17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of</a>
<a id='line_241'>God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that</a>
<a id='line_242'>obey not the gospel of God?  4:18 And if the righteous scarcely be</a>
<a id='line_243'>saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?  4:19 Wherefore</a>
<a id='line_244'>let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping</a>
<a id='line_245'>of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'>5:1 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and</a>
<a id='line_248'>a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the</a>
<a id='line_249'>glory that shall be revealed: 5:2 Feed the flock of God which is among</a>
<a id='line_250'>you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly;</a>
<a id='line_251'>not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; 5:3 Neither as being lords</a>
<a id='line_252'>over God’s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</a>
<a id='line_253'></a>
<a id='line_254'>5:4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown</a>
<a id='line_255'>of glory that fadeth not away.</a>
<a id='line_256'></a>
<a id='line_257'>5:5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all</a>
<a id='line_258'>of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for</a>
<a id='line_259'>God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</a>
<a id='line_260'></a>
<a id='line_261'>5:6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he</a>
<a id='line_262'>may exalt you in due time: 5:7 Casting all your care upon him; for he</a>
<a id='line_263'>careth for you.</a>
<a id='line_264'></a>
<a id='line_265'>5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a</a>
<a id='line_266'>roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: 5:9 Whom</a>
<a id='line_267'>resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are</a>
<a id='line_268'>accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</a>
<a id='line_269'></a>
<a id='line_270'>5:10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal</a>
<a id='line_271'>glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you</a>
<a id='line_272'>perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.</a>
<a id='line_273'></a>
<a id='line_274'>5:11 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_275'></a>
<a id='line_276'>5:12 By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have</a>
<a id='line_277'>written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace</a>
<a id='line_278'>of God wherein ye stand.</a>
<a id='line_279'></a>
<a id='line_280'>5:13 The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you,</a>
<a id='line_281'>saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.</a>
<a id='line_282'></a>
<a id='line_283'>5:14 Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you</a>
<a id='line_284'>all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</a>

<a id='line_288'></a>
<a id='line_289'>The Second General Epistle of Peter</a>
<a id='line_290'></a>
<a id='line_291'></a>
<a id='line_292'>1:1 Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them</a>
<a id='line_293'>that have obtained like precious faith with us through the</a>
<a id='line_294'>righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: 1:2 Grace and peace</a>
<a id='line_295'>be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our</a>
<a id='line_296'>Lord, 1:3 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things</a>
<a id='line_297'>that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him</a>
<a id='line_298'>that hath called us to glory and virtue: 1:4 Whereby are given unto us</a>
<a id='line_299'>exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be</a>
<a id='line_300'>partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is</a>
<a id='line_301'>in the world through lust.</a>
<a id='line_302'></a>
<a id='line_303'>1:5 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue;</a>
<a id='line_304'>and to virtue knowledge; 1:6 And to knowledge temperance; and to</a>
<a id='line_305'>temperance patience; and to patience godliness; 1:7 And to godliness</a>
<a id='line_306'>brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.</a>
<a id='line_307'></a>
<a id='line_308'>1:8 For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye</a>
<a id='line_309'>shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord</a>
<a id='line_310'>Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_311'></a>
<a id='line_312'>1:9 But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar</a>
<a id='line_313'>off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.</a>
<a id='line_314'></a>
<a id='line_315'>1:10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your</a>
<a id='line_316'>calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never</a>
<a id='line_317'>fall: 1:11 For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly</a>
<a id='line_318'>into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_319'></a>
<a id='line_320'>1:12 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in</a>
<a id='line_321'>remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established</a>
<a id='line_322'>in the present truth.</a>
<a id='line_323'></a>
<a id='line_324'>1:13 Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir</a>
<a id='line_325'>you up by putting you in remembrance; 1:14 Knowing that shortly I must</a>
<a id='line_326'>put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed</a>
<a id='line_327'>me.</a>
<a id='line_328'></a>
<a id='line_329'>1:15 Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to</a>
<a id='line_330'>have these things always in remembrance.</a>
<a id='line_331'></a>
<a id='line_332'>1:16 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made</a>
<a id='line_333'>known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were</a>
<a id='line_334'>eyewitnesses of his majesty.</a>
<a id='line_335'></a>
<a id='line_336'>1:17 For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there</a>
<a id='line_337'>came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved</a>
<a id='line_338'>Son, in whom I am well pleased.</a>
<a id='line_339'></a>
<a id='line_340'>1:18 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with</a>
<a id='line_341'>him in the holy mount.</a>
<a id='line_342'></a>
<a id='line_343'>1:19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well</a>
<a id='line_344'>that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until</a>
<a id='line_345'>the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: 1:20 Knowing this</a>
<a id='line_346'>first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private</a>
<a id='line_347'>interpretation.</a>
<a id='line_348'></a>
<a id='line_349'>1:21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but</a>
<a id='line_350'>holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_351'></a>
<a id='line_352'>2:1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there</a>
<a id='line_353'>shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable</a>
<a id='line_354'>heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon</a>
<a id='line_355'>themselves swift destruction.</a>
<a id='line_356'></a>
<a id='line_357'>2:2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the</a>
<a id='line_358'>way of truth shall be evil spoken of.</a>
<a id='line_359'></a>
<a id='line_360'>2:3 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make</a>
<a id='line_361'>merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not,</a>
<a id='line_362'>and their damnation slumbereth not.</a>
<a id='line_363'></a>
<a id='line_364'>2:4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down</a>
<a id='line_365'>to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved</a>
<a id='line_366'>unto judgment; 2:5 And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the</a>
<a id='line_367'>eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon</a>
<a id='line_368'>the world of the ungodly; 2:6 And turning the cities of Sodom and</a>
<a id='line_369'>Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an</a>
<a id='line_370'>ensample unto those that after should live ungodly; 2:7 And delivered</a>
<a id='line_371'>just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: 2:8 (For</a>
<a id='line_372'>that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed</a>
<a id='line_373'>his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;) 2:9 The</a>
<a id='line_374'>Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to</a>
<a id='line_375'>reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: 2:10 But</a>
<a id='line_376'>chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and</a>
<a id='line_377'>despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not</a>
<a id='line_378'>afraid to speak evil of dignities.</a>
<a id='line_379'></a>
<a id='line_380'>2:11 Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not</a>
<a id='line_381'>railing accusation against them before the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_382'></a>
<a id='line_383'>2:12 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and</a>
<a id='line_384'>destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and</a>
<a id='line_385'>shall utterly perish in their own corruption; 2:13 And shall receive</a>
<a id='line_386'>the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot</a>
<a id='line_387'>in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves</a>
<a id='line_388'>with their own deceivings while they feast with you; 2:14 Having eyes</a>
<a id='line_389'>full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable</a>
<a id='line_390'>souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed</a>
<a id='line_391'>children: 2:15 Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray,</a>
<a id='line_392'>following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of</a>
<a id='line_393'>unrighteousness; 2:16 But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass</a>
<a id='line_394'>speaking with man’s voice forbad the madness of the prophet.</a>
<a id='line_395'></a>
<a id='line_396'>2:17 These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a</a>
<a id='line_397'>tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.</a>
<a id='line_398'></a>
<a id='line_399'>2:18 For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure</a>
<a id='line_400'>through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that</a>
<a id='line_401'>were clean escaped from them who live in error.</a>
<a id='line_402'></a>
<a id='line_403'>2:19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants</a>
<a id='line_404'>of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he</a>
<a id='line_405'>brought in bondage.</a>
<a id='line_406'></a>
<a id='line_407'>2:20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world</a>
<a id='line_408'>through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are</a>
<a id='line_409'>again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with</a>
<a id='line_410'>them than the beginning.</a>
<a id='line_411'></a>
<a id='line_412'>2:21 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of</a>
<a id='line_413'>righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy</a>
<a id='line_414'>commandment delivered unto them.</a>
<a id='line_415'></a>
<a id='line_416'>2:22 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The</a>
<a id='line_417'>dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to</a>
<a id='line_418'>her wallowing in the mire.</a>
<a id='line_419'></a>
<a id='line_420'>3:1 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which</a>
<a id='line_421'>I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: 3:2 That ye may be</a>
<a id='line_422'>mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets,</a>
<a id='line_423'>and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: 3:3</a>
<a id='line_424'>Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers,</a>
<a id='line_425'>walking after their own lusts, 3:4 And saying, Where is the promise of</a>
<a id='line_426'>his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as</a>
<a id='line_427'>they were from the beginning of the creation.</a>
<a id='line_428'></a>
<a id='line_429'>3:5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God</a>
<a id='line_430'>the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and</a>
<a id='line_431'>in the water: 3:6 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed</a>
<a id='line_432'>with water, perished: 3:7 But the heavens and the earth, which are</a>
<a id='line_433'>now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against</a>
<a id='line_434'>the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</a>
<a id='line_435'></a>
<a id='line_436'>3:8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is</a>
<a id='line_437'>with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</a>
<a id='line_438'></a>
<a id='line_439'>3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count</a>
<a id='line_440'>slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any</a>
<a id='line_441'>should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</a>
<a id='line_442'></a>
<a id='line_443'>3:10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the</a>
<a id='line_444'>which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements</a>
<a id='line_445'>shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are</a>
<a id='line_446'>therein shall be burned up.</a>
<a id='line_447'></a>
<a id='line_448'>3:11 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner</a>
<a id='line_449'>of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, 3:12</a>
<a id='line_450'>Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the</a>
<a id='line_451'>heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt</a>
<a id='line_452'>with fervent heat?  3:13 Nevertheless we, according to his promise,</a>
<a id='line_453'>look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_454'></a>
<a id='line_455'>3:14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be</a>
<a id='line_456'>diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and</a>
<a id='line_457'>blameless.</a>
<a id='line_458'></a>
<a id='line_459'>3:15 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even</a>
<a id='line_460'>as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto</a>
<a id='line_461'>him hath written unto you; 3:16 As also in all his epistles, speaking</a>
<a id='line_462'>in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be</a>
<a id='line_463'>understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they</a>
<a id='line_464'>do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</a>
<a id='line_465'></a>
<a id='line_466'>3:17 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware</a>
<a id='line_467'>lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from</a>
<a id='line_468'>your own stedfastness.</a>
<a id='line_469'></a>
<a id='line_470'>3:18 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour</a>
<a id='line_471'>Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.</a>
