<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>    I sing of arms, I sing of him, who from the Trojan land</a>
<a id='line_44'>    Thrust forth by Fate, to Italy and that Lavinian strand</a>
<a id='line_45'>    First came: all tost about was he on earth and on the deep</a>
<a id='line_46'>    By heavenly might for Juno's wrath, that had no mind to sleep:</a>
<a id='line_47'>    And plenteous war he underwent ere he his town might frame</a>
<a id='line_48'>    And set his Gods in Latian earth, whence is the Latin name,</a>
<a id='line_49'>    And father-folk of Alba-town, and walls of mighty Rome.</a>
<a id='line_50'></a>
<a id='line_51'>    Say, Muse, what wound of godhead was whereby all this must come,</a>
<a id='line_52'>    How grieving, she, the Queen of Gods, a man so pious drave</a>
<a id='line_53'>    To win such toil, to welter on through such a troublous wave:         10</a>
<a id='line_54'>    --Can anger in immortal minds abide so fierce and fell?</a>
<a id='line_55'></a>
<a id='line_56'>    There was a city of old time where Tyrian folk did dwell,</a>
<a id='line_57'>    Called Carthage, facing far away the shores of Italy</a>
<a id='line_58'>    And Tiber-mouth; fulfilled of wealth and fierce in arms was she,</a>
<a id='line_59'>    And men say Juno loved her well o'er every other land,</a>
<a id='line_60'>    Yea e'en o'er Samos: there were stored the weapons of her hand,</a>
<a id='line_61'>    And there her chariot: even then she cherished the intent</a>
<a id='line_62'>    To make her Lady of all Lands, if Fate might so be bent;</a>
<a id='line_63'>    Yet had she heard how such a stem from Trojan blood should grow,</a>
<a id='line_64'>    As, blooming fair, the Tyrian towers should one day overthrow,        20</a>
<a id='line_65'>    That thence a folk, kings far and wide, most noble lords of fight,</a>
<a id='line_66'>    Should come for bane of Libyan land: such web the Parcæ dight.</a>
<a id='line_67'>    The Seed of Saturn, fearing this, and mindful how she erst</a>
<a id='line_68'>    For her beloved Argive walls by Troy the battle nursed--</a>
<a id='line_69'>    --Nay neither had the cause of wrath nor all those hurts of old</a>
<a id='line_70'>    Failed from her mind: her inmost heart still sorely did enfold</a>
<a id='line_71'>    That grief of body set at nought in Paris' doomful deed,</a>
<a id='line_72'>    The hated race, and honour shed on heaven-rapt Ganymede--</a>
<a id='line_73'>    So set on fire, that Trojan band o'er all the ocean tossed,</a>
<a id='line_74'>    Those gleanings from Achilles' rage, those few the Greeks had lost,   30</a>
<a id='line_75'>    She drave far off the Latin Land: for many a year they stray</a>
<a id='line_76'>    Such wise as Fate would drive them on by every watery way.</a>
<a id='line_77'>    --Lo, what there was to heave aloft in fashioning of Rome!</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>    Now out of sight of Sicily the Trojans scarce were come</a>
<a id='line_80'>    And merry spread their sails abroad and clave the sea with brass,</a>
<a id='line_81'>    When Juno's heart, who nursed the wound that never thence would pass,</a>
<a id='line_82'>    Spake out:</a>
<a id='line_83'>               "And must I, vanquished, leave the deed I have begun,</a>
<a id='line_84'>    Nor save the Italian realm a king who comes of Teucer's son?</a>
<a id='line_85'>    The Fates forbid it me forsooth? And Pallas, might not she</a>
<a id='line_86'>    Burn up the Argive fleet and sink the Argives in the sea              40</a>
<a id='line_87'>    For Oileus' only fault and fury that he wrought?</a>
<a id='line_88'>    She hurled the eager fire of Jove from cloudy dwelling caught,</a>
<a id='line_89'>    And rent the ships and with the wind the heaped-up waters drew,</a>
<a id='line_90'>    And him a-dying, and all his breast by wildfire smitten through,</a>
<a id='line_91'>    The whirl of waters swept away on spiky crag to bide.</a>
<a id='line_92'>    While I, who go forth Queen of Gods, the very Highest's bride</a>
<a id='line_93'>    And sister, must I wage a war for all these many years</a>
<a id='line_94'>    With one lone race? What! is there left a soul that Juno fears</a>
<a id='line_95'>    Henceforth? or will one suppliant hand gifts on mine altar lay?"</a>
<a id='line_96'></a>
<a id='line_97'>    So brooding in her fiery heart the Goddess went her way               50</a>
<a id='line_98'>    Unto the fatherland of storm, full fruitful of the gale,</a>
<a id='line_99'>    Æolia hight, where Æolus is king of all avail,</a>
<a id='line_100'>    And far adown a cavern vast the bickering of the winds</a>
<a id='line_101'>    And roaring tempests of the world with bolt and fetter binds:</a>
<a id='line_102'>    They set the mountains murmuring much, a-growling angrily</a>
<a id='line_103'>    About their bars, while Æolus sits in his burg on high,</a>
<a id='line_104'>    And, sceptre-holding, softeneth them, and strait their wrath doth keep:</a>
<a id='line_105'>    Yea but for that the earth and sea, and vault of heaven the deep,</a>
<a id='line_106'>    They eager-swift would roll away and sweep adown of space:</a>
<a id='line_107'>    For fear whereof the Father high in dark and hollow place             60</a>
<a id='line_108'>    Hath hidden them, and high above a world of mountains thrown</a>
<a id='line_109'>    And given them therewithal a king, who, taught by law well known,</a>
<a id='line_110'>    Now draweth, and now casteth loose the reins that hold them in:</a>
<a id='line_111'>    To whom did suppliant Juno now in e'en such words begin:</a>
<a id='line_112'></a>
<a id='line_113'>    "The Father of the Gods and men hath given thee might enow,</a>
<a id='line_114'>    O Æolus, to smooth the sea, and make the storm-wind blow.</a>
<a id='line_115'>    Hearken! a folk, my very foes, saileth the Tyrrhene main</a>
<a id='line_116'>    Bearing their Troy to Italy, and Gods that were but vain:</a>
<a id='line_117'>    Set on thy winds, and overwhelm their sunken ships at sea,</a>
<a id='line_118'>    Or prithee scattered cast them forth, things drowned diversedly.      70</a>
<a id='line_119'>    Twice seven nymphs are in my house of body passing fair:</a>
<a id='line_120'>    Of whom indeed Deïopea is fairest fashioned there.</a>
<a id='line_121'>    I give her thee in wedlock sure, and call her all thine own</a>
<a id='line_122'>    To wear away the years with thee, for thy deserving shown</a>
<a id='line_123'>    To me this day; of offspring fair she too shall make thee sire."</a>
<a id='line_124'></a>
<a id='line_125'>    To whom spake Æolus: "O Queen, to search out thy desire</a>
<a id='line_126'>    Is all thou needest toil herein; from me the deed should wend.</a>
<a id='line_127'>    Thou mak'st my realm; the sway of all, and Jove thou mak'st my friend,</a>
<a id='line_128'>    Thou givest me to lie with Gods when heavenly feast is dight,</a>
<a id='line_129'>    And o'er the tempest and the cloud thou makest me of might."          80</a>
<a id='line_130'></a>
<a id='line_131'>    Therewith against the hollow hill he turned him spear in hand</a>
<a id='line_132'>    And hurled it on the flank thereof, and as an ordered band</a>
<a id='line_133'>    By whatso door the winds rush out o'er earth in whirling blast,</a>
<a id='line_134'>    And driving down upon the sea its lowest deeps upcast.</a>
<a id='line_135'>    The East, the West together there, the Afric, that doth hold</a>
<a id='line_136'>    A heart fulfilled of stormy rain, huge billows shoreward rolled.</a>
<a id='line_137'>    Therewith came clamour of the men and whistling through the shrouds</a>
<a id='line_138'>    And heaven and day all suddenly were swallowed by the clouds</a>
<a id='line_139'>    Away from eyes of Teucrian men; night on the ocean lies,</a>
<a id='line_140'>    Pole thunders unto pole, and still with wildfire glare the skies,     90</a>
<a id='line_141'>    And all things hold the face of death before the seamen's eyes.</a>
<a id='line_142'></a>
<a id='line_143'>    Now therewithal Æneas' limbs grew weak with chilly dread,</a>
<a id='line_144'>    He groaned, and lifting both his palms aloft to heaven, he said:</a>
<a id='line_145'>    "O thrice and four times happy ye, that had the fate to fall</a>
<a id='line_146'>    Before your fathers' faces there by Troy's beloved wall!</a>
<a id='line_147'>    Tydides, thou of Danaan folk the mightiest under shield,</a>
<a id='line_148'>    Why might I never lay me down upon the Ilian field,</a>
<a id='line_149'>    Why was my soul forbid release at thy most mighty hand,</a>
<a id='line_150'>    Where eager Hector stooped and lay before Achilles' wand,</a>
<a id='line_151'>    Where huge Sarpedon fell asleep, where Simoïs rolls along            100</a>
<a id='line_152'>    The shields of men, and helms of men, and bodies of the strong?"</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>    Thus as he cried the whistling North fell on with sudden gale</a>
<a id='line_155'>    And drave the seas up toward the stars, and smote aback the sail;</a>
<a id='line_156'>    Then break the oars, the bows fall off, and beam on in the trough</a>
<a id='line_157'>    She lieth, and the sea comes on a mountain huge and rough.</a>
<a id='line_158'>    These hang upon the topmost wave, and those may well discern</a>
<a id='line_159'>    The sea's ground mid the gaping whirl: with sand the surges churn.</a>
<a id='line_160'>    Three keels the South wind cast away on hidden reefs that lie</a>
<a id='line_161'>    Midmost the sea, the Altars called by men of Italy,</a>
<a id='line_162'>    A huge back thrusting through the tide: three others from the deep   110</a>
<a id='line_163'>    The East toward straits, and swallowing sands did miserably sweep,</a>
<a id='line_164'>    And dashed them on the shoals, and heaped the sand around in ring:</a>
<a id='line_165'>    And one, a keel the Lycians manned, with him, the trusty King</a>
<a id='line_166'>    Orontes, in Æneas' sight a toppling wave o'erhung,</a>
<a id='line_167'>    And smote the poop, and headlong rolled, adown the helmsman flung;</a>
<a id='line_168'>    Then thrice about the driving flood hath hurled her as she lay,</a>
<a id='line_169'>    The hurrying eddy swept above and swallowed her from day:</a>
<a id='line_170'>    And lo! things swimming here and there, scant in the unmeasured seas,</a>
<a id='line_171'>    The arms of men, and painted boards, and Trojan treasuries.</a>
<a id='line_172'>    And now Ilioneus' stout ship, her that Achates leal                  120</a>
<a id='line_173'>    And Abas ferried o'er the main, and old Aletes' keel</a>
<a id='line_174'>    The storm hath overcome; and all must drink the baneful stream</a>
<a id='line_175'>    Through opening leaky sides of them that gape at every seam.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>    But meanwhile Neptune, sorely moved, hath felt the storm let go,</a>
<a id='line_178'>    And all the turmoil of the main with murmur great enow;</a>
<a id='line_179'>    The deep upheaved from all abodes the lowest that there be:</a>
<a id='line_180'>    So forth he put his placid face o'er topmost of the sea,</a>
<a id='line_181'>    And there he saw Æneas' ships o'er all the main besprent,</a>
<a id='line_182'>    The Trojans beaten by the flood and ruin from heaven sent.</a>
<a id='line_183'>    But Juno's guile and wrathful heart her brother knew full well:      130</a>
<a id='line_184'>    So East and West he called to him, and spake such words to tell:</a>
<a id='line_185'></a>
<a id='line_186'>    "What mighty pride of race of yours hath hold upon your minds,</a>
<a id='line_187'>    That earth and sea ye turmoil so without my will, O winds;</a>
<a id='line_188'>    That such upheaval and so great ye dare without my will?</a>
<a id='line_189'>    Whom I--But first it comes to hand the troubled flood to still:</a>
<a id='line_190'>    For such-like fault henceforward though with nought so light ye pay.</a>
<a id='line_191'>    Go get you gone, and look to it this to your king to say:</a>
<a id='line_192'>    That ocean's realm and three-tined spear of dread are given by Fate</a>
<a id='line_193'>    Not unto him but unto me? he holds the cliffs o'ergreat,</a>
<a id='line_194'>    Thine houses, Eurus; in that hall I bid him then be bold,            140</a>
<a id='line_195'>    Thine Æolus, and lord it o'er his winds in barred hold."</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>    So saying and swifter than his word he layed the troubled main,</a>
<a id='line_198'>    And put to flight the gathered clouds, and brought the sun again;</a>
<a id='line_199'>    And with him Triton fell to work, and fair Cymothoë,</a>
<a id='line_200'>    And thrust the ships from spiky rocks; with triple spear wrought he</a>
<a id='line_201'>    To lift, and opened swallowing sands, and laid the waves alow.</a>
<a id='line_202'>    Then on light wheels o'er ocean's face soft gliding did he go.</a>
<a id='line_203'>    And, like as mid a people great full often will arise</a>
<a id='line_204'>    Huge riot, and all the low-born herd to utter anger flies,</a>
<a id='line_205'>    And sticks and stones are in the air, and fury arms doth find:       150</a>
<a id='line_206'>    Then, setting eyes perchance on one of weight for noble mind,</a>
<a id='line_207'>    And noble deeds, they hush them then and stand with pricked-up ears,</a>
<a id='line_208'>    And he with words becomes their lord, and smooth their anger wears;</a>
<a id='line_209'>    --In such wise fell all clash of sea when that sea-father rose,</a>
<a id='line_210'>    And looked abroad: who turned his steeds, and giving rein to those,</a>
<a id='line_211'>    Flew forth in happy-gliding car through heaven's all-open way.</a>
<a id='line_212'></a>
<a id='line_213'>    Æneas' sore forewearied host the shores that nearest lay</a>
<a id='line_214'>    Stretch out for o'er the sea, and turn to Libyan land this while.</a>
<a id='line_215'>    There goes a long firth of the sea, made haven by an isle,           159</a>
<a id='line_216'>    Against whose sides thrust out abroad each wave the main doth send</a>
<a id='line_217'>    Is broken, and must cleave itself through hollow bights to wend:</a>
<a id='line_218'>    Huge rocks on this hand and on that, twin horns of cliff, cast dread</a>
<a id='line_219'>    On very heaven; and far and wide beneath each mighty head</a>
<a id='line_220'>    Hushed are the harmless waters; lo, the flickering wood above</a>
<a id='line_221'>    And wavering shadow cast adown by darksome hanging grove:</a>
<a id='line_222'>    In face hereof a cave there is of rocks o'erhung, made meet</a>
<a id='line_223'>    With benches of the living stone and springs of water sweet,</a>
<a id='line_224'>    The house of Nymphs: a-riding there may way-worn ships be bold</a>
<a id='line_225'>    To lie without the hawser's strain or anchor's hookèd hold.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>    That bight with seven of all his tale of ships Æneas gained,         170</a>
<a id='line_228'>    And there, by mighty love of land the Trojans sore constrained,</a>
<a id='line_229'>    Leap off-board straight, and gain the gift of that so longed-for sand,</a>
<a id='line_230'>    And lay their limbs with salt sea fouled adown upon the strand:</a>
<a id='line_231'>    And first Achates smote alive the spark from out the flint,</a>
<a id='line_232'>    And caught the fire in tinder-leaves, and never gift did stint</a>
<a id='line_233'>    Of feeding dry; and flame enow in kindled stuff he woke;</a>
<a id='line_234'>    Then Ceres' body spoilt with sea, and Ceres' arms they took,</a>
<a id='line_235'>    And sped the matter spent with toil, and fruit of furrows found</a>
<a id='line_236'>    They set about to parch with fire and 'twixt of stones to pound.</a>
<a id='line_237'></a>
<a id='line_238'>    Meanwhile Æneas scaled the cliff and far and wide he swept           180</a>
<a id='line_239'>    The main, if anywhere perchance the sea his Antheus kept,</a>
<a id='line_240'>    Tossed by the wind, if he might see the twi-banked Phrygians row;</a>
<a id='line_241'>    If Capys, or Caïcus' arms on lofty deck might show.</a>
<a id='line_242'>    Nor any ship there was in sight, but on the strand he saw</a>
<a id='line_243'>    Three stags a-wandering at their will, and after them they draw</a>
<a id='line_244'>    The whole herd following down the dales long strung out as they feed:</a>
<a id='line_245'>    So still he stood, and caught in hand his bow and shafts of speed,</a>
<a id='line_246'>    The weapons that Achates staunch was bearing then and oft;</a>
<a id='line_247'>    And first the very lords of those, that bore their heads aloft</a>
<a id='line_248'>    With branching horns, he felled, and then the common sort, and so    190</a>
<a id='line_249'>    Their army drave he with his darts through leafy woods to go:</a>
<a id='line_250'>    Nor held his hand till on the earth were seven great bodies strown,</a>
<a id='line_251'>    And each of all his ships might have one head of deer her own.</a>
<a id='line_252'>    Thence to the haven gat he gone with all his folk to share,</a>
<a id='line_253'>    And that good wine which erst the casks Acestes made to bear,</a>
<a id='line_254'>    And gave them as they went away on that Trinacrian beach,</a>
<a id='line_255'>    He shared about; then fell to soothe their grieving hearts with speech:</a>
<a id='line_256'></a>
<a id='line_257'>    "O fellows, we are used ere now by evil ways to wend;</a>
<a id='line_258'>    O ye who erst bore heavier loads, this too the Gods shall end.</a>
<a id='line_259'>    Ye, ye have drawn nigh Scylla's rage and rocks that inly roar,       200</a>
<a id='line_260'>    And run the risk of storm of stones upon the Cyclops' shore:</a>
<a id='line_261'>    Come, call aback your ancient hearts and put your fears away!</a>
<a id='line_262'>    This too shall be for joy to you remembered on a day.</a>
<a id='line_263'>    Through diverse haps, through many risks wherewith our way is strown,</a>
<a id='line_264'>    We get us on to Latium, the land the Fates have shown</a>
<a id='line_265'>    To be for peaceful seats for us: there may we raise up Troy.</a>
<a id='line_266'>    Abide, endure, and keep yourselves for coming days of joy."</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>    So spake his voice: but his sick heart did mighty trouble rack,</a>
<a id='line_269'>    As, glad of countenance, he thrust the heavy anguish back.</a>
<a id='line_270'>    But they fall to upon the prey, and feast that was to dight,         210</a>
<a id='line_271'>    And flay the hide from off the ribs, and bare the flesh to sight.</a>
<a id='line_272'>    Some cut it quivering into steaks which on the spits they run,</a>
<a id='line_273'>    Some feed the fire upon the shore, and set the brass thereon.</a>
<a id='line_274'>    And so meat bringeth might again, and on the grass thereby,</a>
<a id='line_275'>    Fulfilled with fat of forest deer and ancient wine, they lie.</a>
<a id='line_276'>    But when all hunger was appeased and tables set aside,</a>
<a id='line_277'>    Of missing fellows how they fared the talk did long abide;</a>
<a id='line_278'>    Whom, weighing hope and weighing fear, either alive they trow,</a>
<a id='line_279'>    Or that the last and worst has come, that called they hear not now.</a>
<a id='line_280'>    And chief of all the pious King Æneas moaned the pass                220</a>
<a id='line_281'>    Of brisk Orontes, Amycus, and cruel fate that was</a>
<a id='line_282'>    Of Lycus, and of Bias strong, and strong Cloanthus gone.</a>
<a id='line_283'></a>
<a id='line_284'>    But now an end of all there was, when Jove a-looking down</a>
<a id='line_285'>    From highest lift on sail-skimmed sea, and lands that round it lie,</a>
<a id='line_286'>    And shores and many folk about, in topmost burg of sky</a>
<a id='line_287'>    Stood still, and fixed the eyes of God on Libya's realm at last:</a>
<a id='line_288'>    To whom, as through his breast and mind such cares of godhead passed,</a>
<a id='line_289'>    Spake Venus, sadder than her due with bright eyes gathering tears:</a>
<a id='line_290'></a>
<a id='line_291'>    "O thou, who rulest with a realm that hath no days nor years,</a>
<a id='line_292'>    Both Gods and men, and mak'st them fear thy thunder lest it fall,    230</a>
<a id='line_293'>    What then hath mine Æneas done so great a crime to call?</a>
<a id='line_294'>    What might have Trojan men to sin? So many deaths they bore</a>
<a id='line_295'>    'Gainst whom because of Italy is shut the wide world's door.</a>
<a id='line_296'>    Was it not surely promised me that as the years rolled round</a>
<a id='line_297'>    The blood of Teucer come again should spring from out the ground,</a>
<a id='line_298'>    The Roman folk, such very lords, that all the earth and sea</a>
<a id='line_299'>    Their sway should compass? Father, doth the counsel shift in thee?</a>
<a id='line_300'>    This thing indeed atoned to me for Troy in ashes laid,</a>
<a id='line_301'>    And all the miserable end, as fate 'gainst fate I weighed:</a>
<a id='line_302'>    But now the self-same fortune dogs men by such troubles driven       240</a>
<a id='line_303'>    So oft and oft. What end of toil then giv'st thou, King of heaven?</a>
<a id='line_304'>    Antenor was of might enow to 'scape the Achæan host,</a>
<a id='line_305'>    And safe to reach the Illyrian gulf and pierce Liburnia's coast,</a>
<a id='line_306'>    And through the inmost realms thereof to pass Timavus' head,</a>
<a id='line_307'>    Whence through nine mouths midst mountain roar is that wild water shed,</a>
<a id='line_308'>    To cast itself on fields below with all its sounding sea:</a>
<a id='line_309'>    And there he made Patavium's town and Teucrian seats to be,</a>
<a id='line_310'>    And gave the folk their very name and Trojan arms did raise:</a>
<a id='line_311'>    Now settled in all peace and rest he passeth quiet days.</a>
<a id='line_312'>    But we, thy children, unto whom thou giv'st with bowing head         250</a>
<a id='line_313'>    The heights of heaven, our ships are lost, and we, O shame! betrayed,</a>
<a id='line_314'>    Are driven away from Italy for anger but of one.</a>
<a id='line_315'>    Is this the good man's guerdon then? is this the promised throne?"</a>
<a id='line_316'></a>
<a id='line_317'>    The Sower of the Gods and men a little smiled on her</a>
<a id='line_318'>    With such a countenance as calms the storms and upper air;</a>
<a id='line_319'>    He kissed his daughter on the lips, and spake such words to tell:</a>
<a id='line_320'>    "O Cytherean, spare thy dread! unmoved the Fates shall dwell</a>
<a id='line_321'>    Of thee and thine, and thou shalt see the promised city yet,</a>
<a id='line_322'>    E'en that Lavinium's walls, and high amidst the stars shalt set</a>
<a id='line_323'>    Great-souled Æneas: nor in me doth aught of counsel shift            260</a>
<a id='line_324'>    But since care gnaws upon thine heart, the hidden things I lift</a>
<a id='line_325'>    Of Fate, and roll on time for thee, and tell of latter days.</a>
<a id='line_326'>    Great war he wars in Italy, and folk full wild of ways</a>
<a id='line_327'>    He weareth down, and lays on men both laws and wallèd steads,</a>
<a id='line_328'>    Till the third summer seeth him King o'er the Latin heads,</a>
<a id='line_329'>    And the third winter's wearing brings the fierce Rutulians low.</a>
<a id='line_330'>    Thereon the lad Ascanius, Iulus by-named now,</a>
<a id='line_331'>    (And Ilus was he once of old, when Ilium's city was,)</a>
<a id='line_332'>    Fulfilleth thirty orbs of rule with rolling months that pass,</a>
<a id='line_333'>    And from the town Lavinium shifts the dwelling of his race,          270</a>
<a id='line_334'>    And maketh Alba-town the Long a mighty fencèd place.</a>
<a id='line_335'>    Here when for thrice an hundred years untouched the land hath been</a>
<a id='line_336'>    Beneath the rule of Hector's folk, lo Ilia, priestess-queen,</a>
<a id='line_337'>    Goes heavy with the love of Mars, and bringeth twins to birth.</a>
<a id='line_338'>    'Neath yellow hide of foster-wolf thence, mighty in his mirth,</a>
<a id='line_339'>    Comes Romulus to bear the folk, and Mavors' walls to frame,</a>
<a id='line_340'>    And by the word himself was called the Roman folk to name.</a>
<a id='line_341'>    On them I lay no bonds of time, no bonds of earthly part;</a>
<a id='line_342'>    I give them empire without end: yea, Juno, hard of heart,</a>
<a id='line_343'>    Who wearieth now with fear of her the heavens and earth and sea,     280</a>
<a id='line_344'>    Shall gather better counsel yet, and cherish them with me;</a>
<a id='line_345'>    The Roman folk, the togaed men, lords of all worldly ways.</a>
<a id='line_346'>    Such is the doom. As weareth time there come those other days,</a>
<a id='line_347'>    Wherein Assaracus shall bind Mycenæ of renown,</a>
<a id='line_348'>    And Phthia, and shall lord it o'er the Argives beaten down.</a>
<a id='line_349'>    Then shall a Trojan Cæsar come from out a lovely name,</a>
<a id='line_350'>    The ocean-stream shall bound his rule, the stars of heaven his fame,</a>
<a id='line_351'>    Julius his name from him of old, the great Iulus sent:</a>
<a id='line_352'>    Him too in house of heaven one day 'neath spoils of Eastlands bent</a>
<a id='line_353'>    Thou, happy, shalt receive; he too shall have the prayers of men.    290</a>
<a id='line_354'>    The wars of old all laid aside, the hard world bettereth then,</a>
<a id='line_355'>    And Vesta and the hoary Faith, Quirinus and his twin</a>
<a id='line_356'>    Now judge the world; the dreadful doors of War now shut within</a>
<a id='line_357'>    Their iron bolts and strait embrace the godless Rage of folk,</a>
<a id='line_358'>    Who, pitiless, on weapons set, and bound in brazen yoke</a>
<a id='line_359'>    Of hundred knots aback of him foams fell from bloody mouth."</a>
<a id='line_360'></a>
<a id='line_361'>    Such words he spake, and from aloft he sent down Maia's youth</a>
<a id='line_362'>    To cause the lands and Carthage towers new-built to open gate</a>
<a id='line_363'>    And welcome in the Teucrian men; lest Dido, fooled of fate,          299</a>
<a id='line_364'>    Should drive them from her country-side. The unmeasured air he beat</a>
<a id='line_365'>    With flap of wings, and speedily in Libya set his feet:</a>
<a id='line_366'>    And straightway there his bidding wrought, and from the Tyrians fall,</a>
<a id='line_367'>    God willing it, their hearts of war; and Dido first of all</a>
<a id='line_368'>    Took peace for Teucrians to her soul, and quiet heart and kind.</a>
<a id='line_369'></a>
<a id='line_370'>    Now good Æneas through the night had many things in mind,</a>
<a id='line_371'>    And set himself to fare abroad at first of holy day</a>
<a id='line_372'>    To search the new land what it was, and on what shore he lay</a>
<a id='line_373'>    Driven by the wind; if manfolk there abode, or nought but deer,</a>
<a id='line_374'>    (For waste it seemed), and tidings true back to his folk to bear.</a>
<a id='line_375'>    So in that hollow bight of groves beneath the cavern cleft,          310</a>
<a id='line_376'>    All hidden by the leafy trees and quavering shades, he left</a>
<a id='line_377'>    His ships: and he himself afoot went with Achates lone,</a>
<a id='line_378'>    Shaking in hand two slender spears with broad-beat iron done.</a>
<a id='line_379'>    But as he reached the thicket's midst his mother stood before,</a>
<a id='line_380'>    Who virgin face, and virgin arms, and virgin habit bore,</a>
<a id='line_381'>    A Spartan maid; or like to her who tames the Thracian horse,</a>
<a id='line_382'>    Harpalyce, and flies before the hurrying Hebrus' course.</a>
<a id='line_383'>    For huntress-wise on shoulder she had hung the handy bow,</a>
<a id='line_384'>    And given all her hair abroad for any wind to blow,</a>
<a id='line_385'>    And, naked-kneed, her kirtle long had gathered in a lap:             320</a>
<a id='line_386'>    She spake the first:</a>
<a id='line_387'>                         "Ho youths," she said, "tell me by any hap</a>
<a id='line_388'>    If of my sisters any one ye saw a wandering wide</a>
<a id='line_389'>    With quiver girt, and done about with lynx's spotted hide,</a>
<a id='line_390'>    Or following of the foaming boar with shouts and eager feet?"</a>
<a id='line_391'></a>
<a id='line_392'>    So Venus; and so Venus' son began her words to meet:</a>
<a id='line_393'>    "I have not seen, nor have I heard thy sisters nigh this place,</a>
<a id='line_394'>    O maid:--and how to call thee then? for neither is thy face</a>
<a id='line_395'>    Of mortals, nor thy voice of men: O very Goddess thou!</a>
<a id='line_396'>    What! Phoebus' sister? or of nymphs whom shall I call thee now?</a>
<a id='line_397'>    But whosoe'er thou be, be kind and lighten us our toil,              330</a>
<a id='line_398'>    And teach us where beneath the heavens, which spot of earthly soil</a>
<a id='line_399'>    We are cast forth; unlearned of men, unlearned of land we stray,</a>
<a id='line_400'>    By might of wind and billows huge here driven from out our way.</a>
<a id='line_401'>    Our right hands by thine altar-horns shall fell full many a host."</a>
<a id='line_402'></a>
<a id='line_403'>    Spake Venus: "Nowise am I worth so much of honour's cost:</a>
<a id='line_404'>    The Tyrian maids are wont to bear the quiver even as I,</a>
<a id='line_405'>    And even so far upon the leg the purple shoe-thong tie.</a>
<a id='line_406'>    The Punic realm thou seest here, Agenor's town and folk,</a>
<a id='line_407'>    But set amidst of Libyan men unused to bear the yoke.</a>
<a id='line_408'>    Dido is Lady of the Land, who fled from Tyre the old,                340</a>
<a id='line_409'>    And from her brother: weary long were all the ill deed told,</a>
<a id='line_410'>    And long its winding ways, but I light-foot will overpass.</a>
<a id='line_411'>    Her husband was Sychæus hight, of land most rich he was</a>
<a id='line_412'>    Of all Phoenicians: she, poor wretch! loved him with mighty love,</a>
<a id='line_413'>    Whose father gave her, maid, to him, and first the rites did move</a>
<a id='line_414'>    Of wedlock: but as King of Tyre her brother did abide,</a>
<a id='line_415'>    Pygmalion, more swollen up in sin than any man beside:</a>
<a id='line_416'>    Mad hatred yoked the twain of them, he blind with golden lust,</a>
<a id='line_417'>    Godless with stroke of iron laid Sychæus in the dust</a>
<a id='line_418'>    Unwares before the altar-horns; nor of the love did reck             350</a>
<a id='line_419'>    His sister had, but with vain hope played on the lover sick,</a>
<a id='line_420'>    And made a host of feignings false, and hid the matter long.</a>
<a id='line_421'>    Till in her sleep the image came of that unburied wrong,</a>
<a id='line_422'>    Her husband dead; in wondrous wise his face was waxen pale:</a>
<a id='line_423'>    His breast with iron smitten through, the altar of his bale,</a>
<a id='line_424'>    The hooded sin of evil house, to her he open laid,</a>
<a id='line_425'>    And speedily to flee away from fatherland he bade;</a>
<a id='line_426'>    And for the help of travel showed earth's hidden wealth of old,</a>
<a id='line_427'>    A mighty mass that none might tell of silver and of gold.</a>
<a id='line_428'>    Sore moved hereby did Dido straight her flight and friends prepare:  360</a>
<a id='line_429'>    They meet together, such as are or driven by biting fear,</a>
<a id='line_430'>    Or bitter hatred of the wretch: such ships as hap had dight</a>
<a id='line_431'>    They fall upon and lade with gold; forth fare the treasures bright</a>
<a id='line_432'>    Of wretch Pygmalion o'er the sea, a woman first therein.</a>
<a id='line_433'>    And so they come unto the place where ye may see begin</a>
<a id='line_434'>    The towers of Carthage, and the walls new built that mighty grow,</a>
<a id='line_435'>    And bought the Byrsa-field good cheap, as still the name shall show,</a>
<a id='line_436'>    So much of land as one bull's hide might scantly go about</a>
<a id='line_437'>    --But ye forsooth, what men are ye, from what land fare ye out,</a>
<a id='line_438'>    And whither go ye on your ways?"                                     370</a>
<a id='line_439'>                                     Her questioning in speech</a>
<a id='line_440'>    He answered, and a heavy sigh from inmost heart did reach:</a>
<a id='line_441'>    "O Goddess, might I tread again first footsteps of our way,</a>
<a id='line_442'>    And if the annals of our toil thine hearkening ears might stay,</a>
<a id='line_443'>    Yet Vesper first on daylight dead should shut Olympus' door.</a>
<a id='line_444'>    From Troy the old, if yet perchance your ears have felt before</a>
<a id='line_445'>    That name go by, do we come forth, and, many a water past,</a>
<a id='line_446'>    A chance-come storm hath drifted us on Libyan shores at last.</a>
<a id='line_447'>    I am Æneas, God-lover; I snatched forth from the foe</a>
<a id='line_448'>    My Gods to bear aboard with me, a fame for heaven to know.</a>
<a id='line_449'>    I seek the Italian fatherland, and Jove-descended line;              380</a>
<a id='line_450'>    Twice ten the ships were that I manned upon the Phrygian brine,</a>
<a id='line_451'>    My Goddess-mother led the way, we followed fate god-given;</a>
<a id='line_452'>    And now scarce seven are left to me by wave and east-wind riven;</a>
<a id='line_453'>    And I through Libyan deserts stray, a man unknown and poor,</a>
<a id='line_454'>    From Asia cast, from Europe cast,"</a>
<a id='line_455'>                                       She might abide no more</a>
<a id='line_456'>    To hear his moan: she thrusts a word amidst his grief and saith:</a>
<a id='line_457'>    "Nay thou art not God's castaway, who drawest mortal breath,</a>
<a id='line_458'>    And fairest to the Tyrian town, if aught thereof I know.</a>
<a id='line_459'>    Set on to Dido's threshold then e'en as the way doth show.</a>
<a id='line_460'>    For take the tidings of thy ships and folk brought back again        390</a>
<a id='line_461'>    By shifting of the northern wind all safe from off the main:</a>
<a id='line_462'>    Unless my parents learned me erst of soothsaying to wot</a>
<a id='line_463'>    But idly. Lo there twice seven swans disporting in a knot,</a>
<a id='line_464'>    Whom falling from the plain of air drave down the bird of Jove</a>
<a id='line_465'>    From open heaven: strung out at length they hang the earth above,</a>
<a id='line_466'>    And now seem choosing where to pitch, now on their choice to gaze,</a>
<a id='line_467'>    As wheeling round with whistling wings they sport in diverse ways</a>
<a id='line_468'>    And with their band ring round the pole and cast abroad their song.</a>
<a id='line_469'>    Nought otherwise the ships and youth that unto thee belong</a>
<a id='line_470'>    Hold haven now, or else full sail to harbour-mouth are come.         400</a>
<a id='line_471'>    Set forth, set forth and tread the way e'en as it leadeth home."</a>
<a id='line_472'></a>
<a id='line_473'>    She spake, she turned, from rosy neck the light of heaven she cast,</a>
<a id='line_474'>    And from her hair ambrosial the scent of Gods went past</a>
<a id='line_475'>    Upon the wind, and o'er her feet her skirts fell shimmering down,</a>
<a id='line_476'>    And very God she went her ways. Therewith his mother known,</a>
<a id='line_477'>    With such a word he followed up a-fleeing from his eyes:</a>
<a id='line_478'></a>
<a id='line_479'>    "Ah cruel as a God! and why with images and lies</a>
<a id='line_480'>    Dost thou beguile me? wherefore then is hand to hand not given</a>
<a id='line_481'>    And we to give and take in words that come from earth and heaven?"</a>
<a id='line_482'></a>
<a id='line_483'>    Such wise he chided her, and then his footsteps townward bent:       410</a>
<a id='line_484'>    But Venus with a dusky air did hedge them as they went,</a>
<a id='line_485'>    And widespread cloak of cloudy stuff the Goddess round them wrapped,</a>
<a id='line_486'>    Lest any man had seen them there, or bodily had happed</a>
<a id='line_487'>    Across their road their steps to stay, and ask their dealings there.</a>
<a id='line_488'>    But she to Paphos and her home went glad amidst the air:</a>
<a id='line_489'>    There is her temple, there they stand, an hundred altars meet,</a>
<a id='line_490'>    Warm with Sabæan incense-smoke, with new-pulled blossoms sweet.</a>
<a id='line_491'></a>
<a id='line_492'>    But therewithal they speed their way as led the road along;</a>
<a id='line_493'>    And now they scale a spreading hill that o'er the town is hung,</a>
<a id='line_494'>    And looking downward thereupon hath all the burg in face.            420</a>
<a id='line_495'>    Æneas marvels how that world was once a peasants' place,</a>
<a id='line_496'>    He marvels at the gates, the roar and rattle of the ways.</a>
<a id='line_497'>    Hot-heart the Tyrians speed the work, and some the ramparts raise,</a>
<a id='line_498'>    Some pile the burg high, some with hand roll stones up o'er the ground;</a>
<a id='line_499'>    Some choose a place for dwelling-house and draw a trench around;</a>
<a id='line_500'>    Some choose the laws, and lords of doom, the holy senate choose.</a>
<a id='line_501'>    These thereaway the havens dig, and deep adown sink those</a>
<a id='line_502'>    The founding of the theatre walls, or cleave the living stone</a>
<a id='line_503'>    In pillars huge, one day to show full fair the scene upon.</a>
<a id='line_504'>    As in new summer 'neath the sun the bees are wont to speed           430</a>
<a id='line_505'>    Their labour in the flowery fields, whereover now they lead</a>
<a id='line_506'>    The well-grown offspring of their race, or when the cells they store</a>
<a id='line_507'>    With flowing honey, till fulfilled of sweets they hold no more;</a>
<a id='line_508'>    Or take the loads of new-comers, or as a watch well set</a>
<a id='line_509'>    Drive off the lazy herd of drones that they no dwelling get;</a>
<a id='line_510'>    Well speeds the work, and thymy sweet the honey's odour is.</a>
<a id='line_511'></a>
<a id='line_512'>    "Well favoured of the Fates are ye, whose walls arise in bliss!"</a>
<a id='line_513'>    Æneas cries, a-looking o'er the housetops spread below;</a>
<a id='line_514'>    Then, wonderful to tell in tale, hedged round with cloud doth go</a>
<a id='line_515'>    Amid the thickest press of men, and yet of none is seen.             440</a>
<a id='line_516'></a>
<a id='line_517'>    A grove amid the town there is, a pleasant place of green,</a>
<a id='line_518'>    Where erst the Tyrians, beat by waves and whirling of the wind,</a>
<a id='line_519'>    Dug out the token Juno once had bidden them hope to find,</a>
<a id='line_520'>    An eager horse's head to wit: for thus their folk should grow</a>
<a id='line_521'>    Far-famed in war for many an age, of victual rich enow.</a>
<a id='line_522'>    There now did Dido, Sidon-born, uprear a mighty fane</a>
<a id='line_523'>    To Juno, rich in gifts, and rich in present godhead's gain:</a>
<a id='line_524'>    On brazen steps its threshold rose, and brass its lintel tied,</a>
<a id='line_525'>    And on their hinges therewithal the brazen door-leaves cried.</a>
<a id='line_526'>    And now within that grove again a new thing thrusting forth          450</a>
<a id='line_527'>    'Gan lighten fear; for here to hope Æneas deemed it worth,</a>
<a id='line_528'>    And trust his fortune beaten down that yet it might arise.</a>
<a id='line_529'>    For there while he abode the Queen, and wandered with his eyes</a>
<a id='line_530'>    O'er all the temple, musing on the city's fate to be,</a>
<a id='line_531'>    And o'er the diverse handicraft and works of mastery,</a>
<a id='line_532'>    Lo there, set out before his face the battles that were Troy's,</a>
<a id='line_533'>    And wars, whereof all folk on earth had heard the fame and noise;</a>
<a id='line_534'>    King Priam, the Atridæ twain, Achilles dire to both.</a>
<a id='line_535'>    He stood, and weeping spake withal:</a>
<a id='line_536'>                                        "Achates, lo! forsooth</a>
<a id='line_537'>    What place, what land in all the earth but with our grief is stored?  460</a>
<a id='line_538'>    Lo Priam! and even here belike deed hath its own reward.</a>
<a id='line_539'>    Lo here are tears for piteous things that touch men's hearts anigh:</a>
<a id='line_540'>    Cast off thy fear! this fame today shall yet thy safety buy."</a>
<a id='line_541'></a>
<a id='line_542'>    And with the empty painted thing he feeds his mind withal,</a>
<a id='line_543'>    Sore groaning, and a very flood adown his face did fall.</a>
<a id='line_544'>    For there he saw, as war around of Pergamus they cast,</a>
<a id='line_545'>    Here fled the Greeks, the Trojan youth for ever following fast;</a>
<a id='line_546'>    There fled the Phrygians, on their heels high-helmed Achilles' car;</a>
<a id='line_547'>    Not far off, fair with snowy cloths, the tents of Rhesus are;</a>
<a id='line_548'>    He knew them weeping: they of old in first of sleep betrayed,        470</a>
<a id='line_549'>    Tydides red with many a death a waste of nothing made,</a>
<a id='line_550'>    And led those fiery steeds to camp ere ever they might have</a>
<a id='line_551'>    One mouthful of the Trojan grass, or drink of Xanthus' wave.</a>
<a id='line_552'>    And lo again, where Troilus is fleeing weaponless,</a>
<a id='line_553'>    Unhappy youth, and all too weak to bear Achilles' stress,</a>
<a id='line_554'>    By his own horses, fallen aback, at empty chariot borne,</a>
<a id='line_555'>    Yet holding on the reins thereof; his neck, his tresses torn</a>
<a id='line_556'>    O'er face of earth, his wrested spear a-writing in the dust.</a>
<a id='line_557'>    Meanwhile were faring to the fane of Pallas little just</a>
<a id='line_558'>    The wives of Troy with scattered hair, bearing the gown refused,     480</a>
<a id='line_559'>    Sad they and suppliant, whose own hands their very bosoms bruised,</a>
<a id='line_560'>    While fixed, averse, the Goddess kept her eyes upon the ground.</a>
<a id='line_561'>    Thrice had Achilles Hector dragged the walls of Troy around,</a>
<a id='line_562'>    And o'er his body, reft of soul, was chaffering now for gold.</a>
<a id='line_563'>    Deep groaned Æneas from his heart in such wise to behold</a>
<a id='line_564'>    The car, the spoils, the very corpse of him, his fellow dead,</a>
<a id='line_565'>    To see the hands of Priam there all weaponless outspread.</a>
<a id='line_566'>    Yea, thrust amidst Achæan lords, his very self he knew;</a>
<a id='line_567'>    The Eastland hosts he saw, and arms of Memnon black of hue.</a>
<a id='line_568'>    There mad Penthesilea leads the maids of moony shield,               490</a>
<a id='line_569'>    The Amazons, and burns amidst the thousands of the field,</a>
<a id='line_570'>    And with her naked breast thrust out above the golden girth,</a>
<a id='line_571'>    The warrior maid hath heart to meet the warriors of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_572'></a>
<a id='line_573'>    But while Æneas, Dardan lord, beholds the marvels there,</a>
<a id='line_574'>    And, all amazed, stands moving nought with eyes in one set stare,</a>
<a id='line_575'>    Lo cometh Dido, very queen of fairest fashion wrought,</a>
<a id='line_576'>    By youths close thronging all about unto the temple brought.</a>
<a id='line_577'>    Yea, e'en as on Eurotas' rim or Cynthus' ridges high</a>
<a id='line_578'>    Diana leadeth dance about, a thousandfold anigh</a>
<a id='line_579'>    The following Oreads gather round, with shoulder quiver-hung         500</a>
<a id='line_580'>    She overbears the Goddesses her swift feet fare among,</a>
<a id='line_581'>    And great Latona's silent breast the joys of godhead touch.</a>
<a id='line_582'>    Lo, such was Dido; joyously she bore herself e'en such</a>
<a id='line_583'>    Amidst them, eager for the work and ordered rule to come;</a>
<a id='line_584'>    Then through the Goddess' door she passed, and midmost 'neath the dome,</a>
<a id='line_585'>    High raised upon a throne she sat, with weapons hedged about,</a>
<a id='line_586'>    And doomed, and fashioned laws for men, and fairly sifted out</a>
<a id='line_587'>    And dealt their share of toil to them, or drew the lot as happed.</a>
<a id='line_588'>    There suddenly Æneas sees amidst a concourse wrapped</a>
<a id='line_589'>    Antheus, Sergestus, and the strong Cloanthus draw anigh,             510</a>
<a id='line_590'>    And other Teucrians whom the whirl, wild, black, all utterly</a>
<a id='line_591'>    Had scattered into other lands afar across the sea.</a>
<a id='line_592'>    Amazed he stood, nor stricken was Achates less than he</a>
<a id='line_593'>    By joy, by fear: they hungered sore hand unto hand to set;</a>
<a id='line_594'>    But doubt of dealings that might be stirred in their hearts as yet;</a>
<a id='line_595'>    So lurking, cloaked in hollow cloud they note what things betide</a>
<a id='line_596'>    Their fellows there, and on what shore the ships they manned may bide,</a>
<a id='line_597'>    And whence they come; for chosen out of all the ships they bear</a>
<a id='line_598'>    Bidding of peace, and, crying out, thus temple-ward they fare.</a>
<a id='line_599'></a>
<a id='line_600'>    But now when they were entered in, and gained the grace of speech,   520</a>
<a id='line_601'>    From placid heart Ilioneus the elder 'gan beseech:</a>
<a id='line_602'>    "O Queen, to whom hath Jove here given a city new to raise,</a>
<a id='line_603'>    And with thy justice to draw rein on men of wilful ways,</a>
<a id='line_604'>    We wretched Trojans, tossed about by winds o'er every main,</a>
<a id='line_605'>    Pray thee forbid it from our ships, the dreadful fiery bane.</a>
<a id='line_606'>    Spare pious folk, and look on us with favouring kindly eyes!</a>
<a id='line_607'>    We are not come with sword to waste the Libyan families,</a>
<a id='line_608'>    Nor drive adown unto the strand the plunder of the strong:</a>
<a id='line_609'>    No such high hearts, such might of mind to vanquished folk belong.</a>
<a id='line_610'>    There is a place, Hesperia called of Greeks in days that are,        530</a>
<a id='line_611'>    An ancient land, a fruitful soil, a mighty land in war.</a>
<a id='line_612'>    Oenotrian folk first tilled the land, whose sons, as rumours run,</a>
<a id='line_613'>    Now call it nought but Italy from him who led them on.</a>
<a id='line_614'>    And thitherward our course was turned,</a>
<a id='line_615'>    When sudden, stormy, tumbling seas, Orion rose on us,</a>
<a id='line_616'>    And wholly scattering us abroad with fierce blasts from the south,</a>
<a id='line_617'>    Drave us, sea-swept, by shallows blind, to straits with wayless mouth:</a>
<a id='line_618'>    But to thy shores we few have swum, and so betake us here.</a>
<a id='line_619'>    What men among men are ye then? what country's soil may bear</a>
<a id='line_620'>    Such savage ways? ye grudge us then the welcome of your sand,        540</a>
<a id='line_621'>    And fall to arms, and gainsay us a tide-washed strip of strand.</a>
<a id='line_622'>    But if men-folk and wars of men ye wholly set at nought,</a>
<a id='line_623'>    Yet deem the Gods bear memory still of good and evil wrought</a>
<a id='line_624'>    Æneas was the king of us; no juster was there one,</a>
<a id='line_625'>    No better lover of the Gods, none more in battle shone:</a>
<a id='line_626'>    And if the Fates have saved that man, if earthly air he drink,</a>
<a id='line_627'>    Nor 'neath the cruel deadly shades his fallen body shrink,</a>
<a id='line_628'>    Nought need we fear, nor ye repent to strive in kindly deed</a>
<a id='line_629'>    With us: we have in Sicily fair cities to our need.</a>
<a id='line_630'>    And fields we have; Acestes high of Trojan blood is come.            550</a>
<a id='line_631'>    Now suffer us our shattered ships in haven to bring home,</a>
<a id='line_632'>    To cut us timber in thy woods, and shave us oars anew.</a>
<a id='line_633'>    Then if the Italian cruise to us, if friends and king are due,</a>
<a id='line_634'>    To Italy and Latium then full merry wend we on.</a>
<a id='line_635'>    But if, dear father of our folk, hope of thy health be gone,</a>
<a id='line_636'>    And thee the Libyan water have, nor hope Iulus give,</a>
<a id='line_637'>    Then the Sicanian shores at least, and seats wherein to live,</a>
<a id='line_638'>    Whence hither came we, and the King Acestes let us seek."</a>
<a id='line_639'></a>
<a id='line_640'>    So spake he, and the others made as they the same would speak,</a>
<a id='line_641'>    The Dardan-folk with murmuring mouth.                                560</a>
<a id='line_642'></a>
<a id='line_643'>    But Dido, with her head hung down, in few words answer gave:</a>
<a id='line_644'>    "Let fear fall from you, Teucrian men, and set your cares aside;</a>
<a id='line_645'>    Hard fortune yet constraineth me and this my realm untried</a>
<a id='line_646'>    To hold such heed, with guard to watch my marches up and down.</a>
<a id='line_647'>    Who knoweth not Æneas' folk? who knoweth not Troy-town,</a>
<a id='line_648'>    The valour, and the men, and all the flame of such a war?</a>
<a id='line_649'>    Nay, surely nought so dull as this the souls within us are,</a>
<a id='line_650'>    Nor turns the sun from Tyrian town, so far off yoking steed.</a>
<a id='line_651'>    So whether ye Hesperia great, and Saturn's acres need,</a>
<a id='line_652'>    Or rather unto Eryx turn, and King Acestes' shore,                   570</a>
<a id='line_653'>    Safe, holpen will I send you forth, and speed you with my store:</a>
<a id='line_654'>    Yea and moreover, have ye will in this my land to bide.</a>
<a id='line_655'>    This city that I build is yours: here leave your ships to ride:</a>
<a id='line_656'>    Trojan and Tyrian no two wise at hands of me shall fare.</a>
<a id='line_657'>    And would indeed the King himself, Æneas, with us were,</a>
<a id='line_658'>    Driven by that self-same southern gale: but sure men will I send,</a>
<a id='line_659'>    And bid them search through Libya from end to utmost end,</a>
<a id='line_660'>    Lest, cast forth anywhere, he stray by town or forest part."</a>
<a id='line_661'></a>
<a id='line_662'>    Father Æneas thereupon high lifted up his heart,</a>
<a id='line_663'>    Nor stout Achates less, and both were fain the cloud to break;       580</a>
<a id='line_664'>    And to Æneas first of all the leal Achates spake:</a>
<a id='line_665'></a>
<a id='line_666'>    "O Goddess-born, what thought hereof ariseth in thy mind?</a>
<a id='line_667'>    All safe thou seest thy ships; thy folk fair welcomed dost thou find:</a>
<a id='line_668'>    One is away, whom we ourselves saw sunken in the deep;</a>
<a id='line_669'>    But all things else the promised word thy mother gave us keep."</a>
<a id='line_670'></a>
<a id='line_671'>    Lo, even as he spake the word the cloud that wrapped them cleaves,</a>
<a id='line_672'>    And in the open space of heaven no dusk behind it leaves;</a>
<a id='line_673'>    And there Æneas stood and shone amid the daylight clear,</a>
<a id='line_674'>    With face and shoulders of a God: for loveliness of hair</a>
<a id='line_675'>    His mother breathed upon her son, and purple light of youth,         590</a>
<a id='line_676'>    And joyful glory of the eyes: e'en as in very sooth</a>
<a id='line_677'>    The hand gives ivory goodliness, or when the Parian stone,</a>
<a id='line_678'>    Or silver with the handicraft of yellow gold is done:</a>
<a id='line_679'>    And therewithal unto the Queen doth he begin to speak,</a>
<a id='line_680'>    Unlooked-for of all men:</a>
<a id='line_681'>                            "Lo here the very man ye seek,</a>
<a id='line_682'>    Trojan Æneas, caught away from Libyan seas of late!</a>
<a id='line_683'>    Thou, who alone of toils of Troy hast been compassionate,</a>
<a id='line_684'>    Who takest us, the leavings poor of Danaan sword, outworn</a>
<a id='line_685'>    With every hap of earth and sea, of every good forlorn,</a>
<a id='line_686'>    To city and to house of thine: to thank thee to thy worth,           600</a>
<a id='line_687'>    Dido, my might may compass not; nay, scattered o'er the earth</a>
<a id='line_688'>    The Dardan folk, for what thou dost may never give thee meed:</a>
<a id='line_689'>    But if somewhere a godhead is the righteous man to heed,</a>
<a id='line_690'>    If justice is, or any soul to note the right it wrought,</a>
<a id='line_691'>    May the Gods give thee due reward. What joyful ages brought</a>
<a id='line_692'>    Thy days to birth? what mighty ones gave such an one today?</a>
<a id='line_693'>    Now while the rivers seaward run, and while the shadows stray</a>
<a id='line_694'>    O'er hollow hills, and while the pole the stars is pasturing wide,</a>
<a id='line_695'>    Still shall thine honour and thy name, still shall thy praise abide</a>
<a id='line_696'>    What land soever calleth me."                                        610</a>
<a id='line_697'>                                  Therewith his right hand sought</a>
<a id='line_698'>    His very friend Ilioneus, his left Serestus caught,</a>
<a id='line_699'>    And then the others, Gyas strong, Cloanthus strong in fight.</a>
<a id='line_700'></a>
<a id='line_701'>    Sidonian Dido marvelled much, first at the hero's sight,</a>
<a id='line_702'>    Then marvelled at the haps he had, and so such word doth say:</a>
<a id='line_703'></a>
<a id='line_704'>    "O Goddess-born, what fate is this that ever dogs thy way</a>
<a id='line_705'>    With such great perils? What hath yoked thy life to this wild shore?</a>
<a id='line_706'>    And art thou that Æneas then, whom holy Venus bore</a>
<a id='line_707'>    Unto Anchises, Dardan lord, by Phrygian Simoïs' wave?</a>
<a id='line_708'>    Of Teucer unto Sidon come a memory yet I have,</a>
<a id='line_709'>    Who, driven from out his fatherland, was seeking new abode           620</a>
<a id='line_710'>    By Belus' help: but Belus then, my father, over-rode</a>
<a id='line_711'>    Cyprus the rich, and held the same as very conquering lord:</a>
<a id='line_712'>    So from that tide I knew of Troy and bitter Fate's award,</a>
<a id='line_713'>    I knew of those Pelasgian kings--yea, and I knew thy name.</a>
<a id='line_714'>    He then, a foeman, added praise to swell the Teucrian fame,</a>
<a id='line_715'>    And oft was glad to deem himself of ancient Teucer's line.</a>
<a id='line_716'>    So hasten now to enter in 'neath roofs of me and mine.</a>
<a id='line_717'>    Me too a fortune such as yours, me tossed by many a toil,</a>
<a id='line_718'>    Hath pleased to give abiding-place at last upon this soil,</a>
<a id='line_719'>    Learned in illhaps full wise am I unhappy men to aid."               630</a>
<a id='line_720'></a>
<a id='line_721'>    Such tale she told, and therewith led to house full kingly made</a>
<a id='line_722'>    Æneas, bidding therewithal the Gods with gifts to grace;</a>
<a id='line_723'>    Nor yet their fellows she forgat upon the sea-beat place,</a>
<a id='line_724'>    But sendeth them a twenty bulls, an hundred bristling backs</a>
<a id='line_725'>    Of swine, an hundred fatted lambs, whereof his ewe none lacks,</a>
<a id='line_726'>    And gifts and gladness of the God.</a>
<a id='line_727'>    Meanwhile the gleaming house within with kingly pomp is dight,</a>
<a id='line_728'>    And in the midmost of the hall a banquet they prepare:</a>
<a id='line_729'>    Cloths laboured o'er with handicraft, and purple proud is there;</a>
<a id='line_730'>    Great is the silver on the board, and carven out of gold             640</a>
<a id='line_731'>    The mighty deeds of father-folk, a long-drawn tale, is told,</a>
<a id='line_732'>    Brought down through many and many an one from when their race began.</a>
<a id='line_733'></a>
<a id='line_734'>    Æneas, through whose father's heart unquiet love there ran,</a>
<a id='line_735'>    Sent on the swift Achates now unto the ships to speed,</a>
<a id='line_736'>    To bear Ascanius all these haps, and townward him to lead;</a>
<a id='line_737'>    For on Ascanius well beloved was all his father's thought:</a>
<a id='line_738'>    And therewithal gifts good to give from Ilium's ruin caught</a>
<a id='line_739'>    He bade him bring: a cope all stiff with golden imagery;</a>
<a id='line_740'>    With saffron soft acanthus twine a veil made fair to see;</a>
<a id='line_741'>    The Argive Helen's braveries, brought from Mycenæ erst,              650</a>
<a id='line_742'>    When she was seeking Pergamos and wedding all accursed:</a>
<a id='line_743'>    Her mother Leda gave her these and marvellous they were.</a>
<a id='line_744'>    A sceptre too that Ilione in days agone did bear,</a>
<a id='line_745'>    The eldest-born of Priam's maids; a neckchain pearl bestrown,</a>
<a id='line_746'>    And, doubly wrought with gold and gems, a kingly-fashioned crown.</a>
<a id='line_747'>    So to the ships Achates went these matters forth to speed.</a>
<a id='line_748'></a>
<a id='line_749'>    But Cytherea in her heart turned over new-wrought rede,</a>
<a id='line_750'>    New craft; how, face and fashion changed, her son the very Love</a>
<a id='line_751'>    For sweet Ascanius should come forth, and, gift-giving, should move</a>
<a id='line_752'>    The Queen to madness, make her bones the yoke-fellows of flame.      660</a>
<a id='line_753'>    Forsooth the doubtful house she dreads, the two-tongued Tyrian name;</a>
<a id='line_754'>    And bitter Juno burneth her, and care the night doth wake:</a>
<a id='line_755'>    Now therefore to the winged Love such words as this she spake:</a>
<a id='line_756'></a>
<a id='line_757'>    "O son, my might, my only might, who fearest nought at all</a>
<a id='line_758'>    How his, the highest Father's bolts, Typhoeus' bane, may fall,</a>
<a id='line_759'>    To thee I flee, and suppliant so thy godhead's power beseech:</a>
<a id='line_760'>    Thy brother, e'en Æneas, tossed on every sea-side beach</a>
<a id='line_761'>    Thou knowest; all the fashioning of wrongful Juno's hate</a>
<a id='line_762'>    Thou knowest; oft upon my grief with sorrow wouldst thou wait.</a>
<a id='line_763'>    Him now Phoenician Dido holds, and with kind words enow              670</a>
<a id='line_764'>    Delays him there, but unto what Junonian welcomes grow</a>
<a id='line_765'>    I fear me: will she hold her hand when thus the hinge is dight?</a>
<a id='line_766'>    Now therefore am I compassing to catch their craft in flight,</a>
<a id='line_767'>    To ring the Queen about with flame that her no power may turn,</a>
<a id='line_768'>    That she may cling to me and sore for mine Æneas yearn.</a>
<a id='line_769'>    Now hearken how I counsel thee to bring about my will:</a>
<a id='line_770'>    The kingly boy his father calls, he whom I cherish still,</a>
<a id='line_771'>    To that Sidonian city now is ready dight to fare,</a>
<a id='line_772'>    And gifts, the gleanings of the sea and flames of Troy, doth bear,</a>
<a id='line_773'>    Whom soaked in sleep forthwith will I in high Cythera hide,          680</a>
<a id='line_774'>    Or in Idalium's holy place where I am wont to bide,</a>
<a id='line_775'>    Lest any one the guile should know and thrust themselves between:</a>
<a id='line_776'>    But thou with craft his fashion feign, and with his face be seen</a>
<a id='line_777'>    Well known of all, for no more space than one night's wearing by;</a>
<a id='line_778'>    And so, when Dido, gladdest grown, shall take thee up to lie</a>
<a id='line_779'>    Upon her breast 'twixt queenly board and great Lyæus' wave,</a>
<a id='line_780'>    And thou the winding of her arms and kisses sweet shalt have,</a>
<a id='line_781'>    Then breathe the hidden flame in her and forge thy venomed guile."</a>
<a id='line_782'></a>
<a id='line_783'>    His lovesome mother Love obeyed, and doffed his wings awhile,</a>
<a id='line_784'>    And as Iulus goeth now rejoicing on his way.                         690</a>
<a id='line_785'>    But Venus all Ascanius' limbs in quiet rest doth lay,</a>
<a id='line_786'>    And cherished in her goddess' breast unto Idalian groves</a>
<a id='line_787'>    She bears him, where the marjoram still soft about him moves</a>
<a id='line_788'>    And breatheth sweet from scented shade and blossoms on the air.</a>
<a id='line_789'>    Love wrought her will, and bearing now those royal gifts and rare,</a>
<a id='line_790'>    Unto the Tyrians joyous went, e'en as Achates led.</a>
<a id='line_791'>    But when he came into the house, there on her golden bed</a>
<a id='line_792'>    With hangings proud Queen Dido lay amidmost of the place:</a>
<a id='line_793'>    The father then, Æneas, then the youth of Trojan race,</a>
<a id='line_794'>    There gather, and their bodies cast on purple spread abroad.         700</a>
<a id='line_795'>    Folk serve them water for their hands, and speed the baskets stored</a>
<a id='line_796'>    With Ceres, and the towels soft of close-clipped nap they bear.</a>
<a id='line_797'>    Within were fifty serving-maids, whose long array had care</a>
<a id='line_798'>    To furnish forth the meat and drink, and feed the house-gods' flame;</a>
<a id='line_799'>    An hundred more, and youths withal of age and tale the same,</a>
<a id='line_800'>    Set on the meat upon the board and lay the cups about.</a>
<a id='line_801'>    And now through that wide joyous door came thronging from without</a>
<a id='line_802'>    The Tyrians, and, so bidden, lie on benches painted fair.</a>
<a id='line_803'>    They wonder at Æneas' gifts, and at Iulus there,</a>
<a id='line_804'>    The flaming countenance of God, and speech so feigned and fine;      710</a>
<a id='line_805'>    They wonder at the cope and veil with that acanthus twine.</a>
<a id='line_806'>    And chiefly that unhappy one doomed to the coming ill,</a>
<a id='line_807'>    Nor hungry hollow of her heart nor burning eyes may fill</a>
<a id='line_808'>    With all beholding: gifts and child alike her heart do move.</a>
<a id='line_809'>    But he, when he had satisfied his feignèd father's love,</a>
<a id='line_810'>    And clipped Æneas all about, and round his neck had hung,</a>
<a id='line_811'>    Went to the Queen, who with her eyes and heart about him clung,</a>
<a id='line_812'>    And whiles would strain him to her breast--poor Dido! knowing nought</a>
<a id='line_813'>    What God upon her bosom sat; who ever had in thought</a>
<a id='line_814'>    His Acidalian mother's word, and slowly did begin                    720</a>
<a id='line_815'>    To end Sychæus quite, and with a living love to win</a>
<a id='line_816'>    Her empty soul at rest, and heart unused a weary tide.</a>
<a id='line_817'></a>
<a id='line_818'>    But when the feasting first was stayed, and boards were done aside,</a>
<a id='line_819'>    Great beakers there they set afoot, and straight the wine they crowned.</a>
<a id='line_820'>    A shout goes up within the house, great noise they roll around</a>
<a id='line_821'>    The mighty halls: the candles hang adown from golden roof</a>
<a id='line_822'>    All lighted, and the torches' flame keeps dusky night aloof.</a>
<a id='line_823'>    And now a heavy bowl of gold and gems the Queen bade bring</a>
<a id='line_824'>    And fill with all unwatered wine, which erst used Belus king,        729</a>
<a id='line_825'>    And all from Belus come: therewith through the hushed house she said:</a>
<a id='line_826'></a>
<a id='line_827'>    "O Jupiter! they say by thee the guesting laws were made;</a>
<a id='line_828'>    Make thou this day to Tyrian folk, and folk come forth from Troy,</a>
<a id='line_829'>    A happy day, and may our sons remember this our joy!</a>
<a id='line_830'>    Mirth-giver Bacchus, fail thou not from midst our mirth! be kind,</a>
<a id='line_831'>    O Juno! and ye Tyrian folk, be glad this bond to bind!"</a>
<a id='line_832'></a>
<a id='line_833'>    She spake, and on the table poured the glorious wave of wine,</a>
<a id='line_834'>    Then touched the topmost of the bowl with dainty lip and fine,</a>
<a id='line_835'>    And, egging on, to Bitias gave: nought slothful to be told</a>
<a id='line_836'>    The draught he drained, who bathed himself within the foaming gold;</a>
<a id='line_837'>    Then drank the other lords of them: long-haired Iopas then           740</a>
<a id='line_838'>    Maketh the golden harp to sing, whom Atlas most of men</a>
<a id='line_839'>    Erst taught: he sings the wandering moon and toiling of the sun,</a>
<a id='line_840'>    And whence the kind of men and beasts, how rain and fire begun,</a>
<a id='line_841'>    Arcturus, the wet Hyades, and twin-wrought Northern Bears:</a>
<a id='line_842'>    And why so swift the winter sun unto his sea-bath fares,</a>
<a id='line_843'>    And what delayeth night so long upon the daylight's hem.</a>
<a id='line_844'>    Then praise on praise the Tyrians shout, the Trojans follow them.</a>
<a id='line_845'></a>
<a id='line_846'>    Meanwhile unhappy Dido wore the night-tide as it sank</a>
<a id='line_847'>    In diverse talk, and evermore long draughts of love she drank,</a>
<a id='line_848'>    And many a thing of Priam asked, of Hector many a thing:             750</a>
<a id='line_849'>    With what-like arms Aurora's son had come unto the King;</a>
<a id='line_850'>    What were the steeds of Diomed, how great Achilles was.</a>
<a id='line_851'>    At last she said:</a>
<a id='line_852'>                      "But come, O guest, tell all that came to pass</a>
<a id='line_853'>    From earliest tide; of Danaan craft, and how thy land was lorn,</a>
<a id='line_854'>    And thine own wanderings; for as now the seventh year is worn</a>
<a id='line_855'>    That thee a-straying wide away o'er earth and sea hath borne."</a>

<a id='line_862'>ARGUMENT.</a>
<a id='line_863'></a>
<a id='line_864'>ÆNEAS TELLETH TO DIDO AND THE TYRIANS THE STORY OF TROY'S OVERTHROW.</a>
<a id='line_865'></a>
<a id='line_866'></a>
<a id='line_867'>    All hearkened hushed, and fixed on him was every face of man,</a>
<a id='line_868'>    As from the couch high set aloft Æneas thus began:</a>
<a id='line_869'></a>
<a id='line_870'>    "Unutterable grief, O Queen, thou biddest me renew</a>
<a id='line_871'>    The falling of the Trojan weal and realm that all shall rue</a>
<a id='line_872'>    'Neath Danaan might; which thing myself unhappy did behold,</a>
<a id='line_873'>    Yea, and was no small part thereof. What man might hear it told</a>
<a id='line_874'>    Of Dolopes, or Myrmidons, or hard Ulysses' band,</a>
<a id='line_875'>    And keep the tears back? Dewy night now falleth from the land</a>
<a id='line_876'>    Of heaven, and all the setting stars are bidding us to sleep:</a>
<a id='line_877'>    But if to know our evil hap thy longing is so deep,                   10</a>
<a id='line_878'>    If thou wilt hear a little word of Troy's last agony,</a>
<a id='line_879'>    Though memory shuddereth, and my heart shrunk up in grief doth lie,</a>
<a id='line_880'>    I will begin.</a>
<a id='line_881'>                 By battle broke, and thrust aback by Fate</a>
<a id='line_882'>    Through all the wearing of the years, the Danaan lords yet wait</a>
<a id='line_883'>    And build a horse up mountain-huge by Pallas' art divine,</a>
<a id='line_884'>    Fair fashioning the ribs thereof with timbers of the pine,</a>
<a id='line_885'>    And feign it vowed for safe return, and let the fame fly forth.</a>
<a id='line_886'>    Herein by stealth a sort of men chosen for bodies' worth</a>
<a id='line_887'>    Amid its darkness do they shut; the caverns inly lost</a>
<a id='line_888'>    Deep in the belly of the thing they fill with armed host.             20</a>
<a id='line_889'></a>
<a id='line_890'>    In sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an island known of all,</a>
<a id='line_891'>    And rich in wealth before the realm of Priam had its fall,</a>
<a id='line_892'>    Now but a bay and roadstead poor, where scarcely ships may ride.</a>
<a id='line_893'>    So thither now they sail away in desert place to hide.</a>
<a id='line_894'>    We thought them gone, and that they sought Mycenæ on a wind,</a>
<a id='line_895'>    Whereat the long-drawn grief of Troy fell off from every mind.</a>
<a id='line_896'></a>
<a id='line_897'>    The gates are opened; sweet it is the Dorian camp to see,</a>
<a id='line_898'>    The dwellings waste, the shore all void where they were wont to be:</a>
<a id='line_899'>    Here dwelt the band of Dolopes, here was Achilles set,                29</a>
<a id='line_900'>    And this was where their ships were beached; here edge to edge we met.</a>
<a id='line_901'>    Some wonder at unwedded maid Minerva's gift of death,</a>
<a id='line_902'>    That baneful mountain of a horse; and first Thymoetes saith</a>
<a id='line_903'>    'Twere good in walls to lead the thing, on topmost burg to stand;</a>
<a id='line_904'>    Whether such word the fate of Troy or evil treason planned</a>
<a id='line_905'>    I know not: Capys and the rest, who better counsel have,</a>
<a id='line_906'>    Bid take the fashioned guile of Greeks, the doubtful gift they gave,</a>
<a id='line_907'>    To tumble it adown to sea, with piled-up fire to burn,</a>
<a id='line_908'>    Or bore the belly of the beast its hidden holes to learn;</a>
<a id='line_909'>    So cleft atwain is rede of men abiding there in doubt.</a>
<a id='line_910'></a>
<a id='line_911'>    But first before all others now with much folk all about              40</a>
<a id='line_912'>    Laocoon the fiery man runs from the burg adown,</a>
<a id='line_913'>    And shouts from far:</a>
<a id='line_914'>                        'O wretched men, how hath such madness grown?</a>
<a id='line_915'>    Deem ye the foe hath fared away? Deem ye that Danaan gifts</a>
<a id='line_916'>    May ever lack due share of guile? Are these Ulysses' shifts?</a>
<a id='line_917'>    For either the Achæans lurk within this fashioned tree,</a>
<a id='line_918'>    Or 'tis an engine wrought with craft bane of our walls to be,</a>
<a id='line_919'>    To look into our very homes, and scale the town perforce:</a>
<a id='line_920'>    Some guile at least therein abides: Teucrians, trust not the horse!</a>
<a id='line_921'>    Whatso it is, the Danaan folk, yea gift-bearing I fear.'              49</a>
<a id='line_922'></a>
<a id='line_923'>    Thus having said, with valiant might he hurled a huge-wrought spear</a>
<a id='line_924'>    Against the belly of the beast swelled out with rib and stave;</a>
<a id='line_925'>    It stood a-trembling therewithal; its hollow caverns gave</a>
<a id='line_926'>    From womb all shaken with the stroke a mighty sounding groan.</a>
<a id='line_927'>    And but for God's heart turned from us, for God's fate fixed and known,</a>
<a id='line_928'>    He would have led us on with steel to foul the Argive den,</a>
<a id='line_929'>    And thou, O Troy, wert standing now, thou Priam's burg as then!</a>
<a id='line_930'></a>
<a id='line_931'>    But lo, where Dardan shepherds lead, with plenteous clamour round,</a>
<a id='line_932'>    A young man unto Priam's place with hands behind him bound,</a>
<a id='line_933'>    Who privily had thrust himself before their way e'en now</a>
<a id='line_934'>    The work to crown, and into Troy an open way to show                  60</a>
<a id='line_935'>    Unto the Greeks; a steadfast soul, prepared for either end,</a>
<a id='line_936'>    Or utterly to work his craft or unto death to bend.</a>
<a id='line_937'>    Eager to see him as he went around the Trojans flock</a>
<a id='line_938'>    On every side, and each with each contend the man to mock.</a>
<a id='line_939'>    Lo now, behold the Danaan guile, and from one wrong they wrought</a>
<a id='line_940'>    Learn ye what all are like to be.</a>
<a id='line_941'>    For as he stood in sight of all, bewildered, weaponless,</a>
<a id='line_942'>    And let his eyes go all around the gazing Phrygian press,</a>
<a id='line_943'>    He spake:</a>
<a id='line_944'>             'What land shall have me now, what sea my head shall hide?</a>
<a id='line_945'>    What then is left of deed to do that yet I must abide?                70</a>
<a id='line_946'>    No place I have among the Greeks, and Dardan folk withal</a>
<a id='line_947'>    My foemen are, and bloody end, due doom, upon me call.'</a>
<a id='line_948'></a>
<a id='line_949'>    And with that wail our hearts were turned, and somewhat backward hung</a>
<a id='line_950'>    The press of men: we bade him say from whence his blood was sprung,</a>
<a id='line_951'>    And what he did, and if indeed a captive we might trust;</a>
<a id='line_952'>    So thus he spake when now all fear from off his heart was thrust:</a>
<a id='line_953'></a>
<a id='line_954'>    'Whatso betide, to thee, O King, the matter's verity</a>
<a id='line_955'>    Will I lay bare unto the end, nor Argive blood deny:</a>
<a id='line_956'>    This firstly; for if Fate indeed shaped Sinon for all bale</a>
<a id='line_957'>    To make him liar and empty fool her worst may not avail.              80</a>
<a id='line_958'>    Perchance a rumour of men's talk about your ears hath gone,</a>
<a id='line_959'>    Telling of Palamedes' fame and glory that he won,</a>
<a id='line_960'>    The son of Belus: traitors' word undid him innocent;</a>
<a id='line_961'>    By unjust doom for banning war the way of death he went,</a>
<a id='line_962'>    Slain by Pelasgian men, that now his quenchèd light deplore.</a>
<a id='line_963'>    Fellow to him, and nigh akin, I went unto the war,</a>
<a id='line_964'>    Sent by my needy father forth, e'en from my earliest years;</a>
<a id='line_965'>    Now while he reigned in health, a king fair blooming mid his peers</a>
<a id='line_966'>    In council of the kings, I too had share of name and worth.</a>
<a id='line_967'>    But after he had gone his way from land of upper earth,               90</a>
<a id='line_968'>    Thrust down by sly Ulysses' hate, (I tell all men's belief),</a>
<a id='line_969'>    Then beaten down I dragged my life through shadowy ways of grief,</a>
<a id='line_970'>    And heavily I took the death of him my sackless friend,</a>
<a id='line_971'>    Nor held my peace, O fool! but vowed revenge if time should send</a>
<a id='line_972'>    A happy tide; if I should come to Argos any more,</a>
<a id='line_973'>    A victor then: so with my words I drew down hatred sore.</a>
<a id='line_974'>    This was the first fleck of my ill; Ulysses ever now</a>
<a id='line_975'>    Would threaten with some new-found guilt, and mid the folk would sow</a>
<a id='line_976'>    Dark sayings, and knowing what was toward, sought weapons new at need;</a>
<a id='line_977'>    Nor wearied till with Calchas now to help him to the deed.--         100</a>
<a id='line_978'>    --But why upturn these ugly things, or spin out time for nought?</a>
<a id='line_979'>    For if ye deem all Greekish men in one same mould are wrought:</a>
<a id='line_980'>    It is enough. Come make an end; Ulysses' hope fulfil!</a>
<a id='line_981'>    With great price would the Atridæ buy such working of their will.'</a>
<a id='line_982'></a>
<a id='line_983'>    Then verily to know the thing and reach it deep we burned,</a>
<a id='line_984'>    So little in Pelasgian guile and evil were we learned.</a>
<a id='line_985'>    He takes the tale up; fluttering-voiced from lying heart he speaks:</a>
<a id='line_986'></a>
<a id='line_987'>    'The longing to be gone from Troy fell oft upon the Greeks,</a>
<a id='line_988'>    And oft they fain had turned their backs on war without an end,</a>
<a id='line_989'>    (I would they had), and oft as they were e'en at point to wend       110</a>
<a id='line_990'>    A tempest would forbid the sea, or southern gale would scare,</a>
<a id='line_991'>    And chiefly when with maple-beams this horse that standeth here</a>
<a id='line_992'>    They fashioned, mighty din of storm did all the heavens fulfil.</a>
<a id='line_993'>    So held aback, Eurypylus we sent to learn the will</a>
<a id='line_994'>    Of Phoebus: from the shrine he brought such heavy words as these:</a>
<a id='line_995'>    _With blood and with a virgin's death did ye the winds appease_</a>
<a id='line_996'>    _When first ye came, O Danaan folk, unto the Ilian shore;_</a>
<a id='line_997'>    _With blood and with an Argive soul the Gods shall ye adore_</a>
<a id='line_998'>    _For your return._</a>
<a id='line_999'>                    'Now when that word men's ears had gone about</a>
<a id='line_1000'>    Their hearts stood still, and tremors cold took all their bones for doubt</a>
<a id='line_1001'>    What man the Fates had doomed thereto, what man Apollo would.        121</a>
<a id='line_1002'>    Amidst us then the Ithacan drags in with clamour rude</a>
<a id='line_1003'>    Calchas the seer, and wearieth him the Gods' will to declare.</a>
<a id='line_1004'>    Of that craftsmaster's cruel guile had many bade beware</a>
<a id='line_1005'>    In words, and many silently foresaw the coming death.</a>
<a id='line_1006'>    Twice five days Calchas holdeth peace and, hidden, gainsayeth</a>
<a id='line_1007'>    To speak the word that any man to very death should cast,</a>
<a id='line_1008'>    Till hardly, by Ulysses' noise sore driven, at the last</a>
<a id='line_1009'>    He brake out with the speech agreed, and on me laid the doom;</a>
<a id='line_1010'>    All cried assent, and what each man feared on himself might come,    130</a>
<a id='line_1011'>    'Gainst one poor wretch's end of days with ready hands they bear.</a>
<a id='line_1012'>    Now came the evil day; for me the rites do men prepare,</a>
<a id='line_1013'>    The salted cakes, the holy strings to do my brows about.</a>
<a id='line_1014'>    I needs must say I brake my bonds, from Death's house gat me out,</a>
<a id='line_1015'>    And night-long lay amid the sedge by muddy marish side</a>
<a id='line_1016'>    Till they spread sail, if they perchance should win their sailing tide.</a>
<a id='line_1017'>    Nor have I hope to see again my fatherland of old;</a>
<a id='line_1018'>    My longed-for father and sweet sons I never shall behold;</a>
<a id='line_1019'>    On whom the guilt of me who fled mayhappen men will lay,</a>
<a id='line_1020'>    And with their death for my default the hapless ones shall pay.      140</a>
<a id='line_1021'>    But by the might of very God, all sooth that knoweth well,</a>
<a id='line_1022'>    By all the unstained faith that yet mid mortal men doth dwell,</a>
<a id='line_1023'>    If aught be left, I pray you now to pity such distress!</a>
<a id='line_1024'>    Pity a heart by troubles tried beyond its worthiness!'</a>
<a id='line_1025'></a>
<a id='line_1026'>    His weeping won his life of us, and pity thereunto,</a>
<a id='line_1027'>    And Priam was the first who bade his irons to undo,</a>
<a id='line_1028'>    And hand-bonds, and in friendly words unto the man he speaks:</a>
<a id='line_1029'></a>
<a id='line_1030'>    'Whoso thou art, henceforward now forget thy missing Greeks;</a>
<a id='line_1031'>    Thou shalt be ours: but learn me now, who fain the sooth would wot,</a>
<a id='line_1032'>    Wherefore they built this world of horse, what craftsman him begot,  150</a>
<a id='line_1033'>    And what to do? What gift for Gods; what gin of war is he?'</a>

<a id='line_1035'>    He spake. The other, wise in guile and Greekish treachery,</a>
<a id='line_1036'>    Both palms of his from bonds new-freed raised toward the stars above,</a>
<a id='line_1037'>    And, 'O eternal fires!' he cried, 'O might that none may move,</a>

<a id='line_1048'>    When godless Diomed and he, well-spring of wickedness,</a>
<a id='line_1049'>    Ulysses, brake the holy place that they by stealth might gain</a>
<a id='line_1050'>    The fate-fulfilled Palladium, when, all the burg-guards slain,</a>
<a id='line_1051'>    They caught the holy image up, and durst their bloody hands</a>
<a id='line_1052'>    Lay on the awful Goddess there and touch her holy bands:</a>
<a id='line_1053'>    The flood-tide of the Danaan hope ebbed from that very day;</a>
<a id='line_1054'>    Might failed them, and the Goddess-maid turned all her heart away:   170</a>
<a id='line_1055'>    Token whereof Tritonia gave by portent none might doubt:</a>
<a id='line_1056'>    Scarce was the image set in camp when suddenly flashed out</a>
<a id='line_1057'>    Fierce fire from staring eyes of her, and salt sweat oozed and fell</a>
<a id='line_1058'>    O'er all her limbs, and she from earth, O wonderful to tell!</a>
<a id='line_1059'>    Leapt thrice, still holding in her hand the quivering spear and shield:</a>
<a id='line_1060'>    Then Calchas bade us turn to flight across the wavy field,</a>
<a id='line_1061'>    Singing how ruin of Pergamos the Argive steel shall lack,</a>
<a id='line_1062'>    Till Argos give the signs again, and we the God bring back</a>
<a id='line_1063'>    In hollow of the curved keel across the tumbling main.</a>
<a id='line_1064'>    And this is why they sought their home, Mycenæ's land, again,        180</a>
<a id='line_1065'>    And there they dight them arms and God, and presently unwares</a>
<a id='line_1066'>    Will be on you across the sea--Calchas such doom declares.</a>
<a id='line_1067'>    So warned hereby for Godhead's hurt, in stolen Palladium's stead,</a>
<a id='line_1068'>    Atonement for their heavy guilt, this horse they fashionèd.</a>
<a id='line_1069'>    But him indeed did Calchas bid to pile so mountain-high</a>
<a id='line_1070'>    With such a might of mingled beams, and lead up to the sky,</a>
<a id='line_1071'>    Lest it within the gates should come, or mid the walls, and lest</a>
<a id='line_1072'>    Beneath their ancient Pallas-faith the people safe should rest.</a>
<a id='line_1073'>    For if upon Minerva's gift ye lay a godless hand,</a>
<a id='line_1074'>    Then mighty ruin (and would to God before his face might stand       190</a>
<a id='line_1075'>    That ruin instead) on Priam's might, and Phrygian folk shall fall.</a>
<a id='line_1076'>    But if your hands shall lead it up within the city wall,</a>
<a id='line_1077'>    Then Asia, free and willing it, to Pelops' house shall come</a>
<a id='line_1078'>    With mighty war; and that same fate our sons shall follow home.'</a>
<a id='line_1079'></a>
<a id='line_1080'>    Caught by such snares and crafty guile of Sinon the forsworn,</a>
<a id='line_1081'>    By lies and lies, and tears forced forth there were we overborne;</a>
<a id='line_1082'>    We, whom Tydides might not tame, nor Larissæan king</a>

<a id='line_1084'></a>
<a id='line_1085'>    But now another, greater hap, a very birth of fear,</a>
<a id='line_1086'>    Was thrust before us wretched ones, our sightless hearts to stir.    200</a>
<a id='line_1087'>    Laocoon, chosen out by lot for mighty Neptune's priest,</a>
<a id='line_1088'>    Would sacrifice a mighty bull at altars of the feast;</a>
<a id='line_1089'>    When lo, away from Tenedos, o'er quiet of the main</a>
<a id='line_1090'>    (I tremble in the tale) we see huge coils of serpents twain</a>
<a id='line_1091'>    Breasting the sea, and side by side swift making for the shore;</a>
<a id='line_1092'>    Whose fronts amid the flood were strained, and high their crests upbore</a>
<a id='line_1093'>    Blood-red above the waves, the rest swept o'er the sea behind,</a>
<a id='line_1094'>    And all the unmeasured backs of them coil upon coil they wind,</a>
<a id='line_1095'>    While sends the sea great sound of foam. And now the meads they gained,</a>
<a id='line_1096'>    The burning eyes with flecks of blood and streaks of fire are stained,</a>
<a id='line_1097'>    Their mouths with hisses all fulfilled are licked by flickering tongue.  211</a>
<a id='line_1098'>    Bloodless we flee the sight, but they fare steadfastly along</a>
<a id='line_1099'>    Unto Laocoon; and first each serpent round doth reach</a>
<a id='line_1100'>    One little body of his sons, and knitting each to each,</a>
<a id='line_1101'>    And winding round and round about, the unhappy body gnaws:</a>
<a id='line_1102'>    And then himself, as sword in hand anigh for help he draws,</a>
<a id='line_1103'>    They seize and bind about in coils most huge, and presently</a>
<a id='line_1104'>    Are folded twice about his midst, twice round his neck they tie</a>
<a id='line_1105'>    Their scaly backs, and hang above with head and toppling mane,</a>
<a id='line_1106'>    While he both striveth with his hands to rend their folds atwain,    220</a>
<a id='line_1107'>    His fillets covered o'er with blood and venom black and fell,</a>
<a id='line_1108'>    And starward sendeth forth withal a cry most horrible,</a>
<a id='line_1109'>    The roaring of a wounded bull who flees the altar-horn</a>
<a id='line_1110'>    And shaketh from his crest away the axe unhandy borne.</a>
<a id='line_1111'></a>
<a id='line_1112'>    But fleeing to the shrines on high do those two serpents glide,</a>
<a id='line_1113'>    And reach the hard Tritonia's house, and therewithin they hide</a>
<a id='line_1114'>    Beneath the Goddess' very feet and orbèd shield of dread;</a>
<a id='line_1115'>    Then through our quaking hearts indeed afresh the terror spread,</a>
<a id='line_1116'>    And all men say Laocoon hath paid but worthily</a>
<a id='line_1117'>    For guilt of his, and hurt of steel upon the holy tree,              230</a>
<a id='line_1118'>    When that unhappy wicked spear against its flank he threw.</a>
<a id='line_1119'>    They cry to lead the image on to holy house and due,</a>
<a id='line_1120'>    And Pallas' godhead to adore.</a>
<a id='line_1121'>    We break adown our rampart walls and bare the very town:</a>
<a id='line_1122'>    All gird themselves unto the work, set wheels that it may glide</a>
<a id='line_1123'>    Beneath his feet, about his neck the hempen bond is tied</a>
<a id='line_1124'>    To warp it on: up o'er the walls so climbs the fateful thing</a>
<a id='line_1125'>    Fruitful of arms; and boys about and unwed maidens sing</a>
<a id='line_1126'>    The holy songs, and deem it joy hand on the ropes to lay.</a>
<a id='line_1127'>    It enters; through the city's midst it wends its evil way.           240</a>
<a id='line_1128'>    --O land! O Ilium, house of Gods! O glorious walls of war!</a>
<a id='line_1129'>    O Dardan walls!--four times amidst the threshold of our door</a>
<a id='line_1130'>    It stood: four times with sound of arms the belly of it rung;</a>
<a id='line_1131'>    But heedless, maddened hearts and blind, hard on the ropes we hung,</a>
<a id='line_1132'>    Nor but amidst the holy burg the monster's feet we stay.</a>
<a id='line_1133'>    And then Cassandra oped her mouth to tell the fateful day,--</a>
<a id='line_1134'>    Her mouth that by the Gods' own doom the Teucrians ne'er might trow.</a>
<a id='line_1135'>    Then on this day that was our last we bear the joyous bough,</a>
<a id='line_1136'>    Poor wretches! through the town to deck each godhead's holy place.</a>

<a id='line_1138'>    Meanwhile the heavens are faring round, night falls on ocean's face,  250</a>
<a id='line_1139'>    Enwrapping in her mighty shade all earthly things and sky,</a>

<a id='line_1141'>    Through all the town, and Sleep her arms o'er wearied bodies slips.</a>
<a id='line_1142'></a>
<a id='line_1143'>    And now the Argive host comes forth upon its ordered ships</a>
<a id='line_1144'>    From Tenedos, all hushed amid the kind moon's silent ways,</a>

<a id='line_1285'>    From gathering anger of the thing and swelling neck of blue:</a>
<a id='line_1286'>    So, quaking at the sight of us, Androgeus backward drew.</a>
<a id='line_1287'>    But we fall on with serried arms and round their rout we crowd,</a>
<a id='line_1288'>    And fell them knowing nought the place, and with all terror cowed:</a>
<a id='line_1289'>    So sweet the breath of fortune was on our first handicraft.</a>
<a id='line_1290'></a>
<a id='line_1291'>    But with good-hap and hardihood Coroebus' spirit laughed;</a>
<a id='line_1292'>    'Come, fellows, follow up,' he cries, 'the way that fortune shows</a>
<a id='line_1293'>    This first of times, and where belike a little kind she grows.</a>
<a id='line_1294'>    Change we our shields, and do on us the tokens of the Greeks;</a>
<a id='line_1295'>    Whether with fraud or force he play what man of foeman seeks,        390</a>
<a id='line_1296'>    Yea, these themselves shall give us arms.'</a>
<a id='line_1297'>                                             He spake, and forth did bear</a>
<a id='line_1298'>    Androgeus' high-crested helm and shield emblazoned fair,</a>
<a id='line_1299'>    And did it on, and Argive sword he girt unto his thigh:</a>
<a id='line_1300'>    So Rhipeus did, and Dymas did, and all did joyously,</a>
<a id='line_1301'>    And each man wholly armed himself with plunder newly won.</a>
<a id='line_1302'>    Then mingled with the Greeks we fare, and no God helps us on,</a>
<a id='line_1303'>    And many a battle there we join amid the eyeless night,</a>
<a id='line_1304'>    And many a Danaan send adown to Orcus from the light:</a>
<a id='line_1305'>    Some fled away unto the ships, some to the safe sea-shore,           399</a>
<a id='line_1306'>    Or smitten with the coward's dread climbed the great horse once more</a>
<a id='line_1307'>    And there they lie all close within the well-known womb of wood.</a>
<a id='line_1308'></a>
<a id='line_1309'>    Alas! what skills it man to trust in Gods compelled to good?</a>
<a id='line_1310'>    For lo, Cassandra, Priam's maid, with hair cast all about,</a>
<a id='line_1311'>    From Pallas' house and innermost of holy place dragged out,</a>
<a id='line_1312'>    And straining with her burning eyes in vain to heaven aloft;</a>
<a id='line_1313'>    Her eyes, for they in bonds had bound her tender palms and soft.</a>
<a id='line_1314'>    Nought bore Coroebus' maddened mind to see that show go by,</a>
<a id='line_1315'>    And in the middle of their host he flung himself to die,</a>
<a id='line_1316'>    And all we follow and fall on with points together set.</a>
<a id='line_1317'>    And first from that high temple-top great overthrow we get           410</a>
<a id='line_1318'>    From weapons of our friends, and thence doth hapless death arise</a>
<a id='line_1319'>    From error of the Greekish crests and armour's Greekish guise;</a>
<a id='line_1320'>    Then crying out for taken maid, fulfilled thereat with wrath,</a>
<a id='line_1321'>    The gathered Greeks fall in on us: comes keenest Ajax forth;</a>
<a id='line_1322'>    The sons of Atreus, all the host of Dolopes are there:--</a>
<a id='line_1323'>    As whiles, the knit whirl broken up, the winds together bear</a>
<a id='line_1324'>    And strive, the West wind and the South, the East wind glad and free</a>
<a id='line_1325'>    With Eastland steeds; sore groan the woods; and Nereus stirs the sea</a>
<a id='line_1326'>    From lowest deeps, and trident shakes, and foams upon the wave:--</a>
<a id='line_1327'>    They even to whom by night and cloud great overthrow we gave,        420</a>
<a id='line_1328'>    Through craft of ours, and drave about through all the town that while,</a>
<a id='line_1329'>    Now show themselves, and know our shields and weapons worn for guile</a>
<a id='line_1330'>    The first of all; our mouths unmeet for Greekish speech they tell</a>
<a id='line_1331'>    Then o'er us sweeps the multitude; and first Coroebus fell</a>
<a id='line_1332'>    By Peneleus before the Maid who ever in the fight</a>
<a id='line_1333'>    Prevaileth most; fell Rhipeus there, the heedfullest of right</a>
<a id='line_1334'>    Of all among the Teucrian folk, the justest man of men;</a>
<a id='line_1335'>    The Gods deemed otherwise. Dymas and Hypanis died then,</a>
<a id='line_1336'>    Shot through by friends, and not a whit availed to cover thee,</a>
<a id='line_1337'>    O Panthus, thine Apollo's bands or plenteous piety.                  430</a>
<a id='line_1338'>    Ashes of Ilium, ye last flames where my beloved ones burned,</a>
<a id='line_1339'>    Bear witness mid your overthrow my face was never turned</a>
<a id='line_1340'>    From Danaan steel and Danaan deed! if fate had willed it so</a>
<a id='line_1341'>    That I should fall, I earned my wage.</a>
<a id='line_1342'>                                         Borne thence away, we go</a>
<a id='line_1343'>    Pelias and Iphitus and I; but Iphitus was spent</a>
<a id='line_1344'>    By eld, and by Ulysses' hurt half halting Pelias went.</a>
<a id='line_1345'>    So unto Priam's house we come, called by the clamour there,</a>
<a id='line_1346'>    Where such a mighty battle was as though none otherwhere</a>
<a id='line_1347'>    Yet burned: as though none others fell in all the town beside.</a>
<a id='line_1348'>    There all unbridled Mars we saw, the Danaans driving wide            440</a>
<a id='line_1349'>    Against the house; with shield-roofs' rush the doors thereof beset.</a>
<a id='line_1350'>    The ladders cling unto the walls, men by the door-posts get</a>
<a id='line_1351'>    Some foothold up; with shielded left they meet the weapons' rain,</a>
<a id='line_1352'>    While on the battlements above grip with the right they gain.</a>
<a id='line_1353'>    The Dardans on the other side pluck roof and pinnacle</a>
<a id='line_1354'>    From off the house; with such-like shot they now, beholding well</a>
<a id='line_1355'>    The end anigh, all death at hand, make ready for the play:</a>
<a id='line_1356'>    And gilded beams, the pomp and joy of fathers passed away.</a>
<a id='line_1357'>    They roll adown, and other some with naked point and edge</a>
<a id='line_1358'>    The nether doorways of the place in close arrayment hedge.           450</a>
<a id='line_1359'>    Blazed up our hearts again to aid this palace of a king,</a>
<a id='line_1360'>    To stead their toil, to vanquished men a little help to bring.</a>
<a id='line_1361'></a>
<a id='line_1362'>    A door there was, a secret pass into the common way</a>
<a id='line_1363'>    Of all King Priam's houses there, that at the backward lay</a>
<a id='line_1364'>    As one goes by: in other days, while yet the lordship was,</a>
<a id='line_1365'>    Hapless Andromache thereby unto the twain would pass</a>
<a id='line_1366'>    Alone, or leading to the king Astyanax her boy.</a>
<a id='line_1367'>    And thereby now I gain the tower, whence wretched men of Troy</a>
<a id='line_1368'>    In helpless wise from out their hands were casting darts aloof.</a>
<a id='line_1369'>    There was a tower, a sheer height down, builded from highest roof     460</a>
<a id='line_1370'>    Up toward the stars; whence we were wont on Troy to look adown,</a>
<a id='line_1371'>    And thence away the Danaan ships, the Achæan tented town.</a>
<a id='line_1372'>    Against the highest stage hereof the steel about we bear,</a>
<a id='line_1373'>    Just where the joints do somewhat give: this from its roots we tear,</a>
<a id='line_1374'>    And heave it up and over wall, whose toppling at the last</a>
<a id='line_1375'>    Bears crash and ruin, and wide away the Danaans are down cast</a>
<a id='line_1376'>    Beneath its fall: but more come on: nor drift of stones doth lack,</a>
<a id='line_1377'>    Nor doth all kind of weapon-shot at any while grow slack.</a>
<a id='line_1378'>    Lo, Pyrrhus in the very porch forth to the door doth pass</a>
<a id='line_1379'>    Exulting; bright with glittering points and flashing of the brass;   470</a>
<a id='line_1380'>    --E'en as a snake to daylight come, on evil herbage fed,</a>
<a id='line_1381'>    Who, swollen, 'neath the chilly soil hath had his winter bed,</a>
<a id='line_1382'>    And now, his ancient armour doffed, and sleek with youth new found,</a>
<a id='line_1383'>    With front upreared his slippery back he coileth o'er the ground</a>
<a id='line_1384'>    Up 'neath the sun; his three-cleft tongue within his mouth gleams clear:--</a>
<a id='line_1385'>    And with him Periphas the huge, Achilles' charioteer,</a>
<a id='line_1386'>    Now shield-bearer Automedon and all the Scyrian host</a>
<a id='line_1387'>    Closed on the walls and on the roof the blazing firebrands tost.</a>
<a id='line_1388'>    Pyrrhus in forefront of them all catches a mighty bill,</a>
<a id='line_1389'>    Beats in the hardened door, and tears perforce from hinge and sill   480</a>
<a id='line_1390'>    The brazen leaves; a beam hewn through, wide gaped the oak hard knit</a>
<a id='line_1391'>    Into a great-mouthed window there, and through the midst of it</a>
<a id='line_1392'>    May men behold the inner house; the long halls open lie;</a>
<a id='line_1393'>    Bared is the heart of Priam's home, the place of kings gone by;</a>
<a id='line_1394'>    And close against the very door all armèd men they see.</a>
<a id='line_1395'></a>
<a id='line_1396'>    That inner house indeed was mazed with wail and misery,</a>
<a id='line_1397'>    The inmost chambers of the place an echoing hubbub hold</a>
<a id='line_1398'>    Of women's cries, whose clamour smites the far-off stars of gold,</a>
<a id='line_1399'>    And through the house so mighty great the fearful mothers stray,</a>
<a id='line_1400'>    And wind their arms about the doors, and kisses on them lay.         490</a>
<a id='line_1401'></a>
<a id='line_1402'>    But Pyrrhus with his father's might comes on; no bolt avails,</a>
<a id='line_1403'>    No man against the might of him; the door all battered fails,</a>
<a id='line_1404'>    The door-leaves torn from off of hinge tumble and lie along:</a>
<a id='line_1405'>    Might maketh road; through passage forced the entering Danaans throng,</a>
<a id='line_1406'>    And slay the first and fill the place with armour of their ranks.</a>
<a id='line_1407'>    Nay nought so great is foaming flood that through its bursten banks</a>
<a id='line_1408'>    Breaks forth, and beateth down the moles that 'gainst its going stand.</a>
<a id='line_1409'>    And falls a fierce heap on the plain, and over all the land</a>
<a id='line_1410'>    Drags off the herds and herd-houses.</a>
<a id='line_1411'>                                        There saw I Pyrrhus wild</a>
<a id='line_1412'>    With death of men amidst the door, and either Atreus' child;         500</a>
<a id='line_1413'>    And Hecuba and hundred wives her sons wed saw I there,</a>
<a id='line_1414'>    And Priam fouling with his blood the very altars fair</a>
<a id='line_1415'>    Whose fires he hallowed: fifty beds the hope of house to be,</a>
<a id='line_1416'>    The doorways proud with outland gold and war-got bravery</a>
<a id='line_1417'>    Sunk into ash; where fire hath failed the Danaans are enow.</a>
<a id='line_1418'></a>
<a id='line_1419'>    Belike what fate on Priam fell thou askest me to show:</a>
<a id='line_1420'>    For when he saw the city lost, and his own house-door stormed,</a>
<a id='line_1421'>    And how in bowels of his house the host of foemen swarmed,</a>
<a id='line_1422'>    The ancient man in vain does on the arms long useless laid</a>
<a id='line_1423'>    About his quaking back of eld, and girds himself with blade          510</a>
<a id='line_1424'>    Of no avail, and fareth forth amid the press to die.</a>
<a id='line_1425'>    A very midmost of the courts beneath the naked sky</a>
<a id='line_1426'>    A mighty altar stood: anear a bay exceeding old,</a>
<a id='line_1427'>    The altar and the Gods thereof did all in shadow hold;</a>
<a id='line_1428'>    And round about that altar-stead sat Hecuba the queen,</a>
<a id='line_1429'>    And many daughters: e'en as doves all huddled up are seen</a>
<a id='line_1430'>    'Neath the black storm they cling about the dear God's images.</a>
<a id='line_1431'></a>
<a id='line_1432'>    But when in arms of early days King Priam now she sees,</a>
<a id='line_1433'>    She crieth: 'O unhappy spouse! what evil heart hast thou,</a>
<a id='line_1434'>    With weapons thus to gird thyself, or whither wilt thou now?         520</a>
<a id='line_1435'>    Today availeth no such help, and no such warder's stay</a>
<a id='line_1436'>    May better aught; not even were my Hector here today.</a>
<a id='line_1437'>    But come thou hither unto me; this altar all shall save,</a>
<a id='line_1438'>    Or we shall die together here!'</a>
<a id='line_1439'>                                    Her arms about she gave</a>
<a id='line_1440'>    And took him, and the elder set adown in holy stead.</a>
<a id='line_1441'></a>
<a id='line_1442'>    But lo! now one of Priam's sons, Polites, having fled</a>
<a id='line_1443'>    From Pyrrhus' murder through the swords and through the foeman's throng,</a>
<a id='line_1444'>    Runs wounded through the empty hall from out the cloister long,</a>
<a id='line_1445'>    And burning Pyrrhus, hard at heel, the deadly hurt doth bear,</a>
<a id='line_1446'>    And grip of hand is on him now, and now the point of spear.          530</a>
<a id='line_1447'>    But as he rushed before their eyes, his parents' face beneath</a>
<a id='line_1448'>    He fell, and with most plenteous blood shed forth his latest breath;</a>
<a id='line_1449'>    Then Priam, howsoever nigh the very death might grip,</a>
<a id='line_1450'>    Refrained him nothing at the sight, but voice and wrath let slip:</a>
<a id='line_1451'>    'Ah, for such wickedness,' he cried, 'for daring such a deed,</a>
<a id='line_1452'>    If aught abide in heaven as yet such things as this to heed,</a>
<a id='line_1453'>    May the Gods give thee worthy thanks, and pay thee well-earned prize,</a>
<a id='line_1454'>    That thou hast set the death of sons before my father's eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1455'>    That thou thy murder's fouling thus in father's face hast flung.</a>
<a id='line_1456'>    Not he, Achilles, whence indeed thou liar hast never sprung,         540</a>
<a id='line_1457'>    Was such a foe to Priam erst; for shamfast meed he gave</a>
<a id='line_1458'>    To law and troth of suppliant men, and rendered to the grave</a>
<a id='line_1459'>    The bloodless Hector dead, and me sent to mine own again.'</a>
<a id='line_1460'></a>
<a id='line_1461'>    So spake the elder, and cast forth a toothless spear and vain,</a>
<a id='line_1462'>    That forthwith from the griding brass was put aback all spent,</a>
<a id='line_1463'>    And from the shield-boss' outer skin hung down, for nothing sent.</a>
<a id='line_1464'>    Then Pyrrhus cried: 'Yea tell him this, go take the tidings down</a>
<a id='line_1465'>    To Peleus' son my father then, of Pyrrhus worser grown</a>
<a id='line_1466'>    And all these evil deeds of mine! take heed to tell the tale!</a>
<a id='line_1467'>    Now die!'</a>
<a id='line_1468'>             And to the altar-stone him quivering did he hale,           550</a>
<a id='line_1469'>    And sliding in his own son's blood so plenteous: in his hair</a>
<a id='line_1470'>    Pyrrhus his left hand wound, his right the gleaming sword made bare,</a>
<a id='line_1471'>    That even to the hilts thereof within his flank he hid.</a>
<a id='line_1472'>    Such was the end of Priam's day, such faring forth fate bid,</a>
<a id='line_1473'>    Troy all aflame upon the road, all Pergamus adown.</a>
<a id='line_1474'>    He, of so many peoples once the mighty lord and crown,</a>
<a id='line_1475'>    So many lands of Asia once, a trunk beside the sea</a>
<a id='line_1476'>    Huge with its headless shoulders laid, a nameless corpse is he.</a>
<a id='line_1477'></a>
<a id='line_1478'>    Then first within the compassing of bitter fear I was;</a>
<a id='line_1479'>    The image of my father dear by me all mazed did pass,                560</a>
<a id='line_1480'>    When I beheld the like-aged king gasping his life away</a>
<a id='line_1481'>    Through cruel wound: upon mine eyes forlorn Creusa lay,</a>
<a id='line_1482'>    The wasted house, my little one, Iulus', evil end.</a>
<a id='line_1483'>    I look aback to see what folk about me yet do wend,</a>
<a id='line_1484'>    But all, foredone, had fallen away, their weary bodies spent,</a>
<a id='line_1485'>    Some all amid the fire had cast, some unto earth had sent.</a>
<a id='line_1486'></a>
<a id='line_1487'>    Alone was I of all men now, when lo, in Vesta's house</a>
<a id='line_1488'>    Abiding, and in inmost nook silent and lurking close,</a>
<a id='line_1489'>    Helen the seed of Tyndarus! the clear fires give her light</a>
<a id='line_1490'>    As there she strayeth, turning eyes on every shifting sight;         570</a>
<a id='line_1491'>    She, fearful of the Teucrian wrath for Pergamus undone,</a>
<a id='line_1492'>    And fearful of the Danaan wrath and husband left alone,</a>
<a id='line_1493'>    The wasting fury both of Troy and land where she was born,</a>
<a id='line_1494'>    She hid her by the altar-stead, a thing of Gods forlorn.</a>
<a id='line_1495'></a>
<a id='line_1496'>    Forth blazed the wildfire in my soul, wrath stirred me up to slake</a>
<a id='line_1497'>    My vengeance for my dying home, and ill's atonement take.</a>
<a id='line_1498'>    What! should she come to Sparta safe, and her Mycenæ then,</a>
<a id='line_1499'>    And in the hard-won triumphing go forth a Queen of men,</a>
<a id='line_1500'>    And see her husband and her home, her parents and her sons,</a>
<a id='line_1501'>    Served by the throng of Ilian wives and Phrygian vanquished ones?    580</a>
<a id='line_1502'>    Shall Priam so be slain with sword; shall Troy so blaze aloft;</a>
<a id='line_1503'>    Shall the sea-beach the Dardan blood have sweat so oft and oft</a>
<a id='line_1504'>    For this? Nay, nay: and though forsooth no deed to blaze abroad</a>
<a id='line_1505'>    The slaying of a woman be, nor gaineth fame's reward,</a>
<a id='line_1506'>    Yet still to quench an evil thing and pay the well-earned meed</a>
<a id='line_1507'>    Is worthy praise, and joy it were unto the full to feed</a>
<a id='line_1508'>    My heart's fell flame, and satisfy these ashes well beloved.</a>
<a id='line_1509'></a>
<a id='line_1510'>    Such things my soul gave forth; such things in furious heart I moved.</a>
<a id='line_1511'>    When lo, my holy mother now, ne'er seen by eyes of mine</a>
<a id='line_1512'>    So clear before, athwart the dark in simple light did shine;         590</a>
<a id='line_1513'>    All God she was; of countenance and measure was she nought,</a>
<a id='line_1514'>    But her the heaven-abiders see; so my right hand she caught,</a>
<a id='line_1515'>    And held me, and from rosy mouth moreover added word:</a>
<a id='line_1516'></a>
<a id='line_1517'>    'O son, what anger measureless thy mighty grief hath stirred?</a>
<a id='line_1518'>    Why ragest thou? or whither then is gone thy heed of me?</a>
<a id='line_1519'>    Wilt thou not first behold the place where worn by eld is he,</a>
<a id='line_1520'>    Anchises, left? Wilt thou not see if yet thy wife abide</a>
<a id='line_1521'>    Creusa, or Ascanius yet? The Greekish bands fare wide</a>
<a id='line_1522'>    About them now on every hand, and but my care withstood</a>
<a id='line_1523'>    The fire had wafted them away or sword had drunk their blood.        600</a>
<a id='line_1524'>    Laconian Helen's beauty cursed this overthrow ne'er wrought.</a>
<a id='line_1525'>    Nor guilty Paris; nay, the Gods, the Gods who pity nought,</a>
<a id='line_1526'>    Have overturned your lordship fair, and laid your Troy alow.</a>
<a id='line_1527'>    Behold! I draw aside the cloud that all abroad doth flow,</a>
<a id='line_1528'>    Dulling the eyes of mortal men, and darkening dewily</a>
<a id='line_1529'>    The world about. And look to it no more afeard to be</a>
<a id='line_1530'>    Of what I bid, nor evermore thy mother's word disown.</a>
<a id='line_1531'>    There where thou seest the great walls cleft, and stone torn off from stone,</a>
<a id='line_1532'>    And seest the waves of smoke go by with mingled dust-cloud rolled,--</a>
<a id='line_1533'>    There Neptune shakes the walls and stirs the foundings from their hold</a>
<a id='line_1534'>    With mighty trident, tumbling down the city from its base.           611</a>
<a id='line_1535'>    There by the Scæan gates again hath bitter Juno place</a>
<a id='line_1536'>    The first of all, and wild and mad, herself begirt with steel,</a>
<a id='line_1537'>    Calls up her fellows from the ships.</a>
<a id='line_1538'>    Look back! Tritonian Pallas broods o'er topmost burg on high,</a>
<a id='line_1539'>    All flashing bright with Gorgon grim from out her stormy sky;</a>
<a id='line_1540'>    The very Father hearteneth on, and stays with happy might</a>
<a id='line_1541'>    The Danaans, crying on the Gods against the Dardan fight.</a>
<a id='line_1542'>    Snatch flight, O son, whiles yet thou may'st, and let thy toil be o'er,</a>
<a id='line_1543'>    I by thy side will bring thee safe unto thy father's door.'          620</a>
<a id='line_1544'></a>
<a id='line_1545'>    She spake, and hid herself away where thickest darkness poured.</a>
<a id='line_1546'>    Then dreadful images show forth, great Godheads are abroad,</a>
<a id='line_1547'>    The very haters of our Troy.</a>
<a id='line_1548'>    And then indeed before mine eyes all Ilium sank in flame,</a>
<a id='line_1549'>    And overturned was Neptune's Troy from its foundations deep.</a>
<a id='line_1550'>    E'en as betideth with an ash upon the mountain steep,</a>
<a id='line_1551'>    Round which sore smitten by the steel the acre-biders throng,</a>
<a id='line_1552'>    And strive in speeding of the axe: and there it threateneth long,</a>
<a id='line_1553'>    And, shaken, trembleth nodding still with heavy head of leaf;</a>
<a id='line_1554'>    Till overcome by many hurts it groans its latest grief,              630</a>
<a id='line_1555'>    And torn from out the ridgy hill, drags all its ruin alow.</a>
<a id='line_1556'></a>
<a id='line_1557'>    I get me down, and, Goddess-led, speed on 'twixt fire and foe,</a>
<a id='line_1558'>    And point and edge give place to me, before me sinks the flame;</a>
<a id='line_1559'>    But when unto my father's door and ancient house I came,</a>
<a id='line_1560'>    And I was fain of all things first my father forth to bear</a>
<a id='line_1561'>    Unto the mountain-tops, and first I sought to find him there,</a>
<a id='line_1562'>    Still he gainsayed to spin out life now Troy was lost and dead,</a>
<a id='line_1563'>    Or suffer exile: 'Ye whose blood is hale with youth,' he said,</a>
<a id='line_1564'>    'Ye other ones, whose might and main endureth and is stout,</a>
<a id='line_1565'>    See ye to flight while yet ye may!                                   640</a>
<a id='line_1566'>    Full surely if the heavenly ones my longer life had willed,</a>
<a id='line_1567'>    They would have kept me this abode: the measure is fulfilled</a>
<a id='line_1568'>    In that the murder I have seen, and lived when Troy-town fell.</a>
<a id='line_1569'>    O ye, depart, when ye have bid my body streaked farewell.</a>
<a id='line_1570'>    My hand itself shall find out death, or pity of my foes,</a>
<a id='line_1571'>    Who seek my spoils: the tomb methinks a little thing to lose.</a>
<a id='line_1572'>    Forsooth I tarry overlong, God-cursed, a useless thing,</a>
<a id='line_1573'>    Since when the Father of the Gods, the earth-abiders' King,</a>
<a id='line_1574'>    Blew on me blast of thunder-wind and touched me with his flame.'</a>
<a id='line_1575'></a>
<a id='line_1576'>    His deed was stubborn as his word, no change upon him came.          650</a>
<a id='line_1577'>    But all we weeping many tears, my wife Creusa there,</a>
<a id='line_1578'>    Ascanius, yea and all the house, besought him not to bear</a>
<a id='line_1579'>    All things to wrack with him, nor speed the hastening evil tide.</a>
<a id='line_1580'>    He gainsaith all, and in his will and home will yet abide.</a>
<a id='line_1581'>    So wretchedly I rush to arms with all intent to die;</a>
<a id='line_1582'>    For what availeth wisdom now, what hope in fate may lie?</a>
<a id='line_1583'></a>
<a id='line_1584'>    'And didst thou hope, O father, then, that thou being left behind,</a>
<a id='line_1585'>    My foot would fare? Woe worth the word that in thy mouth I find!</a>
<a id='line_1586'>    But if the Gods are loth one whit of such a town to save,</a>
<a id='line_1587'>    And thou with constant mind wilt cast on dying Troy-town's grave     660</a>
<a id='line_1588'>    Both thee and thine, wide is the door to wend adown such ways;</a>
<a id='line_1589'>    For Pyrrhus, red with Priam's blood, is hard at hand, who slays</a>
<a id='line_1590'>    The son before the father's face, the father slays upon</a>
<a id='line_1591'>    The altar. Holy Mother, then, for this thou ledst me on</a>
<a id='line_1592'>    Through fire and sword!--that I might see our house filled with the foe,</a>
<a id='line_1593'>    My father old, Ascanius, Creusa lying low,</a>
<a id='line_1594'>    All weltering in each other's blood, and murdered wretchedly.</a>
<a id='line_1595'>    Arms, fellows, arms! the last day's light on vanquished men doth cry.</a>
<a id='line_1596'>    Ah! give me to the Greeks again, that I may play the play</a>
<a id='line_1597'>    Another while: not unavenged shall all we die today.'                670</a>
<a id='line_1598'></a>
<a id='line_1599'>    So was I girt with sword again, and in my shield would set</a>
<a id='line_1600'>    My left hand now, and was in point from out of doors to get,</a>
<a id='line_1601'>    When lo, my wife about my feet e'en in the threshold clung,</a>
<a id='line_1602'>    Still to his father reaching out Iulus tender-young:</a>
<a id='line_1603'>    'If thou art on thy way to die, then bear us through it all;</a>
<a id='line_1604'>    But if to thee the wise in arms some hope of arms befall,</a>
<a id='line_1605'>    Then keep this house first! Unto whom giv'st thou Iulus' life,</a>
<a id='line_1606'>    Thy father's, yea and mine withal, that once was called thy wife?'</a>
<a id='line_1607'></a>
<a id='line_1608'>    So crying out, the house she filled with her exceeding moan,</a>
<a id='line_1609'>    When sudden, wondrous to be told, a portent was there shown;         680</a>
<a id='line_1610'>    For as his woeful parents' hands and lips he hangs between,</a>
<a id='line_1611'>    On topmost of Iulus' head a thin peaked flame is seen,</a>
<a id='line_1612'>    That with the harmless touch of fire, whence clearest light is shed,</a>
<a id='line_1613'>    Licks his soft locks and pastures round the temples of his head.</a>
<a id='line_1614'>    Quaking with awe from out his hair we fall the fire to shake,</a>
<a id='line_1615'>    And bring the water of the well the holy flame to slake.</a>
<a id='line_1616'>    But joyous to the stars aloft Anchises raiseth eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1617'>    And with his hands spread out abroad to very heaven he cries:</a>
<a id='line_1618'>    'Almighty Jove, if thou hast will toward any prayers to turn,</a>
<a id='line_1619'>    Look down on us this while alone; if aught our goodness earn,        690</a>
<a id='line_1620'>    Father, give help and strengthen us these omens from the sky!'</a>
<a id='line_1621'></a>
<a id='line_1622'>    Scarce had the elder said the word ere crashing suddenly</a>
<a id='line_1623'>    It thundered on the left, and down across the shades of night</a>
<a id='line_1624'>    Ran forth a great brand-bearing star with most abundant light;</a>
<a id='line_1625'>    And clear above the topmost house we saw it how it slid</a>
<a id='line_1626'>    Lightening the ways, and at the last in Ida's forest hid.</a>
<a id='line_1627'>    Then through the sky a furrow ran drawn out a mighty space,</a>
<a id='line_1628'>    Giving forth light, and sulphur-fumes rose all about the place.</a>
<a id='line_1629'></a>
<a id='line_1630'>    My father vanquished therewithal his visage doth upraise,</a>
<a id='line_1631'>    And saith a word unto the Gods that holy star to praise:             700</a>
<a id='line_1632'>    'Now, now, no tarrying is at all, I follow where ye lead;</a>
<a id='line_1633'>    O Father-Gods heed ye our house and this my son's son heed!</a>
<a id='line_1634'>    This is your doom; and Troy is held beneath your majesty.</a>
<a id='line_1635'>    I yield, O son, nor more gainsay to go my ways with thee.'</a>
<a id='line_1636'></a>
<a id='line_1637'>    He spake; and mid the walls meanwhile we hear the fire alive</a>
<a id='line_1638'>    Still clearer, and the burning place more nigh the heat doth drive.</a>
<a id='line_1639'></a>
<a id='line_1640'>    'O hasten, father well-beloved, to hang about my neck!</a>
<a id='line_1641'>    Lo, here my shoulders will I stoop, nor of the labour reck.</a>
<a id='line_1642'>    And whatsoever may befall, the two of us shall bide</a>
<a id='line_1643'>    One peril and one heal and end: Iulus by my side                     710</a>
<a id='line_1644'>    Shall wend, and after us my wife shall follow on my feet</a>
<a id='line_1645'>    Ye serving-folk, turn ye your minds these words of mine to meet:</a>
<a id='line_1646'>    Scant from the city is a mound and temple of old tide,</a>
<a id='line_1647'>    Of Ceres' lone, a cypress-tree exceeding old beside.</a>
<a id='line_1648'>    Kept by our fathers' worshipping through many years agone:</a>
<a id='line_1649'>    Thither by divers roads go we to meet at last in one.</a>
<a id='line_1650'>    Now, father, take thy fathers' Gods and holy things to hold,</a>
<a id='line_1651'>    For me to touch them fresh from fight and murder were o'erbold,</a>
<a id='line_1652'>    A misdeed done against the Gods, till in the living flood</a>
<a id='line_1653'>    I make a shift to wash me clean.'                                    720</a>
<a id='line_1654'></a>
<a id='line_1655'>    I stooped my neck and shoulders broad e'en as the word I said,</a>
<a id='line_1656'>    A forest lion's yellow fell for cloth upon them laid,</a>
<a id='line_1657'>    And took my burden up: my young Iulus by my side,</a>
<a id='line_1658'>    Holding my hand, goes tripping short unto his father's stride;</a>
<a id='line_1659'>    My wife comes after: on we fare amidst a mirky world.</a>
<a id='line_1660'>    And I, erewhile as nothing moved by storm of weapons hurled,</a>
<a id='line_1661'>    I, who the gathering of the Greeks against me nothing feared,</a>
<a id='line_1662'>    Now tremble at each breath of wind, by every sound am stirred,</a>
<a id='line_1663'>    Sore troubled for my fellows both, and burden that I bore.</a>
<a id='line_1664'></a>
<a id='line_1665'>    And now we draw anigh the gates, and all the way seemed o'er,        730</a>
<a id='line_1666'>    When sudden sound of falling feet was borne upon our ears,</a>
<a id='line_1667'>    And therewithal my father cries, as through the dusk he peers,</a>
<a id='line_1668'>    'Haste, son, and get thee swift away, for they are on us now;</a>
<a id='line_1669'>    I see the glittering of the brass and all their shields aglow.'</a>
<a id='line_1670'></a>
<a id='line_1671'>    What Godhead nought a friend to me amidst my terror there</a>
<a id='line_1672'>    Snatched wit away I nothing know: for while I swiftly fare</a>
<a id='line_1673'>    By wayless places, wandering wide from out the road I knew,</a>
<a id='line_1674'>    Creusa, whether her the Fates from me unhappy drew,</a>
<a id='line_1675'>    Whether she wandered from the way, or weary lagged aback,</a>
<a id='line_1676'>    Nought know I, but that her henceforth mine eyes must ever lack.     740</a>
<a id='line_1677'>    Nor turned I round to find her lost, nor had it in my thought,</a>
<a id='line_1678'>    Till to that mound and ancient house of Ceres we were brought;</a>
<a id='line_1679'>    Where, all being come together now, there lacked but her alone,</a>
<a id='line_1680'>    And there her fellows' hopes, her son's, her husband's were undone.</a>
<a id='line_1681'></a>
<a id='line_1682'>    On whom of men, on whom of Gods, then laid I not the guilt?</a>
<a id='line_1683'>    What saw I bitterer to be borne in all the city spilt?</a>
<a id='line_1684'>    Ascanius and Anchises set the Teucrian Gods beside,</a>
<a id='line_1685'>    I give unto my fellows there in hollow dale to hide,</a>
<a id='line_1686'>    But I unto the city turn with glittering weapons girt;</a>
<a id='line_1687'>    Needs must I search all Troy again, and open every hurt,             750</a>
<a id='line_1688'>    And into every peril past must thrust my head once more.</a>
<a id='line_1689'>    And first I reach the walls again and mirk ways of the door</a>
<a id='line_1690'>    Whereby I wended out erewhile; and my old footsteps' track</a>
<a id='line_1691'>    I find, and mid the dusk of night with close eyes follow back;</a>
<a id='line_1692'>    While on the heart lies weight of fear, and e'en the hush brings dread,</a>
<a id='line_1693'>    Thence to the house, if there perchance, if there again she tread,</a>
<a id='line_1694'>    I go: infall of Greeks had been, and all the house they hold,</a>
<a id='line_1695'>    And 'neath the wind the ravening fire to highest ridge is rolled.</a>
<a id='line_1696'>    The flames hang o'er, with raging heat the heavens are hot withal;</a>
<a id='line_1697'>    Still on: I look on Priam's house and topmost castle-wall;           760</a>
<a id='line_1698'>    And in the desert cloisters there and Juno's very home</a>
<a id='line_1699'>    Lo, Phoenix and Ulysses cursed, the chosen wards, are come</a>
<a id='line_1700'>    To keep the spoil; fair things of Troy, from everywhither brought,</a>
<a id='line_1701'>    Rapt from the burning of the shrines, Gods' tables rudely caught,</a>
<a id='line_1702'>    And beakers utterly of gold and raiment snatched away</a>
<a id='line_1703'>    Are there heaped up; and boys and wives drawn out in long array</a>
<a id='line_1704'>    Stand trembling round about the heap.</a>
<a id='line_1705'>    And now withal I dared to cast my cries upon the dark,</a>
<a id='line_1706'>    I fill the streets with clamour great, and, groaning woefully,</a>
<a id='line_1707'>    'Creusa,' o'er and o'er again without avail I cry.                   770</a>
<a id='line_1708'></a>
<a id='line_1709'>    But as I sought and endlessly raved all the houses through</a>
<a id='line_1710'>    A hapless shape, Creusa's shade, anigh mine eyen drew,</a>
<a id='line_1711'>    And greater than the body known her image fashioned was;</a>
<a id='line_1712'>    I stood amazed, my hair rose up, nor from my jaws would pass</a>
<a id='line_1713'>    My frozen voice, then thus she spake my care to take away:</a>
<a id='line_1714'>    'Sweet husband, wherefore needest thou with such mad sorrow play?</a>
<a id='line_1715'>    Without the dealing of the Gods doth none of this betide;</a>
<a id='line_1716'>    And they, they will not have thee bear Creusa by thy side,</a>
<a id='line_1717'>    Nor will Olympus' highest king such fellowship allow.</a>
<a id='line_1718'>    Long exile is in store for thee, huge plain of sea to plough,        780</a>
<a id='line_1719'>    Then to Hesperia shalt thou come, where Lydian Tiber's wave</a>
<a id='line_1720'>    The wealthiest meads of mighty men with gentle stream doth lave:</a>
<a id='line_1721'>    There happy days and lordship great, and kingly wife, are born</a>
<a id='line_1722'>    For thee. Ah! do away thy tears for loved Creusa lorn.</a>
<a id='line_1723'>    I shall not see the Myrmidons' nor Dolopes' proud place,</a>
<a id='line_1724'>    Nor wend my ways to wait upon the Greekish women's grace;</a>
<a id='line_1725'>    I, daughter of the Dardan race, I, wife of Venus' son;</a>
<a id='line_1726'>    Me the great Mother of the Gods on Trojan shore hath won.</a>
<a id='line_1727'>    Farewell, and love the son we loved together once, we twain.'</a>
<a id='line_1728'></a>
<a id='line_1729'>    She left me when these words were given, me weeping sore, and fain   790</a>
<a id='line_1730'>    To tell her much, and forth away amid thin air she passed:</a>
<a id='line_1731'>    And there three times about her neck I strove mine arms to cast,</a>
<a id='line_1732'>    And thrice away from out my hands the gathered image streams,</a>
<a id='line_1733'>    E'en as the breathing of the wind or wingèd thing of dreams.</a>
<a id='line_1734'></a>
<a id='line_1735'>    And so at last, the night all spent, I meet my folk anew;</a>
<a id='line_1736'>    And there I found great multitude that fresh unto us drew,</a>
<a id='line_1737'>    And wondered thereat: wives were there, and men, and plenteous youth;</a>
<a id='line_1738'>    All gathered for the faring forth, a hapless crowd forsooth:</a>
<a id='line_1739'>    From everywhere they draw to us, with goods and courage set,</a>
<a id='line_1740'>    To follow o'er the sea where'er my will may lead them yet.           800</a>
<a id='line_1741'></a>
<a id='line_1742'>    And now o'er Ida's topmost ridge at last the day-star rose</a>
<a id='line_1743'>    With dawn in hand: all gates and doors by host of Danaan foes</a>
<a id='line_1744'>    Were close beset, and no more hope of helping may I bide.</a>
<a id='line_1745'>    I turned and took my father up and sought the mountain-side.</a>

<a id='line_1767'>    Weeping I leave my fatherland, and out of haven passed                10</a>
<a id='line_1768'>    Away from fields where Troy-town was, an outcast o'er the deep,</a>
<a id='line_1769'>    With folk and son and Household Gods and Greater Gods to keep.</a>

<a id='line_1771'>    Far off a peopled land of Mars lies midst its mighty plain,</a>

<a id='line_1782'>    A cornel-bush and myrtle stiff with shafts close set around:</a>
<a id='line_1783'>    Thereto I wend and strive to pluck a green shoot from the ground,</a>
<a id='line_1784'>    That I with leafy boughs thereof may clothe the altars well;</a>
<a id='line_1785'>    When lo, a portent terrible and marvellous to tell!</a>
<a id='line_1786'>    For the first stem that from the soil uprooted I tear out</a>
<a id='line_1787'>    Oozes black drops of very blood, that all the earth about</a>
<a id='line_1788'>    Is stained with gore: but as for me, with sudden horror chill</a>
<a id='line_1789'>    My limbs fall quaking, and my blood with freezing fear stands still.  30</a>
<a id='line_1790'>    Yet I go on and strive from earth a new tough shoot to win,</a>
<a id='line_1791'>    That I may search out suddenly what causes lurk within;</a>
<a id='line_1792'>    And once again from out the bark blood followeth as before.</a>
<a id='line_1793'></a>
<a id='line_1794'>    I turn the matter in my mind: the Field-Nymphs I adore,</a>
<a id='line_1795'>    And him, Gradivus, father dread, who rules the Thracian plain,</a>
<a id='line_1796'>    And pray them turn the thing to good and make its threatenings vain.</a>
<a id='line_1797'>    But when upon a third of them once more I set my hand,</a>
<a id='line_1798'>    And striving hard thrust both my knees upon the opposing sand--</a>
<a id='line_1799'>    --Shall I speak now or hold my peace?--a piteous groan is heard</a>
<a id='line_1800'>    From out the mound, and to mine ears is borne a dreadful word:        40</a>
<a id='line_1801'>    'Why manglest thou a wretched man? O spare me in my tomb!</a>
<a id='line_1802'>    Spare to beguilt thy righteous hand, Æneas! Troy's own womb</a>
<a id='line_1803'>    Bore me, thy kinsman; from this stem floweth no alien gore:</a>
<a id='line_1804'>    Woe's me! flee forth the cruel land, flee forth the greedy shore;</a>
<a id='line_1805'>    For I am Polydore: pierced through, by harvest of the spear</a>
<a id='line_1806'>    O'ergrown, that such a crop of shafts above my head doth bear.'</a>
<a id='line_1807'></a>
<a id='line_1808'>    I stood amazed: the wildering fear the heart in me down-weighed.</a>
<a id='line_1809'>    My hair rose up, my frozen breath within my jaws was stayed.</a>
<a id='line_1810'>    Unhappy Priam privily had sent this Polydore,</a>
<a id='line_1811'>    For fostering to the Thracian king with plenteous golden store.       50</a>
<a id='line_1812'>    In those first days when he began to doubt the Dardan might,</a>
<a id='line_1813'>    Having the leaguered walls of Troy for ever in his sight.</a>
<a id='line_1814'>    This king, as failed the weal of Troy and fortune fell away,</a>
<a id='line_1815'>    Turned him about to conquering arms and Agamemnon's day.</a>
<a id='line_1816'>    He brake all right, slew Polydore, and all the gold he got</a>
<a id='line_1817'>    Perforce: O thou gold-hunger cursed, and whither driv'st thou not</a>
<a id='line_1818'>    The hearts of men?</a>
<a id='line_1819'>                      But when at length the fear from me did fall,</a>
<a id='line_1820'>    Unto the chosen of the folk, my father first of all,</a>
<a id='line_1821'>    I show those portents of the Gods and ask them of their will,</a>
<a id='line_1822'>    All deem it good that we depart that wicked land of ill,              60</a>
<a id='line_1823'>    And leave that blighted guesting-place and give our ships the breeze.</a>
<a id='line_1824'>    Therefore to Polydore we do the funeral services,</a>
<a id='line_1825'>    The earth is heaped up high in mound; the Death-Gods' altars stand</a>
<a id='line_1826'>    Woeful with bough of cypress black and coal-blue holy band;</a>
<a id='line_1827'>    The wives of Ilium range about with due dishevelled hair;</a>
<a id='line_1828'>    Cups of the warm and foaming milk unto the dead we bear,</a>
<a id='line_1829'>    And bowls of holy blood we bring, and lay the soul in grave,</a>
<a id='line_1830'>    And cry a great farewell to him, the last that he shall have.</a>
<a id='line_1831'>    But now, when we may trust the sea and winds the ocean keep</a>
<a id='line_1832'>    Unangered, and the South bids on light whispering to the deep,        70</a>
<a id='line_1833'>    Our fellows crowd the sea-beach o'er and run the ships adown,</a>
<a id='line_1834'>    And from the haven are we borne, and fadeth field and town.</a>
<a id='line_1835'></a>
<a id='line_1836'>    Amid the sea a land there lies, sweet over everything,</a>
<a id='line_1837'>    Loved of the Nereids' mother, loved by that Ægean king</a>
<a id='line_1838'>    Great Neptune: this, a-wandering once all coasts and shores around,</a>
<a id='line_1839'>    The Bow-Lord good to Gyaros and high Myconos bound,</a>
<a id='line_1840'>    And bade it fixed to cherish folk nor fear the wind again:</a>
<a id='line_1841'>    There come we; and that gentlest isle receives us weary men;</a>
<a id='line_1842'>    In haven safe we land, and thence Apollo's town adore;</a>
<a id='line_1843'>    King Anius, who, a king of men, Apollo's priesthood bore,             80</a>
<a id='line_1844'>    His temples with the fillets done and crowned with holy bays,</a>
<a id='line_1845'>    Meets us, and straight Anchises knows, his friend of early days.</a>
<a id='line_1846'>    So therewith hand to hand we join and houseward get us gone.</a>
<a id='line_1847'></a>
<a id='line_1848'>    There the God's fane I pray unto, the place of ancient stone:</a>
<a id='line_1849'>    'Thymbræan, give us house and home, walls to the weary give,</a>
<a id='line_1850'>    In folk and city to endure: let Pergamus twice live,</a>
<a id='line_1851'>    In Troy twice built, left of the Greeks, left of Achilles' wrath!</a>
<a id='line_1852'>    Ah, whom to follow? where to go? wherein our home set forth?</a>
<a id='line_1853'>    O Father, give us augury and sink into our heart!</a>
<a id='line_1854'></a>
<a id='line_1855'>    Scarce had I said the word, when lo all doors with sudden start       90</a>
<a id='line_1856'>    Fell trembling, and the bay of God, and all the mountain side,</a>
<a id='line_1857'>    Was stirred, and in the opened shrine the holy tripod cried:</a>
<a id='line_1858'>    There as a voice fell on our ears we bowed ourselves to earth:</a>
<a id='line_1859'>    'O hardy folk of Dardanus, the land that gave you birth</a>
<a id='line_1860'>    From root and stem of fathers old, its very bosom kind,</a>
<a id='line_1861'>    Shall take you back: go fare ye forth, your ancient mother find:</a>
<a id='line_1862'>    There shall Æneas' house be lords o'er every earth and sea,</a>
<a id='line_1863'>    The children of his children's sons, and those that thence shall be.'</a>
<a id='line_1864'></a>
<a id='line_1865'>    So Phoebus spake, and mighty joy arose with tumult mixed,</a>
<a id='line_1866'>    As all fell wondering where might be that seat of city fixed,        100</a>
<a id='line_1867'>    Where Phoebus called us wandering folk, bidding us turn again.</a>
<a id='line_1868'>    Thereat my father, musing o'er the tales of ancient men,</a>
<a id='line_1869'>    Saith: 'Hearken, lords, and this your hope a little learn of me!</a>
<a id='line_1870'>    There is an isle of mightiest Jove called Crete amid the sea;</a>
<a id='line_1871'>    An hundred cities great it hath, that most abundant place;</a>
<a id='line_1872'>    And there the hill of Ida is, and cradle of our race.</a>
<a id='line_1873'>    Thence Teucer our first father came, if right the tale they tell,</a>
<a id='line_1874'>    When borne to those Rhoetean shores he chose a place to dwell</a>
<a id='line_1875'>    A very king: no Ilium was, no Pergamus rose high;</a>
<a id='line_1876'>    He and his folk abode as then in dales that lowly lie:               110</a>
<a id='line_1877'>    Thence came Earth-mother Cybele and Corybantian brass,</a>
<a id='line_1878'>    And Ida's thicket; thence the hush all hallowed came to pass,</a>
<a id='line_1879'>    And thence the lions yoked and tame, the Lady's chariot drag.</a>
<a id='line_1880'>    On then! and led by God's command for nothing let us lag!</a>
<a id='line_1881'>    Please we the winds, and let our course for Gnosian land be laid;</a>
<a id='line_1882'>    Nor long the way shall be for us: with Jupiter to aid,</a>
<a id='line_1883'>    The third-born sun shall stay our ships upon the Cretan shore.'</a>
<a id='line_1884'></a>
<a id='line_1885'>    So saying, all the offerings due he to the altar bore,</a>
<a id='line_1886'>    A bull to Neptune, and a bull to thee, Apollo bright,</a>
<a id='line_1887'>    A black ewe to the Storm of sea, to Zephyr kind a white.             120</a>
<a id='line_1888'>    Fame went that Duke Idomeneus, thrust from his fathers' land,</a>
<a id='line_1889'>    Had gone his ways, and desert now was all the Cretan strand,</a>
<a id='line_1890'>    That left all void of foes to us those habitations lie.</a>
<a id='line_1891'>    Ortygia's haven then we leave, and o'er the sea we fly</a>
<a id='line_1892'>    By Naxos of the Bacchus ridge, Donusa's green-hued steep,</a>
<a id='line_1893'>    And Olearon, and Paros white, and scattered o'er the deep</a>
<a id='line_1894'>    All Cyclades; we skim the straits besprent with many a folk;</a>
<a id='line_1895'>    And diverse clamour mid the ships seafarers striving woke;</a>
<a id='line_1896'>    Each eggs his fellow; On for Crete, and sires of time agone!</a>
<a id='line_1897'>    And rising up upon our wake a fair wind followed on.                 130</a>
<a id='line_1898'></a>
<a id='line_1899'>    And so at last we glide along the old Curetes' strand,</a>
<a id='line_1900'>    And straightway eager do I take the city wall in hand,</a>
<a id='line_1901'>    And call it Pergamea, and urge my folk that name who love,</a>
<a id='line_1902'>    For love of hearth and home to raise a burg their walls above.</a>
<a id='line_1903'></a>
<a id='line_1904'>    And now the more part of the ships are hauled up high and dry,</a>
<a id='line_1905'>    To wedding and to work afield the folk fall presently,</a>
<a id='line_1906'>    And I give laws and portion steads; when suddenly there fell</a>
<a id='line_1907'>    From poisoned heaven a wasting plague, a wretched thing to tell,</a>
<a id='line_1908'>    On limbs of men, on trees and fields; and deadly was the year,</a>
<a id='line_1909'>    And men must leave dear life and die, or weary sick must bear        140</a>
<a id='line_1910'>    Their bodies on: then Sirius fell to burn the acres dry;</a>
<a id='line_1911'>    The grass was parched, the harvest sick all victual did deny.</a>
<a id='line_1912'>    Then bids my father back once more o'er the twice-measured main,</a>
<a id='line_1913'>    To Phoebus and Ortygia's strand, some grace of prayer to gain:</a>
<a id='line_1914'>    What end to our outworn estate he giveth? whence will he</a>
<a id='line_1915'>    That we should seek us aid of toil; where turn to o'er the sea?</a>
<a id='line_1916'>    Night falleth, and all lives of earth doth sleep on bosom bear,</a>
<a id='line_1917'>    When lo, the holy images, the Phrygian House-gods there,</a>
<a id='line_1918'>    E'en them I bore away from Troy and heart of burning town,</a>
<a id='line_1919'>    Were present to the eyes of me in slumber laid adown,                150</a>
<a id='line_1920'>    Clear shining in the plenteous light that over all was shed</a>
<a id='line_1921'>    By the great moon anigh her full through windows fashionèd.</a>
<a id='line_1922'>    Then thus they fall to speech with me, end of my care to make:</a>
<a id='line_1923'></a>
<a id='line_1924'>    'The thing that in Ortygia erst the seer Apollo spake</a>
<a id='line_1925'>    Here telleth he, and to thy doors come we of his good will:</a>
<a id='line_1926'>    Thee and thine arms from Troy aflame fast have we followed still.</a>
<a id='line_1927'>    We 'neath thy care and in thy keel have climbed the swelling sea,</a>
<a id='line_1928'>    And we shall bear unto the stars thy sons that are to be,</a>
<a id='line_1929'>    And give thy city majesty: make ready mighty wall</a>
<a id='line_1930'>    For mighty men, nor toil of way leave thou, though long it fall.     160</a>
<a id='line_1931'>    Shift hence abode; the Delian-born Apollo ne'er made sweet</a>
<a id='line_1932'>    These shores for thee, nor bade thee set thy city down in Crete:</a>
<a id='line_1933'>    There is a place, the Westland called of Greeks in days that are,</a>
<a id='line_1934'>    An ancient land, a fruitful soil, a mighty land of war;</a>
<a id='line_1935'>    Oenotrian folk first tilled the land, whose sons, as rumours run,</a>
<a id='line_1936'>    Now call it nought but Italy, from him who led them on.</a>
<a id='line_1937'>    This is our very due abode: thence Dardanus outbroke,</a>
<a id='line_1938'>    Iasius our father thence, beginner of our folk.</a>
<a id='line_1939'>    Come rise, and glad these tidings tell unto thy father old,</a>
<a id='line_1940'>    No doubtful tale: now Corythus, Ausonian field and fold              170</a>
<a id='line_1941'>    Let him go seek, for Jupiter banneth Dictæan mead.'</a>
<a id='line_1942'></a>
<a id='line_1943'>    All mazed was I with sight and voice of Gods; because indeed</a>
<a id='line_1944'>    This was not sleep, but face to face, as one a real thing sees.</a>
<a id='line_1945'>    I seemed to see their coifèd hair and very visages,</a>
<a id='line_1946'>    And over all my body too cold sweat of trembling flowed.</a>
<a id='line_1947'>    I tore my body from the bed, and, crying out aloud,</a>
<a id='line_1948'>    I stretched my upturned hands to heaven and unstained gifts I spilled</a>
<a id='line_1949'>    Upon the hearth, and joyfully that worship I fulfilled.</a>
<a id='line_1950'>    Anchises next I do to wit and all the thing unlock;</a>
<a id='line_1951'>    And he, he saw the twi-branched stem, twin fathers of our stock,     180</a>
<a id='line_1952'>    And how by fault of yesterday through steads of old he strayed.</a>
<a id='line_1953'></a>
<a id='line_1954'>    'O son, well learned in all the lore of Ilium's fate,' he said,</a>
<a id='line_1955'>    'Cassandra only of such hap would sing; I mind me well</a>
<a id='line_1956'>    Of like fate meted to our folk full oft would she foretell;</a>
<a id='line_1957'>    And oft would call to Italy and that Hesperian home.</a>
<a id='line_1958'>    But who believed that Teucrian folk on any day might come</a>
<a id='line_1959'>    Unto Hesperia's shores? or who might trow Cassandra then?</a>
<a id='line_1960'>    Yield we to Phoebus, follow we as better counselled men</a>
<a id='line_1961'>    The better part.'</a>
<a id='line_1962'>                     We, full of joy, obey him with one mind;</a>
<a id='line_1963'>    From this seat too we fare away and leave a few behind;              190</a>
<a id='line_1964'>    With sail abroad in hollow tree we skim the ocean o'er.</a>
<a id='line_1965'></a>
<a id='line_1966'>    But when our keels the deep sea made, nor had we any more</a>
<a id='line_1967'>    The land in sight, but sea around, and sky around was spread,</a>
<a id='line_1968'>    A coal-blue cloud drew up to us that, hanging overhead,</a>
<a id='line_1969'>    Bore night and storm, and mirky gloom o'er all the waters cast:</a>
<a id='line_1970'>    Therewith the winds heap up the waves, the seas are rising fast</a>
<a id='line_1971'>    And huge; and through the mighty whirl scattered we toss about;</a>
<a id='line_1972'>    The storm-clouds wrap around the day, and wet mirk blotteth out</a>
<a id='line_1973'>    The heavens, and mid the riven clouds the ceaseless lightnings live.</a>
<a id='line_1974'>    So are we blown from out our course, through might of seas we drive,  200</a>
<a id='line_1975'>    Nor e'en might Palinurus self the day from night-tide sift,</a>
<a id='line_1976'>    Nor have a deeming of the road atwixt the watery drift.</a>
<a id='line_1977'>    Still on for three uncertain suns, that blind mists overlay,</a>
<a id='line_1978'>    And e'en so many starless nights, across the sea we stray;</a>
<a id='line_1979'>    But on the fourth day at the last afar upon us broke</a>
<a id='line_1980'>    The mountains of another land, mid curling wreaths of smoke.</a>
<a id='line_1981'>    Then fall the sails, we rise on oars, no sloth hath any place,</a>
<a id='line_1982'>    The eager seamen toss the spray and sweep the blue sea's face;</a>
<a id='line_1983'>    And me first saved from whirl of waves the Strophades on strand</a>
<a id='line_1984'>    Now welcome; named by Greekish name Isles of the Sea, they stand     210</a>
<a id='line_1985'>    Amid the great Ionian folk: Celæno holds the shores,</a>
<a id='line_1986'>    And others of the Harpies grim, since shut were Phineus' doors</a>
<a id='line_1987'>    Against them, and they had to leave the tables they had won.</a>
<a id='line_1988'>    No monster woefuller than they, and crueller is none</a>
<a id='line_1989'>    Of all God's plagues and curses dread from Stygian waters sent.</a>
<a id='line_1990'>    A wingèd thing with maiden face, whose bellies' excrement</a>
<a id='line_1991'>    Is utter foul; and hookèd hands, and face for ever pale</a>
<a id='line_1992'>    With hunger that no feeding stints.</a>
<a id='line_1993'></a>
<a id='line_1994'>    Borne thither, into haven come, we see how everywhere</a>
<a id='line_1995'>    The merry wholesome herds of neat feed down the meadows fair,        220</a>
<a id='line_1996'>    And all untended goatish flocks amid the herbage bite.</a>
<a id='line_1997'>    With point and edge we fall on them, and all the Gods invite,</a>
<a id='line_1998'>    Yea very Jove, to share the spoil, and on the curvèd strand</a>
<a id='line_1999'>    We strew the beds, and feast upon rich dainties of the land.</a>
<a id='line_2000'>    When lo, with sudden dreadful rush from out the mountains hap</a>
<a id='line_2001'>    The Harpy folk, and all about their clanging wings they flap,</a>
<a id='line_2002'>    And foul all things with filthy touch as at the food they wrench,</a>
<a id='line_2003'>    And riseth up their grisly voice amid the evilest stench.</a>
<a id='line_2004'></a>
<a id='line_2005'>    Once more then 'neath a hollow rock at a long valley's head,         229</a>
<a id='line_2006'>    Where close around the boughs of trees their quavering shadows shed,</a>
<a id='line_2007'>    We dight the boards, and once again flame on the altars raise.</a>
<a id='line_2008'>    Again from diverse parts of heaven, from dusky lurking-place,</a>
<a id='line_2009'>    The shrieking rout with hookèd feet about the prey doth fly,</a>
<a id='line_2010'>    Fouling the feast with mouth: therewith I bid my company</a>
<a id='line_2011'>    To arms, that with an evil folk the war may come to pass.</a>
<a id='line_2012'>    They do no less than my commands, and lay along the grass</a>
<a id='line_2013'>    Their hidden swords, and therewithal their bucklers cover o'er.</a>
<a id='line_2014'>    Wherefore, when swooping down again, they fill the curvèd shore</a>
<a id='line_2015'>    With noise, Misenus blows the call from off a watch-stead high</a>
<a id='line_2016'>    With hollow brass; our folk fall on and wondrous battle try,         240</a>
<a id='line_2017'>    Striving that sea-fowl's filthy folk with point and edge to spill.</a>
<a id='line_2018'>    But nought will bite upon their backs, and from their feathers still</a>
<a id='line_2019'>    Glanceth the sword, and swift they flee up 'neath the stars of air,</a>
<a id='line_2020'>    Half-eaten meat and token foul leaving behind them there.</a>
<a id='line_2021'>    But on a rock exceeding high yet did Celæeno rest,</a>
<a id='line_2022'>    Unhappy seer! there breaks withal a voice from out her breast:</a>
<a id='line_2023'></a>
<a id='line_2024'>    'What, war to pay for slaughtered neat, war for our heifers slain?</a>
<a id='line_2025'>    O children of Laomedon, the war then will ye gain?</a>
<a id='line_2026'>    The sackless Harpies will ye drive from their own land away?</a>
<a id='line_2027'>    Then let this sink into your souls, heed well the words I say;       250</a>
<a id='line_2028'>    The Father unto Phoebus told a tale that Phoebus told</a>
<a id='line_2029'>    To me, and I the first-born fiend that same to you unfold:</a>
<a id='line_2030'>    Ye sail for Italy, and ye, the winds appeased by prayer,</a>
<a id='line_2031'>    Shall come to Italy, and gain the grace of haven there:</a>
<a id='line_2032'>    Yet shall ye gird no wall about the city granted you,</a>
<a id='line_2033'>    Till famine, and this murder's wrong that ye were fain to do,</a>
<a id='line_2034'>    Drive you your tables gnawed with teeth to eat up utterly.'</a>
<a id='line_2035'></a>
<a id='line_2036'>    She spake, and through the woody deeps borne off on wings did fly.</a>
<a id='line_2037'>    But sudden fear fell on our folk, and chilled their frozen blood;    259</a>
<a id='line_2038'>    Their hearts fell down; with weapon-stroke no more they deem it good</a>
<a id='line_2039'>    To seek for peace: but rather now sore prayers and vows they will,</a>
<a id='line_2040'>    Whether these things be goddesses or filthy fowls of ill.</a>
<a id='line_2041'>    Father Anchises on the strand stretched both his hands abroad,</a>
<a id='line_2042'>    And, bidding all their worship due, the Mighty Ones adored:</a>
<a id='line_2043'>    'Gods, bring their threats to nought! O Gods, turn ye the curse, we pray!</a>
<a id='line_2044'>    Be kind, and keep the pious folk!'</a>
<a id='line_2045'>                                      Then bade he pluck away</a>
<a id='line_2046'>    The hawser from the shore and slack the warping cable's strain:</a>
<a id='line_2047'>    The south wind fills the sails, we fare o'er foaming waves again,</a>
<a id='line_2048'>    E'en as the helmsman and the winds have will that we should fare.</a>
<a id='line_2049'></a>
<a id='line_2050'>    And now amidmost of the flood Zacynthus' woods appear,               270</a>
<a id='line_2051'>    Dulichium, Samos, Neritos, with sides of stony steep:</a>
<a id='line_2052'>    Wide course from cliffs of Ithaca, Laertes' land, we keep,</a>
<a id='line_2053'>    Cursing the soil that bore and nursed Ulysses' cruelty.</a>
<a id='line_2054'>    Now open up Leucata's peaks, that fare so cloudy high</a>
<a id='line_2055'>    Over Apollo, mighty dread to all seafarers grown;</a>
<a id='line_2056'>    But weary thither do we steer and make the little town,</a>
<a id='line_2057'>    We cast the anchors from the bows and swing the sterns a-strand.</a>
<a id='line_2058'>    And therewithal since we at last have gained the longed-for land,</a>
<a id='line_2059'>    We purge us before Jupiter and by the altars pray,</a>
<a id='line_2060'>    Then on the shores of Actium's head the Ilian plays we play.         280</a>
<a id='line_2061'>    Anointed with the sleeking oil there strive our fellows stripped</a>
<a id='line_2062'>    In wrestling game of fatherland: it joys us to have slipped</a>
<a id='line_2063'>    By such a host of Argive towns amidmost of the foe.</a>
<a id='line_2064'></a>
<a id='line_2065'>    Meanwhile, the sun still pressing on, the year about doth go,</a>
<a id='line_2066'>    And frosty winter with his north the sea's face rough doth wear;</a>
<a id='line_2067'>    A buckler of the hollow brass of mighty Abas' gear</a>
<a id='line_2068'>    I set amid the temple-doors with singing scroll thereon,</a>
<a id='line_2069'>    ÆNEAS HANGETH ARMOUR HERE FROM CONQUERING DANAANS WON.</a>
<a id='line_2070'>    And then I bid to leave the shore and man the thwarts again.</a>
<a id='line_2071'>    Hard strive the folk in smiting sea, and oar-blades brush the main.  290</a>
<a id='line_2072'>    The airy high Phæacian towers sink down behind our wake,</a>
<a id='line_2073'>    And coasting the Epirote shores Chaonia's bay we make,</a>
<a id='line_2074'>    And so Buthrotus' city-walls high set we enter in.</a>
<a id='line_2075'></a>
<a id='line_2076'>    There tidings hard for us to trow unto our ears do win,</a>
<a id='line_2077'>    How Helenus, e'en Priam's son, hath gotten wife and crown</a>
<a id='line_2078'>    Of Pyrrhus come of Æacus, and ruleth Greekish town,</a>
<a id='line_2079'>    And that Andromache hath wed one of her folk once more.</a>
<a id='line_2080'>    All mazed am I; for wondrous love my heart was kindling sore</a>
<a id='line_2081'>    To give some word unto the man, of such great things to learn:</a>
<a id='line_2082'>    So from the haven forth I fare, from ships and shore I turn.         300</a>
<a id='line_2083'></a>
<a id='line_2084'>    But as it happed Andromache was keeping yearly day,</a>
<a id='line_2085'>    Pouring sad gifts unto the dead, amidst a grove that lay</a>
<a id='line_2086'>    Outside the town, by wave that feigned the Simoïs that had been,</a>
<a id='line_2087'>    Blessing the dead by Hector's mound empty and grassy green,</a>
<a id='line_2088'>    Which she with altars twain thereby had hallowed for her tears.</a>
<a id='line_2089'>    But when she saw me drawing nigh with armour that Troy bears</a>
<a id='line_2090'>    About me, senseless, throughly feared with marvels grown so great,</a>
<a id='line_2091'>    She stiffens midst her gaze; her bones are reft of life-blood's heat,</a>
<a id='line_2092'>    She totters, scarce, a long while o'er, this word comes forth from her:</a>
<a id='line_2093'></a>
<a id='line_2094'>    'Is the show true, O Goddess-born? com'st thou a messenger           310</a>
<a id='line_2095'>    Alive indeed? or if from thee the holy light is fled,</a>
<a id='line_2096'>    Where then is Hector?'</a>
<a id='line_2097'>                           Flowed the tears e'en as the word she said,</a>
<a id='line_2098'>    And with her wailing rang the place: sore moved I scarce may speak</a>
<a id='line_2099'>    This word to her, grown wild with grief, in broken voice and weak:</a>
<a id='line_2100'>    'I live indeed, I drag my life through outer ways of ill;</a>
<a id='line_2101'>    Doubt not, thou seest the very sooth.</a>
<a id='line_2102'>    Alas! what hap hath caught thee up from such a man downcast?</a>
<a id='line_2103'>    Hath any fortune worthy thee come back again at last?</a>
<a id='line_2104'>    Doth Hector's own Andromache yet serve in Pyrrhus' bed?'</a>
<a id='line_2105'></a>
<a id='line_2106'>    She cast her countenance adown, and in a low voice said:             320</a>
<a id='line_2107'>    'O thou alone of Trojan maids that won a little joy,</a>
<a id='line_2108'>    Bidden to die on foeman's tomb before the walls of Troy!</a>
<a id='line_2109'>    Who died, and never had to bear the sifting lot's award,</a>
<a id='line_2110'>    Whose slavish body never touched the bed of victor lord!</a>
<a id='line_2111'>    We from our burning fatherland carried o'er many a sea,</a>
<a id='line_2112'>    Of Achillæan offspring's pride the yoke-fellow must be,</a>
<a id='line_2113'>    Must bear the childbed of a slave: thereafter he, being led</a>
<a id='line_2114'>    To Leda's child Hermione and that Laconian bed,</a>
<a id='line_2115'>    To Helenus his very thrall me very thrall gave o'er:</a>
<a id='line_2116'>    But there Orestes, set on fire by all the love he bore               330</a>
<a id='line_2117'>    His ravished wife, and mad with hate, comes on him unaware</a>
<a id='line_2118'>    Before his fathers' altar-stead and slays him then and there.</a>
<a id='line_2119'></a>
<a id='line_2120'>    By death of Neoptolemus his kingdom's leavings came</a>
<a id='line_2121'>    To Helenus, who called the fields Chaonian fields by name,</a>
<a id='line_2122'>    And all the land Chaonia, from Chaon of Troy-town;</a>
<a id='line_2123'>    And Pergamus and Ilian burg on ridgy steep set down.</a>
<a id='line_2124'>    What winds, what fates gave thee the road to cross the ocean o'er?</a>
<a id='line_2125'>    Or what of Gods hath borne thee on unwitting to our shore?</a>
<a id='line_2126'>    What of the boy Ascanius? lives he and breathes he yet?</a>
<a id='line_2127'>    Whom unto thee when Troy yet was----                                 340</a>
<a id='line_2128'>    The boy then, of his mother lost, hath he a thought of her?</a>
<a id='line_2129'>    Do him Æneas, Hector gone, father and uncle, stir,</a>
<a id='line_2130'>    To valour of the ancient days, and great hearts' glorious gain?'</a>
<a id='line_2131'></a>
<a id='line_2132'>    Such tale she poured forth, weeping sore, and long she wept in vain</a>
<a id='line_2133'>    Great floods of tears: when lo, from out the city draweth nigh</a>
<a id='line_2134'>    Lord Helenus the Priam-born midst mighty company,</a>
<a id='line_2135'>    And knows his kin, and joyfully leads onward to his door,</a>
<a id='line_2136'>    Though many a tear 'twixt broken words the while doth he outpour.</a>
<a id='line_2137'>    So on; a little Troy I see feigned from great Troy of fame,</a>
<a id='line_2138'>    A Pergamus, a sandy brook that hath the Xanthus name,                350</a>
<a id='line_2139'>    On threshold of a Scæan gate I stoop to lay a kiss.</a>
<a id='line_2140'>    Soon, too, all Teucrian folk are wrapped in friendly city's bliss,</a>
<a id='line_2141'>    And them the King fair welcomes in amid his cloisters broad,</a>
<a id='line_2142'>    And they amidmost of the hall the bowls of Bacchus poured,</a>
<a id='line_2143'>    The meat was set upon the gold, and cups they held in hand.</a>
<a id='line_2144'></a>
<a id='line_2145'>    So passed a day and other day, until the gales command</a>
<a id='line_2146'>    The sails aloft, and canvas swells with wind from out the South:</a>
<a id='line_2147'>    Therewith I speak unto the seer, such matters in my mouth:</a>
<a id='line_2148'>    'O Troy-born, O Gods' messenger, who knowest Phoebus' will,</a>
<a id='line_2149'>    The tripods and the Clarian's bay, and what the stars fulfil,        360</a>
<a id='line_2150'>    And tongues of fowl, and omens brought by swift foreflying wing,</a>
<a id='line_2151'>    Come, tell the tale! for of my way a happy heartening thing</a>
<a id='line_2152'>    All shrines have said, and all the Gods have bid me follow on</a>
<a id='line_2153'>    To Italy, till outland shores, far off, remote were won:</a>
<a id='line_2154'>    Alone Celæno, Harpy-fowl, new dread of fate set forth,</a>
<a id='line_2155'>    Unmeet to tell, and bade us fear the grimmest day of wrath,</a>
<a id='line_2156'>    And ugly hunger. How may I by early perils fare?</a>
<a id='line_2157'>    Or doing what may I have might such toil to overbear?'</a>
<a id='line_2158'></a>
<a id='line_2159'>    So Helenus, when he hath had the heifers duly slain,</a>
<a id='line_2160'>    Prays peace of Gods, from hallowed head he doffs the bands again,    370</a>
<a id='line_2161'>    And then with hand he leadeth me, O Phoebus, to thy door,</a>
<a id='line_2162'>    My fluttering soul with all thy might of godhead shadowed o'er.</a>
<a id='line_2163'>    There forth at last from God-loved mouth the seer this word did send:</a>
<a id='line_2164'></a>
<a id='line_2165'>    'O Goddess-born, full certainly across the sea ye wend</a>
<a id='line_2166'>    By mightiest bidding, such the lot the King of Gods hath found</a>
<a id='line_2167'>    All fateful; so he rolls the world, so turns its order round.</a>
<a id='line_2168'>    Few things from many will I tell that thou the outland sea</a>
<a id='line_2169'>    May'st sail the safer, and at last make land in Italy;</a>
<a id='line_2170'>    The other things the Parcæ still ban Helenus to wot,</a>
<a id='line_2171'>    Saturnian Juno's will it is that more he utter not.                  380</a>
<a id='line_2172'>    First, from that Italy, which thou unwitting deem'st anigh,</a>
<a id='line_2173'>    Thinking to make in little space the haven close hereby,</a>
<a id='line_2174'>    Long is the wayless way that shears, and long the length of land;</a>
<a id='line_2175'>    And first in the Trinacrian wave must bend the rower's wand.</a>
<a id='line_2176'>    On plain of that Ausonian salt your ships must stray awhile,</a>
<a id='line_2177'>    And thou must see the nether meres, Ææan Circe's isle,</a>
<a id='line_2178'>    Ere thou on earth assured and safe thy city may'st set down.</a>
<a id='line_2179'>    I show thee tokens; in thy soul store thou the tokens shown.</a>
<a id='line_2180'>    When thou with careful heart shalt stray the secret stream anigh,</a>
<a id='line_2181'>    And 'neath the holm-oaks of the shore shalt see a great sow lie,     390</a>
<a id='line_2182'>    That e'en now farrowed thirty head of young, long on the ground</a>
<a id='line_2183'>    She lieth white, with piglings white their mother's dugs around,--</a>
<a id='line_2184'>    That earth shall be thy city's place, there rest from toil is stored.</a>
<a id='line_2185'>    Nor shudder at the coming curse, the gnawing of the board,</a>
<a id='line_2186'>    The Fates shall find a way thereto; Apollo called shall come.</a>
<a id='line_2187'>    But flee these lands of Italy, this shore so near our home,</a>
<a id='line_2188'>    That washing of the strand thereof our very sea-tide seeks;</a>
<a id='line_2189'>    For in all cities thereabout abide the evil Greeks.</a>
<a id='line_2190'>    There now have come the Locrian folk Narycian walls to build;</a>
<a id='line_2191'>    And Lyctian Idomeneus Sallentine meads hath filled                   400</a>
<a id='line_2192'>    With war-folk; Philoctetes there holdeth Petelia small,</a>
<a id='line_2193'>    Now by that Meliboean duke fenced round with mighty wall.</a>
<a id='line_2194'>    Moreover, when your ships have crossed the sea, and there do stay,</a>
<a id='line_2195'>    And on the altars raised thereto your vows ashore ye pay,</a>
<a id='line_2196'>    Be veiled of head, and wrap thyself in cloth of purple dye,</a>
<a id='line_2197'>    Lest 'twixt you and the holy fires ye light to God on high</a>
<a id='line_2198'>    Some face of foeman should thrust in the holy signs to spill.</a>
<a id='line_2199'>    Now let thy folk, yea and thyself, this worship thus fulfil,</a>
<a id='line_2200'>    And let thy righteous sons of sons such fashion ever mind.</a>
<a id='line_2201'>    But when, gone forth, to Sicily thou comest on the wind,             410</a>
<a id='line_2202'>    And when Pelorus' narrow sea is widening all away,</a>
<a id='line_2203'>    Your course for leftward lying land and leftward waters lay,</a>
<a id='line_2204'>    How long soe'er ye reach about: flee right-hand shore and wave.</a>
<a id='line_2205'>    In time agone some mighty thing this place to wrack down drave,</a>
<a id='line_2206'>    So much for changing of the world doth lapse of time avail.</a>
<a id='line_2207'></a>
<a id='line_2208'>    It split atwain, when heretofore the two lands, saith the tale,</a>
<a id='line_2209'>    Had been but one, the sea rushed in and clave with mighty flood</a>
<a id='line_2210'>    Hesperia's side from Italy, and field and city stood</a>
<a id='line_2211'>    Drawn back on either shore, along a sundering sea-race strait.</a>
<a id='line_2212'>    There Scylla on the right hand lurks, the left insatiate             420</a>
<a id='line_2213'>    Charybdis holds, who in her maw all whirling deep adown</a>
<a id='line_2214'>    Sucketh the great flood tumbling in thrice daily, which out-thrown</a>
<a id='line_2215'>    Thrice daily doth she spout on high, smiting the stars with brine.</a>
<a id='line_2216'>    But Scylla doth the hidden hole of mirky cave confine;</a>
<a id='line_2217'>    With face thrust forth she draweth ships on to that stony bed;</a>
<a id='line_2218'>    Manlike above, with maiden breast and lovely fashioned</a>
<a id='line_2219'>    Down to the midst, she hath below huge body of a whale,</a>
<a id='line_2220'>    And unto maw of wolfish heads is knit a dolphin's tail.</a>
<a id='line_2221'>    'Tis better far to win about Pachynus, outer ness</a>
<a id='line_2222'>    Of Sicily, and reach long round, despite the weariness,              430</a>
<a id='line_2223'>    Than have that ugly sight of her within her awful den,</a>
<a id='line_2224'>    And hear her coal-blue baying dogs and rocks that ring again.</a>
<a id='line_2225'></a>
<a id='line_2226'>    Now furthermore if Helenus in anything have skill,</a>
<a id='line_2227'>    Or aught of trust, or if his soul with sooth Apollo fill,</a>
<a id='line_2228'>    Of one thing, Goddess-born, will I forewarn thee over all,</a>
<a id='line_2229'>    And spoken o'er and o'er again my word on thee shall fall:</a>
<a id='line_2230'>    The mighty Juno's godhead first let many a prayer seek home;</a>
<a id='line_2231'>    To Juno sing your vows in joy, with suppliant gifts o'ercome</a>
<a id='line_2232'>    That Lady of all Might; and so, Trinacria overpast,</a>
<a id='line_2233'>    Shalt thou be sped to Italy victorious at the last.                  440</a>
<a id='line_2234'>    When there thou com'st and Cumæ's town amidst thy way hast found,</a>
<a id='line_2235'>    The Holy Meres, Avernus' woods fruitful of many a sound,</a>
<a id='line_2236'>    There the wild seer-maid shalt thou see, who in a rock-hewn cave</a>
<a id='line_2237'>    Singeth of fate, and letteth leaves her names and tokens have:</a>
<a id='line_2238'>    But whatso song upon those leaves the maiden seer hath writ</a>
<a id='line_2239'>    She ordereth duly, and in den of live stone leaveth it:</a>
<a id='line_2240'>    There lie the written leaves unmoved, nor shift their ordered rows.</a>
<a id='line_2241'>    But when the hinge works round, and thence a light air on them blows,</a>
<a id='line_2242'>    Then, when the door doth disarray among the frail leaves bear,</a>
<a id='line_2243'>    To catch them fluttering in the cave she never hath a care,          450</a>
<a id='line_2244'>    Nor will she set them back again nor make the song-words meet;</a>
<a id='line_2245'>    So folk unanswered go their ways and loathe the Sibyl's seat.</a>
<a id='line_2246'>    But thou, count not the cost of time that there thou hast to spend;</a>
<a id='line_2247'>    Although thy fellows blame thee sore, and length of way to wend</a>
<a id='line_2248'>    Call on thy sails, and thou may'st fill their folds with happy gale,</a>
<a id='line_2249'>    Draw nigh the seer, and strive with prayers to have her holy tale;</a>
<a id='line_2250'>    Beseech her sing, and that her words from willing tongue go free:</a>
<a id='line_2251'>    So reverenced shall she tell thee tale of folk of Italy</a>
<a id='line_2252'>    And wars to come; and how to 'scape, and how to bear each ill,</a>
<a id='line_2253'>    And with a happy end at last thy wandering shall fulfil.             460</a>
<a id='line_2254'>    Now is this all my tongue is moved to tell thee lawfully:</a>
<a id='line_2255'>    Go, let thy deeds Troy's mightiness exalt above the sky!'</a>
<a id='line_2256'></a>
<a id='line_2257'>    So when the seer from loving mouth such words as this had said,</a>
<a id='line_2258'>    Then gifts of heavy gold and gifts of carven tooth he bade</a>
<a id='line_2259'>    Be borne a-shipboard; and our keels he therewithal doth stow</a>
<a id='line_2260'>    With Dodonæan kettle-ware and silver great enow,</a>
<a id='line_2261'>    A coat of hookèd woven mail and triple golden chain,</a>
<a id='line_2262'>    A helm with noble towering crest crowned with a flowing mane,</a>
<a id='line_2263'>    The arms of Pyrrhus: gifts most meet my father hath withal;</a>
<a id='line_2264'>    And steeds he gives and guides he gives,                             470</a>
<a id='line_2265'>    Fills up the tale of oars, and arms our fellows to their need.</a>
<a id='line_2266'>    Anchises still was bidding us meanwhile to have a heed</a>
<a id='line_2267'>    Of setting sail, nor with the wind all fair to make delay;</a>
<a id='line_2268'>    To whom with words of worship now doth Phoebus' servant say:</a>
<a id='line_2269'>    'Anchises, thou whom Venus' bed hath made so glorious,</a>
<a id='line_2270'>    Care of the Gods, twice caught away from ruin of Pergamus,</a>
<a id='line_2271'>    Lo, there the Ausonian land for thee, set sail upon the chase:</a>
<a id='line_2272'>    Yet needs must thou upon the sea glide by its neighbouring face.</a>
<a id='line_2273'>    Far off is that Ausonia yet that Phoebus open lays.</a>
<a id='line_2274'>    Fare forth, made glad with pious son! why tread I longer ways        480</a>
<a id='line_2275'>    Of speech, and stay the rising South with words that I would tell?'</a>
<a id='line_2276'></a>
<a id='line_2277'>    And therewithal Andromache, sad with the last farewell,</a>
<a id='line_2278'>    Brings for Ascanius raiment wrought with picturing wool of gold,</a>
<a id='line_2279'>    And Phrygian coat; nor will she have our honour wax acold,</a>
<a id='line_2280'>    But loads him with the woven gifts, and such word sayeth she:</a>
<a id='line_2281'>    'Take these, fair boy; keep them to be my hands' last memory,</a>
<a id='line_2282'>    The tokens of enduring love thy younger days did win</a>
<a id='line_2283'>    From Hector's wife Andromache, the last gifts of thy kin.</a>
<a id='line_2284'>    O thou, of my Astyanax the only image now!</a>
<a id='line_2285'>    Such eyes he had, such hands he had, such countenance as thou,       490</a>
<a id='line_2286'>    And now with thee were growing up in equal tale of years.'</a>
<a id='line_2287'></a>
<a id='line_2288'>    Then I, departing, spake to them amid my rising tears:</a>
<a id='line_2289'>    'Live happy! Ye with fortune's game have nothing more to play,</a>
<a id='line_2290'>    While we from side to side thereof are hurried swift away.</a>
<a id='line_2291'>    Your rest hath blossomed and brought forth; no sea-field shall ye till,</a>
<a id='line_2292'>    Seeking the fields of Italy that fade before you still.</a>
<a id='line_2293'>    Ye see another Xanthus here, ye see another Troy,</a>
<a id='line_2294'>    Made by your hands for better days mehopes, and longer joy:</a>
<a id='line_2295'>    And soothly less it lies across the pathway of the Greek,</a>
<a id='line_2296'>    If ever I that Tiber flood and Tiber fields I seek                   500</a>
<a id='line_2297'>    Shall enter, and behold the walls our folk shall win of fate.</a>
<a id='line_2298'>    Twin cities some day shall we have, and folks confederate,</a>
<a id='line_2299'>    Epirus and Hesperia; from Dardanus each came,</a>
<a id='line_2300'>    One fate had each: them shall we make one city and the same,</a>
<a id='line_2301'>    One Troy in heart: lo, let our sons of sons' sons see to it!'</a>
<a id='line_2302'></a>
<a id='line_2303'>    Past nigh Ceraunian mountain-sides thence o'er the sea we flit,</a>
<a id='line_2304'>    Whence the sea-way to Italy the shortest may be made.</a>
<a id='line_2305'>    But in the meanwhile sets the sun, the dusk hills lie in shade,</a>
<a id='line_2306'>    And, choosing oar-wards, down we lie on bosom of the land</a>
<a id='line_2307'>    So wished for: by the water-side and on the dry sea-strand           510</a>
<a id='line_2308'>    We tend our bodies here and there; sleep floodeth every limb.</a>
<a id='line_2309'>    But ere the hour-bedriven night in midmost orb did swim,</a>
<a id='line_2310'>    Nought slothful Palinurus rose, and wisdom strives to win</a>
<a id='line_2311'>    Of all the winds: with eager ear the breeze he drinketh in;</a>
<a id='line_2312'>    He noteth how through silent heaven the stars soft gliding fare,</a>
<a id='line_2313'>    Arcturus, the wet Hyades, and either Northern Bear,</a>
<a id='line_2314'>    And through and through he searcheth out Orion girt with gold.</a>
<a id='line_2315'>    So when he sees how everything a peaceful sky foretold,</a>
<a id='line_2316'>    He bloweth clear from off the poop, and we our campment shift,</a>
<a id='line_2317'>    And try the road and spread abroad our sail-wings to the lift.       520</a>
<a id='line_2318'></a>
<a id='line_2319'>    And now, the stars all put to flight, Aurora's blushes grow,</a>
<a id='line_2320'>    When we behold dim fells afar and long lands lying low,</a>
<a id='line_2321'>    --E'en Italy. Achates first cries out on Italy;</a>
<a id='line_2322'>    To Italy our joyous folk glad salutation cry.</a>
<a id='line_2323'>    Anchises then a mighty bowl crowned with a garland fair,</a>
<a id='line_2324'>    And filled it with unwatered wine and called the Gods to hear,</a>
<a id='line_2325'>    High standing on the lofty deck:</a>
<a id='line_2326'>    'O Gods that rule the earth and sea, and all the tides of storm,</a>
<a id='line_2327'>    Make our way easy with the wind, breathe on us kindly breath!'</a>
<a id='line_2328'></a>
<a id='line_2329'>    Then riseth up the longed-for breeze, the haven openeth              530</a>
<a id='line_2330'>    As nigh we draw, and on the cliff a fane of Pallas shows:</a>
<a id='line_2331'>    Therewith our fellow-folk furl sail and shoreward turn the prows.</a>
<a id='line_2332'>    Bow-wise the bight is hollowed out by eastward-setting flood,</a>
<a id='line_2333'>    But over-foamed by salt-sea spray thrust out its twin horns stood,</a>
<a id='line_2334'>    While it lay hidden; tower-like rocks let down on either hand</a>
<a id='line_2335'>    Twin arms of rock-wall, and the fane lies backward from the stand.</a>
<a id='line_2336'></a>
<a id='line_2337'>    But I beheld upon the grass four horses, snowy white,</a>
<a id='line_2338'>    Grazing the meadows far and wide, first omen of my sight.</a>
<a id='line_2339'>    Father Anchises seeth and saith: 'New land, and bear'st thou war?</a>
<a id='line_2340'>    For war are horses dight; so these war-threatening herd-beasts are.  540</a>
<a id='line_2341'>    Yet whiles indeed those four-foot things in car will well refrain,</a>
<a id='line_2342'>    And tamed beneath the yoke will bear the bit and bridle's strain,</a>
<a id='line_2343'>    So there is yet a hope of peace.'</a>
<a id='line_2344'>                                     Then on the might we call</a>
<a id='line_2345'>    Of Pallas of the weapon-din, first welcomer of all,</a>
<a id='line_2346'>    And veil our brows before the Gods with cloth of Phrygian dye;</a>
<a id='line_2347'>    And that chief charge of Helenus we do all rightfully,</a>
<a id='line_2348'>    And Argive Juno worship there in such wise as is willed.</a>
<a id='line_2349'></a>
<a id='line_2350'>    We tarry not, but when all vows are duly there fulfilled,</a>
<a id='line_2351'>    Unto the wind our sail-yard horns we fall to turn about,</a>
<a id='line_2352'>    And leave the houses of the Greeks, and nursing fields of doubt.     550</a>
<a id='line_2353'>    And next is seen Tarentum's bay, the Herculean place</a>
<a id='line_2354'>    If fame tell true; Lacinia then, the house of Gods, we face;</a>
<a id='line_2355'>    And Caulon's towers, and Scylaceum, of old the shipman's bane.</a>
<a id='line_2356'>    Then see we Ætna rise far off above Trinacria's main;</a>
<a id='line_2357'>    Afar the mighty moan of sea, and sea-cliffs beaten sore,</a>
<a id='line_2358'>    We hearken, and the broken voice that cometh from the shore:</a>
<a id='line_2359'>    The sea leaps high upon the shoals, the eddy churns the sand.</a>
<a id='line_2360'></a>
<a id='line_2361'>    Then saith Anchises: 'Lo forsooth, Charybdis is at hand,</a>
<a id='line_2362'>    Those rocks and stones the dread whereof did Helenus foretell.</a>
<a id='line_2363'>    Save ye, O friends! swing out the oars together now and well!'       560</a>
<a id='line_2364'></a>
<a id='line_2365'>    Nor worser than his word they do, and first the roaring beaks</a>
<a id='line_2366'>    Doth Palinurus leftward wrest; then all the sea-host seeks</a>
<a id='line_2367'>    With sail and oar the waters wild upon the left that lie:</a>
<a id='line_2368'>    Upheaved upon the tossing whirl we fare unto the sky,</a>
<a id='line_2369'>    Then down unto the nether Gods we sink upon the wave:</a>
<a id='line_2370'>    Thrice from the hollow-carven rocks great roar the sea-cliffs gave;</a>
<a id='line_2371'>    Thrice did we see the spray cast forth and stars with sea-dew done;</a>
<a id='line_2372'>    But the wind left us weary folk at sinking of the sun,</a>
<a id='line_2373'>    And on the Cyclops' strand we glide unwitting of the way.</a>
<a id='line_2374'></a>
<a id='line_2375'>    Locked from the wind the haven is, itself an ample bay;              570</a>
<a id='line_2376'>    But hard at hand mid ruin and fear doth Ætna thunder loud;</a>
<a id='line_2377'>    And whiles it blasteth forth on air a black and dreadful cloud,</a>
<a id='line_2378'>    That rolleth on a pitchy wreath, where bright the ashes mix,</a>
<a id='line_2379'>    And heaveth up great globes of flame and heaven's high star-world licks,</a>
<a id='line_2380'>    And other whiles the very cliffs, and riven mountain-maw</a>
<a id='line_2381'>    It belches forth; the molten stones together will it draw</a>
<a id='line_2382'>    Aloft with moan, and boileth o'er from lowest inner vale.</a>
<a id='line_2383'>    This world of mountain presseth down, as told it is in tale,</a>
<a id='line_2384'>    Enceladus the thunder-scorched; huge Ætna on him cast,</a>
<a id='line_2385'>    From all her bursten furnaces breathes out his fiery blast;          580</a>
<a id='line_2386'>    And whensoe'er his weary side he shifteth, all the shore</a>
<a id='line_2387'>    Trinacrian trembleth murmuring, and heaven is smoke-clad o'er.</a>
<a id='line_2388'></a>
<a id='line_2389'>    In thicket close we wear the night amidst these marvels dread,</a>
<a id='line_2390'>    Nor may we see what thing it is that all that noise hath shed:</a>
<a id='line_2391'>    For neither showed the planet fires, nor was the heaven bright</a>
<a id='line_2392'>    With starry zenith; mirky cloud hung over all the night,</a>
<a id='line_2393'>    In mist of dead untimely tide the moon was hidden close.</a>
<a id='line_2394'></a>
<a id='line_2395'>    But when from earliest Eastern dawn the following day arose,</a>
<a id='line_2396'>    And fair Aurora from the heaven the watery shades had cleared,</a>
<a id='line_2397'>    Lo, suddenly from out the wood new shape of man appeared.            590</a>
<a id='line_2398'>    Unknown he was, most utter lean, in wretchedest of plight:</a>
<a id='line_2399'>    Shoreward he stretched his suppliant hands; we turn back at the sight,</a>
<a id='line_2400'>    And gaze on him: all squalor there, a mat of beard we see,</a>
<a id='line_2401'>    And raiment clasped with wooden thorns; and yet a Greek is he,</a>
<a id='line_2402'>    Yea, sent erewhile to leaguered Troy in Greekish weed of war.</a>
<a id='line_2403'>    But when he saw our Dardan guise and arms of Troy afar,</a>
<a id='line_2404'>    Feared at the sight he hung aback at first a little space,</a>
<a id='line_2405'>    But presently ran headlong down into our sea-side place</a>
<a id='line_2406'>    With tears and prayers:</a>
<a id='line_2407'>                           'O Teucrian men, by all the stars,' he cried,</a>
<a id='line_2408'>    'By all the Gods, by light of heaven ye breathe, O bear me wide      600</a>
<a id='line_2409'>    Away from here! to whatso land henceforth ye lead my feet</a>
<a id='line_2410'>    It is enough. That I am one from out the Danaan fleet,</a>
<a id='line_2411'>    And that I warred on Ilian house erewhile, most true it is;</a>
<a id='line_2412'>    For which, if I must pay so much wherein I wrought amiss,</a>
<a id='line_2413'>    Then strew me on the flood and sink my body in the sea!</a>
<a id='line_2414'>    To die by hands of very men shall be a joy to me.'</a>
<a id='line_2415'></a>
<a id='line_2416'>    He spake with arms about our knees, and wallowing still he clung</a>
<a id='line_2417'>    Unto our knees: but what he was and from what blood he sprung</a>
<a id='line_2418'>    We bade him say, and tell withal what fate upon him drave.</a>
<a id='line_2419'>    His right hand with no tarrying then Father Anchises gave            610</a>
<a id='line_2420'>    Unto the youth, and heartened him with utter pledge of peace.</a>
<a id='line_2421'>    So now he spake when fear of us amid his heart did cease:</a>
<a id='line_2422'></a>
<a id='line_2423'>    'Luckless Ulysses' man am I, and Ithaca me bore,</a>
<a id='line_2424'>    Hight Achemenides, who left that Adamastus poor</a>
<a id='line_2425'>    My father (would I still were there!) by leaguered Troy to be.</a>
<a id='line_2426'>    Here while my mates aquake with dread the cruel threshold flee,</a>
<a id='line_2427'>    They leave me in the Cyclops' den unmindful of their friend;</a>
<a id='line_2428'>    A house of blood and bloody meat, most huge from end to end,</a>
<a id='line_2429'>    Mirky within: high up aloft star-smiting to behold</a>
<a id='line_2430'>    Is he himself;--such bane, O God, keep thou from field and fold!     620</a>
<a id='line_2431'>    Scarce may a man look on his face; no word to him is good;</a>
<a id='line_2432'>    On wretches' entrails doth he feed and black abundant blood.</a>
<a id='line_2433'>    Myself I saw him of our folk two hapless bodies take</a>
<a id='line_2434'>    In his huge hand, whom straight he fell athwart a stone to break</a>
<a id='line_2435'>    As there he lay upon his back; I saw the threshold swim</a>
<a id='line_2436'>    With spouted blood, I saw him grind each bloody dripping limb,</a>
<a id='line_2437'>    I saw the joints amidst his teeth all warm and quivering still.</a>
<a id='line_2438'>    --He payed therefore, for never might Ulysses bear such ill,</a>
<a id='line_2439'>    Nor was he worser than himself in such a pinch bestead:</a>
<a id='line_2440'>    For when with victual satiate, deep sunk in wine, his head           630</a>
<a id='line_2441'>    Fell on his breast, and there he lay enormous through the den,</a>
<a id='line_2442'>    Snorting out gore amidst his sleep, with gobbets of the men</a>
<a id='line_2443'>    And mingled blood and wine; then we sought the great Gods with prayer</a>
<a id='line_2444'>    And drew the lots, and one and all crowded about him there,</a>
<a id='line_2445'>    And bored out with a sharpened pike the eye that used to lurk</a>
<a id='line_2446'>    Enormous lonely 'neath his brow overhanging grim and mirk,</a>
<a id='line_2447'>    As great a shield of Argolis, or Phoebus' lamp on high;</a>
<a id='line_2448'>    And so our murdered fellows' ghosts avenged we joyously.</a>
<a id='line_2449'>    --But ye, O miserable men, flee forth! make haste to pluck</a>
<a id='line_2450'>    The warping hawser from the shore!                                   640</a>
<a id='line_2451'>    For even such, and e'en so great as Polypheme in cave</a>
<a id='line_2452'>    Shuts in the wealth of woolly things and draws the udders' wave,</a>
<a id='line_2453'>    An hundred others commonly dwell o'er these curving bights,</a>
<a id='line_2454'>    Unutterable Cyclop folk, or stray about the heights.</a>
<a id='line_2455'>    Thrice have the twin horns of the moon fulfilled the circle clear</a>
<a id='line_2456'>    While I have dragged out life in woods and houses of the deer,</a>
<a id='line_2457'>    And gardens of the beasts; and oft from rocky place on high</a>
<a id='line_2458'>    Trembling I note the Cyclops huge, hear foot and voice go by.</a>
<a id='line_2459'>    And evil meat of wood-berries, and cornel's flinty fruit             649</a>
<a id='line_2460'>    The bush-boughs give; on grass at whiles I browse, and plucked-up root</a>
<a id='line_2461'>    So wandering all about, at last I see unto the shore</a>
<a id='line_2462'>    Your ships a-coming: thitherward my steps in haste I bore:</a>
<a id='line_2463'>    Whate'er might hap enough it was to flee this folk of ill;</a>
<a id='line_2464'>    Rather do ye in any wise the life within me spill.'</a>
<a id='line_2465'></a>
<a id='line_2466'>    And scarcely had he said the word ere on the hill above</a>
<a id='line_2467'>    The very shepherd Polypheme his mountain mass did move,</a>
<a id='line_2468'>    A marvel dread, a shapeless trunk, an eyeless monstrous thing,</a>
<a id='line_2469'>    Who down unto the shore well known his sheep was shepherding;</a>
<a id='line_2470'>    A pine-tree in the hand of him leads on and stays his feet;</a>
<a id='line_2471'>    The woolly sheep his fellows are, his only pleasure sweet,           660</a>
<a id='line_2472'>    The only solace of his ill.</a>
<a id='line_2473'>    But when he touched the waters deep, and mid the waves was come,</a>
<a id='line_2474'>    He falls to wash the flowing blood from off his eye dug out;</a>
<a id='line_2475'>    Gnashing his teeth and groaning sore he walks the sea about,</a>
<a id='line_2476'>    But none the less no wave there was up to his flank might win.</a>
<a id='line_2477'>    Afeard from far we haste to flee, and, having taken in</a>
<a id='line_2478'>    Our suppliant, who had earned it well, cut cable silently,</a>
<a id='line_2479'>    And bending to the eager oars sweep out along the sea.</a>
<a id='line_2480'>    He heard it, and his feet he set to follow on the sound;</a>
<a id='line_2481'>    But when his right hand failed to reach, and therewithal he found    670</a>
<a id='line_2482'>    He might not speed as fast as fares the Ionian billow lithe,</a>
<a id='line_2483'>    Then clamour measureless he raised, and ocean quaked therewith</a>
<a id='line_2484'>    Through every wave, and inwardly the land was terrified</a>
<a id='line_2485'>    Of Italy, and Ætna boomed from many-hollowed side.</a>
<a id='line_2486'>    But all the race of Cyclops stirred from woods and lofty hills,</a>
<a id='line_2487'>    Down rushes to the haven-side and all the haven fills;</a>
<a id='line_2488'>    And Ætna's gathered brethren there we see; in vain they stand</a>
<a id='line_2489'>    Glowering grim-eyed with heads high up in heaven, a dreadful band</a>
<a id='line_2490'>    Of councillors: they were as when on ridge aloft one sees</a>
<a id='line_2491'>    The oaks stand thick against the sky, and cone-hung cypresses,       680</a>
<a id='line_2492'>    Jove's lofty woods, or thicket where Diana's footsteps stray.</a>
<a id='line_2493'></a>
<a id='line_2494'>    Then headlong fear fell on our folk in whatsoever way</a>
<a id='line_2495'>    To shake the reefs out spreading sail to any wind that blew;</a>
<a id='line_2496'>    But Helenus had bid us steer a midmost course and true</a>
<a id='line_2497'>    'Twixt Scylla and Charybdis, lest to death we sail o'er-close:</a>
<a id='line_2498'>    So safest seemed for backward course to let the sails go loose.</a>
<a id='line_2499'>    But lo, from out Pelorus' strait comes down the northern flaw,</a>
<a id='line_2500'>    And past Pantagia's haven-mouth of living stone we draw,</a>
<a id='line_2501'>    And through the gulf of Megara by Thapsus lying low.</a>
<a id='line_2502'>    Such names did Achemenides, Ulysses' fellow, show,                   690</a>
<a id='line_2503'>    As now he coasted back again the shore erst wandered by.</a>
<a id='line_2504'></a>
<a id='line_2505'>    In jaws of the Sicanian bay there doth an island lie</a>
<a id='line_2506'>    Against Plemyrium's wavy face; folk called it in old days</a>
<a id='line_2507'>    Ortygia: there, as tells the tale, Alpheus burrowed ways</a>
<a id='line_2508'>    From his own Elis 'neath the sea, and now by mouth of thine,</a>
<a id='line_2509'>    O Arethusa, blendeth him with that Sicilian brine.</a>
<a id='line_2510'>    We pray the isle's great deities, e'en as we bidden were:</a>
<a id='line_2511'>    And thence we pass the earth o'erfat about Helorus' mere;</a>
<a id='line_2512'>    Then by Pachynus' lofty crags and thrust-forth rocks we skim,</a>
<a id='line_2513'>    And Camarina showeth next a long way off and dim;                    700</a>
<a id='line_2514'>    Her whom the Fates would ne'er be moved: then comes the plain in sight</a>
<a id='line_2515'>    Of Gela, yea, and Gela huge from her own river hight:</a>
<a id='line_2516'>    Then Acragas the very steep shows great walls far away,</a>
<a id='line_2517'>    Begetter of the herds of horse high-couraged on a day.</a>
<a id='line_2518'>    Then thee, Selinus of the palms, I leave with happy wind,</a>

<a id='line_2521'>    But next the firth of Drepanum, the strand without a joy,</a>
<a id='line_2522'>    Will have me. There I tossed so sore, the tempests' very toy,</a>

<a id='line_2524'>    Of every ill: me all alone, me weary, father dear,                   710</a>

<a id='line_2526'>    Ah, neither Helenus the seer, despite the fears he taught,</a>
<a id='line_2527'>    Nor grim Celæno in her wrath, this grief of soul forebode.</a>
<a id='line_2528'>    This was the latest of my toils, the goal of all my road,</a>
<a id='line_2529'>    For me departed thence some God to this your land did bear."</a>
<a id='line_2530'></a>
<a id='line_2531'>    So did the Father Æneas, with all at stretch to hear,</a>
<a id='line_2532'>    Tell o'er the fateful ways of God, and of his wanderings teach:</a>
<a id='line_2533'>    But here he hushed him at the last and made an end of speech.</a>

<a id='line_2540'>ARGUMENT.</a>
<a id='line_2541'></a>
<a id='line_2542'>HEREIN IS TOLD OF THE GREAT LOVE OF DIDO, QUEEN OF CARTHAGE, AND THE</a>
<a id='line_2543'>WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.</a>
<a id='line_2544'></a>
<a id='line_2545'></a>
<a id='line_2546'>    Meanwhile the Queen, long smitten sore with sting of all desire,</a>
<a id='line_2547'>    With very heart's blood feeds the wound and wastes with hidden fire.</a>
<a id='line_2548'>    And still there runneth in her mind the hero's valiancy,</a>
<a id='line_2549'>    And glorious stock; his words, his face, fast in her heart they lie:</a>
<a id='line_2550'>    Nor may she give her body peace amid that restless pain.</a>
<a id='line_2551'></a>
<a id='line_2552'>    But when the next day Phoebus' lamp lit up the lands again,</a>
<a id='line_2553'>    And now Aurora from the heavens had rent the mist apart,</a>
<a id='line_2554'>    Sick-souled her sister she bespeaks, the sharer of her heart:</a>
<a id='line_2555'>    "Sister, O me, this sleepless pain that fears me with unrest!</a>
<a id='line_2556'>    O me, within our house and home this new-come wondrous guest!         10</a>
<a id='line_2557'>    Ah, what a countenance and mien! in arms and heart how strong!</a>
<a id='line_2558'>    Surely to trow him of the Gods it doth no wisdom wrong;</a>
<a id='line_2559'>    For fear it is shows base-born souls. Woe's me! how tossed about</a>
<a id='line_2560'>    By fortune was he! how he showed war's utter wearing out!</a>
<a id='line_2561'>    And, but my heart for ever now were set immovably</a>
<a id='line_2562'>    Never to let me long again the wedding bond to tie,</a>
<a id='line_2563'>    Since love betrayed me first of all with him my darling dead,</a>
<a id='line_2564'>    And were I not all weary-sick of torch and bridal bed,</a>
<a id='line_2565'>    This sin alone of all belike my falling heart might trap;</a>
<a id='line_2566'>    For, Anna, I confess it thee, since poor Sychæus' hap,                20</a>
<a id='line_2567'>    My husband dead, my hearth acold through murderous brother's deed,</a>
<a id='line_2568'>    This one alone hath touched the quick; this one my heart may lead</a>
<a id='line_2569'>    Unto its fall: I feel the signs of fire of long agone.</a>
<a id='line_2570'>    And yet I pray the deeps of earth beneath my feet may yawn,</a>
<a id='line_2571'>    I pray the Father send me down bolt-smitten to the shades,</a>
<a id='line_2572'>    The pallid shades of Erebus, the night that never fades,</a>
<a id='line_2573'>    Before, O Shame, I shame thy face, or loose what thou hast tied!</a>
<a id='line_2574'>    He took away the love from me, who bound me to his side</a>
<a id='line_2575'>    That first of times. Ah, in the tomb let love be with him still!"</a>
<a id='line_2576'></a>
<a id='line_2577'>    The tears arisen as she spake did all her bosom fill.                 30</a>
<a id='line_2578'>    But Anna saith: "Dearer to me than very light of day,</a>
<a id='line_2579'>    Must thou alone and sorrowing wear all thy youth away,</a>
<a id='line_2580'>    Nor see sweet sons, nor know the joys that gentle Venus brings?</a>
<a id='line_2581'>    Deem'st thou dead ash or buried ghosts have heed of such-like things?</a>
<a id='line_2582'>    So be it that thy sickened soul no man to yield hath brought</a>
<a id='line_2583'>    In Libya as in Tyre; let be Iarbas set at nought,</a>
<a id='line_2584'>    And other lords, whom Africa, the rich in battle's bliss,</a>
<a id='line_2585'>    Hath nursed: but now, with love beloved,--must thou be foe to this?</a>
<a id='line_2586'>    Yea, hast thou not within thy mind amidst whose bounds we are?</a>
<a id='line_2587'>    Here the Gætulian cities fierce, a folk unmatched in war,             40</a>
<a id='line_2588'>    And hard Numidia's bitless folk, and Syrtes' guestless sand</a>
<a id='line_2589'>    Lie round thee: there Barcæans wild, the rovers of the land,</a>
<a id='line_2590'>    Desert for thirst: what need to tell of wars new-born in Tyre,</a>
<a id='line_2591'>    And of thy murderous brother's threats?</a>
<a id='line_2592'>    Meseems by very will of Gods, by Juno's loving mind,</a>
<a id='line_2593'>    The Ilian keels run down their course before the following wind.</a>
<a id='line_2594'>    Ah, what a city shalt thou see! how shall the lordship wax</a>
<a id='line_2595'>    With such a spouse! with Teucrian arms our brothers at our backs</a>
<a id='line_2596'>    Unto what glory of great deeds the Punic realm may reach!</a>
<a id='line_2597'>    But thou, go seek the grace of Gods, with sacrifice beseech;          50</a>
<a id='line_2598'>    Then take thy fill of guest-serving; weave web of all delays:</a>
<a id='line_2599'>    The wintry raging of the sea, Orion's watery ways,</a>
<a id='line_2600'>    The way-worn ships, the heavens unmeet for playing seaman's part."</a>
<a id='line_2601'></a>
<a id='line_2602'>    So saying, she blew the flame of love within her kindled heart,</a>
<a id='line_2603'>    And gave her doubtful soul a hope and loosed the girth of shame.</a>
<a id='line_2604'></a>
<a id='line_2605'>    Then straight they fare unto the shrines, by every altar's flame</a>
<a id='line_2606'>    Praying for peace; and hosts they slay, chosen as custom would,</a>
<a id='line_2607'>    To Phoebus, Ceres wise of law, Father Lyæus good,</a>
<a id='line_2608'>    But chiefest unto Juno's might, that wedlock hath in care.</a>
<a id='line_2609'>    There bowl in hand stands Dido forth, most excellently fair,          60</a>
<a id='line_2610'>    And pours between the sleek cow's horns; or to and fro doth pace</a>
<a id='line_2611'>    Before the altars fat with prayer, 'neath very godhead's face,</a>
<a id='line_2612'>    And halloweth in the day with gifts, and, gazing eagerly</a>
<a id='line_2613'>    Amid the host's yet beating heart, for answering rede must try.</a>
<a id='line_2614'>    --Woe's me! the idle mind of priests! what prayer, what shrine avails</a>
<a id='line_2615'>    The wild with love!--and all the while the smooth flame never fails</a>
<a id='line_2616'>    To eat her heart: the silent wound lives on within her breast:</a>
<a id='line_2617'>    Unhappy Dido burneth up, and, wild with all unrest,</a>
<a id='line_2618'>    For ever strays the city through: as arrow-smitten doe,</a>
<a id='line_2619'>    Unwary, whom some herd from far hath drawn upon with bow              70</a>
<a id='line_2620'>    Amid the Cretan woods, and left the swift steel in the sore,</a>
<a id='line_2621'>    Unknowing: far in flight she strays the woods and thickets o'er,</a>
<a id='line_2622'>    'Neath Dictæ's heights; but in her flank still bears the deadly reed.</a>
<a id='line_2623'></a>
<a id='line_2624'>    Now midmost of the city-walls Æneas doth she lead,</a>
<a id='line_2625'>    And shows him the Sidonian wealth, the city's guarded ways;</a>
<a id='line_2626'>    And now she falls to speech, and now amidst a word she stays.</a>
<a id='line_2627'>    Then at the dying of the day the feast she dights again,</a>
<a id='line_2628'>    And, witless, once again will hear the tale of Ilium's pain;</a>
<a id='line_2629'>    And once more hangeth on the lips that tell the tale aloud.</a>
<a id='line_2630'>    But after they were gone their ways, and the dusk moon did shroud     80</a>
<a id='line_2631'>    Her light in turn, and setting stars bade all to sleep away,</a>
<a id='line_2632'>    Lone in the empty house she mourns, broods over where he lay,</a>
<a id='line_2633'>    Hears him and sees him, she apart from him that is apart</a>
<a id='line_2634'>    Or, by his father's image smit, Ascanius to her heart</a>
<a id='line_2635'>    She taketh, if her utter love she may thereby beguile.</a>
<a id='line_2636'>    No longer rise the walls begun, nor play the youth this while</a>
<a id='line_2637'>    In arms, or fashion havens forth, or ramparts of the war:</a>
<a id='line_2638'>    Broken is all that handicraft and mastery; idle are</a>
<a id='line_2639'>    The mighty threatenings of the walls and engines wrought heaven high.</a>
<a id='line_2640'></a>
<a id='line_2641'>    Now when the holy wife of Jove beheld her utterly                     90</a>
<a id='line_2642'>    Held by that plague, whose madness now not e'en her fame might stay,</a>
<a id='line_2643'>    Then unto Venus, Saturn's seed began such words to say:</a>
<a id='line_2644'>    "Most glorious praise ye carry off, meseems, most wealthy spoil,</a>
<a id='line_2645'>    Thou and thy Boy; wondrous the might, and long to tell the toil,</a>
<a id='line_2646'>    Whereas two Gods by dint of craft one woman have o'erthrown.</a>
<a id='line_2647'>    But well I wot, that through your fear of walls I call mine own,</a>
<a id='line_2648'>    In welcome of proud Carthage doors your hearts may never trow.</a>
<a id='line_2649'>    But what shall be the end hereof? where wends our contest now?</a>
<a id='line_2650'>    What if a peace that shall endure, and wedlock surely bound,          99</a>
<a id='line_2651'>    We fashion? That which all thine heart was set on thou hast found.</a>
<a id='line_2652'>    For Dido burns: bone of her bone thy madness is today:</a>
<a id='line_2653'>    So let us rule these folks as one beneath an equal sway:</a>
<a id='line_2654'>    Let the doom be that she shall take a Phrygian man for lord,</a>
<a id='line_2655'>    And to thine hand for dowry due her Tyrian folk award."</a>
<a id='line_2656'></a>
<a id='line_2657'>    But Venus felt that Juno's guile within the word did live,</a>
<a id='line_2658'>    Who lordship due to Italy to Libya fain would give,</a>
<a id='line_2659'>    So thus she answered her again: "Who were so overbold</a>
<a id='line_2660'>    To gainsay this? or who would wish war against thee to hold,</a>
<a id='line_2661'>    If only this may come to pass, and fate the deed may seal?</a>
<a id='line_2662'>    But doubtful drifts my mind of fate, if one same town and weal       110</a>
<a id='line_2663'>    Jove giveth to the Tyrian folk and those from Troy outcast,</a>
<a id='line_2664'>    If he will have those folks to blend and bind the treaty fast</a>
<a id='line_2665'>    Thou art his wife: by prayer mayst thou prove all his purpose weighed.</a>
<a id='line_2666'>    Set forth, I follow."</a>
<a id='line_2667'>                         Juno then took up the word and said:</a>
<a id='line_2668'>    "Yea, that shall be my very work: how that which presseth now</a>
<a id='line_2669'>    May be encompassed, hearken ye, in few words will I show:</a>
<a id='line_2670'>    Æneas and the hapless queen are minded forth to fare</a>
<a id='line_2671'>    For hunting to the thicket-side, when Titan first shall bear</a>
<a id='line_2672'>    Tomorrow's light aloft, and all the glittering world unveil:</a>
<a id='line_2673'>    On them a darkening cloud of rain, blended with drift of hail,       120</a>
<a id='line_2674'>    Will I pour down, while for the hunt the feathered snare-lines shake,</a>
<a id='line_2675'>    And toils about the thicket go: all heaven will I awake</a>
<a id='line_2676'>    With thunder, and their scattered folk the mid-mirk shall enwrap:</a>
<a id='line_2677'>    Then Dido and the Trojan lord on one same cave shall hap;</a>
<a id='line_2678'>    I will be there, and if to me thy heart be stable grown,</a>
<a id='line_2679'>    In wedlock will I join the two and deem her all his own:</a>
<a id='line_2680'>    And there shall be their bridal God."</a>
<a id='line_2681'>                                         Then Venus nought gainsaid,</a>
<a id='line_2682'>    But, nodding yea, she smiled upon the snare before her laid.</a>
<a id='line_2683'></a>
<a id='line_2684'>    Meanwhile Aurora risen up had left the ocean stream,</a>
<a id='line_2685'>    And gateward throng the chosen youth in first of morning's beam,     130</a>
<a id='line_2686'>    And wide-meshed nets, and cordage-toils and broad-steeled spears abound,</a>
<a id='line_2687'>    Massylian riders go their ways with many a scenting hound.</a>
<a id='line_2688'>    The lords of Carthage by the door bide till the tarrying queen</a>
<a id='line_2689'>    Shall leave her chamber: there, with gold and purple well beseen,</a>
<a id='line_2690'>    The mettled courser stands, and champs the bit that bids him bide.</a>
<a id='line_2691'>    At last she cometh forth to them with many a man beside:</a>
<a id='line_2692'>    A cloak of Sidon wrapped her round with pictured border wrought,</a>
<a id='line_2693'>    Her quiver was of fashioned gold, and gold her tresses caught;</a>
<a id='line_2694'>    The gathering of her purple gown a golden buckle had.</a>
<a id='line_2695'></a>
<a id='line_2696'>    Then come the Phrygian fellows forth; comes forth Iulus glad;        140</a>
<a id='line_2697'>    Yea and Æneas' very self is of their fellowship,</a>
<a id='line_2698'>    And joins their band: in goodliness all those did he outstrip:</a>
<a id='line_2699'>    E'en such as when Apollo leaves the wintry Lycian shore,</a>
<a id='line_2700'>    And Xanthus' stream, and Delos sees, his mother's isle once more;</a>
<a id='line_2701'>    And halloweth in the dance anew, while round the altars shout</a>
<a id='line_2702'>    The Cretans and the Dryopes, and painted Scythian rout:</a>
<a id='line_2703'>    He steps it o'er the Cynthus' ridge, and leafy crown to hold</a>
<a id='line_2704'>    His flowing tresses doth he weave, and intertwines the gold,</a>
<a id='line_2705'>    And on his shoulders clang the shafts. Nor duller now passed on</a>
<a id='line_2706'>    Æneas, from his noble face such wondrous glory shone.                150</a>
<a id='line_2707'>    So come they to the mountain-side and pathless deer-fed ground,</a>
<a id='line_2708'>    And lo, from hill-tops driven adown, how swift the wild goats bound</a>
<a id='line_2709'>    Along the ridges: otherwhere across the open lea</a>
<a id='line_2710'>    Run hart and hind, and gathering up their hornèd host to flee,</a>
<a id='line_2711'>    Amid a whirling cloud of dust they leave the mountain-sides.</a>
<a id='line_2712'>    But here the boy Ascanius the midmost valley rides,</a>
<a id='line_2713'>    And glad, swift-horsed, now these he leaves, now those he flees before,</a>
<a id='line_2714'>    And fain were he mid deedless herds to meet a foaming boar,</a>
<a id='line_2715'>    Or see some yellow lion come the mountain-slopes adown.              159</a>
<a id='line_2716'></a>
<a id='line_2717'>    Meanwhile with mighty murmuring sound confused the heavens are grown,</a>
<a id='line_2718'>    And thereupon the drift of rain and hail upon them broke;</a>
<a id='line_2719'>    Therewith the scattered Trojan youth, the Tyrian fellow-folk,</a>
<a id='line_2720'>    The son of Venus' Dardan son, scared through the meadows fly</a>
<a id='line_2721'>    To diverse shelter, while the streams rush from the mountains high.</a>
<a id='line_2722'></a>
<a id='line_2723'>    Then Dido and the Trojan lord meet in the self-same cave;</a>
<a id='line_2724'>    Then Earth, first-born of everything, and wedding Juno gave</a>
<a id='line_2725'>    The token; then the wildfires flashed, and air beheld them wed,</a>
<a id='line_2726'>    And o'er their bridal wailed the nymphs in hill-tops overhead.</a>
<a id='line_2727'></a>
<a id='line_2728'>    That day began the tide of death; that day the evil came;</a>
<a id='line_2729'>    No more she heedeth eyes of men; no more she heedeth fame;           170</a>
<a id='line_2730'>    No more hath Dido any thought a stolen love to win,</a>
<a id='line_2731'>    But calls it wedlock: yea, e'en so she weaveth up the sin.</a>
<a id='line_2732'></a>
<a id='line_2733'>    Straight through the mighty Libyan folks is Rumour on the wing--</a>
<a id='line_2734'>    Rumour, of whom nought swifter is of any evil thing:</a>
<a id='line_2735'>    She gathereth strength by going on, and bloometh shifting oft!</a>
<a id='line_2736'>    A little thing, afraid at first, she springeth soon aloft;</a>
<a id='line_2737'>    Her feet are on the worldly soil, her head the clouds o'erlay.</a>
<a id='line_2738'>    Earth, spurred by anger 'gainst the Gods, begot her as they say,</a>
<a id='line_2739'>    Of Coeus and Enceladus the latest sister-birth.</a>
<a id='line_2740'>    Swift are her wings to cleave the air, swift-foot she treads the earth:  180</a>
<a id='line_2741'>    A monster dread and huge, on whom so many as there lie</a>
<a id='line_2742'>    The feathers, under each there lurks, O strange! a watchful eye;</a>
<a id='line_2743'>    And there wag tongues, and babble mouths, and hearkening ears upstand</a>
<a id='line_2744'>    As many: all a-dusk by night she flies 'twixt sky and land</a>
<a id='line_2745'>    Loud clattering, never shutting eye in rest of slumber sweet.</a>
<a id='line_2746'>    By day she keepeth watch high-set on houses of the street,</a>
<a id='line_2747'>    Or on the towers aloft she sits for mighty cities' fear!</a>
<a id='line_2748'>    And lies and ill she loves no less than sooth which she must bear.</a>
<a id='line_2749'></a>
<a id='line_2750'>    She now, rejoicing, filled the folk with babble many-voiced,</a>
<a id='line_2751'>    And matters true and false alike sang forth as she rejoiced:         190</a>
<a id='line_2752'>    How here was come Æneas now, from Trojan blood sprung forth,</a>
<a id='line_2753'>    Whom beauteous Dido deemed indeed a man to mate her worth:</a>
<a id='line_2754'>    How winter-long betwixt them there the sweets of sloth they nursed,</a>
<a id='line_2755'>    Unmindful of their kingdoms' weal, by ill desire accursed.</a>
<a id='line_2756'>    This in the mouth of every man the loathly Goddess lays,</a>
<a id='line_2757'>    And thence to King Iarbas straight she wendeth on her ways,</a>
<a id='line_2758'>    To set his mind on fire with words, and high his wrath to lead.</a>
<a id='line_2759'></a>
<a id='line_2760'>    He, sprung from Garamantian nymph and very Ammon's seed,</a>
<a id='line_2761'>    An hundred mighty fanes to Jove, an hundred altars fair,</a>
<a id='line_2762'>    Had builded in his wide domain, and set the watch-fire there,        200</a>
<a id='line_2763'>    The everlasting guard of God: there fat the soil was grown</a>
<a id='line_2764'>    With blood of beasts; the threshold bloomed with garlands diverse blown.</a>
<a id='line_2765'>    He, saith the tale, all mad at heart, and fired with bitter fame,</a>
<a id='line_2766'>    Amidmost of the might of God before the altars came,</a>
<a id='line_2767'>    And prayed a many things to Jove with suppliant hands outspread:</a>
<a id='line_2768'></a>

<a id='line_2802'></a>
<a id='line_2803'>    He spake: his mighty father's will straight did the God prepare</a>

<a id='line_2818'>    And all his gathered body thence sent headlong toward the waves;</a>
<a id='line_2819'>    Then like a bird the shores about, about the fishy caves,</a>
<a id='line_2820'>    Skims low adown upon the wing the sea-plain's face anigh,</a>
<a id='line_2821'>    Not otherwise 'twixt heaven and earth Cyllene's God did fly;</a>
<a id='line_2822'>    And now, his mother's father great a long way left behind,</a>
<a id='line_2823'>    Unto the sandy Libya's shore he clave the driving wind.</a>
<a id='line_2824'>    But when the cot-built place of earth he felt beneath his feet,</a>
<a id='line_2825'>    He saw Æneas founding towers and raising houses meet:                260</a>
<a id='line_2826'>    Starred was the sword about him girt with yellow jasper stone,</a>
<a id='line_2827'>    The cloak that from his shoulders streamed with Tyrian purple shone:</a>
<a id='line_2828'>    Fair things that wealthy Dido's hand had given him for a gift,</a>
<a id='line_2829'>    Who with the gleam of thready gold the purple web did shift.</a>
<a id='line_2830'></a>
<a id='line_2831'>    Then brake the God on him: "Forsooth, tall Carthage wilt thou found,</a>
<a id='line_2832'>    O lover, and a city fair raise up from out the ground?</a>
<a id='line_2833'>    Woe's me! thy lordship and thy deeds hast thou forgotten quite?</a>
<a id='line_2834'>    The very ruler of the Gods down from Olympus bright</a>
<a id='line_2835'>    Hath sent me, he whose majesty the earth and heavens obey;</a>
<a id='line_2836'>    This was the word he bade me bear adown the windy way.               270</a>
<a id='line_2837'>    What dost thou? hoping for what hope in Libya dost thou wear</a>
<a id='line_2838'>    Thy days? if glorious fated things thine own soul may not stir,</a>
<a id='line_2839'>    And heart thou lackest for thy fame the coming toil to wed,</a>
<a id='line_2840'>    Think on Ascanius' dawn of days and hope inherited,</a>
<a id='line_2841'>    To whom is due the Italian realm and all the world of Rome!"</a>
<a id='line_2842'></a>
<a id='line_2843'>    But when from out Cyllenius' mouth such word as this had come,</a>
<a id='line_2844'>    Amidst his speech he left the sight of men that die from day,</a>
<a id='line_2845'>    And mid thin air from eyes of folk he faded far away.</a>
<a id='line_2846'>    But sore the sight Æneas feared, and wit from out him drave;</a>
<a id='line_2847'>    His hair stood up, amidst his jaws the voice within him clave.       280</a>
<a id='line_2848'>    Bewildered by that warning word, and by that God's command,</a>
<a id='line_2849'>    He yearneth to depart and flee, and leave the lovely land.</a>
<a id='line_2850'>    Ah, what to do? and with what word may he be bold to win</a>
<a id='line_2851'>    Peace of the Queen all mad with love? what wise shall he begin?</a>
<a id='line_2852'>    Hither and thither now he sends his mind all eager-swift,</a>
<a id='line_2853'>    And bears it diversely away and runs o'er every shift:</a>
<a id='line_2854'>    At last, as many things he weighed, this seemed the better rede.</a>
<a id='line_2855'>    Mnestheus, Sergestus, straight he calls, Sergestus stout at need,</a>
<a id='line_2856'>    And bids them dight ship silently and bring their folk to shore,</a>
<a id='line_2857'>    And dight their gear, and cause thereof with lying cover o'er;       290</a>
<a id='line_2858'>    While he himself, since of all this kind Dido knoweth nought,</a>
<a id='line_2859'>    Nor of the ending of such love may ever have a thought,</a>
<a id='line_2860'>    Will seek to draw anigh the Queen, seek time wherein the word</a>
<a id='line_2861'>    May softliest be said to her, the matter lightliest stirred.</a>
<a id='line_2862'>    So all they glad his bidding do, and get them to the work.</a>
<a id='line_2863'></a>
<a id='line_2864'>    But who may hoodwink loving eyes? She felt the treason lurk</a>
<a id='line_2865'>    About her life, and from the first saw all that was to be;</a>
<a id='line_2866'>    Fearing indeed where no fear was. That Rumour wickedly</a>
<a id='line_2867'>    Told her wild soul of ship-host armed and ready to set out;</a>
<a id='line_2868'>    The heart died in her; all aflame she raves the town about,          300</a>
<a id='line_2869'>    E'en as a Thyad, who, soul-smit by holy turmoil, hears</a>
<a id='line_2870'>    The voice of Bacchus on the day that crowns the triple years,</a>
<a id='line_2871'>    And mirk Cithæron through the night hath called her clamorous.</a>
<a id='line_2872'></a>
<a id='line_2873'>    Unto Æneas at the last herself she speaketh thus:</a>
<a id='line_2874'>    "O thou forsworn! and hast thou hoped with lies to cover o'er</a>
<a id='line_2875'>    Such wickedness, and silently to get thee from my shore?</a>
<a id='line_2876'>    Our love, it hath not held thee back? nor right hand given in faith</a>
<a id='line_2877'>    Awhile agone? nor Dido doomed to die a bitter death?</a>
<a id='line_2878'>    Yea, e'en beneath the winter heavens thy fleet thou gatherest</a>
<a id='line_2879'>    In haste to fare across the main amid the north's unrest             310</a>
<a id='line_2880'>    O cruel! What if land unknown and stranger field and fold</a>
<a id='line_2881'>    Thou sought'st not; if the ancient Troy stood as in days of old;</a>
<a id='line_2882'>    Wouldst thou not still be seeking Troy across the wavy brine?</a>
<a id='line_2883'>    --Yea, me thou fleest. O by these tears, by that right hand of thine,</a>
<a id='line_2884'>    Since I myself have left myself unhappy nought but this,</a>
<a id='line_2885'>    And by our bridal of that day and early wedding bliss,</a>
<a id='line_2886'>    If ever I were worthy thanks, if sweet in aught I were,</a>
<a id='line_2887'>    Pity a falling house! If yet be left a space for prayer,</a>
<a id='line_2888'>    O then I pray thee put away this mind of evil things!</a>
<a id='line_2889'>    Because of thee the Libyan folks, and those Numidian kings,          320</a>
<a id='line_2890'>    Hate me, and Tyrians are my foes: yea, and because of thee</a>
<a id='line_2891'>    My shame is gone, and that which was my heavenward road to be.</a>
<a id='line_2892'>    My early glory.--Guest, to whom leav'st thou thy dying friend?</a>
<a id='line_2893'>    Since of my husband nought but this is left me in the end.</a>
<a id='line_2894'>    Why bide I till Pygmalion comes to lay my walls alow,</a>
<a id='line_2895'>    Till taken by Getulian kings, Iarbas' slave I go?</a>

<a id='line_2897'>    If yet Æneas in mine house might play a little lad,</a>
<a id='line_2898'>    E'en but to bring aback the face of that beloved one,</a>
<a id='line_2899'>    Then were I never vanquished quite, nor utterly undone."             330</a>
<a id='line_2900'></a>
<a id='line_2901'>    She spake: he, warned by Jove's command, his eyes still steadfast held,</a>
<a id='line_2902'>    And, striving, thrust his sorrow back, howso his heart-strings swelled:</a>
<a id='line_2903'>    At last he answered shortly thus:</a>
<a id='line_2904'>                                     "O Queen, though words may fail</a>
<a id='line_2905'>    To tell thy lovingkindness, ne'er my heart belies the tale:</a>
<a id='line_2906'>    Still shall it be a joy to think of sweet Elissa's days</a>
<a id='line_2907'>    While of myself I yet may think, while breath my body sways.</a>
<a id='line_2908'>    Few words about the deed in hand: ne'er in my mind it came</a>
<a id='line_2909'>    As flees a thief to flee from thee; never the bridal flame</a>
<a id='line_2910'>    Did I hold forth, or plight my troth such matters to fulfil.</a>
<a id='line_2911'>    If fate would let me lead a life according to my will,               340</a>
<a id='line_2912'>    Might I such wise as pleaseth me my troubles lay to rest,</a>
<a id='line_2913'>    By Troy-town surely would I bide among the ashes blest</a>
<a id='line_2914'>    Of my beloved, and Priam's house once more aloft should stand;</a>
<a id='line_2915'>    New Pergamus for vanquished men should rise beneath my hand.</a>
<a id='line_2916'>    But now Grynean Phoebus bids toward Italy the great</a>
<a id='line_2917'>    To reach my hand; to Italy biddeth the Lycian fate:</a>
<a id='line_2918'>    There is my love, there is my land. If Carthage braveries</a>

<a id='line_2920'>    Why wilt thou grudge the Teucrian men Ausonian dwelling-place?</a>
<a id='line_2921'>    If we too seek the outland realm, for us too be there grace!         350</a>
<a id='line_2922'>    Father Anchises, whensoever night covereth up the earth</a>
<a id='line_2923'>    With dewy dark, and whensoe'er the bright stars come to birth,</a>
<a id='line_2924'>    His troubled image midst of sleep brings warning word and fear.</a>
<a id='line_2925'>    Ascanius weigheth on my heart with wrong of head so dear,</a>
<a id='line_2926'>    Whom I beguile of fateful fields and realm of Italy.</a>
<a id='line_2927'>    Yea, even now God's messenger sent from the Jove on high,</a>
<a id='line_2928'>    (Bear witness either head of us!) bore doom of God adown</a>
<a id='line_2929'>    The eager wind: I saw the God enter the fair-walled town</a>
<a id='line_2930'>    In simple light: I drank his voice, yea with these ears of mine.</a>
<a id='line_2931'>    Cease then to burn up with thy wail my burdened heart and thine!     360</a>
<a id='line_2932'>    Perforce I follow Italy."</a>
<a id='line_2933'></a>
<a id='line_2934'>    But now this long while, as he spake, athwart and wild she gazed,</a>
<a id='line_2935'>    And here and there her eyeballs rolled, and strayed with silent look</a>
<a id='line_2936'>    His body o'er; and at the last with heart of fire outbroke:</a>
<a id='line_2937'>    "Traitor! no Goddess brought thee forth, nor Dardanus was first</a>
<a id='line_2938'>    Of thine ill race; but Caucasus on spiky crags accurst</a>

<a id='line_2940'>    Why hide it now? why hold me back lest greater evil be?</a>
<a id='line_2941'>    For did he sigh the while I wept? his eyes--what were they moved?</a>
<a id='line_2942'>    Hath he been vanquished unto tears, or pitied her that loved?        370</a>
<a id='line_2943'>    --Ah, is aught better now than aught, when Juno utter great,</a>
<a id='line_2944'>    Yea and the Father on all this with evil eyen wait?</a>
<a id='line_2945'>    All faith is gone! I took him in a stranded outcast, bare:</a>
<a id='line_2946'>    Yea in my very throne and land, ah fool! I gave him share.</a>
<a id='line_2947'>    His missing fleet I brought aback; from death I brought his friends.</a>
<a id='line_2948'>    --Woe! how the furies burn me up!--Now seer Apollo sends,</a>
<a id='line_2949'>    Now bidding send the Lycian lots; now sendeth Jove on high</a>

<a id='line_2951'>    Such is the toil of Gods aloft; such are the cares that rack</a>
<a id='line_2952'>    Their souls serene.--I hold thee not, nor cast thy words aback.      380</a>
<a id='line_2953'>    Go down the wind to Italy! seek lordship o'er the sea!</a>
<a id='line_2954'>    Only I hope amid the rocks, if any God there be,</a>

<a id='line_2956'>    Full oft: and I, though gone away, will follow with black flame;</a>
<a id='line_2957'>    And when cold death from out my limbs my soul hath won away,</a>
<a id='line_2958'>    I will be with thee everywhere; O wretch, and thou shalt pay.</a>
<a id='line_2959'>    Ah, I shall hear; the tale of all shall reach me midst the dead."</a>
<a id='line_2960'></a>
<a id='line_2961'>    Therewith she brake her speech athwart, and sick at heart she fled</a>
<a id='line_2962'>    The outer air, and turned away, and gat her from his eyes;</a>
<a id='line_2963'>    Leaving him dallying with his fear, and turning many wise            390</a>
<a id='line_2964'>    The words to say. Her serving-maids the fainting body weak,</a>
<a id='line_2965'>    Bear back unto the marble room and on the pillows streak.</a>

<a id='line_2967'>    But god-fearing Æneas now, however fain he were</a>
<a id='line_2968'>    To soothe her grief and with soft speech assuage her weary care,</a>
<a id='line_2969'>    Much groaning, and the heart of him shaken with loving pain.</a>
<a id='line_2970'>    Yet went about the God's command and reached his ships again.</a>
<a id='line_2971'>    Then fall the Teucrians on indeed, and over all the shore</a>
<a id='line_2972'>    Roll the tall ships; the pitchy keel swims in the sea once more:</a>
<a id='line_2973'>    They bear the oars still leaf-bearing: they bring the might of wood,</a>
<a id='line_2974'>    Unwrought, so fain of flight they are,                               400</a>
<a id='line_2975'>    Lo now their flitting! how they run from all the town in haste!</a>
<a id='line_2976'>    E'en as the ants, the winter-wise, are gathered whiles to waste</a>
<a id='line_2977'>    A heap of corn, and toil that same beneath their roof to lay,</a>

<a id='line_2979'>    Over the grass in narrow line: some strive with shoulder-might</a>
<a id='line_2980'>    And push along a grain o'ergreat, some drive the line aright,</a>

<a id='line_2983'>    Ah Dido, when thou sawest all what heart in thee abode!</a>

<a id='line_3014'>    So prayed she: such unhappy words of weeping Anna bears,</a>
<a id='line_3015'>    And bears again and o'er again: but him no weeping stirs,</a>
<a id='line_3016'>    Nor any voice he hearkeneth now may turn him from his road:</a>
<a id='line_3017'>    God shut the hero's steadfast ears; fate in the way abode.           440</a>

<a id='line_3024'>    E'en so by ceaseless drift of words the hero every wise</a>
<a id='line_3025'>    Is battered, and the heavy care deep in his bosom lies;</a>
<a id='line_3026'>    Steadfast the will abides in him; the tears fall down for nought.</a>

<a id='line_3032'>    The wine poured forth turned into blood all loathly as it fell.</a>
<a id='line_3033'>    Which sight to none, not e'en unto her sister, would she tell.</a>
<a id='line_3034'>    Moreover, to her first-wed lord there stood amidst the house</a>
<a id='line_3035'>    A marble shrine, the which she loved with worship marvellous,</a>
<a id='line_3036'>    And bound it was with snowy wool and leafage of delight;             459</a>
<a id='line_3037'>    Thence heard she, when the earth was held in mirky hand of night,</a>
<a id='line_3038'>    Strange sounds come forth, and words as if her husband called his own.</a>
<a id='line_3039'>    And o'er and o'er his funeral song the screech-owl wailed alone,</a>
<a id='line_3040'>    And long his lamentable tale from high aloft was rolled.</a>
<a id='line_3041'>    And many a saying furthermore of god-loved seers of old</a>
<a id='line_3042'>    Fears her with dreadful memory: all wild amid her dreams</a>
<a id='line_3043'>    Cruel Æneas drives her on, and evermore she seems</a>
<a id='line_3044'>    Left all alone; and evermore a road that never ends,</a>
<a id='line_3045'>    Mateless, and seeking through the waste her Tyrian folk, she wends.</a>
<a id='line_3046'>    As raving Pentheus saw the rout of that Well-willing Folk,</a>
<a id='line_3047'>    When twofold sun and twofold Thebes upon his eyes outbroke:          470</a>
<a id='line_3048'>    Or like as Agamemnon's son is driven across the stage,</a>
<a id='line_3049'>    Fleeing his mother's fiery hand that bears the serpent's rage,</a>
<a id='line_3050'>    While there the avenging Dreadful Ones upon the threshold sit.</a>
<a id='line_3051'></a>
<a id='line_3052'>    But when she gave the horror birth, and, grief-worn, cherished it,</a>
<a id='line_3053'>    And doomed her death, then with herself she planned its time and guise,</a>
<a id='line_3054'>    And to her sister sorrowing sore spake word in such a wise,</a>
<a id='line_3055'>    Covering her end with cheerful face and calm and hopeful brow:</a>
<a id='line_3056'>    "Kinswoman, I have found a way, (joy with thy sister now!)</a>

<a id='line_3065'>    She by enchantment takes in hand to loose what hearts she will,</a>
<a id='line_3066'>    But other ones at need will she with heavy sorrows fill;</a>
<a id='line_3067'>    And she hath craft to turn the stars and back the waters beat,</a>
<a id='line_3068'>    Call up the ghosts that fare by night, make earth beneath thy feet   490</a>

<a id='line_3077'></a>

<a id='line_3092'>    Water she scattered, would-be wave of dark Avernus' brook;</a>

<a id='line_3112'>    Her sorrows grow, and love again swells up with all unrest,</a>
<a id='line_3113'>    And ever midst her troubled wrath rolls on a mighty tide;</a>

<a id='line_3139'>    When lo! amid the dreams of sleep that shape of God come back,</a>
<a id='line_3140'>    Seemed once again to warn him thus: nor yet the face did lack</a>

<a id='line_3142'>    And loveliness of youthful limbs and length of yellow hair:          559</a>
<a id='line_3143'>    "O Goddess-born, and canst thou sleep through such a tide as this?</a>
<a id='line_3144'>    And seest thou not how round about the peril gathered is?</a>

<a id='line_3149'>    Thou shalt behold the sea beat up with oar-blade, and the brand</a>
<a id='line_3150'>    Gleam dire against thee, and one flame shall run adown the strand,</a>

<a id='line_3153'></a>
<a id='line_3154'>    So saying, amid the mirk of night he mingled and was lost.           570</a>
<a id='line_3155'>    And therewithal Æneas, feared by sudden-flitting ghost,</a>
<a id='line_3156'>    Snatching his body forth from sleep, stirs up his folk at need:</a>
<a id='line_3157'>    "Wake ye, and hurry now, O men! get to the thwarts with speed,</a>

<a id='line_3164'>                       And from the sheath his lightning sword flew out</a>
<a id='line_3165'>    E'en as he spake: with naked blade he smote the hawser through,      580</a>

<a id='line_3167'>    The shore is left, with crowd of keels the sight of sea is dim;</a>

<a id='line_3229'>    She spake; with hurrying of eld the nurse her footsteps sped.</a>
<a id='line_3230'>    But Dido, trembling, wild at heart with her most dread intent,</a>

<a id='line_3257'>    The lofty halls, and Rumour runs mad through the smitten town.</a>
<a id='line_3258'>    The houses sound with women's wails and lamentable groan;</a>
<a id='line_3259'>    The mighty clamour of their grief rings through the upper skies.</a>
<a id='line_3260'>    'Twas e'en as if all Carthage fell mid flood of enemies,</a>
<a id='line_3261'>    Or mighty Tyre of ancient days,--as if the wildfire ran              670</a>
<a id='line_3262'>    Rolling about the roof of God and dwelling-place of man.</a>
<a id='line_3263'></a>
<a id='line_3264'>    Half dead her sister heard, and rushed distraught and trembling there,</a>
<a id='line_3265'>    With nail and fist befouling all her face and bosom fair:</a>
<a id='line_3266'>    She thrust amidst them, and by name called on the dying Queen:</a>
<a id='line_3267'>    "O was it this my sister, then! guile in thy word hath been!</a>
<a id='line_3268'>    And this was what the bale, the fire, the altars wrought for me!</a>
<a id='line_3269'>    Where shall I turn so left alone? Ah, scorned was I to be</a>
<a id='line_3270'>    For death-fellow! thou shouldst have called me too thy way to wend.</a>
<a id='line_3271'>    One sword-pang should have been for both, one hour to make an end.</a>
<a id='line_3272'>    Built I with hands, on Father-Gods with crying did I cry             680</a>
<a id='line_3273'>    To be away, a cruel heart, from thee laid down to die?</a>
<a id='line_3274'>    O sister, me and thee, thy folk, the fathers of the land,</a>
<a id='line_3275'>    Thy city hast thou slain----O give, give water to my hand,</a>
<a id='line_3276'>    And let me wash the wound, and if some last breath linger there,</a>
<a id='line_3277'>    Let my mouth catch it!"</a>
<a id='line_3278'>                           Saying so she reached the topmost stair,</a>
<a id='line_3279'>    And to her breast the dying one she fondled, groaning sore,</a>
<a id='line_3280'>    And with her raiment strove to staunch the black and flowing gore.</a>
<a id='line_3281'>    Then Dido strove her heavy lids to lift, but back again</a>
<a id='line_3282'>    They sank, and deep within her breast whispered the deadly bane:</a>
<a id='line_3283'>    Three times on elbow struggling up a little did she rise,            690</a>
<a id='line_3284'>    And thrice fell back upon the bed, and sought with wandering eyes</a>
<a id='line_3285'>    The light of heaven aloft, and moaned when it was found at last.</a>
<a id='line_3286'></a>
<a id='line_3287'>    Then on her long-drawn agony did Juno pity cast,</a>
<a id='line_3288'>    Her hard departing; Iris then she sent from heaven on high,</a>
<a id='line_3289'>    And bade her from the knitted limbs the struggling soul untie.</a>
<a id='line_3290'>    For since by fate she perished not, nor waited death-doom given,</a>
<a id='line_3291'>    But hapless died before her day by sudden fury driven,</a>
<a id='line_3292'>    Not yet the tress of yellow hair had Proserpine off-shred,</a>
<a id='line_3293'>    Nor unto Stygian Orcus yet had doomed her wandering head.</a>
<a id='line_3294'>    So Iris ran adown the sky on wings of saffron dew,                   700</a>
<a id='line_3295'>    And colours shifting thousandfold against the sun she drew,</a>
<a id='line_3296'>    And overhead she hung: "So bid, from off thee this I bear,</a>
<a id='line_3297'>    Hallowed to Dis, and charge thee now from out thy body fare."</a>
<a id='line_3298'></a>
<a id='line_3299'>    She spake and sheared the tress away; then failed the life-heat spent</a>
<a id='line_3300'>    And forth away upon the wind the spirit of her went.</a>

<a id='line_3309'>ÆNEAS MAKING FOR ITALY IS STAYED BY CONTRARY WINDS, WHEREFORE HE SAILETH</a>
<a id='line_3310'>TO SICILY, AND, COMING TO THE TOMB OF HIS FATHER ANCHISES, HOLDETH</a>
<a id='line_3311'>SOLEMN GAMES THEREAT, AND IN THE END GOETH HIS WAY TO ITALY AGAIN.</a>
<a id='line_3312'></a>
<a id='line_3313'></a>
<a id='line_3314'>    Meanwhile Æneas with his ships the mid-sea way did hold</a>
<a id='line_3315'>    Steadfast, and cut the dusky waves before the north wind rolled,</a>
<a id='line_3316'>    Still looking back upon the walls now litten by the flame</a>
<a id='line_3317'>    Of hapless Dido: though indeed whence so great burning came</a>
<a id='line_3318'>    They knew not; but the thought of grief that comes of love defiled</a>
<a id='line_3319'>    How great it is, what deed may come of woman waxen wild,</a>
<a id='line_3320'>    Through woeful boding of the sooth the Teucrians' bosoms bore.</a>
<a id='line_3321'></a>
<a id='line_3322'>    But when the ships the main sea held, nor had they any more</a>
<a id='line_3323'>    The land in sight, but sea around and sky around was spread,</a>
<a id='line_3324'>    A coal-blue cloud drew up to them, that hanging overhead              10</a>
<a id='line_3325'>    Bore night and storm: feared 'neath the dark the waters trembling lie.</a>
<a id='line_3326'>    Then called the helmsman Palinure from lofty deck on high:</a>
<a id='line_3327'>    "Ah, wherefore doth such cloud of storm gird all the heavens about?</a>
<a id='line_3328'>    What will ye, Father Neptune, now?"</a>
<a id='line_3329'>                                        Therewith he crieth out</a>
<a id='line_3330'>    To gather all the tackling in, and hard on oars to lay,</a>
<a id='line_3331'>    And slopeth sail across the wind; and so such word doth say:</a>
<a id='line_3332'>    "Great-souled Æneas, e'en if Jove my borrow now should be,</a>
<a id='line_3333'>    'Neath such a sky I might not hope to make our Italy:</a>
<a id='line_3334'>    The changed winds roar athwart our course, and from the west grown black</a>
<a id='line_3335'>    They rise; while o'er the face of heaven gathers the cloudy rack.     20</a>
<a id='line_3336'>    Nor have we might to draw a-head, nor e'en to hold our own.</a>
<a id='line_3337'>    Wherefore since Fortune hath prevailed, by way that she hath shown,</a>
<a id='line_3338'>    Whither she calleth, let us turn: methinks the way but short</a>
<a id='line_3339'>    To brother-land of Eryx leal and safe Sicanian port,</a>
<a id='line_3340'>    If I may read the stars aright that erst I bare in mind."</a>
<a id='line_3341'></a>
<a id='line_3342'>    Quoth good Æneas: "Now for long that suchwise would the wind</a>
<a id='line_3343'>    I saw, and how thou heldest head against it all in vain:</a>
<a id='line_3344'>    Shift sail and go about; what land may sweeter be to gain,</a>
<a id='line_3345'>    Or whither would I liefer turn my keels from beat of sea,</a>
<a id='line_3346'>    Than that which yet the Dardan lord Acestes holds for me,             30</a>
<a id='line_3347'>    That holds my very father's bones, Anchises, in its breast?"</a>
<a id='line_3348'></a>
<a id='line_3349'>    They seek the haven therewithal, and fair and happy west</a>
<a id='line_3350'>    Swelleth the sails: o'er whirl of waves full speedily they wend,</a>
<a id='line_3351'>    And glad to that familiar sand they turn them in the end:</a>
<a id='line_3352'>    But there Acestes meeteth them, who from a mountain high</a>
<a id='line_3353'>    All wondering had seen afar the friendly ships draw nigh.</a>
<a id='line_3354'>    With darts he bristled, and was clad in fell of Libyan bear.</a>
<a id='line_3355'>    Him erst unto Crimisus' flood a Trojan mother fair</a>
<a id='line_3356'>    Brought forth: and now, forgetting nought his mother's folk of old,</a>
<a id='line_3357'>    He welcomes them come back again with wealth of field and fold,       40</a>
<a id='line_3358'>    And solaces the weary men with plenteous friendly cheer.</a>
<a id='line_3359'></a>
<a id='line_3360'>    But when the stars in first of dawn fled from the morrow clear,</a>
<a id='line_3361'>    Æneas called upon the shore assembly of his folk,</a>
<a id='line_3362'>    And standing high aloft on mound such words to tell he spoke:</a>
<a id='line_3363'>    "O mighty Dardan men, O folk from blood of Godhead born,</a>
<a id='line_3364'>    The yearly round is all fulfilled, with lapse of months outworn,</a>
<a id='line_3365'>    Since when my godlike father's husk and bones of him we laid</a>
<a id='line_3366'>    Amid the mould, and heavy sad the hallowed altars made:</a>
<a id='line_3367'>    And now meseems the day is here, for evermore to me</a>
<a id='line_3368'>    A bitter day, a worshipped day.--So God would have it be!             50</a>
<a id='line_3369'>    Yea should it find me outcast man on great Getulia's sand,</a>
<a id='line_3370'>    Or take me in the Argive sea, or mid Mycenæ's land,</a>
<a id='line_3371'>    Yet yearly vows, and pomps that come in due recurring while,</a>
<a id='line_3372'>    Still should I pay, and gifts most meet upon the altar pile.</a>
<a id='line_3373'>    Now to my father's bones, indeed, and ashes are we brought</a>
<a id='line_3374'>    By chance; yet not, meseems, without the Godhead's will and thought</a>
<a id='line_3375'>    Are we come here, to lie in peace within a friendly bay.</a>
<a id='line_3376'>    So come, and let all worship here the glory of the day;</a>
<a id='line_3377'>    Pray we the winds, that year by year this worship may be done</a>
<a id='line_3378'>    In temples dedicate to him within my city won.                        60</a>
<a id='line_3379'>    Troy-born Acestes giveth you two head of hornèd beasts</a>
<a id='line_3380'>    For every ship; so see ye bid the House-gods to your feasts,</a>
<a id='line_3381'>    Both them of Troy and them our host Acestes loveth here.</a>
<a id='line_3382'>    Moreover, if the ninth dawn hence Aurora shall uprear</a>
<a id='line_3383'>    For health of men, and with her rays earth's coverlit shall lift,</a>
<a id='line_3384'>    For Teucrians will I fast set forth the race for galleys swift:</a>
<a id='line_3385'>    Then whosoe'er is fleet of foot, or bold of might and main,</a>
<a id='line_3386'>    Or with the dart or eager shaft a better prize may gain,</a>
<a id='line_3387'>    Or whoso hath the heart to play in fight-glove of raw hide,</a>
<a id='line_3388'>    Let all be there, and victory's palm and guerdon due abide.           70</a>
<a id='line_3389'>    Clean be all mouths! and gird with leaves the temple of the head."</a>
<a id='line_3390'></a>
<a id='line_3391'>    His mother's bush he did on brow e'en as the word he said;</a>
<a id='line_3392'>    The like did Helymus, the like Acestes ripe of eld,</a>
<a id='line_3393'>    The like the boy Ascanius, yea, and all that manner held.</a>
<a id='line_3394'>    Then from that council to the tomb that duke of men did pass;</a>
<a id='line_3395'>    Mid many thousands, he the heart of all that concourse was.</a>
<a id='line_3396'>    There, worshipping, on earth he pours in such wise as was good</a>
<a id='line_3397'>    Two cups of mere wine, two of milk, and two of holy blood,</a>
<a id='line_3398'>    And scatters purple flowers around; and then such words he said:</a>
<a id='line_3399'>    "Hail, holy father! hail once more! hail, ashes visited               80</a>
<a id='line_3400'>    Once more for nought! hail, father-shade and spirit sweet in vain!</a>
<a id='line_3401'>    Forbid with me that Italy to seek, that fated plain,</a>
<a id='line_3402'>    With me Ausonian Tiber-flood, whereso it be, to seek."</a>
<a id='line_3403'></a>
<a id='line_3404'>    He spake: but from the lowest mound a mighty serpent sleek</a>
<a id='line_3405'>    Drew seven great circles o'er the earth, and glided sevenfold,</a>
<a id='line_3406'>    Passing in peace the tomb around, and o'er the altars rolled:</a>
<a id='line_3407'>    Blue stripèd was the back of him, and all his scales did glow</a>
<a id='line_3408'>    With glitter of fine flecks of gold; e'en as the cloud-hung bow</a>
<a id='line_3409'>    A thousand shifting colours fair back from the sun he cast.</a>
<a id='line_3410'>    Æneas wondered at the sight; but on the serpent passed,               90</a>
<a id='line_3411'>    And 'twixt the bowls and smoothèd cups his long array he wound,</a>
<a id='line_3412'>    Tasting the hallowed things; and so he gat him underground</a>
<a id='line_3413'>    Beneath the tomb again, and left the altars pastured o'er.</a>
<a id='line_3414'></a>
<a id='line_3415'>    Heartened hereby, his father's soul Æneas worshipped more,</a>
<a id='line_3416'>    And, doubtful, deemeth it to be Anchises' guardian ghost</a>
<a id='line_3417'>    Or godhead of the place: so there he slayeth double host,</a>
<a id='line_3418'>    As custom would; two black-backed steers, and e'en as many swine,</a>
<a id='line_3419'>    And calleth on his father's soul with pouring of the wine,</a>
<a id='line_3420'>    On great Anchises' glorious ghost from Acheron set free.</a>
<a id='line_3421'>    From out their plenty therewithal his fellows joyfully               100</a>
<a id='line_3422'>    Give gifts, and load the altar-stead, and smite the steers adown.</a>
<a id='line_3423'>    While others serve the seething brass, and o'er the herbage strown</a>
<a id='line_3424'>    Set coaly morsels 'neath the spit, and roast the inner meat.</a>
<a id='line_3425'></a>
<a id='line_3426'>    And now the looked-for day was come with simple light and sweet,</a>
<a id='line_3427'>    And Phaeton's horses shining bright the ninth dawn in did bear.</a>
<a id='line_3428'>    Fame and the name Acestes had the neighbouring people stir</a>
<a id='line_3429'>    To fill the shore with joyful throng, Æneas' folk to see:</a>
<a id='line_3430'>    But some were dight amid the games their strife-fellows to be.</a>
<a id='line_3431'>    There first before the eyes of men the gifts to come they lay</a>
<a id='line_3432'>    Amid the course; as hallowed bowls, and garlands of green bay,       110</a>
<a id='line_3433'>    And palms, the prize of victory, weapons, and raiment rolled</a>
<a id='line_3434'>    In purple, and a talent's weight of silver and of gold;</a>
<a id='line_3435'>    Then blast of horn from midst the mound the great games halloweth in:</a>
<a id='line_3436'>    Four ships from all the fleet picked out will first the race begin</a>
<a id='line_3437'>    With heavy oars; well matched are they for speed and rowers' tale:</a>
<a id='line_3438'>    Hereof did Mnestheus' eager oars drive on the speedy Whale,</a>
<a id='line_3439'>    Mnestheus to be of Italy, whence cometh Memmius' name.</a>
<a id='line_3440'>    The huge Chimæra's mountain mass was Gyas set to tame;</a>
<a id='line_3441'>    There on that city of a ship threesome its rowing plies</a>
<a id='line_3442'>    The Dardan youth; the banks of oars in threefold order rise.         120</a>
<a id='line_3443'>    Sergestus next, the name whereof the Sergian house yet bears,</a>
<a id='line_3444'>    Is ferried by the Centaur great: last in blue Scylla steers</a>
<a id='line_3445'>    Cloanthus, whence the name of thee, Cluentius, man of Rome.</a>
<a id='line_3446'></a>
<a id='line_3447'>    Far mid the sea a rock there is, facing the shore-line's foam,</a>
<a id='line_3448'>    Which, beat by overtoppling waves, is drowned and hidden oft,</a>
<a id='line_3449'>    What time the stormy North-west hides the stars in heaven aloft:</a>
<a id='line_3450'>    But otherwhiles it lies in peace when nought the sea doth move,</a>
<a id='line_3451'>    And riseth up a meadow fair that sunning sea-gulls love.</a>
<a id='line_3452'>    There a green goal Æneas raised, dight of a leafy oak,</a>
<a id='line_3453'>    To be a sign of turning back to that sea-faring folk,                130</a>
<a id='line_3454'>    That fetching compass round the same their long course they might turn.</a>
<a id='line_3455'></a>
<a id='line_3456'>    So then by lot they take their place: there on the deck they burn.</a>
<a id='line_3457'>    The captains, goodly from afar in gold and purple show:</a>
<a id='line_3458'>    The other lads with poplar-leaf have garlanded the brow,</a>
<a id='line_3459'>    And with the oil poured over them their naked shoulders shine.</a>
<a id='line_3460'>    They man the thwarts; with hearts a-stretch they hearken for the sign,</a>
<a id='line_3461'>    With arms a-stretch upon the oars; hard tugs the pulse of fear</a>
<a id='line_3462'>    About their bounding hearts, hard strains the lust of glory dear.</a>
<a id='line_3463'>    But when the clear horn gives the sound, forthwith from where they lie</a>
<a id='line_3464'>    They leap away; the seamen's shouts smite up against the sky,        140</a>
<a id='line_3465'>    The upturned waters froth about as home the arms are borne:</a>
<a id='line_3466'>    So timely they the furrows cut, and all the sea uptorn</a>
<a id='line_3467'>    Is cloven by the sweep of oars and bows' three-headed push.</a>
<a id='line_3468'>    --Nay, nought so swift in twi-yoke race forth from the barriers rush</a>
<a id='line_3469'>    The scattered headlong chariots on to wear the space of plain,</a>
<a id='line_3470'>    Nor eager so the charioteers shake waves along the rein</a>
<a id='line_3471'>    Above the hurrying yoke, as hung over the lash they go.</a>
<a id='line_3472'>    --Then with the shouts and praise of men, and hope cast to and fro,</a>
<a id='line_3473'>    Rings all the grove; the cliff-walled shore rolleth great voice around,</a>
<a id='line_3474'>    And beating 'gainst the mountain-side the shattering shouts rebound.  150</a>
<a id='line_3475'></a>
<a id='line_3476'>    Before the others Gyas flies, and first the waves doth skim</a>
<a id='line_3477'>    Betwixt the throng and roar, but hard Cloanthus presseth him;</a>
<a id='line_3478'>    Who, better manned, is held aback by sluggish weight of pine.</a>
<a id='line_3479'>    'Twixt Whale and Centaur after these the edge of strife is fine,</a>
<a id='line_3480'>    And hard they struggle each with each to win the foremost place.</a>
<a id='line_3481'>    Now the Whale hath it; beaten now is foregone in the race</a>
<a id='line_3482'>    By the huge Centaur; head and head now follow on the two,</a>
<a id='line_3483'>    As the long keel of either one the salt sea furrows through.</a>
<a id='line_3484'></a>
<a id='line_3485'>    But now they drew anigh the holm, the goal close on them gave,</a>
<a id='line_3486'>    When Gyas first and conquering there amid the whirl of wave          160</a>
<a id='line_3487'>    Unto the helmsman of his ship, Menoetes, cries command:</a>
<a id='line_3488'>    "And why so far unto the right? turn hither to this hand!</a>
<a id='line_3489'>    Hug thou the shore; let the blades graze the very rocks a-lee.</a>
<a id='line_3490'>    Let others hold the deep!"</a>
<a id='line_3491'>                              No less unto the wavy sea</a>
<a id='line_3492'>    Menoetes, fearing hidden rocks, still turns away the bow:</a>
<a id='line_3493'>    Gyas would shout him back again: "Menoetes, whither now?</a>
<a id='line_3494'>    Steer for the rocks!"</a>
<a id='line_3495'>                         And therewithal, as back his eyes he cast.</a>
<a id='line_3496'>    He sees Cloanthus hard at heel and gaining on him fast;</a>
<a id='line_3497'>    Who, grazing on this hand and that the rocks and Gyas' ship,</a>
<a id='line_3498'>    Now suddenly by leeward course a-head of all doth slip,              170</a>
<a id='line_3499'>    And leaving clear the goal behind hath open water's gain.</a>
<a id='line_3500'>    Then unto Gyas' very bones deep burns the wrathful pain;</a>
<a id='line_3501'>    Nor did his cheeks lack tears indeed: forgetting honour's trust,</a>
<a id='line_3502'>    Forgetting all his fellows' weal, Menoetes doth he thrust</a>
<a id='line_3503'>    Headlong from off the lofty deck into the sea adown,</a>
<a id='line_3504'>    And takes the tiller, helmsman now and steering-master grown;</a>
<a id='line_3505'>    He cheers his men, and toward the shore the rudder wresteth round.</a>
<a id='line_3506'>    Menoetes, heavy, hardly won up from the ocean's ground,</a>
<a id='line_3507'>    (For he was old, and floods enow fulfilled his dripping gear,)</a>
<a id='line_3508'>    Made for the holm and sat him down upon the dry rock there:          180</a>
<a id='line_3509'>    The Teucrians laughed to see him fall, and laughed to see him swim,</a>
<a id='line_3510'>    And laugh to see him spue the brine back from the heart of him.</a>
<a id='line_3511'></a>
<a id='line_3512'>    Now Mnestheus' and Sergestus' hope began anew to spring,</a>
<a id='line_3513'>    That they might outgo Gyas yet amid his tarrying:</a>
<a id='line_3514'>    Of whom Sergestus draws ahead and nears the rocky holm;</a>
<a id='line_3515'>    But not by all his keel indeed the other did o'ercome,</a>
<a id='line_3516'>    But by the half; the eager Whale amidships held her place,</a>
<a id='line_3517'>    Where Mnestheus midst the men themselves now to and fro did pace,</a>
<a id='line_3518'>    Egging them on: "Now, now!" he cries; "up, up, on oar-heft high!</a>
<a id='line_3519'>    Fellows of Hector, whom I chose when Troy last threw the die!        190</a>
<a id='line_3520'>    Now put ye forth your ancient heart, put forth the might of yore,</a>
<a id='line_3521'>    Wherewith amid Getulian sand, Ionian sea ye bore;</a>
<a id='line_3522'>    The heart and might ye had amidst Malea's following wave!</a>
<a id='line_3523'>    I, Mnestheus, seek not victory now, nor foremost place to save.</a>
<a id='line_3524'>    --Yet, O my heart! but let them win to whom thou giv'st the crown,</a>
<a id='line_3525'>    O Neptune!--but the shameful last! O townsmen, beat it down.</a>
<a id='line_3526'>    And ban such horror!"</a>
<a id='line_3527'>                          Hard on oars they lie mid utter throes,</a>
<a id='line_3528'>    And quivereth all the brazen ship beneath their mighty blows;</a>
<a id='line_3529'>    The sea's floor slippeth under them; the ceaseless pantings shake    199</a>
<a id='line_3530'>    Their limbs and parchèd mouths, and still the sweat-streams never slake.</a>
<a id='line_3531'>    But very chance those strivers gave the prize they struggled for,</a>
<a id='line_3532'>    Since now Sergestus, hot at heart, while to the stony shore</a>
<a id='line_3533'>    He clingeth innerward, is come into the treacherous strait,</a>
<a id='line_3534'>    And hapless driveth on the rocks thrust forth for such a fate:</a>
<a id='line_3535'>    The cliffs are shaken and the oars against the flinty spikes</a>
<a id='line_3536'>    Snap crashing, and the prow thrust up yet hangeth where it strikes:</a>
<a id='line_3537'>    Up start the seafarers, and raise great hubbub tarrying;</a>
<a id='line_3538'>    Then sprits all iron-shod and poles sharp-ended forth they bring</a>
<a id='line_3539'>    To bear her off, and gather oars a-floating in the wash.</a>
<a id='line_3540'></a>
<a id='line_3541'>    But Mnestheus, whetted by his luck, joyful, with hurrying dash       210</a>
<a id='line_3542'>    Of timely-beating oars, speeds forth, and praying breezes on,</a>
<a id='line_3543'>    O'er waters' slope adown the sea's all open way doth run:</a>
<a id='line_3544'>    --E'en as a pigeon in a cave stirred suddenly from rest,</a>
<a id='line_3545'>    Who in the shady pumice-rock hath house and happy nest;</a>
<a id='line_3546'>    Scared 'neath the roof she beateth forth with mighty flap of wings,</a>
<a id='line_3547'>    And flieth, borne adown the fields, till in soft air she swings,</a>
<a id='line_3548'>    And floateth on the flowing way, nor scarce a wing doth move;</a>
<a id='line_3549'>    --So Mnestheus, so the Whale herself, the latter waters clove,</a>
<a id='line_3550'>    So with the way erst made on her she flew on swift and soft;</a>
<a id='line_3551'>    And first Sergestus doth she leave stayed on the rock aloft,         220</a>
<a id='line_3552'>    Striving in shallows' tanglement, calling for help in vain,</a>
<a id='line_3553'>    And learning with his broken oars a little way to gain.</a>
<a id='line_3554'>    Then Gyas and Chimæra's bulk he holdeth hard in chase,</a>
<a id='line_3555'>    Who, from her lack of helmsman lost, must presently give place.</a>
<a id='line_3556'>    And now at very end of all Cloanthus is the last</a>
<a id='line_3557'>    With whom to deal: his most he strives, and presseth on him fast.</a>
<a id='line_3558'>    Then verily shout thrusts on shout, and all with all goodwill</a>
<a id='line_3559'>    Cry on the chase; their echoing noise the very lift doth fill.</a>
<a id='line_3560'>    These, thinking shame of letting fall their hardly-gotten gain</a>
<a id='line_3561'>    Of glory's meed, to buy the praise with very life are fain;          230</a>
<a id='line_3562'>    Those, fed on good-hap, all things may, because they deem they may:</a>
<a id='line_3563'>    The twain, perchance, head laid to head, had won the prize that day,</a>
<a id='line_3564'>    But if Cloanthus both his palms had stretched to seaward there,</a>
<a id='line_3565'>    And called upon the Gods to aid and poured forth eager prayer:</a>
<a id='line_3566'></a>
<a id='line_3567'>    "O Gods, whose lordship is the sea, whose waters I run o'er,</a>
<a id='line_3568'>    Now glad will I, your debtor bound, by altars on the shore</a>
<a id='line_3569'>    Bring forth for you a snow-white bull, and cast amid the brine</a>
<a id='line_3570'>    His inner meat, and pour abroad a flowing of fair wine."</a>
<a id='line_3571'></a>
<a id='line_3572'>    He spake, and all the Nereids' choir hearkened the words he said</a>
<a id='line_3573'>    Down 'neath the waves, and Phorcus' folk, and Panopea the maid;      240</a>
<a id='line_3574'>    Yea, and the sire Portunus thrust the keel with mighty hand</a>
<a id='line_3575'>    Upon its way, and arrow-swift it flew on toward the land,</a>
<a id='line_3576'>    Swift as the South, and there at rest in haven deep it lies.</a>
<a id='line_3577'></a>
<a id='line_3578'>    But now Anchises' seed, all men being summoned in due wise,</a>
<a id='line_3579'>    Proclaims Cloanthus victor there by loud-voiced herald's shout,</a>
<a id='line_3580'>    And with green garland of the bay he does his brows about;</a>
<a id='line_3581'>    Then biddeth them to choose the gifts, for every ship three steers,</a>
<a id='line_3582'>    And wine, and every crew therewith great weight of silver bears.</a>
<a id='line_3583'>    And glorious gifts he adds withal to every duke of man:</a>
<a id='line_3584'>    A gold-wrought cloak the victor hath, about whose rim there ran      250</a>
<a id='line_3585'>    A plenteous double wavy stream of Meliboean shell,</a>
<a id='line_3586'>    And leafy Ida's kingly boy thereon was pictured well.</a>
<a id='line_3587'>    A-following up the fleeing hart with spear and running fleet;</a>
<a id='line_3588'>    Eager he seemed as one who pants; then him with hookèd feet</a>
<a id='line_3589'>    Jove's shield-bearer hath caught, and up with him from Ida flies,</a>
<a id='line_3590'>    And there the ancient masters stretch vain palms unto the skies,</a>
<a id='line_3591'>    While bark of staring hunting-hound beats fierce at upper air.</a>
<a id='line_3592'></a>
<a id='line_3593'>    Then next for him who second place of might and valour bare</a>
<a id='line_3594'>    A mail-coat wove of polished rings with threefold wire of gold,</a>
<a id='line_3595'>    Which from Demoleos the King had stripped in days of old,            260</a>
<a id='line_3596'>    A conqueror then by Simoïs swift beneath high-builded Troy,</a>
<a id='line_3597'>    He giveth now that lord to have a safeguard and a joy;</a>
<a id='line_3598'>    Its many folds his serving-men, Phegeus and Sagaris,</a>
<a id='line_3599'>    Scarce bore on toiling shoulders joined, yet clad in nought but this</a>
<a id='line_3600'>    Swift ran Demoleos following on the Trojans disarrayed.</a>
<a id='line_3601'></a>
<a id='line_3602'>    A third gift then he setteth forth, twin cauldrons brazen made,</a>
<a id='line_3603'>    And silver bowls with picturing fret and wrought with utter pain.</a>
<a id='line_3604'></a>
<a id='line_3605'>    And now when all had gotten gifts, and glorying in their gain,</a>
<a id='line_3606'>    Were wending with the filleting of purple round the brow,</a>
<a id='line_3607'>    Lo, gotten from the cruel rock with craft and toil enow,             270</a>
<a id='line_3608'>    With missing oars, and all one board unhandy and foredone,</a>
<a id='line_3609'>    His ship inglorious and bemocked, Sergestus driveth on.</a>
<a id='line_3610'>    --As with an adder oft it haps caught on the highway's crown,</a>
<a id='line_3611'>    Aslant by brazen tire of wheel, or heavy pebble thrown</a>
<a id='line_3612'>    By wayfarer, hath left him torn and nigh unto his end:</a>
<a id='line_3613'>    Who writhings wrought for helpless flight through all his length doth send,</a>
<a id='line_3614'>    And one half fierce with burning eyes uprears a hissing crest,</a>
<a id='line_3615'>    The other half, with wounds all halt, still holding back the rest;</a>
<a id='line_3616'>    He knitteth him in many a knot and on himself doth slip.</a>
<a id='line_3617'>    --E'en such the crawling of the oars that drave the tarrying ship.   280</a>
<a id='line_3618'>    But they hoist sail on her, and so the harbour-mouth make shift</a>
<a id='line_3619'>    To win: and there Æneas gives Sergestus promised gift,</a>
<a id='line_3620'>    Blithe at his saving of the ship, and fellows brought aback:</a>
<a id='line_3621'>    A maid he hath, who not a whit of Pallas' art doth lack.</a>
<a id='line_3622'>    Of Crete she is, and Pholoë called, and twins at breast she bears.</a>
<a id='line_3623'></a>
<a id='line_3624'>    Now all that strife being overpast, the good Æneas fares</a>
<a id='line_3625'>    To grassy meads girt all about by hollow wooded hills,</a>
<a id='line_3626'>    Where theatre-wise the racing-course the midmost valley fills.</a>
<a id='line_3627'>    Thereto the hero, very heart of many a thousand men,</a>
<a id='line_3628'>    Now wendeth, and on seat high-piled he sits him down again.          290</a>
<a id='line_3629'>    There whosoever may have will to strive in speedy race</a>
<a id='line_3630'>    He hearteneth on with hope of gift, and shows the prize and grace.</a>
<a id='line_3631'>    So from all sides Sicilians throng, and Trojan fellowship.</a>
<a id='line_3632'>    Euryalus and Nisus first.</a>
<a id='line_3633'>    Euryalus for goodliness and youth's first blossom famed,</a>
<a id='line_3634'>    Nisus for fair love of the youth; then after these are named</a>
<a id='line_3635'>    Diores, of the blood of kings from Priam's glorious race;</a>
<a id='line_3636'>    Salius and Patron next; the one of Acarnanian place,</a>
<a id='line_3637'>    The other from Arcadian blood of Tegeæa outsprung:</a>
<a id='line_3638'>    Then two Trinacrians, Helymus and Panopes the young,                 300</a>
<a id='line_3639'>    In woodcraft skilled, who ever went by old Acestes' side;</a>
<a id='line_3640'>    And many others else there were whom rumour dimmed doth hide.</a>
<a id='line_3641'></a>
<a id='line_3642'>    And now amidmost of all these suchwise Æneas spake:</a>
<a id='line_3643'>    "Now hearken; let your merry hearts heed of my saying take:</a>
<a id='line_3644'>    No man of all the tale of you shall henceforth giftless go;</a>
<a id='line_3645'>    Two Gnosian spears to each I give with polished steel aglow,</a>
<a id='line_3646'>    An axe to carry in the war with silver wrought therein.</a>
<a id='line_3647'>    This honour is for one and all: the three first prize shall win,</a>
<a id='line_3648'>    And round about their heads shall do the olive dusky-grey.</a>
<a id='line_3649'>    A noble horse with trappings dight the first shall bear away;        310</a>
<a id='line_3650'>    A quiver of the Amazons with Thracian arrows stored</a>
<a id='line_3651'>    The second hath; about it goes a gold belt broidered broad,</a>
<a id='line_3652'>    With gem-wrought buckle delicate to clasp it at the end.</a>
<a id='line_3653'>    But gladdened with this Argive helm content the third shall wend."</a>
<a id='line_3654'></a>
<a id='line_3655'>    All said, they take their places due, and when the sign they hear,</a>
<a id='line_3656'>    Forthwith they leave the bar behind and o'er the course they bear,</a>
<a id='line_3657'>    Like drift of storm-cloud; on the goal all set their eager eyes:</a>
<a id='line_3658'>    But far before all shapes of man shows Nisus, and outflies</a>
<a id='line_3659'>    The very whistling of the winds or lightning on the wing.</a>
<a id='line_3660'>    Then, though the space be long betwixt, comes Salius following;      320</a>
<a id='line_3661'>    And after Salius again another space is left,</a>
<a id='line_3662'>    And then Euryalus is third;</a>
<a id='line_3663'>    And after him is Helymus: but lo, how hard on heel</a>
<a id='line_3664'>    Diores scuds! foot on his foot doth Helymus nigh feel,</a>
<a id='line_3665'>    Shoulder on shoulder: yea, and if the course held longer out,</a>
<a id='line_3666'>    He would slip by him and be first, or leave the thing in doubt.</a>
<a id='line_3667'></a>
<a id='line_3668'>    Now, spent, unto the utmost reach and very end of all</a>
<a id='line_3669'>    They came, when in the slippery blood doth luckless Nisus fall,</a>
<a id='line_3670'>    E'en where the ground was all a-slop with bullocks slain that day,</a>
<a id='line_3671'>    And all the topmost of the grass be-puddled with it lay:             330</a>
<a id='line_3672'>    There, as he went the victor now, exulting, failed his feet</a>
<a id='line_3673'>    From off the earth, and forth he fell face foremost down to meet</a>
<a id='line_3674'>    The midst of all the filthy slime blent with the holy gore:</a>
<a id='line_3675'>    Yet for Euryalus his love forgat he none the more,</a>
<a id='line_3676'>    For rising from the slippery place in Salius' way he thrust,</a>
<a id='line_3677'>    Who, rolling over, lay along amid the thickened dust.</a>
<a id='line_3678'>    Forth flies Euryalus, and flies to fame and foremost place,</a>
<a id='line_3679'>    His own friend's gift, mid beat of hands and shouts that bear him grace.</a>
<a id='line_3680'>    Next came in Helymus, and next the palm Diores bore.</a>
<a id='line_3681'>    But over all the concourse set in hollow dale, and o'er              340</a>
<a id='line_3682'>    The heads of those first father-lords goes Salius' clamouring speech,</a>
<a id='line_3683'>    Who for his glory reft away by guile doth still beseech.</a>
<a id='line_3684'>    But safe goodwill and goodly tears Euryalus do bear,</a>
<a id='line_3685'>    And lovelier seemeth valour set in body wrought so fair.</a>
<a id='line_3686'>    Him too Diores backeth now, and crieth out on high,</a>
<a id='line_3687'>    Whose palm of praise and third-won place shall fail and pass him by,</a>
<a id='line_3688'>    If the first glory once again at Salius' bidding shift.</a>
<a id='line_3689'></a>
<a id='line_3690'>    Then sayeth Father Æneas: "O fellows, every gift</a>
<a id='line_3691'>    Shall bide unmoved: the palm of praise shall no man now displace.</a>
<a id='line_3692'>    Yet for my sackless friend's mishap give me some pity's grace."      350</a>
<a id='line_3693'></a>
<a id='line_3694'>    He spake, and unto Salius gave a mighty lion's hide,</a>
<a id='line_3695'>    Getulian born, with weight of hair and golden claws beside:</a>
<a id='line_3696'>    Then Nisus spake: "If such great gifts are toward for beaten men,</a>
<a id='line_3697'>    And thou must pity those that fall, what gift is worthy then</a>
<a id='line_3698'>    Of Nisus? I, who should have gained the very victory's crown,</a>
<a id='line_3699'>    If me, as Salius, Fate my foe had never overthrown."</a>
<a id='line_3700'></a>
<a id='line_3701'>    And even as he speaks the word he showeth face and limb</a>
<a id='line_3702'>    Foul with the mud. The kindest lord, the Father, laughed on him,</a>
<a id='line_3703'>    And bade them bring a buckler forth, wrought of Didymaon,</a>
<a id='line_3704'>    Spoil of the Greeks, from Neptune's house and holy doors undone;     360</a>
<a id='line_3705'>    And there unto the noble youth he gives that noble thing.</a>
<a id='line_3706'>    But now, the race all overpassed and all the gift-giving,</a>
<a id='line_3707'>    Quoth he: "If any valour hath, or heart that may withstand,</a>
<a id='line_3708'>    Let him come forth to raise his arm with hide-begirded hand."</a>
<a id='line_3709'></a>
<a id='line_3710'>    So saying, for the fight to come he sets forth glories twain;</a>
<a id='line_3711'>    A steer gilt-horned and garlanded the conquering man should gain,</a>
<a id='line_3712'>    A sword and noble helm should stay the vanquished in his woe.</a>
<a id='line_3713'>    No tarrying was there: Dares straight his face to all doth show,</a>
<a id='line_3714'>    And riseth in his mighty strength amidst the murmur great:</a>
<a id='line_3715'>    He who alone of all men erst with Paris held debate,                 370</a>
<a id='line_3716'>    And he who at the mound wherein that mightiest Hector lay,</a>
<a id='line_3717'>    Had smitten Butes' body huge, the winner of the day,</a>
<a id='line_3718'>    Who called him come of Amycus and that Bebrycian land:</a>
<a id='line_3719'>    But Dares stretched him dying there upon the yellow sand.</a>
<a id='line_3720'>    Such was the Dares that upreared his head against the fight,</a>
<a id='line_3721'>    And showed his shoulders' breadth and drave his fists to left and right,</a>
<a id='line_3722'>    With arms cast forth, as heavy strokes he laid upon the air.</a>
<a id='line_3723'>    But when they sought a man for him, midst all the concourse there</a>
<a id='line_3724'>    Was none durst meet him: not a hand the fighting-glove would don:</a>
<a id='line_3725'>    Wherefore, high-hearted, deeming now the prize from all was won,     380</a>
<a id='line_3726'>    He stood before Æneas' feet nor longer tarrièd,</a>
<a id='line_3727'>    But with his left hand took the steer about the horn and said:</a>
<a id='line_3728'>    "O Goddess-born, if no man dares to trust him in the play,</a>
<a id='line_3729'>    What end shall be of standing here; must I abide all day?</a>
<a id='line_3730'>    Bid them bring forth the gifts."</a>
<a id='line_3731'>                                    Therewith they cried out one and all,</a>
<a id='line_3732'>    The Dardan folk, to give the gifts that due to him did fall.</a>
<a id='line_3733'>    But with hard words Acestes now Entellus falls to chide,</a>
<a id='line_3734'>    As on the bank of grassy green they sat there side by side,</a>
<a id='line_3735'>    "Entellus, bravest hero once of all men, and for nought,</a>
<a id='line_3736'>    If thou wilt let them bear away without a battle fought              390</a>
<a id='line_3737'>    Such gifts as these. And where is he, thy master then, that God,</a>
<a id='line_3738'>    That Eryx, told of oft in vain? where is thy fame sown broad</a>
<a id='line_3739'>    Through all Trinacria, where the spoils hung up beneath thy roof?"</a>
<a id='line_3740'></a>
<a id='line_3741'>    "Nay," said he, "neither love of fame nor glory holds aloof</a>
<a id='line_3742'>    Beaten by fear, but cold I grow with eld that holdeth back.</a>
<a id='line_3743'>    My blood is dull, my might gone dry with all my body's lack.</a>
<a id='line_3744'>    Ah, had I that which once I had, that which the rascal there</a>
<a id='line_3745'>    Trusts in with idle triumphing, the days of youth the dear,</a>
<a id='line_3746'>    Then had I come into the fight by no gift-giving led,</a>
<a id='line_3747'>    No goodly steer: nought heed I gifts."                               400</a>
<a id='line_3748'>                                           And with the last word said,</a>
<a id='line_3749'>    His fighting gloves of fearful weight amidst of them he cast,</a>
<a id='line_3750'>    Wherewith the eager Eryx' hands amid the play had passed</a>
<a id='line_3751'>    Full oft; with hardened hide of them his arms he used to bind.</a>
<a id='line_3752'>    Men's hearts were mazed; such seven bull-hides each other in them lined,</a>
<a id='line_3753'>    So stiff they were with lead sewn in and iron laid thereby;</a>
<a id='line_3754'>    And chief of all was Dares mazed, and drew back utterly.</a>
<a id='line_3755'>    But the great-souled Anchises' seed that weight of gauntlets weighed,</a>
<a id='line_3756'>    And here and there he turned about their mighty folds o'erlaid.</a>
<a id='line_3757'>    Then drew the elder from his breast words that were like to these:</a>
<a id='line_3758'></a>
<a id='line_3759'>    "Ah, had ye seen the gloves that armed the very Hercules,            410</a>
<a id='line_3760'>    And that sad battle foughten out upon this country shore!</a>
<a id='line_3761'>    For these are arms indeed that erst thy kinsmen Eryx bore:</a>
<a id='line_3762'>    Lo, ye may see them even now flecked with the blood and brain.</a>
<a id='line_3763'>    With these Alcides he withstood; with these I too was fain</a>
<a id='line_3764'>    Of war, while mightier blood gave might, nor envious eld as yet</a>
<a id='line_3765'>    On either temple of my head the hoary hairs had set.</a>
<a id='line_3766'>    But if this Dares out of Troy refuse our weapons still,</a>
<a id='line_3767'>    And good Æneas doom it so, and so Acestes will,</a>
<a id='line_3768'>    My fight-lord; make the weapons like: these gloves of Eryx here</a>
<a id='line_3769'>    I take aback: be not afraid, but doff thy Trojan gear."              420</a>
<a id='line_3770'></a>
<a id='line_3771'>    He spake, and from his back he cast his twifold cloak adown,</a>
<a id='line_3772'>    And naked his most mighty limbs and shoulders huge were shown,</a>
<a id='line_3773'>    And on the midmost of the sand a giant there he stood.</a>
<a id='line_3774'>    Wherewith Anchises' seed brought forth gloves even-matched and good,</a>
<a id='line_3775'>    And so at last with gear alike the arms of each he bound,</a>
<a id='line_3776'>    Then straightway each one stretched aloft on tip-toe from the ground:</a>
<a id='line_3777'>    They cast their mighty arms abroad, nor any fear they know,</a>
<a id='line_3778'>    The while their lofty heads they draw abackward from the blow:</a>
<a id='line_3779'>    And so they mingle hands with hands and fall to wake the fight.</a>
<a id='line_3780'>    The one a-trusting in his youth and nimbler feet and light;          430</a>
<a id='line_3781'>    The other's bulk of all avail, but, trembling, ever shrank</a>
<a id='line_3782'>    His heavy knees, and breathing short for ever shook his flank.</a>
<a id='line_3783'>    Full many a stroke those mighty men cast each at each in vain;</a>
<a id='line_3784'>    Thick fall they on the hollow sides; the breasts ring out again</a>
<a id='line_3785'>    With mighty sound; and eager-swift the hands full often stray</a>
<a id='line_3786'>    Round ears and temples; crack the jaws beneath that heavy play:</a>
<a id='line_3787'>    In one set strain, not moving aught, heavy Entellus stands,</a>
<a id='line_3788'>    By body's sway and watchful eye shunning the dart of hands:</a>
<a id='line_3789'>    But Dares is as one who brings the gin 'gainst high-built town,</a>
<a id='line_3790'>    Or round about some mountain-hold the leaguer setteth down:          440</a>
<a id='line_3791'>    Now here now there he falleth on, and putteth art to pain</a>
<a id='line_3792'>    At every place, and holds them strait with onset all in vain.</a>
<a id='line_3793'>    Entellus, rising to the work, his right hand now doth show</a>
<a id='line_3794'>    Upreared; but he, the nimble one, foresaw the falling blow</a>
<a id='line_3795'>    Above him, and his body swift writhed skew-wise from the fall.</a>
<a id='line_3796'>    Entellus spends his stroke on air, and, overborne withal,</a>
<a id='line_3797'>    A heavy thing, falls heavily to earth, a mighty weight:</a>
<a id='line_3798'>    As whiles a hollow-eaten pine on Erymanthus great,</a>
<a id='line_3799'>    Or mighty Ida, rooted up, to earthward toppling goes.</a>
<a id='line_3800'>    Then Teucrian and Trinacrian folk with wondrous longing rose,        450</a>
<a id='line_3801'>    And shouts went skyward: thither first the King Acestes ran,</a>
<a id='line_3802'>    And pitying his like-aged friend raised up the fallen man;</a>
<a id='line_3803'>    Who neither slackened by his fall, nor smit by any fear,</a>
<a id='line_3804'>    Gets back the eagerer to the fight, for anger strength doth stir,</a>
<a id='line_3805'>    And shame and conscious valour lights his ancient power again.</a>
<a id='line_3806'>    In headlong flight his fiery wrath drives Dares o'er the plain,</a>
<a id='line_3807'>    And whiles his right hand showereth strokes, his left hand raineth whiles.</a>
<a id='line_3808'>    No tarrying and no rest there is; as hail-storm on the tiles</a>
<a id='line_3809'>    Rattleth, so swift with either hand the eager hero now</a>
<a id='line_3810'>    Beats on and batters Dares down, and blow is laid on blow.           460</a>
<a id='line_3811'></a>
<a id='line_3812'>    But now the Father Æneas no longer might abide</a>
<a id='line_3813'>    Entellus' bitter rage of soul or lengthening anger's tide,</a>
<a id='line_3814'>    But laid an end upon the fight therewith, and caught away</a>
<a id='line_3815'>    Dares foredone, and soothing words in such wise did he say:</a>
<a id='line_3816'>    "Unhappy man, what madness then hath hold upon thine heart?</a>
<a id='line_3817'>    Feel'st not another might than man's, and Heaven upon his part?</a>
<a id='line_3818'>    Yield to the Gods!"</a>
<a id='line_3819'>                        So 'neath his word the battle sank to peace.</a>
<a id='line_3820'>    But Dares his true fellows took, trailing his feeble knees,</a>
<a id='line_3821'>    Lolling his head from side to side, the while his sick mouth sent</a>
<a id='line_3822'>    The clotted blood from out of it wherewith the teeth were blent.     470</a>
<a id='line_3823'>    They lead him to the ships; then, called, they take the helm and sword,</a>
<a id='line_3824'>    But leave Entellus' bull and palm, the victory's due reward;</a>
<a id='line_3825'>    Who, high of heart, proud in the beast his conquering hand did earn,</a>
<a id='line_3826'>    "O Goddess-born," he said, "and ye, O Teucrians, look, and learn</a>
<a id='line_3827'>    What might was in my body once, ere youth it had to lack,</a>
<a id='line_3828'>    And what the death whence Dares saved e'en now ye draw aback."</a>
<a id='line_3829'></a>
<a id='line_3830'>    He spake, and at the great bull's head straightway he took his stand,</a>
<a id='line_3831'>    As there it bode the prize of fight, and drawing back his hand</a>
<a id='line_3832'>    Rose to the blow, and 'twixt the horns sent forth the hardened glove,</a>
<a id='line_3833'>    And back upon his very brain the shattered skull he drove.           480</a>
<a id='line_3834'>    Down fell the beast and on the earth lay quivering, outstretched, dead,</a>
<a id='line_3835'>    While over him from his inmost breast such words Entellus said:</a>
<a id='line_3836'>    "Eryx, this soul, a better thing, for Dares doomed to die,</a>
<a id='line_3837'>    I give thee, and victorious here my gloves and craft lay by."</a>
<a id='line_3838'></a>
<a id='line_3839'>    Forth now Æneas biddeth all who have a mind to strive</a>
<a id='line_3840'>    At speeding of the arrow swift, and gifts thereto doth give,</a>
<a id='line_3841'>    And with his mighty hand the mast from out Serestus' keel</a>
<a id='line_3842'>    Uprears; and there a fluttering dove, mark for the flying steel,</a>
<a id='line_3843'>    Tied to a string he hangeth up athwart the lofty mast.</a>
<a id='line_3844'>    Then meet the men; a brazen helm catches the lots down cast:         490</a>
<a id='line_3845'>    And, as from out their favouring folk ariseth up the shout,</a>
<a id='line_3846'>    Hippocoon, son of Hyrtacus, before the rest leaps out;</a>
<a id='line_3847'>    Then Mnestheus, who was victor erst in ship upon the sea,</a>
<a id='line_3848'>    Comes after: Mnestheus garlanded with olive greenery.</a>
<a id='line_3849'>    The third-come was Eurytion, thy brother, O renowned,</a>
<a id='line_3850'>    O Pandarus, who, bidden erst the peace-troth to confound,</a>
<a id='line_3851'>    Wert first amid Achæan host to send a wingèd thing.</a>
<a id='line_3852'>    But last, at bottom of the helm, Acestes' name did cling,</a>
<a id='line_3853'>    Who had the heart to try the toil amid the youthful rout.</a>
<a id='line_3854'></a>
<a id='line_3855'>    Then with their strength of all avail they bend the bows about       500</a>
<a id='line_3856'>    Each for himself: from quiver then the arrows forth they take:</a>
<a id='line_3857'>    And first from off the twanging string through heaven there went the wake</a>
<a id='line_3858'>    Of shaft of young Hyrtacides, and clave the flowing air,</a>
<a id='line_3859'>    And, flying home, amid the mast that stood before it there</a>
<a id='line_3860'>    It stuck: the mast shook therewithal; the frighted, timorous bird,</a>
<a id='line_3861'>    Fluttered her wings; and mighty praise all round about was heard.</a>
<a id='line_3862'>    Then stood forth Mnestheus keen, and drew his bow unto the head,</a>
<a id='line_3863'>    Aiming aloft; and shaft and eyes alike therewith he sped;</a>
<a id='line_3864'>    But, worthy of all pitying, the very bird he missed,</a>
<a id='line_3865'>    But had the hap to shear the knots and lines of hempen twist         510</a>
<a id='line_3866'>    Whereby, all knitted to her foot, she to the mast was tied:</a>
<a id='line_3867'>    But flying toward the winds of heaven and mirky mist she hied.</a>
<a id='line_3868'>    Then swift Eurytion, who for long had held his arrow laid</a>
<a id='line_3869'>    On ready bow-string, vowed, and called his brother unto aid,</a>
<a id='line_3870'>    And sighted her all joyful now amidst the void of sky,</a>
<a id='line_3871'>    And smote her as she clapped her wings 'neath the black cloud on high:</a>
<a id='line_3872'>    Then dead she fell, and mid the stars of heaven her life she left,</a>
<a id='line_3873'>    And, falling, brought the shaft aback whereby her heart was cleft.</a>
<a id='line_3874'></a>
<a id='line_3875'>    Acestes now was left alone, foiled of the victory's prize.</a>
<a id='line_3876'>    No less the father sent his shot aloft unto the skies,               520</a>
<a id='line_3877'>    Fain to set forth his archer-craft and loud-resounding bow.</a>
<a id='line_3878'>    Then to men's eyes all suddenly a portent there did show,</a>
<a id='line_3879'>    A mighty sign of things to come, the ending showed how great</a>
<a id='line_3880'>    When seers, the shakers of men's hearts, sang over it too late.</a>
<a id='line_3881'>    For, flying through the flowing clouds, the swift reed burned about,</a>
<a id='line_3882'>    And marked its road with flaming wake, and, eaten up, died out</a>
<a id='line_3883'>    Mid the thin air: as oft the stars fly loose from heaven's roof,</a>
<a id='line_3884'>    And run adown the space of sky with hair that flies aloof.</a>
<a id='line_3885'>    Trinacrian men and Teucrian men, staring aghast they stood,</a>
<a id='line_3886'>    Praying the Gods: but mightiest Æneas held for good                  530</a>
<a id='line_3887'>    That tokening, and Acestes takes as one all glad at heart,</a>
<a id='line_3888'>    And loadeth him with many gifts, and suchwise speaks his part:</a>
<a id='line_3889'></a>
<a id='line_3890'>    "Take them, O father, for indeed by such a sign I wot</a>
<a id='line_3891'>    Olympus' King will have thee win all honour without lot.</a>
<a id='line_3892'>    This gift thou hast, Anchises' self, the ancient, had before,</a>
<a id='line_3893'>    A bowl all stamped with images, which Cisseus once of yore,</a>
<a id='line_3894'>    The Thracian, to my father gave, that he might bear the same</a>
<a id='line_3895'>    A very tokening of his love and memory of his name."</a>
<a id='line_3896'></a>
<a id='line_3897'>    So saying, a garland of green bay he doth his brows about,</a>
<a id='line_3898'>    And victor over all the men Acestes giveth out:                      540</a>
<a id='line_3899'>    Nor did the good Eurytion grudge his honour so preferred,</a>
<a id='line_3900'>    Though he alone from height of heaven had brought adown the bird:</a>
<a id='line_3901'>    But he came next in gift-giving who sheared the string, and last</a>
<a id='line_3902'>    Was he who set his wingèd reed amidmost of the mast.</a>
<a id='line_3903'></a>
<a id='line_3904'>    Now had Æneas called to him, ere yet the match was done,</a>
<a id='line_3905'>    The child of Epytus, the guard, and fellow of his son,</a>
<a id='line_3906'>    Beardless Iulus, and so spake into his faithful ear:</a>
<a id='line_3907'>    "Go thou and bid Ascenius straight, if ready dight with gear</a>
<a id='line_3908'>    He hath that army of the lads, and fair array of steeds,</a>
<a id='line_3909'>    To bring unto his grandsire now, himself in warlike weeds,           550</a>
<a id='line_3910'>    That host of his."</a>
<a id='line_3911'>                       The lord meanwhile biddeth all folk begone</a>
<a id='line_3912'>    Who into the long course had poured, and leave the meadow lone.</a>
<a id='line_3913'>    Then come the lads: in equal ranks before their fathers' eyes</a>
<a id='line_3914'>    They shine upon their bitted steeds, and wondering murmurs rise</a>
<a id='line_3915'>    From men of Troy and Sicily as on their ways they fare.</a>
<a id='line_3916'>    Due crown of well-ordainèd leaves bindeth their flowing hair,</a>
<a id='line_3917'>    And each a pair of cornel shafts with iron head doth hold;</a>
<a id='line_3918'>    And some the polished quiver bear at shoulder: limber gold,</a>
<a id='line_3919'>    Ringing the neck with twisted stem, high on the breast is shown.</a>
<a id='line_3920'>    Three companies of horse they are by tale, and up and down           560</a>
<a id='line_3921'>    Three captains ride, and twice six lads each leadeth to the war:</a>
<a id='line_3922'>    In bands of even tale they shine, and like their leaders are.</a>
<a id='line_3923'>    Their first array all glad at heart doth little Priam lead,</a>
<a id='line_3924'>    Who from his grandsire had his name, thy well-renowned seed,</a>
<a id='line_3925'>    Polites, fated to beget Italian folk: him bore</a>
<a id='line_3926'>    A Thracian piebald flecked with white, whose feet were white before,</a>
<a id='line_3927'>    And white withal the crest of him that high aloft he flung.</a>
<a id='line_3928'>    Next Atys came, from whence the stem of Latin Atii sprung;</a>
<a id='line_3929'>    Young Atys, whom Iulus young most well-beloved did call:</a>
<a id='line_3930'>    Iulus last, in goodliness so far excelling all,                      570</a>
<a id='line_3931'>    Upon a horse of Sidon came, whom that bright Dido gave</a>
<a id='line_3932'>    To be a token of her love, her memory to save.</a>
<a id='line_3933'>    On horses of Acestes old, Trinacrian-nurtured beasts,</a>
<a id='line_3934'>    The others of the youth are borne.</a>
<a id='line_3935'></a>
<a id='line_3936'>    With praise they greet their fluttering hearts and look on them with joy,</a>
<a id='line_3937'>    Those Dardan folk, who see in them the ancient eyes of Troy.</a>
<a id='line_3938'>    But after they had fared on steed the concourse all about</a>
<a id='line_3939'>    Before the faces of their folk, Epytides did shout</a>
<a id='line_3940'>    The looked-for sign afar to them, and cracked withal his whip:</a>
<a id='line_3941'>    Then evenly they fall apart, in threesome order slip                 580</a>
<a id='line_3942'>    Their cloven ranks; but, called again, aback upon their way</a>
<a id='line_3943'>    They turn, and threatening levelled spears against each other lay.</a>
<a id='line_3944'>    Then they to other onset now and other wheeling take,</a>
<a id='line_3945'>    In bands opposed, and tanglements of ring on ring they make;</a>
<a id='line_3946'>    So with their weapons every show of very fight they stir,</a>
<a id='line_3947'>    And now they bare their backs in flight, and now they turn the spear</a>
<a id='line_3948'>    In hostile wise; now side by side in plighted peace they meet.</a>
<a id='line_3949'>    --E'en as they tell of Labyrinth that lies in lofty Crete,</a>
<a id='line_3950'>    A road with blind walls crossed and crossed, an ever-shifting trap</a>
<a id='line_3951'>    Of thousand ways, where he who seeks upon no sign may hap,           590</a>
<a id='line_3952'>    But midst of error, blind to seize or follow back, 'tis gone.</a>
<a id='line_3953'>    Not otherwise Troy's little ones the tangle follow on</a>
<a id='line_3954'>    At top of speed, and interweave the flight and battle's play;</a>
<a id='line_3955'>    E'en as the dolphins, swimming swift amid the watery way,</a>
<a id='line_3956'>    Cleave Libyan or Carpathian sea and sport upon the wave.</a>
<a id='line_3957'></a>
<a id='line_3958'>    This guise of riding, such-like play, his folk Ascanius gave</a>
<a id='line_3959'>    Once more, when round the Long White Stead the walls of war he drew:</a>
<a id='line_3960'>    Withal the Ancient Latin Folk he taught the games to do,</a>
<a id='line_3961'>    Suchwise as he a lad had learned with lads from Troy that came:      599</a>
<a id='line_3962'>    That same the Albans taught their sons; most mighty Rome that same</a>
<a id='line_3963'>    Took to her thence, and honoured so her sires of yore agone:</a>
<a id='line_3964'>    Now name of Troy and Trojan host the play and boys have won.</a>
<a id='line_3965'></a>
<a id='line_3966'>    Thus far unto the Holy Sire the games were carried through,</a>
<a id='line_3967'>    When Fortune turned her faith at last and changed her mind anew:</a>
<a id='line_3968'>    For while the diverse hallowed games about the tomb they spent,</a>
<a id='line_3969'>    Saturnian Juno Iris fair from heights of heaven hath sent</a>
<a id='line_3970'>    Unto the Ilian ships, and breathed fair wind behind her ways,</a>
<a id='line_3971'>    For sore she brooded, nor had spent her wrath of ancient days.</a>
<a id='line_3972'>    So now the maid sped swift along her thousand-coloured bow,</a>
<a id='line_3973'>    And swiftly ran adown the path where none beheld her go.             610</a>
<a id='line_3974'>    And there she saw that gathering great, and swept the strand with eye,</a>
<a id='line_3975'>    And saw the haven void of folk, the ships unheeded lie.</a>
<a id='line_3976'>    But far away on lonely beach the Trojan women weep</a>
<a id='line_3977'>    The lost Anchises; and all they look ever on the deep</a>
<a id='line_3978'>    Amid their weeping: "Woe are we! what waters yet abide!</a>
<a id='line_3979'>    What ocean-waste for weary folk!" So one and all they cried,</a>
<a id='line_3980'>    And all they yearn for city's rest: sea-toil is loathsome grown.</a>
<a id='line_3981'></a>
<a id='line_3982'>    So she, not lacking craft of guile, amidst them lighted down,</a>
<a id='line_3983'>    When she hath put away from her God's raiment and God's mien,</a>
<a id='line_3984'>    And but as wife of Doryclus, the Tmarian man, is seen,               620</a>
<a id='line_3985'>    Old Beroë, who once had sons and lordly race and name;</a>
<a id='line_3986'>    Amid the Dardan mother-folk such wise the Goddess came:</a>
<a id='line_3987'></a>
<a id='line_3988'>    "O wretched ones!" she said, "O ye whom armed Achæan hand</a>
<a id='line_3989'>    Dragged not to death before the walls that stayed your fatherland!</a>
<a id='line_3990'>    Unhappy folk! and why hath Fate held back your doom till now?</a>
<a id='line_3991'>    The seventh year is on the turn since Troy-town's overthrow;</a>
<a id='line_3992'>    And we all seas the while, all lands, all rocks and skies that hate</a>
<a id='line_3993'>    The name of guest, have wandered o'er, and through the sea o'ergreat</a>
<a id='line_3994'>    Still chase that fleeing Italy mid wallowing waters tossed.</a>
<a id='line_3995'>    Lo, here is Eryx' brother-land; Acestes is our host;                  630</a>
<a id='line_3996'>    What banneth us to found our walls and lawful cities gain?</a>
<a id='line_3997'>    O Fatherland! O House-Gods snatched from midst the foe in vain!</a>
<a id='line_3998'>    Shall no walls more be called of Troy? Shall I see never more</a>
<a id='line_3999'>    Xanthus or Simoïs, like the streams where Hector dwelt of yore?</a>
<a id='line_4000'>    Come on, and those unhappy ships burn up with aid of me;</a>
<a id='line_4001'>    For e'en now mid the dreams of sleep Cassandra did I see,</a>
<a id='line_4002'>    Who gave me burning brand, and said, 'Here seek your Troy anew:</a>
<a id='line_4003'>    This is the house that ye shall have.'--And now is time to do!</a>
<a id='line_4004'>    No tarrying with such tokens toward! Lo, altars four are here</a>
<a id='line_4005'>    Of Neptune: very God for us heart and the fire doth bear!"           640</a>
<a id='line_4006'></a>
<a id='line_4007'>    So saying, first she caught upon the fiery bane, and raised</a>
<a id='line_4008'>    Her hand aloft, and mightily she whirled it as it blazed</a>
<a id='line_4009'>    And cast it: but the Ilian wives, their straining hearts are torn,</a>
<a id='line_4010'>    Their souls bewildered: one of them, yea, and their eldest-born,</a>
<a id='line_4011'>    Pyrgo, the queenly fosterer of many a Priam's son,</a>
<a id='line_4012'>    Cried: "Mothers, nay no Beroë, nay no Rhoeteian one,</a>
<a id='line_4013'>    The wife of Doryclus is this: lo, Godhead's beauty there!</a>
<a id='line_4014'>    Behold the gleaming of her eyes, note how she breathes the air;</a>
<a id='line_4015'>    Note ye her countenance and voice, the gait wherewith she goes.</a>
<a id='line_4016'>    Yea, I myself left Beroë e'en now amidst her woes;                   650</a>
<a id='line_4017'>    Sick, sad at heart that she alone must fail from such a deed,</a>
<a id='line_4018'>    Nor bear unto Anchises' ghost his glory's righteous meed."</a>
<a id='line_4019'></a>
<a id='line_4020'>    Such were the words she spake to them.</a>
<a id='line_4021'>    But now those mothers, at the first doubtful, with evil eyes</a>
<a id='line_4022'>    Gazed on the ships awhile between unhappy craving stayed</a>
<a id='line_4023'>    For land they stood on, and the thought of land that Fortune bade:</a>
<a id='line_4024'>    When lo! with even spread of wings the Goddess rose to heaven,</a>
<a id='line_4025'>    And in her flight the cloudy lift with mighty bow was riven.</a>
<a id='line_4026'>    Then, wildered by such tokens dread, pricked on by maddened hearts,</a>
<a id='line_4027'>    Shrieking they snatch the hearthstone's fire and brand from inner parts;</a>
<a id='line_4028'>    While some, they strip the altars there, and flaming leaf and bough  661</a>
<a id='line_4029'>    Cast forth: and Vulcan, let aloose, is swiftly raging now</a>
<a id='line_4030'>    Along the thwarts, along the oars, and stems of painted fir.</a>
<a id='line_4031'></a>
<a id='line_4032'>    But now with news of flaming ships there goes a messenger,</a>
<a id='line_4033'>    Eumelus, to Anchises' tomb, and theatre-seats, and they</a>
<a id='line_4034'>    Look round themselves and see the soot black in the smoke-cloud play.</a>
<a id='line_4035'>    Then first Ascanius, e'en as blithe the riding-play he led,</a>
<a id='line_4036'>    So eager now he rode his ways to camp bewilderèd,</a>
<a id='line_4037'>    And nowise might they hold him back, his masters spent of breath.</a>
<a id='line_4038'></a>
<a id='line_4039'>    "O what new madness then is this? What, what will ye?" he saith.</a>
<a id='line_4040'>    "O wretched townswomen, no foe, no camp of Argive men                671</a>
<a id='line_4041'>    Ye burn, but your own hopes ye burn. Lo, your Ascanius then!"</a>
<a id='line_4042'></a>
<a id='line_4043'>    Therewith before their feet he cast his empty helm afar,</a>
<a id='line_4044'>    Dight wherewithal he stirred in sport that image of the war.</a>
<a id='line_4045'>    And thither now Æneas sped, and crowd of Teucrian folk;</a>
<a id='line_4046'>    Whereat the women diversely along the sea-shore broke,</a>
<a id='line_4047'>    Fleeing afeard, and steal to woods and whatso hollow den,</a>
<a id='line_4048'>    And loathe their deed, and loathe the light, as changed they know again</a>
<a id='line_4049'>    Their very friends, and Juno now from every heart is cast.</a>
<a id='line_4050'></a>
<a id='line_4051'>    But none the less the flaming rage for ever holdeth fast             680</a>
<a id='line_4052'>    With might untamed; the fire lives on within the timbers wet,</a>
<a id='line_4053'>    The caulking sends forth sluggish smoke, the slow heat teeth doth set</a>
<a id='line_4054'>    Upon the keel; to inmost heart down creeps the fiery bale;</a>
<a id='line_4055'>    Nor all the might of mighty men nor rivers poured avail.</a>
<a id='line_4056'>    Then good Æneas from his back the raiment off him tore,</a>
<a id='line_4057'>    And called the Gods to aid, and high his palms to heaven upbore:</a>
<a id='line_4058'></a>
<a id='line_4059'>    "Great Jove, if not all utterly a hater thou art grown</a>
<a id='line_4060'>    Of Trojan folk, and if thy love of old yet looketh down</a>
<a id='line_4061'>    On deeds of men, give to our ships to win from out the flame,</a>
<a id='line_4062'>    O Father, now, and snatch from death the feeble Teucrian name,       690</a>
<a id='line_4063'>    Or else thrust down the remnant left, if so we merit aught,</a>
<a id='line_4064'>    With bolt of death, and with thine hand sweep us away to nought!"</a>
<a id='line_4065'></a>
<a id='line_4066'>    Scarce had he given forth the word, ere midst outpouring rain,</a>
<a id='line_4067'>    The black storm rageth measureless, and earthly height and plain</a>
<a id='line_4068'>    Shake to the thundering; all the sky casts forth confusèd flood,</a>
<a id='line_4069'>    Most black with gathering of the South: then all the ship-hulls stood</a>
<a id='line_4070'>    Fulfilled with water of the heavens; the half-burned oak was drenched,</a>
<a id='line_4071'>    Until at last to utmost spark the smouldering fire is quenched,</a>
<a id='line_4072'>    And all the ships escaped the bane of fiery end save four.</a>
<a id='line_4073'></a>
<a id='line_4074'>    But, shaken by such bitter hap, Father Æneas bore                    700</a>
<a id='line_4075'>    This way and that; and turned the cares on all sides in his breast:</a>
<a id='line_4076'>    Whether amid Sicilian fields to set him down in rest,</a>
<a id='line_4077'>    Forgetting Fate, or yet to strive for shores of Italy.</a>
<a id='line_4078'>    Then the old Nautes, whom erewhile had Pallas set on high</a>
<a id='line_4079'>    By her exceeding plenteous craft and lore that she had taught:--</a>
<a id='line_4080'>    She gave him answers; telling him how wrath of God was wrought,</a>
<a id='line_4081'>    And how it showed, and what the law of fate would ask and have:--</a>
<a id='line_4082'>    This man unto Æneas now such words of solace gave:</a>
<a id='line_4083'></a>
<a id='line_4084'>    "O Goddess-born, Fate's ebb and flow still let us follow on,</a>
<a id='line_4085'>    Whate'er shall be, by bearing all must Fortune's fight be won.       710</a>
<a id='line_4086'>    Dardan Acestes have ye here, sprung of the Godhead's seed;</a>
<a id='line_4087'>    Take his goodwill and fellowship to help thee in thy rede.</a>
<a id='line_4088'>    Give him the crews of those burnt ships; to him let such-like go</a>
<a id='line_4089'>    As faint before thy mighty hope and shifting weal and woe.</a>
<a id='line_4090'>    The mothers weary of the sea, the elders spent with years,</a>
<a id='line_4091'>    And whatsoever feeble is and whatsoever fears,</a>
<a id='line_4092'>    Choose out, and in this land of his walls let the weary frame;</a>
<a id='line_4093'>    And they their town by leave of thee shall e'en Acesta name."</a>
<a id='line_4094'></a>
<a id='line_4095'>    So was he kindled by the speech of that wise ancient friend,</a>
<a id='line_4096'>    Yet still down every way of care his thought he needs must send.     720</a>
<a id='line_4097'></a>
<a id='line_4098'>    But now the wain of mirky night was holding middle sky,</a>
<a id='line_4099'>    When lo, his father's image seemed to fall from heaven the high,</a>
<a id='line_4100'>    And suddenly Anchises' lips such words to him poured forth:</a>
<a id='line_4101'></a>
<a id='line_4102'>    "O son, that while my life abode more than my life wert worth;</a>
<a id='line_4103'>    O son, well learned in Ilium's fates, hither my ways I take</a>
<a id='line_4104'>    By Jove's commands, who even now the fiery bane did slake</a>
<a id='line_4105'>    Amid thy ships, and now at last in heaven hath pitied thee:</a>
<a id='line_4106'>    Yield thou to elder Nautes' redes; exceeding good they be:</a>
<a id='line_4107'>    The very flower of all thy folk, the hearts that hardiest are,</a>
<a id='line_4108'>    Take thou to Italy; for thee in Latium bideth war                    730</a>
<a id='line_4109'>    With hardy folk of nurture rude: but first must thou be gone</a>
<a id='line_4110'>    To nether dwelling-place of Dis: seek thou to meet me, son,</a>
<a id='line_4111'>    Across Avernus deep: for me the wicked house of hell</a>
<a id='line_4112'>    The dusk unhappy holdeth not; in pleasant place I dwell,</a>
<a id='line_4113'>    Elysium, fellowship of good: there shall the holy Maid,</a>
<a id='line_4114'>    The Sibyl, bring thee; plenteous blood of black-wooled ewes being paid:</a>
<a id='line_4115'>    There shalt thou learn of all thy race, and gift of fated walls.</a>
<a id='line_4116'>    And now farewell: for dewy night from mid way-faring falls,</a>
<a id='line_4117'>    The panting steeds of cruel dawn are on me with their breath."</a>
<a id='line_4118'></a>
<a id='line_4119'>    He spake, and midst thin air he fled as smoke-wreath vanisheth.      740</a>
<a id='line_4120'>    "Where rushest thou?" Æneas cried: "where hurriest thou again?</a>
<a id='line_4121'>    Whom fleest thou? who driveth thee from these embraces fain?"</a>
<a id='line_4122'></a>
<a id='line_4123'>    So saying, the flame asleep in ash he busied him to wake,</a>
<a id='line_4124'>    And worshipped with the censer full and holy-kneaded cake</a>
<a id='line_4125'>    The sacred Vesta's shrine and God of Pergamean wall.</a>
<a id='line_4126'>    Then for his fellows doth he send, Acestes first of all,</a>
<a id='line_4127'>    And teacheth them of Jove's command, and what his sire beloved</a>
<a id='line_4128'>    Had bidden him, and whitherwise his heart thereto was moved.</a>
<a id='line_4129'>    No tarrying there was therein, Acestes gainsaid nought;</a>
<a id='line_4130'>    They write the mothers on the roll; thither a folk is brought,       750</a>
<a id='line_4131'>    Full willing hearts, who nothing crave the great reward of fame:</a>
<a id='line_4132'>    But they themselves shape thwarts anew; and timbers gnawed by flame</a>
<a id='line_4133'>    Make new within their ships again, and oars and rudders fit.</a>
<a id='line_4134'>    A little band it is by tale, but valour lives in it.</a>
<a id='line_4135'></a>
<a id='line_4136'>    Meanwhile Æneas marketh out the city with the plough,</a>
<a id='line_4137'>    And, portioning the houses out, bids Troy and Ilium grow:</a>
<a id='line_4138'>    Therewith Acestes, Trojan king, joys in his lordship fair;</a>
<a id='line_4139'>    Sets forth the court, and giveth laws to fathers gathered there:</a>
<a id='line_4140'>    Then on the head of Eryx huge a house that neareth heaven</a>
<a id='line_4141'>    To Venus of Idalia is reared: a priest is given                      760</a>
<a id='line_4142'>    And holy grove wide spread around, where old Anchises lay.</a>
<a id='line_4143'></a>
<a id='line_4144'>    Now all the folk for nine days' space have made them holyday</a>
<a id='line_4145'>    And worshipped God; and quiet winds have lowly laid the main,</a>
<a id='line_4146'>    And ever gentle Southern breath woos to the deep again:</a>
<a id='line_4147'>    Then all along the hollow shore ariseth weeping great,</a>
<a id='line_4148'>    And 'twixt farewells and many a kiss a night and day they wait:</a>
<a id='line_4149'>    Yea e'en the mothers, yea e'en they to whom so hard and drear</a>
<a id='line_4150'>    The sea had seemed, a dreadful name they had no heart to bear,</a>
<a id='line_4151'>    Are fain to go, are fain to take all toil the way may find.</a>
<a id='line_4152'>    Whom good Æneas solaceth with friendly words and kind,               770</a>
<a id='line_4153'>    As to Acestes' kindred heart weeping he giveth them.</a>
<a id='line_4154'>    Three calves to Eryx then he bids slay on the ocean's hem;</a>
<a id='line_4155'>    To wind and weather an ewe lamb; then biddeth cast aloose:</a>
<a id='line_4156'>    And he himself, begarlanded with olive clippèd close,</a>
<a id='line_4157'>    Stands, cup in hand, on furthest prow, and casts upon the brine</a>
<a id='line_4158'>    The inner meat, and poureth forth the flowing of the wine.</a>
<a id='line_4159'>    They gather way; springs up astern the fair and following breeze;</a>
<a id='line_4160'>    The fellows strive in smiting brine and sweep the level seas.</a>
<a id='line_4161'></a>
<a id='line_4162'>    But meanwhile Venus, sorely stirred by cares and all unrest,</a>
<a id='line_4163'>    Hath speech of Neptune, pouring forth complaining from her breast:</a>
<a id='line_4164'>    "The cruel wrath that Juno bears, and heart insatiate,               781</a>
<a id='line_4165'>    Drive me, O Neptune, prayer-fulfilled upon thy power to wait:</a>
<a id='line_4166'>    She softeneth not by lapse of days nor piety's increase,</a>
<a id='line_4167'>    Nor yielding unto Jove and Fate from troubling will she cease.</a>
<a id='line_4168'>    'Tis not enough to tear away from heart of Phrygian folk</a>
<a id='line_4169'>    Their city by her cruel hate; nor with all ills to yoke</a>
<a id='line_4170'>    Troy's remnant; but its ash and bones through death she followeth on.</a>
<a id='line_4171'>    What! doth her own heart know the deed that all this wrath hath won?</a>
<a id='line_4172'>    Be thou my witness how of late she stirred up suddenly</a>
<a id='line_4173'>    Wild tumult of the Libyan sea! all waters with the sky               790</a>
<a id='line_4174'>    She mingled, trusting all in vain to storm of Æolus:</a>
<a id='line_4175'>    This in thy very realm she dared.</a>
<a id='line_4176'>    E'en now mad hearts to Trojan wives by wickedness she gave,</a>
<a id='line_4177'>    And foully burned his ships; and him with crippled ship-host drave</a>
<a id='line_4178'>    To leave his fellow-folk behind upon an outland shore.</a>
<a id='line_4179'>    I pray thee let the remnant left sail safe thine ocean o'er,</a>
<a id='line_4180'>    And let them come where into sea Laurentian Tiber falls,</a>
<a id='line_4181'>    If right I ask, and unto these Fate giveth fateful walls."</a>
<a id='line_4182'></a>
<a id='line_4183'>    Then Saturn's son, the sea-tamer, gave forth such words as these:</a>
<a id='line_4184'>    "'Tis utter right, O Cytherean, to trust thee to my seas,            800</a>
<a id='line_4185'>    Whence thou wert born; and I myself deserve no less; e'en I,</a>
<a id='line_4186'>    Who oft for thee refrain the rage of maddened sea and sky.</a>
<a id='line_4187'>    Nor less upon the earth my care Æneas did embrace;</a>
<a id='line_4188'>    Xanthus and Simoïs witness it!--When, following up the chace,</a>
<a id='line_4189'>    The all-unheartened host of Troy 'gainst Troy Achilles bore,</a>
<a id='line_4190'>    And many a thousand gave to death; choked did the rivers roar</a>
<a id='line_4191'>    Nor any way might Xanthus find to roll his flood to sea:</a>
<a id='line_4192'>    Æneas then in hollow cloud I caught away, when he</a>
<a id='line_4193'>    Would meet Pelides' might with hands and Gods not strong enow.</a>
<a id='line_4194'>    Yea, that was when from lowest base I wrought to overthrow           810</a>
<a id='line_4195'>    The walls of that same Troy forsworn my very hands had wrought.</a>
<a id='line_4196'>    And now cast all thy fear away, my mind hath shifted nought;</a>
<a id='line_4197'>    Avernus' haven shall he reach, e'en as thou deemest good,</a>
<a id='line_4198'>    And one alone of all his folk shall seek amidst the flood;</a>
<a id='line_4199'>    One head shall pay for all the rest."</a>
<a id='line_4200'></a>
<a id='line_4201'>    So when these words had brought to peace the Goddess' joyful heart,</a>
<a id='line_4202'>    The Father yokes his steeds with gold, and bridles the wild things</a>
<a id='line_4203'>    With o'erfoamed bit, and loose in hand the rein above them flings,</a>
<a id='line_4204'>    And light in coal-blue car he flies o'er topmost of the sea:</a>
<a id='line_4205'>    The waves sink down, the heaped main lays his waters peacefully      820</a>
<a id='line_4206'>    Before the thunder of his wheels; from heaven all cloud-flecks fail.</a>
<a id='line_4207'>    Lo, diverse bodies of his folk; lo, many a mighty whale;</a>
<a id='line_4208'>    And Glaucus' ancient fellowship, Palæmon Ino's son,</a>
<a id='line_4209'>    And Tritons swift, and all the host that Phorcus leadeth on;</a>
<a id='line_4210'>    Maid Panopea and Melite, Cymodoce the fair,</a>
<a id='line_4211'>    Nesæa, Spio, and Thalia, with Thetis leftward bear.</a>
<a id='line_4212'></a>
<a id='line_4213'>    Now to Æneas' overstrained heart the kindly joy and soft</a>
<a id='line_4214'>    Sinks deep: herewith he biddeth men raise all the masts aloft</a>
<a id='line_4215'>    At swiftest, and along the yards to spread the sails to wind:</a>
<a id='line_4216'>    So all sheet home together then; then leftward with one mind         830</a>
<a id='line_4217'>    They tack; then tack again to right: the yard-horns up in air</a>
<a id='line_4218'>    They shift and shift, while kindly winds seaward the ship-host bear.</a>
<a id='line_4219'>    But first before all other keels did Palinurus lead</a>
<a id='line_4220'>    The close array, and all were charged to have his course in heed.</a>
<a id='line_4221'>    And now the midmost place of heaven had dewy night drawn nigh,</a>
<a id='line_4222'>    And 'neath the oars on benches hard scattered the shipmen lie,</a>
<a id='line_4223'>    Who all the loosened limbs of them to gentle rest had given;</a>
<a id='line_4224'>    When lo, the very light-winged Sleep stooped from the stars of heaven,</a>
<a id='line_4225'>    Thrusting aside the dusky air and cleaving night atwain:</a>
<a id='line_4226'>    The sackless Palinure he sought with evil dreams and vain.           840</a>
<a id='line_4227'>    So on the high poop sat the God as Phorbas fashionèd,</a>
<a id='line_4228'>    And as he sat such-like discourse from out his mouth he shed:</a>
<a id='line_4229'>    "Iasian Palinure, unasked the waves our ship-host bear;</a>
<a id='line_4230'>    Soft blow the breezes steadily; the hour for rest is here:</a>
<a id='line_4231'>    Lay down thine head, steal weary eyes from toil a little space,</a>
<a id='line_4232'>    And I will do thy deeds awhile and hold me in thy place."</a>
<a id='line_4233'></a>
<a id='line_4234'>    But Palinure with scarce-raised eyes e'en such an answer gave:</a>
<a id='line_4235'>    "To gentle countenance of sea and quiet of the wave</a>
<a id='line_4236'>    Deem'st thou me dull? would'st have me trow in such a monster's truth?</a>
<a id='line_4237'>    And shall I mine Æneas trust to lying breeze forsooth,               850</a>
<a id='line_4238'>    I, fool of peaceful heaven and sea so many times of old?"</a>
<a id='line_4239'></a>
<a id='line_4240'>    So saying to the helm he clung, nor ever left his hold,</a>
<a id='line_4241'>    And all the while the stars above his eyen toward them drew.</a>
<a id='line_4242'>    But lo, the God brought forth a bough wet with Lethean dew,</a>
<a id='line_4243'>    And sleepy with the might of Styx, and shook it therewithal</a>
<a id='line_4244'>    Over his brow, and loosed his lids delaying still to fall:</a>
<a id='line_4245'>    But scarce in first of stealthy sleep his limbs all loosened lay,</a>
<a id='line_4246'>    When, weighing on him, did he tear a space of stern away,</a>
<a id='line_4247'>    And rolled him, helm and wrack and all, into the flowing wave</a>
<a id='line_4248'>    Headlong, and crying oft in vain for fellowship to save:             860</a>
<a id='line_4249'>    Then Sleep himself amid thin air flew, borne upon the wing.</a>
<a id='line_4250'></a>
<a id='line_4251'>    No less the ship-host sails the sea, its safe way following</a>
<a id='line_4252'>    Untroubled 'neath the plighted word of Father Neptune's mouth.</a>
<a id='line_4253'>    So to the Sirens' rocks they draw, a dangerous pass forsooth</a>
<a id='line_4254'>    In yore agone, now white with bones of many a perished man.</a>
<a id='line_4255'>    Thence ever roared the salt sea now as on the rocks it ran;</a>
<a id='line_4256'>    And there the Father felt the ship fare wild and fitfully,</a>
<a id='line_4257'>    Her helmsman lost; so he himself steered o'er the night-tide sea,</a>
<a id='line_4258'>    Sore weeping; for his fellow's end his inmost heart did touch:</a>
<a id='line_4259'>    "O Palinure, that trowed the sky and soft seas overmuch,             870</a>
<a id='line_4260'>    Now naked on an unknown shore thy resting-place shall be!"</a>

<a id='line_4268'></a>
<a id='line_4269'>ÆNEAS COMETH TO THE SIBYL OF CUMÆ, AND BY HER IS LED INTO THE</a>
<a id='line_4270'>UNDER-WORLD, AND THERE BEHOLDETH MANY STRANGE THINGS, AND IN THE END</a>
<a id='line_4271'>MEETETH HIS FATHER, ANCHISES, WHO TELLETH HIM OF THE DAYS TO COME.</a>
<a id='line_4272'></a>
<a id='line_4273'></a>
<a id='line_4274'>    So spake he weeping, and his host let loose from every band,</a>
<a id='line_4275'>    Until at last they draw anigh Cumæ's Euboean strand.</a>
<a id='line_4276'>    They turn the bows from off the main; the toothèd anchors' grip</a>
<a id='line_4277'>    Makes fast the keels; the shore is hid by many a curvèd ship.</a>
<a id='line_4278'>    Hot-heart the youthful company leaps on the Westland's shore;</a>
<a id='line_4279'>    Part falleth on to seek them out the seed of fiery store</a>
<a id='line_4280'>    That flint-veins hide; part runneth through the dwellings of the deer,</a>
<a id='line_4281'>    The thicket steads, and each to each the hidden streams they bare.</a>
<a id='line_4282'></a>
<a id='line_4283'>    But good Æneas seeks the house where King Apollo bides,</a>
<a id='line_4284'>    The mighty den, the secret place set far apart, that hides            10</a>
<a id='line_4285'>    The awful Sibyl, whose great soul and heart he seeketh home,</a>
<a id='line_4286'>    The Seer of Delos, showing her the hidden things to come:</a>
<a id='line_4287'>    And so the groves of Trivia and golden house they gain.</a>
<a id='line_4288'></a>
<a id='line_4289'>    Now Dædalus, as tells the tale, fleeing from Minos' reign,</a>
<a id='line_4290'>    Durst trust himself to heaven on wings swift hastening, and swim forth</a>
<a id='line_4291'>    Along the road ne'er tried before unto the chilly north;</a>
<a id='line_4292'>    So light at last o'er Chalcis' towers he hung amid the air,</a>
<a id='line_4293'>    Then, come adown to earth once more, to thee he hallowed here,</a>
<a id='line_4294'>    O Phoebus, all his wingèd oars, and built thee mighty fane:</a>
<a id='line_4295'>    Androgeus' death was on the doors; then paying of the pain            20</a>
<a id='line_4296'>    By those Cecropians; bid, alas, each year to give in turn</a>
<a id='line_4297'>    Seven bodies of their sons;--lo there, the lots drawn from the urn.</a>
<a id='line_4298'>    But facing this the Gnosian land draws up amid the sea:</a>
<a id='line_4299'>    There is the cruel bull-lust wrought, and there Pasiphaë</a>
<a id='line_4300'>    Embraced by guile: the blended babe is there, the twiformed thing,</a>
<a id='line_4301'>    The Minotaur, that evil sign of Venus' cherishing;</a>
<a id='line_4302'>    And there the tangled house and toil that ne'er should be undone:</a>
<a id='line_4303'>    But ruth of Dædalus himself a queen's love-sorrow won,</a>
<a id='line_4304'>    And he himself undid the snare and winding wilderment.</a>
<a id='line_4305'>    Guiding the blind feet with the thread. Thou, Icarus, wert blent      30</a>
<a id='line_4306'>    Full oft with such a work be sure, if grief forbade it not;</a>
<a id='line_4307'>    But twice he tried to shape in gold the picture of thy lot,</a>
<a id='line_4308'>    And twice the father's hands fell down.</a>
<a id='line_4309'></a>
<a id='line_4310'>    Long had their eyes read o'er</a>
<a id='line_4311'>    Such matters, but Achates, now, sent on a while before,</a>
<a id='line_4312'>    Was come with that Deïphobe, the Glaucus' child, the maid</a>
<a id='line_4313'>    Of Phoebus and of Trivia, and such a word she said:</a>
<a id='line_4314'>    "The hour will have no tarrying o'er fair shows for idle eyes;</a>
<a id='line_4315'>    'Twere better from an unyoked herd seven steers to sacrifice,</a>
<a id='line_4316'>    And e'en so many hosts of ewes in manner due culled out."</a>
<a id='line_4317'></a>
<a id='line_4318'>    She spake; her holy bidding then the warriors go about,               40</a>
<a id='line_4319'>    Nor tarry: into temple high she calls the Teucrian men,</a>
<a id='line_4320'>    Where the huge side of Cumæ's rock is carven in a den,</a>
<a id='line_4321'>    Where are an hundred doors to come, an hundred mouths to go,</a>
<a id='line_4322'>    Whence e'en so many awful sounds, the Sibyl's answers flow.</a>
<a id='line_4323'>    But at the threshold cried the maid: "Now is the hour awake</a>
<a id='line_4324'>    For asking--Ah, the God, the God!"</a>
<a id='line_4325'>                                        And as the word she spake</a>
<a id='line_4326'>    Within the door, all suddenly her visage and her hue</a>
<a id='line_4327'>    Were changed, and all her sleekèd hair, and gasping breath she drew,</a>
<a id='line_4328'>    And with the rage her wild heart swelled, and greater was she grown,</a>
<a id='line_4329'>    Nor mortal-voiced; for breath of God upon her heart was blown         50</a>
<a id='line_4330'>    As He drew nigher:</a>
<a id='line_4331'>                        "Art thou dumb of vows and prayers, forsooth,</a>
<a id='line_4332'>    Trojan Æneas, art thou dumb? unprayed, the mighty mouth</a>
<a id='line_4333'>    Of awe-mazed house shall open not."</a>
<a id='line_4334'>                                        Even such a word she said,</a>
<a id='line_4335'>    Then hushed: through hardened Teucrian bones swift ran the chilly dread,</a>
<a id='line_4336'>    And straight the king from inmost heart the flood of prayers doth pour:</a>
<a id='line_4337'>    "Phoebus, who all the woe of Troy hast pitied evermore,</a>
<a id='line_4338'>    Who Dardan shaft and Paris' hands in time agone didst speed</a>
<a id='line_4339'>    Against Achilles' body there, who me withal didst lead</a>
<a id='line_4340'>    Over the seas that go about so many a mighty land,</a>
<a id='line_4341'>    Through those Massylian folks remote, and length of Syrtes' sand,     60</a>
<a id='line_4342'>    Till now I hold that Italy that ever drew aback;</a>
<a id='line_4343'>    And now perchance a Trojan fate we, even we may lack.</a>
<a id='line_4344'>    Ye now, O Gods and Goddesses, to whom a stumbling-stone</a>
<a id='line_4345'>    Was Ilium in the days of old, and Dardan folk's renown,</a>
<a id='line_4346'>    May spare the folk of Pergamus. But thou, O holiest,</a>
<a id='line_4347'>    O Maid that knowest things to come, grant thou the Latin rest</a>
<a id='line_4348'>    To Teucrian men, and Gods of Troy, the straying way-worn powers!</a>
<a id='line_4349'>    For surely now no realm I ask but such as Fate makes ours.</a>
<a id='line_4350'>    To Phoebus and to Trivia then a temple will I raise,</a>
<a id='line_4351'>    A marble world; in Phoebus' name will hallow festal days:           70</a>
<a id='line_4352'>    Thee also in our realm to be full mighty shrines await,</a>
<a id='line_4353'>    There will I set thine holy lots and hidden words of fate</a>
<a id='line_4354'>    Said to my folk, and hallow there well-chosen men for thee,</a>
<a id='line_4355'>    O Holy One: But give thou not thy songs to leaf of tree,</a>
<a id='line_4356'>    Lest made a sport to hurrying gales confusedly they wend;</a>
<a id='line_4357'>    But sing them thou thyself, I pray!"</a>
<a id='line_4358'>                                          Therewith his words had end.</a>
<a id='line_4359'>    Meanwhile the Seer-maid, not yet tamed to Phoebus, raves about</a>
<a id='line_4360'>    The cave, still striving from her breast to cast the godhead out;</a>
<a id='line_4361'>    But yet the more the mighty God her mouth bewildered wears,</a>
<a id='line_4362'>    Taming her wild heart, fashioning her soul with weight of fears.      80</a>
<a id='line_4363'>    At last the hundred mighty doors fly open, touched of none,</a>
<a id='line_4364'>    And on the air the answer floats of that foreseeing one:</a>
<a id='line_4365'></a>
<a id='line_4366'>    "O Thou, who dangers of the sea hast throughly worn away,</a>
<a id='line_4367'>    Abides thee heavier toil of earth: the Dardans on a day</a>
<a id='line_4368'>    Shall come to that Lavinian land,--leave fear thereof afar:</a>
<a id='line_4369'>    Yet of their coming shall they rue. Lo, war, war, dreadful war!</a>
<a id='line_4370'>    And Tiber bearing plenteous blood upon his foaming back.</a>
<a id='line_4371'>    Nor Simoïs there, nor Xanthus' stream, nor Dorian camp shall lack:</a>
<a id='line_4372'>    Yea, once again in Latin land Achilles is brought forth,</a>
<a id='line_4373'>    God-born no less: nor evermore shall mighty Juno's wrath              90</a>
<a id='line_4374'>    Fail Teucrian men. Ah, how shalt thou, fallen on evil days,</a>
<a id='line_4375'>    To all Italian lands and folks thine hands beseeching raise!</a>
<a id='line_4376'>    Lo, once again a stranger bride brings woeful days on Troy,</a>
<a id='line_4377'>    Once more the wedding of a foe.</a>
<a id='line_4378'>    But thou, yield not to any ill, but set thy face, and wend</a>
<a id='line_4379'>    The bolder where thy fortune leads; the dawn of perils' end,</a>
<a id='line_4380'>    Whence least thou mightest look for it, from Greekish folk shall come."</a>
<a id='line_4381'></a>
<a id='line_4382'>    Suchwise the Seer of Cumæ sang from out her inner home</a>
<a id='line_4383'>    The dreadful double words, wherewith the cavern moans again,</a>
<a id='line_4384'>    As sooth amid the mirk she winds: Apollo shakes the rein             100</a>
<a id='line_4385'>    Over the maddened one, and stirs the strings about her breast;</a>
<a id='line_4386'>    But when her fury lulled awhile and maddened mouth had rest,</a>
<a id='line_4387'>    Hero Æneas thus began:</a>
<a id='line_4388'>                            "No face of any care,</a>
<a id='line_4389'>    O maiden, can arise on me in any wise unware:</a>
<a id='line_4390'>    Yea, all have I forecast; my mind hath worn through everything.</a>
<a id='line_4391'>    One prayer I pray, since this they call the gateway of the King</a>
<a id='line_4392'>    Of Nether-earth, and Acheron's o'erflow this mirky mere:</a>
<a id='line_4393'>    O let me meet the eyes and mouth of my dead father dear;</a>
<a id='line_4394'>    O open me the holy gate, and teach me where to go!</a>
<a id='line_4395'>    I bore him on these shoulders once from midmost of the foe,          110</a>
<a id='line_4396'>    From flame and weapons thousandfold against our goings bent;</a>
<a id='line_4397'>    My yoke-fellow upon the road o'er every sea he went,</a>
<a id='line_4398'>    'Gainst every threat of sea and sky a hardy heart he held,</a>
<a id='line_4399'>    Though worn and feeble past decay and feebleness of eld.</a>
<a id='line_4400'>    Yea, he it was who bade me wend, a suppliant, to thy door,</a>
<a id='line_4401'>    And seek thee out: O holy one, cast thou thy pity o'er</a>
<a id='line_4402'>    Father and son! All things thou canst, nor yet hath Hecaté</a>
<a id='line_4403'>    Set thee to rule Avernus' woods an empty Queen to be.</a>
<a id='line_4404'>    Yea, Orpheus wrought with Thracian harp and strings of tuneful might</a>
<a id='line_4405'>    To draw away his perished love from midmost of the night.            120</a>
<a id='line_4406'>    Yea, Pollux, dying turn for turn, his brother borrowed well,</a>
<a id='line_4407'>    And went and came the road full oft--Of Theseus shall I tell?</a>
<a id='line_4408'>    Or great Alcides? Ah, I too from highest Jove am sprung."</a>
<a id='line_4409'></a>
<a id='line_4410'>    Such were the words he prayed withal and round the altars clung:</a>
<a id='line_4411'>    Then she fell speaking:</a>
<a id='line_4412'>                            "Man of Troy, from blood of Godhead grown,</a>
<a id='line_4413'>    Anchises' child, Avernus' road is easy faring down;</a>
<a id='line_4414'>    All day and night is open wide the door of Dis the black;</a>
<a id='line_4415'>    But thence to gain the upper air, and win the footsteps back,</a>
<a id='line_4416'>    This is the deed, this is the toil: Some few have had the might,</a>
<a id='line_4417'>    Beloved by Jove the just, upborne to heaven by valour's light,       130</a>
<a id='line_4418'>    The Sons of God. 'Twixt it and us great thicket fills the place</a>
<a id='line_4419'>    That slow Cocytus' mirky folds all round about embrace;</a>
<a id='line_4420'>    But if such love be in thine heart, such yearning in thee lie,</a>
<a id='line_4421'>    To swim twice o'er the Stygian mere and twice to see with eye</a>
<a id='line_4422'>    Black Tartarus, and thou must needs this idle labour win,</a>
<a id='line_4423'>    Hearken what first there is to do: the dusky tree within</a>
<a id='line_4424'>    Lurks the gold bough with golden leaves and limber twigs of gold,</a>
<a id='line_4425'>    To nether Juno consecrate; this all these woods enfold,</a>
<a id='line_4426'>    Dim shadowy places cover it amid the hollow dale;</a>
<a id='line_4427'>    To come unto the under-world none living may avail                    140</a>
<a id='line_4428'>    Till he that growth of golden locks from off the tree hath shorn;</a>
<a id='line_4429'>    For this fair Proserpine ordained should evermore be borne</a>
<a id='line_4430'>    Her very gift: but, plucked away, still faileth not the thing,</a>
<a id='line_4431'>    Another golden stem instead hath leafy tide of spring.</a>
<a id='line_4432'>    So throughly search with eyes: thine hand aright upon it lay</a>
<a id='line_4433'>    When thou hast found: for easily 'twill yield and come away</a>
<a id='line_4434'>    If the Fates call thee: otherwise no might may overbear</a>
<a id='line_4435'>    Its will, nor with the hardened steel the marvel mayst thou shear.</a>
<a id='line_4436'></a>
<a id='line_4437'>    --Ah! further,--of thy perished friend as yet thou nothing know'st,</a>
<a id='line_4438'>    Whose body lying dead and cold defileth all thine host,              150</a>
<a id='line_4439'>    While thou beseechest answering words, and hangest on our door:</a>
<a id='line_4440'>    Go, bring him to his own abode and heap the grave mound o'er;</a>
<a id='line_4441'>    Bring forth the black-wooled ewes to be first bringing back of grace:</a>
<a id='line_4442'>    So shalt thou see the Stygian groves, so shalt thou see the place</a>
<a id='line_4443'>    That hath no road for living men."</a>
<a id='line_4444'>                                        So hushed her mouth shut close:</a>
<a id='line_4445'>    But sad-faced and with downcast eyes therefrom Æneas goes,</a>
<a id='line_4446'>    And leaves the cave, still turning o'er those coming things, so dim,</a>
<a id='line_4447'>    So dark to see. Achates fares nigh fellow unto him,</a>
<a id='line_4448'>    And ever 'neath like load of cares he lets his footsteps fall:</a>
<a id='line_4449'>    And many diverse words they cast each unto each withal,              160</a>
<a id='line_4450'>    What was the dead friend and the grave whereof the seer did teach.</a>
<a id='line_4451'>    But when they gat them down at last upon the barren beach,</a>
<a id='line_4452'>    They saw Misenus lying dead by death but lightly earned;</a>
<a id='line_4453'>    Misenus, son of Æolus; no man more nobly learned</a>
<a id='line_4454'>    In waking up the war with brass and singing Mars alight.</a>
<a id='line_4455'>    Great Hector's fellow was he erst, with Hector through the fight</a>
<a id='line_4456'>    He thrust, by horn made glorious, made glorious by the spear.</a>
<a id='line_4457'>    But when from Hector life and all Achilles' hand did tear,</a>
<a id='line_4458'>    Dardan Æneas' man became that mightiest under shield,</a>
<a id='line_4459'>    Nor unto any worser lord his fellowship would yield.                 170</a>
<a id='line_4460'>    Now while by chance through hollow shell he blew across the sea,</a>
<a id='line_4461'>    And witless called the very Gods his singing-foes to be,</a>
<a id='line_4462'>    The envious Triton caught him up, if ye the tale may trow,</a>
<a id='line_4463'>    And sank the hero 'twixt the rocks in foaming waters' flow.</a>
<a id='line_4464'>    Wherefore about him weeping sore were gathered all the men,</a>
<a id='line_4465'>    And good Æneas chief of all: the Sibyl's bidding then</a>
<a id='line_4466'>    Weeping they speed, and loiter not, but heap the tree-boughs high</a>
<a id='line_4467'>    Upon the altar of the dead to raise it to the sky:</a>
<a id='line_4468'>    Then to the ancient wood they fare, high dwelling of wild things;</a>
<a id='line_4469'>    They fell the pine, and 'neath the axe the smitten holm-oak rings;   180</a>
<a id='line_4470'>    With wedge they cleave the ashen logs, and knitted oaken bole,</a>
<a id='line_4471'>    Full fain to split; and mighty elms down from the mountains roll.</a>
<a id='line_4472'></a>
<a id='line_4473'>    Amid the work Æneas is, who hearteneth on his folk,</a>
<a id='line_4474'>    As with such very tools as they he girds him for the stroke;</a>
<a id='line_4475'>    But through the sorrow of his heart such thought as this there strays,</a>
<a id='line_4476'>    And looking toward the waste of wood such word as this he prays:</a>
<a id='line_4477'>    "O if that very golden bough would show upon the tree,</a>
<a id='line_4478'>    In such a thicket and so great; since all she told of thee,</a>
<a id='line_4479'>    The seer-maid, O Misenus lost, was true and overtrue!"</a>
<a id='line_4480'></a>
<a id='line_4481'>    But scarcely had he spoken thus, when lo, from heaven there flew     190</a>
<a id='line_4482'>    Two doves before his very eyes, who settled fluttering</a>
<a id='line_4483'>    On the green grass: and therewithal that mightiest battle-king</a>
<a id='line_4484'>    Knoweth his mother's birds new-come, and joyful poureth prayer:</a>
<a id='line_4485'>    "O, if a way there be at all, lead ye amid the air,</a>
<a id='line_4486'>    Lead on unto the thicket place where o'er the wealthy soil</a>
<a id='line_4487'>    The rich bough casteth shadow down! Fail not my eyeless toil,</a>
<a id='line_4488'>    O Goddess-mother!"</a>
<a id='line_4489'>                        So he saith, and stays his feet to heed</a>
<a id='line_4490'>    What token they may bring to him, and whitherward they speed.</a>
<a id='line_4491'>    So on they flutter pasturing, with such a space between,</a>
<a id='line_4492'>    As they by eyes of following folk may scantly well be seen;          200</a>
<a id='line_4493'>    But when Avernus' jaws at last, the noisome place, they reach,</a>
<a id='line_4494'>    They rise aloft and skim the air, and settle each by each</a>
<a id='line_4495'>    Upon the very wished-for place, yea high amid the tree,</a>
<a id='line_4496'>    Where the changed light through twigs of gold shines forth diversedly;</a>
<a id='line_4497'>    As in the woods mid winter's chill puts forth the mistletoe,</a>
<a id='line_4498'>    And bloometh with a leafage strange his own tree ne'er did sow,</a>
<a id='line_4499'>    And with his yellow children hath the rounded trunk in hold,</a>
<a id='line_4500'>    So in the dusky holm-oak seemed that bough of leafy gold,</a>
<a id='line_4501'>    As through the tinkling shaken foil the gentle wind went by:</a>
<a id='line_4502'>    Then straight Æneas caught and culled the tough stem greedily,       210</a>
<a id='line_4503'>    And to the Sibyl's dwelling-place the gift in hand he bore.</a>
<a id='line_4504'></a>
<a id='line_4505'>    Nor less meanwhile the Teucrians weep Misenus on the shore,</a>
<a id='line_4506'>    And do last service to the dead that hath no thanks to pay.</a>
<a id='line_4507'>    And first fat fagots of the fir and oaken logs they lay,</a>
<a id='line_4508'>    And pile a mighty bale and rich, and weave the dusk-leaved trees</a>
<a id='line_4509'>    Between its sides, and set before the funeral cypresses,</a>
<a id='line_4510'>    And over all in seemly wise the gleaming weapons pile:</a>
<a id='line_4511'>    But some speed fire bewavèd brass and water's warmth meanwhile,</a>
<a id='line_4512'>    And wash all o'er and sleek with oil the cold corpse of the dead:</a>
<a id='line_4513'>    Goes up the wail; the limbs bewept they streak upon the bed,         220</a>
<a id='line_4514'>    And cast thereon the purple cloths, the well-known noble gear.</a>
<a id='line_4515'>    Then some of them, they shoulder up the mighty-fashioned bier,</a>
<a id='line_4516'>    Sad service! and put forth the torch with faces from him turned,</a>
<a id='line_4517'>    In fashion of the fathers old: there the heaped offerings burned,</a>
<a id='line_4518'>    The frankincense, the dainty meats, the bowls o'erflowed with oil.</a>
<a id='line_4519'>    But when the ashes were sunk down and fire had rest from toil,</a>
<a id='line_4520'>    The relics and the thirsty ash with unmixed wine they wet.</a>
<a id='line_4521'>    Then the gleaned bones in brazen urn doth Corynæus set,</a>
<a id='line_4522'>    Who thrice about the gathered folk the stainless water bore.</a>
<a id='line_4523'>    As from the fruitful olive-bough light dew he sprinkled o'er,        230</a>
<a id='line_4524'>    And cleansed the men, and spake withal last farewell to the dead.</a>
<a id='line_4525'>    But good Æneas raised a tomb, a mound huge fashionèd,</a>
<a id='line_4526'>    And laid thereon the hero's arms and oar and battle-horn,</a>
<a id='line_4527'>    Beneath an airy hill that thence Misenus' name hath borne,</a>
<a id='line_4528'>    And still shall bear it, not to die till time hath faded out.</a>
<a id='line_4529'></a>
<a id='line_4530'>    This done, those deeds the Sibyl bade he setteth swift about:</a>
<a id='line_4531'>    A deep den is there, pebble-piled, with mouth that gapeth wide;</a>
<a id='line_4532'>    Black mere and thicket shadowy-mirk the secret of it hide.</a>
<a id='line_4533'>    And over it no fowl there is may wend upon the wing</a>
<a id='line_4534'>    And 'scape the bane; its blackened jaws bring forth such venoming.   240</a>
<a id='line_4535'>    Such is the breath it bears aloft unto the hollow heaven;</a>
<a id='line_4536'>    So to the place the Greekish folk have name of Fowl-less given.</a>
<a id='line_4537'></a>
<a id='line_4538'>    Here, first of all, four black-skinned steers the priestess sets in line,</a>
<a id='line_4539'>    And on the foreheads of all these out-pours the bowl of wine.</a>
<a id='line_4540'>    Then 'twixt the horns she culleth out the topmost of the hair,</a>
<a id='line_4541'>    And lays it on the holy fire, the first-fruits offered there,</a>
<a id='line_4542'>    And cries aloud on Hecaté, of might in heaven and hell;</a>
<a id='line_4543'>    While others lay the knife to throat and catch the blood that fell</a>
<a id='line_4544'>    Warm in the bowls: Æneas then an ewe-lamb black of fleece</a>
<a id='line_4545'>    Smites down with sword to her that bore the dread Eumenides,         250</a>
<a id='line_4546'>    And her great sister; and a cow yet barren slays aright</a>
<a id='line_4547'>    To thee, O Proserpine, and rears the altars of the night</a>
<a id='line_4548'>    Unto the Stygian King, and lays whole bulls upon the flame,</a>
<a id='line_4549'>    Pouring rich oil upon the flesh that rush of fire o'ercame.</a>
<a id='line_4550'></a>
<a id='line_4551'>    But now, when sunrise is at hand, and dawning of the day,</a>
<a id='line_4552'>    The earth falls moaning 'neath their feet, the wooded ridges sway,</a>
<a id='line_4553'>    And dogs seem howling through the dusk as now she drew anear</a>
<a id='line_4554'>    The Goddess. "O be far away, ye unclean!" cries the seer.</a>
<a id='line_4555'>    "Be far away! ah, get ye gone from all the holy wood!</a>
<a id='line_4556'>    But thou, Æneas, draw thy steel and take thee to the road;           260</a>
<a id='line_4557'>    Now needeth all thine hardihood and steadfast heart and brave."</a>
<a id='line_4558'></a>
<a id='line_4559'>    She spake, and wildly cast herself amidst the hollow cave,</a>
<a id='line_4560'>    But close upon her fearless feet Æneas followeth.</a>
<a id='line_4561'></a>
<a id='line_4562'>    O Gods, who rule the ghosts of men, O silent shades of death,</a>
<a id='line_4563'>    Chaos and Phlegethon, hushed lands that lie beneath the night!</a>
<a id='line_4564'>    Let me speak now, for I have heard: O aid me with your might</a>
<a id='line_4565'>    To open things deep sunk in earth, and mid the darkness blent.</a>
<a id='line_4566'></a>
<a id='line_4567'>    All dim amid the lonely night on through the dusk they went,</a>
<a id='line_4568'>    On through the empty house of Dis, the land of nought at all.</a>
<a id='line_4569'>    E'en as beneath the doubtful moon, when niggard light doth fall      270</a>
<a id='line_4570'>    Upon some way amid the woods, when God hath hidden heaven,</a>
<a id='line_4571'>    And black night from the things of earth the colours dear hath driven.</a>
<a id='line_4572'></a>
<a id='line_4573'>    Lo, in the first of Orcus' jaws, close to the doorway side,</a>
<a id='line_4574'>    The Sorrows and Avenging Griefs have set their beds to bide;</a>
<a id='line_4575'>    There the pale kin of Sickness dwells, and Eld, the woeful thing,</a>
<a id='line_4576'>    And Fear, and squalid-fashioned Lack, and witless Hungering,</a>
<a id='line_4577'>    Shapes terrible to see with eye; and Toil of Men, and Death,</a>
<a id='line_4578'>    And Sleep, Death's brother, and the Lust of Soul that sickeneth:</a>
<a id='line_4579'>    And War, the death-bearer, was set full in the threshold's way,</a>
<a id='line_4580'>    And those Well-willers' iron beds: there heartless Discord lay,      280</a>
<a id='line_4581'>    Whose viper-breeding hair about was bloody-filleted.</a>
<a id='line_4582'></a>
<a id='line_4583'>    But in the midst a mighty elm, dusk as the night, outspread</a>
<a id='line_4584'>    Its immemorial boughs and limbs, where lying dreams there lurk,</a>
<a id='line_4585'>    As tells the tale, still clinging close 'neath every leaf-side mirk.</a>
<a id='line_4586'>    Withal most wondrous, many-shaped are all the wood-beasts there;</a>
<a id='line_4587'>    The Centaurs stable by the porch, and twi-shaped Scyllas fare,</a>
<a id='line_4588'>    And hundred-folded Briareus, and Lerna's Worm of dread</a>
<a id='line_4589'>    Fell hissing; and Chimæra's length and fire-behelmèd head,</a>
<a id='line_4590'>    Gorgons and Harpies, and the shape of that three-bodied Shade.</a>
<a id='line_4591'>    Then smitten by a sudden fear Æneas caught his blade,                290</a>
<a id='line_4592'>    And turned the naked point and edge against their drawing nigh;</a>
<a id='line_4593'>    And but for her wise word that these were thin lives flitting by</a>
<a id='line_4594'>    All bodiless, and wrapped about in hollow shape and vain,</a>
<a id='line_4595'>    With idle sword had he set on to cleave the ghosts atwain.</a>
<a id='line_4596'></a>
<a id='line_4597'>    To Acheron of Tartarus from hence the road doth go,</a>
<a id='line_4598'>    That mire-bemingled, whirling wild, rolls on his desert flow,</a>
<a id='line_4599'>    And all amid Cocytus' flood casteth his world of sand.</a>
<a id='line_4600'>    This flood and river's ferrying doth Charon take in hand,</a>
<a id='line_4601'>    Dread in his squalor: on his chin untrimmed the hoar hair lies</a>
<a id='line_4602'>    Most plenteous; and unchanging flame bides in his staring eyes:      300</a>
<a id='line_4603'>    Down from his shoulders hangs his gear in filthy knot upknit;</a>
<a id='line_4604'>    And he himself poles on his ship, and tends the sails of it,</a>
<a id='line_4605'>    And crawls with load of bodies lost in bark all iron-grey,</a>
<a id='line_4606'>    Grown old by now: but fresh and green is godhead's latter day.</a>
<a id='line_4607'></a>
<a id='line_4608'>    Down thither rushed a mighty crowd, unto the flood-side borne;</a>
<a id='line_4609'>    Mothers and men, and bodies there with all the life outworn</a>
<a id='line_4610'>    Of great-souled heroes; many a boy and never-wedded maid,</a>
<a id='line_4611'>    And youths before their fathers' eyes upon the death-bale laid:</a>
<a id='line_4612'>    As many as the leaves fall down in first of autumn cold;</a>
<a id='line_4613'>    As many as the gathered fowl press on to field and fold,             310</a>
<a id='line_4614'>    From off the weltering ocean-flood, when the late year and chill</a>
<a id='line_4615'>    Hath driven them across the sea the sunny lands to fill.</a>
<a id='line_4616'></a>
<a id='line_4617'>    There stood the first and prayed him hard to waft their bodies o'er,</a>
<a id='line_4618'>    With hands stretched out for utter love of that far-lying shore.</a>
<a id='line_4619'>    But that grim sailor now takes these, now those from out the band,</a>
<a id='line_4620'>    While all the others far away he thrusteth from the sand.</a>
<a id='line_4621'></a>
<a id='line_4622'>    Æneas wondered at the press, and moved thereby he spoke:</a>
<a id='line_4623'>    "Say, Maid, what means this river-side, and gathering of the folk?</a>
<a id='line_4624'>    What seek the souls, and why must some depart the river's rim,</a>
<a id='line_4625'>    While others with the sweep of oars the leaden waters skim?"         320</a>
<a id='line_4626'></a>
<a id='line_4627'>    Thereon the ancient Maid of Days in few words answered thus:</a>
<a id='line_4628'>    "Anchises' seed, thou very child of Godhead glorious,</a>
<a id='line_4629'>    Thou seest the deep Cocytus' pools, thou seest the Stygian mere,</a>
<a id='line_4630'>    By whose might Gods will take the oath, and all forswearing fear:</a>
<a id='line_4631'>    But all the wretched crowd thou seest are they that lack a grave,</a>
<a id='line_4632'>    And Charon is the ferryman: those borne across the wave</a>
<a id='line_4633'>    Are buried: none may ever cross the awful roaring road</a>
<a id='line_4634'>    Until their bones are laid at rest within their last abode.</a>
<a id='line_4635'>    An hundred years they stray about and wander round the shore,</a>
<a id='line_4636'>    Then they at last have grace to gain the pools desired so sore."     330</a>
<a id='line_4637'></a>
<a id='line_4638'>    There tarried then Anchises' child and stayed awhile his feet,</a>
<a id='line_4639'>    Mid many thoughts, and sore at heart, for such a doom unmeet:</a>
<a id='line_4640'>    And there he saw all sorrowful, without the death-dues dead,</a>
<a id='line_4641'>    Leucaspis, and Orontes, he that Lycian ship-host led;</a>
<a id='line_4642'>    Whom, borne from Troy o'er windy plain, the South wind utterly</a>
<a id='line_4643'>    O'erwhelming, sank him, ships and men, in swallow of the sea.</a>
<a id='line_4644'>    And lo ye now, where Palinure the helmsman draweth nigh,</a>
<a id='line_4645'>    Who lately on the Libyan sea, noting the starry sky,</a>
<a id='line_4646'>    Fell from the high poop headlong down mid wavy waters cast.</a>
<a id='line_4647'>    His sad face through the plenteous dusk Æneas knew at last,          340</a>
<a id='line_4648'>    And spake:</a>
<a id='line_4649'>                "What God, O Palinure, did snatch thee so away</a>
<a id='line_4650'>    From us thy friends and drown thee dead amidst the watery way?</a>
<a id='line_4651'>    Speak out! for Seer Apollo, found no guileful prophet erst,</a>
<a id='line_4652'>    By this one answer in my soul a lying hope hath nursed;</a>
<a id='line_4653'>    Who sang of thee safe from the deep and gaining field and fold</a>
<a id='line_4654'>    Of fair Ausonia: suchwise he his plighted word doth hold!"</a>
<a id='line_4655'></a>
<a id='line_4656'>    The other spake: "Apollo's shrine in nowise lied to thee,</a>
<a id='line_4657'>    King of Anchises, and no God hath drowned me in the sea:</a>
<a id='line_4658'>    But while I clung unto the helm, its guard ordained of right,</a>
<a id='line_4659'>    And steered thee on, I chanced to fall, and so by very might         350</a>
<a id='line_4660'>    Seaward I dragged it down with me. By the rough seas I swear</a>
<a id='line_4661'>    My heart, for any hap of mine, had no so great a fear</a>
<a id='line_4662'>    As for thy ship; lest, rudderless, its master from it torn,</a>
<a id='line_4663'>    Amid so great o'ertoppling seas it yet might fail forlorn.</a>
<a id='line_4664'>    Three nights of storm I drifted on, 'neath wind and water's might,</a>
<a id='line_4665'>    Over the sea-plain measureless; but with the fourth day's light</a>
<a id='line_4666'>    There saw I Italy rise up from welter of the wave.</a>
<a id='line_4667'>    Then slow I swam unto the land, that me well-nigh did save,</a>
<a id='line_4668'>    But fell the cruel folk on me, heavy with raiment wet,</a>
<a id='line_4669'>    And striving with my hookèd hands hold on the rocks to get:          360</a>
<a id='line_4670'>    The fools, they took me for a prey, and steel against me bore.</a>
<a id='line_4671'>    Now the waves have me, and the winds on sea-beach roll me o'er.</a>
<a id='line_4672'>    But by the breath of heaven above, by daylight's joyous ways,</a>
<a id='line_4673'>    By thine own father, by the hope of young Iulus' days,</a>
<a id='line_4674'>    Snatch me, O dauntless, from these woes, and o'er me cast the earth!</a>
<a id='line_4675'>    As well thou may'st when thou once more hast gained the Veline firth.</a>
<a id='line_4676'>    Or if a way there be, if way thy Goddess-mother show,--</a>
<a id='line_4677'>    For not without the will of Gods meseemeth wouldst thou go</a>
<a id='line_4678'>    O'er so great floods, or have a mind to swim the Stygian mere,--</a>
<a id='line_4679'>    Then give thine hand, and o'er the wave me woeful with thee bear,    370</a>
<a id='line_4680'>    That I at least in quiet place may rest when I am dead."</a>
<a id='line_4681'></a>
<a id='line_4682'>    So spake he, but the priestess straight such word unto him said:</a>
<a id='line_4683'>    "O Palinure, what godless mind hath gotten hold of thee,</a>
<a id='line_4684'>    That thou the grim Well-willers' stream and Stygian flood wouldst see</a>
<a id='line_4685'>    Unburied, and unbidden still the brim wilt draw anear?</a>
<a id='line_4686'>    Hope not the Fates of very God to change by any prayer.</a>
<a id='line_4687'>    But take this memory of my words to soothe thy wretched case:</a>
<a id='line_4688'>    Through all their cities far and wide the people of the place,</a>
<a id='line_4689'>    Driven by mighty signs from heaven, thy bones shall expiate</a>
<a id='line_4690'>    And raise thee tomb, and year by year with worship on thee wait;     380</a>
<a id='line_4691'>    And there the name of Palinure shall dwell eternally."</a>
<a id='line_4692'></a>
<a id='line_4693'>    So at that word his trouble lulled, his grief of heart passed by,</a>
<a id='line_4694'>    A little while he joyed to think of land that bore his name.</a>
<a id='line_4695'></a>
<a id='line_4696'>    So forth upon their way they went and toward the river came;</a>
<a id='line_4697'>    But when from Stygian wave their path the shipman's gaze did meet,</a>
<a id='line_4698'>    As through the dead hush of the grove shoreward they turned their feet,</a>
<a id='line_4699'>    He fell upon them first with words and unbid chided them:</a>
<a id='line_4700'></a>
<a id='line_4701'>    "Whoe'er ye be who come in arms unto our river's hem,</a>
<a id='line_4702'>    Say what ye be! yea, speak from thence and stay your steps forthright!</a>
<a id='line_4703'>    This is the very place of shades, and sleep, and sleepful night;     390</a>
<a id='line_4704'>    And living bodies am I banned in Stygian keel to bear.</a>
<a id='line_4705'>    Nor soothly did I gain a joy, giving Alcides fare,</a>
<a id='line_4706'>    Or ferrying of Pirithoüs and Theseus time agone,</a>
<a id='line_4707'>    Though come of God they were and matched in valiancy of none:</a>
<a id='line_4708'>    He sought the guard of Tartarus chains on his limbs to lay,</a>
<a id='line_4709'>    And from the King's own seat he dragged the quaking beast away:</a>
<a id='line_4710'>    Those strove to carry off the Queen from great Dis' very bed."</a>
<a id='line_4711'></a>
<a id='line_4712'>    The Amphrysian prophet answering, few words unto him said:</a>
<a id='line_4713'>    "But here are no such guiles as this, so let thy wrath go by:</a>
<a id='line_4714'>    Our weapons bear no war; for us still shall the door-ward lie        400</a>
<a id='line_4715'>    And bark in den, and fright the ghosts, the bloodless, evermore:</a>
<a id='line_4716'>    Nor shall chaste Proserpine for us pass through her kinsman's door:</a>
<a id='line_4717'>    Trojan Æneas, great in arms and great in godly grace,</a>
<a id='line_4718'>    Goes down through dark of Erebus to see his father's face.</a>
<a id='line_4719'>    But if such guise of piety may move thine heart no whit,</a>
<a id='line_4720'>    At least this bough "--(bared from her weed therewith she showeth it)--</a>
<a id='line_4721'>    "Know ye!"</a>
<a id='line_4722'>                Then in his swelling heart adown the anger sank,</a>
<a id='line_4723'>    Nor spake he more; but wondering at that gift a God might thank,</a>
<a id='line_4724'>    The fateful stem, now seen once more so long a time worn by,</a>
<a id='line_4725'>    He turned about his coal-blue keel and drew the bank anigh           410</a>
<a id='line_4726'>    The souls upon the long thwarts set therewith he thrusteth out,</a>
<a id='line_4727'>    And clears the gangway, and withal takes in his hollow boat</a>
<a id='line_4728'>    The huge Æneas, 'neath whose weight the seamed boat groans and creaks,</a>
<a id='line_4729'>    And plenteous water of the mere lets in at many leaks.</a>
<a id='line_4730'>    At last the Hero and the Maid safe o'er the watery way</a>
<a id='line_4731'>    He leaveth on the ugly mire and sedge of sorry grey.</a>
<a id='line_4732'></a>
<a id='line_4733'>    The three-mouthed bark of Cerberus here filleth all the place,</a>
<a id='line_4734'>    As huge he lieth in a den that hath them full in face:</a>
<a id='line_4735'>    But when the adders she beheld upon his crest upborne,</a>
<a id='line_4736'>    A sleepy morsel honey-steeped, and blent of wizards' corn,           420</a>
<a id='line_4737'>    She cast him: then his threefold throat, all wild with hunger's lack,</a>
<a id='line_4738'>    He opened wide, and caught at it, and sank his monstrous back,</a>
<a id='line_4739'>    And there he lay upon the earth enormous through the cave.</a>
<a id='line_4740'>    Æneas caught upon the pass the door-ward's slumber gave,</a>
<a id='line_4741'>    And fled the bank of that sad stream no man may pass again.</a>
<a id='line_4742'>    And many sounds they heard therewith, a wailing vast and vain;</a>
<a id='line_4743'>    For weeping souls of speechless babes round the first threshold lay,</a>
<a id='line_4744'>    Whom, without share of life's delight, snatched from the breast away,</a>
<a id='line_4745'>    The black day hurried off, and all in bitter ending hid.</a>
<a id='line_4746'>    And next were those condemned to die for deed they never did:        430</a>
<a id='line_4747'>    For neither doom nor judge nor house may any lack in death:</a>
<a id='line_4748'>    The seeker Minos shakes the urn, and ever summoneth</a>
<a id='line_4749'>    The hushed-ones' court, and learns men's lives and what against them stands.</a>
<a id='line_4750'></a>
<a id='line_4751'>    The next place is of woeful ones, who sackless, with their hands</a>
<a id='line_4752'>    Compassed their death, and weary-sick of light without avail</a>
<a id='line_4753'>    Cast life away; but now how fain to bear the poor man's bale</a>
<a id='line_4754'>    Beneath the heaven, the uttermost of weary toil to bear!</a>
<a id='line_4755'>    But law forbiddeth: the sad wave of that unlovely mere</a>
<a id='line_4756'>    Is changeless bond; and ninefold Styx compelleth to abide.</a>
<a id='line_4757'>    Nor far from thence behold the meads far spread on every side,       440</a>
<a id='line_4758'>    The Mourning Meads--in tale have they such very name and sign.</a>
<a id='line_4759'>    There those whom hard love ate away with cruel wasting pine</a>
<a id='line_4760'>    Are hidden in the lonely paths with myrtle-groves about,</a>
<a id='line_4761'>    Nor in the very death itself may wear their trouble out:</a>
<a id='line_4762'>    Phædra he saw, Procris he saw, and Eriphyle sad.</a>
<a id='line_4763'>    Baring that cruel offspring's wound her loving body had:</a>
<a id='line_4764'>    Evadne and Pasiphaë, Laodamia there</a>
<a id='line_4765'>    He saw, and Cænis, once a youth and then a maiden fair,</a>
<a id='line_4766'>    And shifted by the deed of fate to his old shape again.</a>
<a id='line_4767'></a>
<a id='line_4768'>    Midst whom Phoenician Dido now, fresh from the iron bane,            450</a>
<a id='line_4769'>    Went wandering in the mighty wood: and when the Trojan man</a>
<a id='line_4770'>    First dimly knew her standing by amid the glimmer wan</a>
<a id='line_4771'>    --E'en as in earliest of the month one sees the moon arise,</a>
<a id='line_4772'>    Or seems to see her at the least in cloudy drift of skies--</a>
<a id='line_4773'>    He spake, and let the tears fall down by all love's sweetness stirred:</a>
<a id='line_4774'>    "Unhappy Dido, was it true, that bitter following word,</a>
<a id='line_4775'>    That thou wert dead, by sword hadst sought the utter end of all?</a>
<a id='line_4776'>    Was it thy very death I wrought? Ah! on the stars I call,</a>
<a id='line_4777'>    I call the Gods and whatso faith the nether earth may hold,</a>
<a id='line_4778'>    To witness that against my will I left thy field and fold!           460</a>
<a id='line_4779'>    But that same bidding of the Gods, whereby e'en now I wend</a>
<a id='line_4780'>    Through dark, through deserts rusty-rough, through night without an end,</a>
<a id='line_4781'>    Drave me with doom. Nor held my heart in anywise belief</a>
<a id='line_4782'>    That my departure from thy land might work thee such a grief.</a>
<a id='line_4783'>    O stay thy feet! nor tear thyself from my beholding thus.</a>
<a id='line_4784'>    Whom fleest thou? this word is all that Fate shall give to us."</a>
<a id='line_4785'></a>
<a id='line_4786'>    Such were the words Æneas spake to soothe her as she stood</a>
<a id='line_4787'>    With stern eyes flaming, while his heart swelled with the woeful flood:</a>
<a id='line_4788'>    But, turned away, her sick eyes still she fixed upon the earth;</a>
<a id='line_4789'>    Nor was her face moved any more by all his sad words' birth          470</a>
<a id='line_4790'>    Than if Marpesian crag or flint had held her image so:</a>
<a id='line_4791'>    At last she flung herself away, and fled, his utter foe,</a>
<a id='line_4792'>    Unto the shady wood, where he, her husband of old days,</a>
<a id='line_4793'>    Gives grief for grief, and loving heart beside her loving lays.</a>
<a id='line_4794'>    Nor less Æneas, smitten sore by her unworthy woes,</a>
<a id='line_4795'>    With tears and pity followeth her as far away she goes.</a>
<a id='line_4796'></a>
<a id='line_4797'>    But thence the meted way they wear, and reach the outer field,</a>
<a id='line_4798'>    Where dwell apart renownèd men, the mighty under shield:</a>
<a id='line_4799'>    There Tydeus meets him; there he sees the great fight-glorious man,</a>
<a id='line_4800'>    Parthenopæus; there withal Adrastus' image wan;                      480</a>
<a id='line_4801'>    And there the Dardans battle-slain, for whom the wailing went</a>
<a id='line_4802'>    To very heaven: their long array he saw with sad lament:</a>
<a id='line_4803'>    Glaucus and Medon there he saw, Thersilochus, the three</a>
<a id='line_4804'>    Antenor-sons, and Polyphoete, by Ceres' mystery</a>
<a id='line_4805'>    Made holy, and Idæus still in car with armèd hand:</a>
<a id='line_4806'>    There on the right side and the left the straying spirits stand.</a>
<a id='line_4807'>    Nor is one sight of him enough; it joyeth them to stay</a>
<a id='line_4808'>    And pace beside, asking for why he wendeth such a way.</a>
<a id='line_4809'>    But when the lords of Danaan folk, and Agamemnon's hosts,</a>
<a id='line_4810'>    Behold the man and gleaming arms amid the dusky ghosts,              490</a>
<a id='line_4811'>    They fall a-quaking full of fear: some turn their back to fly</a>
<a id='line_4812'>    As erst they ran unto the ships; some raise a quavering cry,</a>
<a id='line_4813'>    But never from their gaping vain will swell the shout begun.</a>
<a id='line_4814'></a>
<a id='line_4815'>    And now Deïphobus he sees, the glorious Priam's son;</a>
<a id='line_4816'>    But all his body mangled sore, his face all evilly hacked,</a>
<a id='line_4817'>    His face and hands; yea, and his head, laid waste, the ear-lobes lacked,</a>
<a id='line_4818'>    And nostrils cropped unto the root by wicked wound and grim.</a>
<a id='line_4819'>    Scarcely he knew the trembling man, who strove to hide from him</a>
<a id='line_4820'>    Those torments dire, but thus at last he spake in voice well known:</a>
<a id='line_4821'></a>
<a id='line_4822'>    "O great in arms, Deïphobus, from Teucer's blood come down,          500</a>
<a id='line_4823'>    Who had the heart to work on thee such bitter wicked bale?</a>
<a id='line_4824'>    Who had the might to deal thee this? Indeed I heard the tale,</a>
<a id='line_4825'>    That, tired with slaying of the Greeks on that last night of all,</a>
<a id='line_4826'>    Upon a heap of mingled death thou didst to slumber fall:</a>
<a id='line_4827'>    And I myself an empty tomb on that Rhoetean coast</a>
<a id='line_4828'>    Set up to thee, and thrice aloud cried blessing on thy ghost:</a>
<a id='line_4829'>    Thy name and arms still keep the place; but thee I found not, friend,</a>
<a id='line_4830'>    To set thee in thy fathers' earth ere I too needs must wend."</a>
<a id='line_4831'></a>
<a id='line_4832'>    To him the child of Priam spake: "Friend, nought thou left'st undone;</a>
<a id='line_4833'>    All things thou gav'st Deïphobus, and this dead shadowy one:         510</a>
<a id='line_4834'>    My Fates and that Laconian Bane, the Woman wicked-fair,</a>
<a id='line_4835'>    Have drowned me in this sea of ills: she set these tokens here.</a>
<a id='line_4836'>    How midst a lying happiness we wore the last night by</a>
<a id='line_4837'>    'Thou know'st: yea; overwell belike thou hold'st that memory</a>
<a id='line_4838'>    Now when the baneful Horse of Fate high Pergamus leapt o'er,</a>
<a id='line_4839'>    With womb come nigh unto the birth of weaponed men of war,</a>
<a id='line_4840'>    She, feigning hallowed dance, led on a holy-shouting band</a>
<a id='line_4841'>    Of Phrygian maids, and midst of them, the bale-fire in her hand,</a>
<a id='line_4842'>    Called on the Danaan men to come, high on the castle's steep:</a>
<a id='line_4843'>    But me, outworn with many cares and weighed adown with sleep,        520</a>
<a id='line_4844'>    The hapless bride-bed held meanwhile, and on me did there press</a>
<a id='line_4845'>    Deep rest and sweet, most like indeed to death's own quietness.</a>
<a id='line_4846'>    Therewith my glorious wife all arms from out the house withdrew,</a>
<a id='line_4847'>    And stole away from o'er my head the sword whose faith I knew,</a>
<a id='line_4848'>    Called Menelaüs to the house and opened him the door,</a>
<a id='line_4849'>    Thinking, forsooth, great gift to give to him who loved so sore,</a>
<a id='line_4850'>    To quench therewith the tale gone by of how she did amiss.</a>
<a id='line_4851'>    Why linger? They break in on me, and he their fellow is,</a>
<a id='line_4852'>    Ulysses, preacher of all guilt.--O Gods, will ye not pay</a>
<a id='line_4853'>    The Greeks for all? belike with mouth not godless do I pray.         530</a>
<a id='line_4854'>    --But tell me, thou, what tidings new have brought thee here alive?</a>
<a id='line_4855'>    Is it blind strayings o'er the sea that hither doth thee drive,</a>
<a id='line_4856'>    Or bidding of the Gods? Wherein hath Fortune worn thee so,</a>
<a id='line_4857'>    That thou, midst sunless houses sad, confused lands, must go?"</a>
<a id='line_4858'></a>
<a id='line_4859'>    But as they gave and took in talk, Aurora at the last</a>
<a id='line_4860'>    In rosy wain the topmost crown of upper heaven had passed,</a>
<a id='line_4861'>    And all the fated time perchance in suchwise had they spent;</a>
<a id='line_4862'>    But warning of few words enow the Sibyl toward him sent:</a>
<a id='line_4863'>    "Night falls, Æneas, weeping here we wear the hours in vain;</a>
<a id='line_4864'>    And hard upon us is the place where cleaves the road atwain;         540</a>
<a id='line_4865'>    On by the walls of mighty Dis the right-hand highway goes,</a>
<a id='line_4866'>    Our way to that Elysium: the left drags on to woes</a>
<a id='line_4867'>    Ill-doers' souls, and bringeth them to godless Tartarus."</a>
<a id='line_4868'></a>
<a id='line_4869'>    Then spake Deïphobus: "Great seer, be not o'erwroth with us:</a>
<a id='line_4870'>    I will depart and fill the tale, and unto dusk turn back:</a>
<a id='line_4871'>    Go forth, our glory, go and gain the better fate I lack!"</a>
<a id='line_4872'>    And even with that latest word his feet he tore away.</a>
<a id='line_4873'>    But suddenly Æneas turned, and lo, a city lay</a>
<a id='line_4874'>    Wide-spread 'neath crags upon the left, girt with a wall threefold;</a>
<a id='line_4875'>    And round about in hurrying flood a flaming river rolled,            550</a>
<a id='line_4876'>    E'en Phlegethon of Tartarus, with rattling, stony roar:</a>
<a id='line_4877'>    In face with adamantine posts was wrought the mighty door,</a>
<a id='line_4878'>    Such as no force of men nor might of heaven-abiders high</a>
<a id='line_4879'>    May cleave with steel; an iron tower thence riseth to the sky:</a>
<a id='line_4880'>    And there is set Tisiphone, with girded blood-stained gown,</a>
<a id='line_4881'>    Who, sleepless, holdeth night and day the doorway of the town.</a>
<a id='line_4882'>    Great wail and cruel sound of stripes that city sendeth out,</a>
<a id='line_4883'>    And iron clanking therewithal of fetters dragged about.</a>
<a id='line_4884'></a>
<a id='line_4885'>    Then fearfully Æneas stayed, and drank the tumult in:</a>
<a id='line_4886'>    "O tell me, Maiden, what is there? What images of sin?               560</a>
<a id='line_4887'>    What torments bear they? What the wail yon city casts abroad?"</a>
<a id='line_4888'></a>
<a id='line_4889'>    Then so began the seer to speak: "O glorious Teucrian lord,</a>
<a id='line_4890'>    On wicked threshold of the place no righteous foot may stand:</a>
<a id='line_4891'>    But when great Hecate made me Queen of that Avernus land,</a>
<a id='line_4892'>    She taught me of God's punishments and led me down the path.</a>
<a id='line_4893'>    --There Gnosian Rhadamanthus now most heavy lordship hath,</a>
<a id='line_4894'>    And heareth lies, and punisheth, and maketh men confess</a>
<a id='line_4895'>    Their deeds of earth, whereof made glad by foolish wickedness,</a>
<a id='line_4896'>    They thrust the late repentance off till death drew nigh to grip:</a>
<a id='line_4897'>    Those guilty drives Tisiphone, armed with avenging whip,             570</a>
<a id='line_4898'>    And mocks their writhings, casting forth her other dreadful hand</a>
<a id='line_4899'>    Filled with the snakes, and crying on her cruel sister's band.</a>
<a id='line_4900'>    And then at last on awful hinge loud-clanging opens wide</a>
<a id='line_4901'>    The Door of Doom:--and lo, behold what door-ward doth abide</a>
<a id='line_4902'>    Within the porch, what thing it is the city gate doth hold!</a>
<a id='line_4903'>    More dreadful yet the Water-worm, with black mouth fiftyfold,</a>
<a id='line_4904'>    Hath dwelling in the inner parts. Then Tartarus aright</a>
<a id='line_4905'>    Gapes sheer adown; and twice so far it thrusteth under night</a>
<a id='line_4906'>    As up unto the roof of heaven Olympus lifteth high:</a>
<a id='line_4907'>    And there the ancient race of Earth, the Titan children, lie,        580</a>
<a id='line_4908'>    Cast down by thunder, wallowing in bottomless abode.</a>
<a id='line_4909'>    There of the twin Aloidæ the monstrous bodies' load</a>
<a id='line_4910'>    I saw; who fell on mighty heaven to cleave it with their hands,</a>
<a id='line_4911'>    That they might pluck the Father Jove from out his glorious lands;</a>
<a id='line_4912'>    And Salmoneus I saw withal, paying the cruel pain</a>
<a id='line_4913'>    That fire of Jove and heaven's own voice on earth he needs must feign:</a>
<a id='line_4914'>    He, drawn by fourfold rush of steeds, and shaking torches' glare,</a>
<a id='line_4915'>    Amidmost of the Grecian folks, amidst of Elis fair,</a>
<a id='line_4916'>    Went glorying, and the name of God and utter worship sought.</a>
<a id='line_4917'>    O fool! the glory of the storm, and lightning like to nought,        590</a>
<a id='line_4918'>    He feigned with rattling copper things and beat of horny hoof.</a>
<a id='line_4919'>    Him the Almighty Father smote from cloudy rack aloof,</a>
<a id='line_4920'>    But never brand nor pitchy flame of smoky pine-tree cast,</a>
<a id='line_4921'>    As headlong there he drave him down amid the whirling blast.</a>
<a id='line_4922'>    And Tityon, too, the child of Earth, great Mother of all things,</a>
<a id='line_4923'>    There may ye see: nine acres' space his mighty frame he flings;</a>
<a id='line_4924'>    His deathless liver still is cropped by that huge vulture's beak</a>
<a id='line_4925'>    That evermore his daily meat doth mid his inwards seek,</a>
<a id='line_4926'>    Fruitful of woe, and hath his home beneath his mighty breast:</a>
<a id='line_4927'>    Whose heart-strings eaten, and new-born shall never know of rest.    600</a>
<a id='line_4928'>    Of Lapithæ, Pirithoüs, Ixion, what a tale!</a>
<a id='line_4929'>    O'er whom the black crag hangs, that slips, and slips, and ne'er shall fail</a>
<a id='line_4930'>    To seem to fall. The golden feet of feast beds glitter bright,</a>
<a id='line_4931'>    And there in manner of the kings is glorious banquet dight.</a>
<a id='line_4932'>    But lo, the Furies' eldest-born is crouched beside it there,</a>
<a id='line_4933'>    And banneth one and all of them hand on the board to bear,</a>
<a id='line_4934'>    And riseth up with tossing torch, and crieth, thundering loud.</a>
<a id='line_4935'>    Here they that hated brethren sore while yet their life abode,</a>
<a id='line_4936'>    The father-smiters, they that drew the client-catching net,</a>
<a id='line_4937'>    The brooders over treasure found in earth, who never yet             610</a>
<a id='line_4938'>    Would share one penny with their friends--and crowded thick these are--</a>
<a id='line_4939'>    Those slain within another's bed; the followers up of war</a>
<a id='line_4940'>    Unrighteous; they no whit ashamed their masters' hand to fail,</a>
<a id='line_4941'>    Here prisoned bide the penalty: seek not to know their tale</a>
<a id='line_4942'>    Of punishment; what fate it is o'erwhelmeth such a folk.</a>
<a id='line_4943'>    Some roll huge stones; some hang adown, fast bound to tire or spoke</a>
<a id='line_4944'>    Of mighty wheels. There sitteth now, and shall sit evermore</a>
<a id='line_4945'>    Theseus undone: wretch Phlegyas is crying o'er and o'er</a>
<a id='line_4946'>    His warning, and in mighty voice through dim night testifies:</a>
<a id='line_4947'>    'Be warned, and learn of righteousness, nor holy Gods despise.'      620</a>
<a id='line_4948'>    This sold his fatherland for gold; this tyrant on it laid;</a>
<a id='line_4949'>    This for a price made laws for men, for price the laws unmade:</a>
<a id='line_4950'>    This broke into his daughter's bed and wedding-tide accursed:</a>
<a id='line_4951'>    All dared to think of monstrous deed, and did the deed they durst.</a>
<a id='line_4952'>    Nor, had I now an hundred mouths, an hundred tongues at need,</a>
<a id='line_4953'>    An iron voice, might I tell o'er all guise of evil deed,</a>
<a id='line_4954'>    Or run adown the names of woe those evil deeds are worth."</a>
<a id='line_4955'></a>
<a id='line_4956'>    So when Apollo's ancient seer such words had given forth:</a>
<a id='line_4957'>    "Now to the road! fulfil the gift that we so far have brought!       629</a>
<a id='line_4958'>    Haste on!" she saith, "I see the walls in Cyclops' furnace wrought;</a>
<a id='line_4959'>    And now the opening of the gates is lying full in face,</a>
<a id='line_4960'>    Where we are bidden lay adown the gift that brings us grace."</a>
<a id='line_4961'></a>
<a id='line_4962'>    She spake, and through the dusk of ways on side by side they wend,</a>
<a id='line_4963'>    And wear the space betwixt, and reach the doorway in the end.</a>
<a id='line_4964'>    Æneas at the entering in bedews his body o'er</a>
<a id='line_4965'>    With water fresh, and sets the bough in threshold of the door.</a>
<a id='line_4966'>    So, all being done, the Goddess' gift well paid in manner meet,</a>
<a id='line_4967'>    They come into a joyous land, and green-sward fair and sweet</a>
<a id='line_4968'>    Amid the happiness of groves, the blessèd dwelling-place.</a>
<a id='line_4969'>    Therein a more abundant heaven clothes all the meadows' face         640</a>
<a id='line_4970'>    With purple light, and their own sun and their own stars they have.</a>
<a id='line_4971'>    Here some in games upon the grass their bodies breathing gave;</a>
<a id='line_4972'>    Or on the yellow face of sand they strive and play the play;</a>
<a id='line_4973'>    Some beat the earth with dancing foot, and some, the song they say:</a>
<a id='line_4974'>    And there withal the Thracian man in flowing raiment sings</a>
<a id='line_4975'>    Unto the measure of the dance on seven-folded strings;</a>
<a id='line_4976'>    And now he smites with finger-touch, and now with ivory reed.</a>
<a id='line_4977'>    And here is Teucer's race of old, most lovely sons indeed;</a>
<a id='line_4978'>    High-hearted heroes born on earth in better days of joy:</a>
<a id='line_4979'>    Ilus was there, Assaracus, and he who builded Troy,                  650</a>
<a id='line_4980'>    E'en Dardanus. Far off are seen their empty wains of war</a>
<a id='line_4981'>    And war-weed: stand the spears in earth, unyoked the horses are,</a>
<a id='line_4982'>    And graze the meadows all about; for even as they loved</a>
<a id='line_4983'>    Chariot and weapons, yet alive, and e'en as they were moved</a>
<a id='line_4984'>    To feed sleek horses, under earth doth e'en such joy abide.</a>
<a id='line_4985'>    Others he saw to right and left about the meadows wide</a>
<a id='line_4986'>    Feasting; or joining merry mouths to sing the battle won</a>
<a id='line_4987'>    Amidst the scented laurel grove, whence earthward rolleth on</a>
<a id='line_4988'>    The full flood that Eridanus athwart the wood doth pour.</a>
<a id='line_4989'>    Lo, they who in their country's fight sword-wounded bodies bore;     660</a>
<a id='line_4990'>    Lo, priests of holy life and chaste, while they in life had part;</a>
<a id='line_4991'>    Lo, God-loved poets, men who spake things worthy Phoebus' heart:</a>
<a id='line_4992'>    And they who bettered life on earth by new-found mastery;</a>
<a id='line_4993'>    And they whose good deeds left a tale for men to name them by:</a>
<a id='line_4994'>    And all they had their brows about with snowy fillets bound.</a>
<a id='line_4995'></a>
<a id='line_4996'>    Now unto them the Sibyl spake as there they flowed around,--</a>
<a id='line_4997'>    Unto Musæus first; for him midmost the crowd enfolds</a>
<a id='line_4998'>    Higher than all from shoulders up, and reverently beholds:</a>
<a id='line_4999'>    "Say, happy souls, and thou, O bard, the best earth ever bare,</a>
<a id='line_5000'>    What land, what place Anchises hath? for whose sake came we here,    670</a>
<a id='line_5001'>    And swam the floods of Erebus and every mighty wave."</a>
<a id='line_5002'></a>
<a id='line_5003'>    Then, lightly answering her again, few words the hero gave:</a>
<a id='line_5004'>    "None hath a certain dwelling-place; in shady groves we bide,</a>
<a id='line_5005'>    And meadows fresh with running streams, and beds by river-side:</a>
<a id='line_5006'>    But if such longing and so sore the heart within you hath,</a>
<a id='line_5007'>    O'ertop yon ridge and I will set your feet in easy path."</a>
<a id='line_5008'></a>
<a id='line_5009'>    He spake and footed it afore, and showeth from above</a>
<a id='line_5010'>    The shining meads; and thence away from hill-top down they move.</a>
<a id='line_5011'></a>
<a id='line_5012'>    But Sire Anchises deep adown in green-grown valley lay,</a>
<a id='line_5013'>    And on the spirits prisoned there, but soon to wend to day,          680</a>
<a id='line_5014'>    Was gazing with a fond desire: of all his coming ones</a>
<a id='line_5015'>    There was he reckoning up the tale, and well-loved sons of sons:</a>
<a id='line_5016'>    Their fate, their haps, their ways of life, their deeds to come to pass.</a>
<a id='line_5017'>    But when he saw Æneas now draw nigh athwart the grass,</a>
<a id='line_5018'>    He stretched forth either palm to him all eager, and the tears</a>
<a id='line_5019'>    Poured o'er his cheeks, and speech withal forth from his mouth there fares:</a>
<a id='line_5020'></a>
<a id='line_5021'>    "O come at last, and hath the love, thy father hoped for, won</a>
<a id='line_5022'>    O'er the hard way, and may I now look on thy face, O son,</a>
<a id='line_5023'>    And give and take with thee in talk, and hear the words I know?</a>
<a id='line_5024'>    So verily my mind forebode, I deemed 'twas coming so,                690</a>
<a id='line_5025'>    And counted all the days thereto; nor was my longing vain.</a>
<a id='line_5026'>    And now I have thee, son, borne o'er what lands, how many a main!</a>
<a id='line_5027'>    How tossed about on every side by every peril still!</a>
<a id='line_5028'>    Ah, how I feared lest Libyan land should bring thee unto ill!"</a>
<a id='line_5029'></a>
<a id='line_5030'>    Then he: "O father, thou it was, thine image sad it was,</a>
<a id='line_5031'>    That, coming o'er and o'er again, drave me these doors to pass:</a>
<a id='line_5032'>    My ships lie in the Tyrrhene salt--ah, give the hand I lack!</a>
<a id='line_5033'>    Give it, my father; neither thus from my embrace draw back!"</a>
<a id='line_5034'></a>
<a id='line_5035'>    His face was wet with plenteous tears e'en as the word he spake,</a>
<a id='line_5036'>    And thrice the neck of him beloved he strove in arms to take;        700</a>
<a id='line_5037'>    And thrice away from out his hands the gathered image streams,</a>
<a id='line_5038'>    E'en as the breathing of the wind or wingèd thing of dreams.</a>
<a id='line_5039'></a>
<a id='line_5040'>    But down amid a hollow dale meanwhile Æneas sees</a>
<a id='line_5041'>    A secret grove, a thicket fair, with murmuring of the trees,</a>
<a id='line_5042'>    And Lethe's stream that all along that quiet place doth wend;</a>
<a id='line_5043'>    O'er which there hovered countless folks and peoples without end:</a>
<a id='line_5044'>    And as when bees amid the fields in summer-tide the bright</a>
<a id='line_5045'>    Settle on diverse flowery things, and round the lilies white</a>
<a id='line_5046'>    Go streaming; so the fields were filled with mighty murmuring.</a>
<a id='line_5047'></a>
<a id='line_5048'>    Unlearned Æneas fell aquake at such a wondrous thing,                710</a>
<a id='line_5049'>    And asketh what it all may mean, what rivers these may be,</a>
<a id='line_5050'>    And who the men that fill the banks with such a company.</a>
<a id='line_5051'>    Then spake Anchises: "These are souls to whom fate oweth now</a>
<a id='line_5052'>    New bodies: there they drink the draught by Lethe's quiet flow,</a>
<a id='line_5053'>    The draught that is the death of care, the long forgetfulness.</a>
<a id='line_5054'>    And sure to teach thee of these things, and show thee all their press,</a>
<a id='line_5055'>    And of mine offspring tell the tale, for long have I been fain,</a>

<a id='line_5057'></a>
<a id='line_5058'>    "O Father, may we think it then, that souls may get them hence</a>

<a id='line_5060'>    How can such mad desire be to win the worldly day?"</a>
<a id='line_5061'></a>
<a id='line_5062'>    "Son, I shall tell thee all thereof, nor hold thee on the way."</a>
<a id='line_5063'>    Therewith he takes the tale and all he openeth orderly:</a>

<a id='line_5073'>    Ere limbs of earth bewilder them and members made to die.</a>
<a id='line_5074'>    Hence fear they have, and love, and joy, and grief, and ne'er may find</a>
<a id='line_5075'>    The face of heaven amid the dusk and prison strait and blind:</a>
<a id='line_5076'>    Yea, e'en when out of upper day their life at last is borne,</a>
<a id='line_5077'>    Not all the ill of wretched men is utterly outworn,</a>
<a id='line_5078'>    Not all the bane their bodies bred; and sure in wondrous wise</a>
<a id='line_5079'>    The plenteous ill they bore so long engrained in them it lies:</a>
<a id='line_5080'>    So therefore are they worn by woes and pay for ancient wrong:</a>
<a id='line_5081'>    And some of them are hung aloft the empty winds among;               740</a>
<a id='line_5082'>    And some, their stain of wickedness amidst the water's heart</a>
<a id='line_5083'>    Is washed away; amidst the fire some leave their worser part;</a>
<a id='line_5084'>    And each his proper death must bear: then through Elysium wide</a>

<a id='line_5086'>    Till in the fulness of the time, the day that long hath been</a>

<a id='line_5089'>    All these who now have turned the wheel for many and many a year</a>
<a id='line_5090'>    God calleth unto Lethe's flood in mighty company,</a>

<a id='line_5093'></a>
<a id='line_5094'>    Anchises therewithal his son, and her the Sibyl drew</a>

<a id='line_5235'>    For I will scatter purple flowers, and heap such offerings spilled</a>
<a id='line_5236'>    Unto the spirit of my child, and empty service do."</a>
<a id='line_5237'></a>
<a id='line_5238'>    Thereafter upon every side they strayed that country through,</a>
<a id='line_5239'>    Amid wide-spreading airy meads, and sight of all things won.</a>
<a id='line_5240'>    But after old Anchises now through all had led his son,</a>
<a id='line_5241'>    And kindled love within his heart of fame that was to be,</a>
<a id='line_5242'>    Then did he tell him of the wars that he himself should see,         890</a>
<a id='line_5243'>    And of Laurentian peoples taught, and town of Latin folk;</a>
<a id='line_5244'>    And how from every grief to flee, or how to bear its stroke.</a>
<a id='line_5245'></a>
<a id='line_5246'>    Now twofold are the Gates of Sleep, whereof the one, men say,</a>
<a id='line_5247'>    Is wrought of horn, and ghosts of sooth thereby win easy way,</a>
<a id='line_5248'>    The other clean and smooth is wrought of gleaming ivory,</a>
<a id='line_5249'>    But lying dreams the nether Gods send up to heaven thereby.</a>
<a id='line_5250'>    All said, Anchises on his son and Sibyl-maid doth wait</a>
<a id='line_5251'>    Unto the last, and sends them up by that same ivory gate.</a>
<a id='line_5252'>    He wears the way and gains his fleet and fellow-folk once more.</a>
<a id='line_5253'></a>
<a id='line_5254'>    So for Caieta's haven-mouth by straightest course they bore,         900</a>

<a id='line_5262'>ARGUMENT.</a>
<a id='line_5263'></a>
<a id='line_5264'>ÆNEAS AND HIS TROJANS TAKE LAND BY THE TIBER-MOUTH, AND KING LATINUS</a>
<a id='line_5265'>PLIGHTETH PEACE WITH THEM; WHICH PEACE IS BROKEN BY THE WILL OF JUNO,</a>
<a id='line_5266'>AND ALL MEN MAKE THEM READY FOR WAR.</a>
<a id='line_5267'></a>
<a id='line_5268'></a>
<a id='line_5269'>    Thou also, O Æneas' nurse, Caieta, didst avail,</a>
<a id='line_5270'>    E'en dying, unto these our shores to leave a deathless tale:</a>
<a id='line_5271'>    And yet thy glory guards the place, thy bones have won it name</a>
<a id='line_5272'>    Within the great Hesperian land, if that be prize of fame.</a>
<a id='line_5273'></a>
<a id='line_5274'>    But good Æneas, when at last all funeral rites were paid</a>
<a id='line_5275'>    And the grave heaped, when in a while the ocean's face was laid,</a>
<a id='line_5276'>    Went on his way with sails aloft, and left the port behind:</a>
<a id='line_5277'>    The faint winds breathe about the night, the moon shines clear and kind;</a>
<a id='line_5278'>    Beneath the quivering shining road the wide seas gleaming lie.</a>
<a id='line_5279'></a>
<a id='line_5280'>    But next the beach of Circe's land their swift ships glide anigh,     10</a>
<a id='line_5281'>    Where the rich daughter of the Sun with constant song doth rouse</a>
<a id='line_5282'>    The groves that none may enter in, or in her glorious house</a>
<a id='line_5283'>    Burneth the odorous cedar-torch amidst the dead of night,</a>
<a id='line_5284'>    While through the slender warp she speeds the shrilling shuttle light.</a>
<a id='line_5285'>    And thence they hear the sound of groans, and wrath of lions dread</a>
<a id='line_5286'>    Fretting their chains; and roaring things o'er night-tide fallen dead;</a>
<a id='line_5287'>    And bristled swine and cagèd bears cried bitter-wild, and sore;</a>
<a id='line_5288'>    And from the shapes of monstrous wolves the howling seaward bore.</a>
<a id='line_5289'>    These from the likeness of mankind had cruel Circe won</a>
<a id='line_5290'>    By herbs of might, and shape and hide of beasts upon them done.       20</a>
<a id='line_5291'>    But lest the godly Trojan folk such wickedness should bear,</a>
<a id='line_5292'>    Lest borne into the baneful bay they bring their keels o'er near,</a>
<a id='line_5293'>    Their sails did Father Neptune fill with fair and happy breeze,</a>
<a id='line_5294'>    And sped their flight and sent them swift across the hurrying seas.</a>
<a id='line_5295'></a>
<a id='line_5296'>    Now reddened all the sea with rays, and from the heavenly plain</a>
<a id='line_5297'>    The golden-hued Aurora shone amidst her rosy wain,</a>
<a id='line_5298'>    Then fell the winds and every air sank down in utter sleep,</a>
<a id='line_5299'>    And now the shaven oars must strive amid the sluggish deep:</a>
<a id='line_5300'>    Therewith Æneas sees a wood rise from the water's face,</a>
<a id='line_5301'>    And there it is the Tiber's flood amidst a pleasant place,            30</a>
<a id='line_5302'>    With many a whirling eddy swift and yellowing with sand</a>
<a id='line_5303'>    Breaks into sea; and diversely above on either hand</a>
<a id='line_5304'>    The fowl that love the river-bank and haunt the river-bed</a>
<a id='line_5305'>    Sweetened the air with plenteous song and through the thicket fled.</a>
<a id='line_5306'>    So there Æneas bids his folk shoreward their bows to lay,</a>
<a id='line_5307'>    And joyfully he entereth in the stream's o'ershadowed way.</a>
<a id='line_5308'></a>
<a id='line_5309'>    To aid, Erato! while I tell what kings, what deedful tide,</a>
<a id='line_5310'>    What manner life, in Latin land did anciently abide</a>
<a id='line_5311'>    When first the stranger brought his ships to that Ausonian shore;</a>
<a id='line_5312'>    Yea help me while I call aback beginnings of the war.                 40</a>
<a id='line_5313'>    O Goddess, hearten thou thy seer! dread war my song-speech saith:</a>
<a id='line_5314'>    It tells the battle in array, and kings full fain of death,</a>
<a id='line_5315'>    The Tyrrhene host, all Italy, spurred on the sword to bear:</a>
<a id='line_5316'>    Yea, greater matters are afoot, a mightier deed I stir.</a>
<a id='line_5317'></a>
<a id='line_5318'>    The king Latinus, old of days, ruled o'er the fields' increase,</a>
<a id='line_5319'>    And cities of the people there at rest in long-drawn peace:</a>
<a id='line_5320'>    Of Faunus and Laurentian nymph, Marica, do we learn</a>
<a id='line_5321'>    That he was born: but Faunus came of Picus, who must turn</a>
<a id='line_5322'>    To thee, O Saturn, for his sire: 'twas he that blood began.</a>
<a id='line_5323'>    Now, as God would, this king had got no son to grow a man,            50</a>
<a id='line_5324'>    For he who first had dawned on him in earliest youth had waned:</a>
<a id='line_5325'>    A daughter only such a house, so great a world sustained,</a>
<a id='line_5326'>    Now ripe for man, the years fulfilled that made her meet for bed:</a>
<a id='line_5327'>    And her much folk of Latin land were fain enow to wed,</a>
<a id='line_5328'>    And all Ausonia: first of whom, and fairest to be seen,</a>
<a id='line_5329'>    Was Turnus, great from fathers great; and him indeed the queen</a>
<a id='line_5330'>    Was fain of for her son-in-law with wondrous love of heart:</a>
<a id='line_5331'>    But dreadful portents of the Gods the matter thrust apart.</a>
<a id='line_5332'>    Amidmost of the inner house a laurel-tree upbore</a>
<a id='line_5333'>    Its hallowed leaves, that fear of God had kept through years of yore:  60</a>
<a id='line_5334'>    Father Latinus first, they said, had found it there, when he</a>
<a id='line_5335'>    Built there his burg and hallowed it to Phoebus' deity,</a>
<a id='line_5336'>    And on Laurentian people thence the name thereof had laid;</a>
<a id='line_5337'>    On whose top now the gathered bees, O wondrous to be said!</a>
<a id='line_5338'>    Borne on with mighty humming noise amid the flowing air,</a>
<a id='line_5339'>    Had settled down, and foot to foot all interwoven there,</a>
<a id='line_5340'>    In sudden swarm they hung adown from off the leafy bough.</a>
<a id='line_5341'></a>
<a id='line_5342'>    But straight the seer cries out: "Ah me! I see him coming now,</a>
<a id='line_5343'>    The stranger man; I see a host from that same quarter come</a>
<a id='line_5344'>    To this same quarter, to be lords amidst our highest home."           70</a>
<a id='line_5345'></a>
<a id='line_5346'>    But further, while the altar-fires she feeds with virgin brands,</a>
<a id='line_5347'>    The maid Lavinia, and beside her ancient father stands,</a>
<a id='line_5348'>    Out! how along her length of hair the grasp of fire there came,</a>
<a id='line_5349'>    And all the tiring of her head was caught in crackling flame.</a>
<a id='line_5350'>    And there her royal tresses blazed, and blazed her glorious crown</a>
<a id='line_5351'>    Gem-wrought, and she one cloud of smoke and yellow fire was grown:</a>
<a id='line_5352'>    And wrapped therein, the fiery God she scattered through the house:</a>
<a id='line_5353'>    And sure it seemed a dreadful thing, a story marvellous:</a>
<a id='line_5354'>    For they fell singing she should grow glorious of fame and fate,</a>
<a id='line_5355'>    But unto all her folk should be the seed of huge debate.              80</a>
<a id='line_5356'></a>
<a id='line_5357'>    So troubled by this tokening dread forth fareth now the king</a>
<a id='line_5358'>    To Faunus' fane, his father-seer, to ask him counselling</a>
<a id='line_5359'>    'Neath Albunea the high, whose wood, the thicket most of worth,</a>
<a id='line_5360'>    Resoundeth with the holy well and breathes the sulphur forth.</a>
<a id='line_5361'>    From whence the folk of Italy and all Oenotrian land</a>
<a id='line_5362'>    Seek rede amidst of troublous time. Here, when the priest in hand</a>
<a id='line_5363'>    Hath borne the gifts, and laid him down amidst the hush of night</a>
<a id='line_5364'>    On the strown fells of slaughtered ewes, and sought him sleep aright,</a>
<a id='line_5365'>    He seeth wondrous images about him flit and shift,</a>
<a id='line_5366'>    He hearkeneth many a changing voice, of talk with Gods hath gift,     90</a>
<a id='line_5367'>    And holdeth speech with Acheron, from deep Avernus come.</a>
<a id='line_5368'>    There now the sire Latinus went seeking the answers home,</a>
<a id='line_5369'>    And there an hundred woolly ewes in order due did slay,</a>
<a id='line_5370'>    And propped upon the fells thereof on bed of fleeces lay,</a>
<a id='line_5371'>    Till from the thickets inner depths the sudden answer came:</a>
<a id='line_5372'></a>
<a id='line_5373'>    "Seek not thy daughter, O my son, to wed to Latin name;</a>
<a id='line_5374'>    Unto the bridal set on foot let not thy troth be given:</a>
<a id='line_5375'>    Thy sons are coming over sea to raise our blood to heaven,</a>
<a id='line_5376'>    And sons of sons' sons from their stem shall see beneath their feet</a>
<a id='line_5377'>    All things for them to shift and doom; all things the sun may meet,  100</a>
<a id='line_5378'>    As to and fro he wendeth way 'twixt either ocean wave."</a>
<a id='line_5379'></a>
<a id='line_5380'>    Such warnings of the silent night that father Faunus gave,</a>
<a id='line_5381'>    Shut up betwixt his closed lips Latinus held no whit,</a>
<a id='line_5382'>    But through Ausonia flying fame had borne the noise of it,</a>
<a id='line_5383'>    When that Laomedontian folk at last had moored their ships</a>
<a id='line_5384'>    Unto the grassy-mounded bank whereby the river slips.</a>
<a id='line_5385'></a>
<a id='line_5386'>    Æneas and Iulus fair, and all their most and best,</a>
<a id='line_5387'>    Beneath a tall tree's boughs had laid their bodies down to rest:</a>
<a id='line_5388'>    They dight the feast; about the grass on barley-cakes they lay</a>
<a id='line_5389'>    What meat they had,--for even so Jove bade them do that day,--       110</a>
<a id='line_5390'>    And on the ground that Ceres gave the woodland apples pile.</a>
<a id='line_5391'>    And so it happed, that all being spent, they turn them in a while</a>
<a id='line_5392'>    To Ceres' little field, and eat, egged on by very want,</a>
<a id='line_5393'>    And dare to waste with hands and teeth the circle thin and scant</a>
<a id='line_5394'>    Where fate lay hid, nor spare upon the trenchers wide to fall.</a>
<a id='line_5395'></a>
<a id='line_5396'>    "Ah!" cries Iulus, "so today we eat up board and all."</a>
<a id='line_5397'></a>
<a id='line_5398'>    'Twas all his jest-word; but its sound their labour slew at last,</a>
<a id='line_5399'>    And swift his father caught it up, as from his mouth it passed,</a>
<a id='line_5400'>    And stayed him, by the might of God bewildered utterly.              119</a>
<a id='line_5401'>    Then forthwith: "Hail," he cried, "O land that Fate hath owed to me!</a>
<a id='line_5402'>    And ye, O House-gods of our Troy, hail ye, O true and kind!</a>
<a id='line_5403'>    This is your house, this is your land: my father, as I mind,</a>
<a id='line_5404'>    Such secrets of the deeds of Fate left me in days of yore:</a>
<a id='line_5405'>    'O son, when hunger driveth thee stranded on outland shore</a>
<a id='line_5406'>    To eat the very boards beneath thy victual scant at need,</a>
<a id='line_5407'>    There hope for house, O weary one, and in that place have heed</a>
<a id='line_5408'>    To set hand first unto the roof, and heap the garth around.'</a>
<a id='line_5409'>    So this will be that hunger-tide: this waited us to bound</a>
<a id='line_5410'>    Our wasting evils at the last.</a>
<a id='line_5411'>    So come, and let us joyfully upon the first of dawn                  130</a>
<a id='line_5412'>    Seek out the land, what place it is, what men-folk there abide,</a>
<a id='line_5413'>    And where their city; diversely leaving the haven-side.</a>
<a id='line_5414'>    But now pour out the bowls to Jove, send prayer upon the way</a>
<a id='line_5415'>    To sire Anchises, and the wine again on table lay."</a>
<a id='line_5416'></a>
<a id='line_5417'>    He spake, and with the leafy bough his temples garlanded,</a>
<a id='line_5418'>    And to the Spirit of the Soil forthwith the prayer he said,</a>
<a id='line_5419'>    To Earth, the eldest-born of Gods, to Nymphs, to Streams unknown</a>
<a id='line_5420'>    As yet: he called upon the Night, and night-tide's signs new shown;</a>
<a id='line_5421'>    Idæan Jove, the Phrygian Queen, the Mother, due and well</a>
<a id='line_5422'>    He called on; and his parents twain in Heaven and in Hell.           140</a>
<a id='line_5423'>    But thrice the Almighty Father then from cloudless heaven on high</a>
<a id='line_5424'>    Gave thunder, showing therewithal the glory of his sky</a>
<a id='line_5425'>    All burning with the golden gleam, and shaken by his hand.</a>
<a id='line_5426'>    Then sudden rumour ran abroad amid the Trojan band,</a>
<a id='line_5427'>    That now the day was come about their fateful walls to raise;</a>
<a id='line_5428'>    So eagerly they dight the feast, gladdened by omen's grace,</a>
<a id='line_5429'>    And bring the beakers forth thereto and garland well the wine.</a>
<a id='line_5430'>    But when the morrow's lamp of dawn across the earth 'gan shine,</a>
<a id='line_5431'>    The shore, the fields, the towns of folk they search, wide scattering:</a>
<a id='line_5432'>    And here they come across the pools of that Numician spring:         150</a>
<a id='line_5433'>    This is the Tiber-flood; hereby the hardy Latins dwell.</a>
<a id='line_5434'>    But therewithal Anchises' seed from out them chose him well</a>
<a id='line_5435'>    An hundred sweet-mouthed men to go unto the walls renowned,</a>
<a id='line_5436'>    Where dwelt the king, and every one with Pallas' olive crowned,</a>
<a id='line_5437'>    To carry gifts unto the lord and peace for Teucrians pray.</a>
<a id='line_5438'>    So, bidden, nought they tarry now, but swift-foot wear the way.</a>
<a id='line_5439'></a>
<a id='line_5440'>    But he himself marks out the walls with shallow ditch around,</a>
<a id='line_5441'>    And falls to work upon the shore his first abode to found,</a>
<a id='line_5442'>    In manner of a camp, begirt with bank and battlement.</a>
<a id='line_5443'></a>
<a id='line_5444'>    Meanwhile his men beheld at last, when all the way was spent,        160</a>
<a id='line_5445'>    The Latin towers and roofs aloft, and drew the walls anigh:</a>
<a id='line_5446'>    There were the lads and flower of youth afield the city by</a>
<a id='line_5447'>    Backing the steed, or mid the dust a-steering of the car,</a>
<a id='line_5448'>    Or bending of the bitter bow, hurling tough darts afar</a>
<a id='line_5449'>    By strength of arm; for foot or fist crying the challenging.</a>
<a id='line_5450'>    Then fares a well-horsed messenger, who to the ancient king</a>
<a id='line_5451'>    Bears tidings of tall new-comers in outland raiment clad:</a>
<a id='line_5452'>    So straight Latinus biddeth them within his house be had,</a>
<a id='line_5453'>    And he upon his father's throne sat down amidmost there.</a>
<a id='line_5454'></a>
<a id='line_5455'>    High on an hundred pillars stood that mighty house and fair,         170</a>
<a id='line_5456'>    High in the burg, the dwelling-place Laurentian Picus won,</a>
<a id='line_5457'>    Awful with woods, and worshipping of sires of time agone:</a>
<a id='line_5458'>    Here was it wont for kings to take the sceptre in their hand,</a>
<a id='line_5459'>    Here first to raise the axe of doom: 'twas court-house of the land,</a>
<a id='line_5460'>    This temple, and the banquet-hall; here when the host was slain</a>
<a id='line_5461'>    The fathers at the endlong boards would sit the feast to gain.</a>
<a id='line_5462'>    There too were dight in cedar old the sires of ancient line</a>
<a id='line_5463'>    For there was fashioned Italus, and he who set the vine,</a>
<a id='line_5464'>    Sabinus, holding yet in hand the image of the hook;</a>
<a id='line_5465'>    And Saturn old, and imaging of Janus' double look,                   180</a>
<a id='line_5466'>    Stood in the porch; and many a king was there from ancient tide,</a>
<a id='line_5467'>    Who in their country's battle erst the wounds of Mars would bide:</a>
<a id='line_5468'>    And therewithal were many arms hung on the holy door.</a>
<a id='line_5469'>    There hung the axes crookèd-horned, and taken wains of war,</a>
<a id='line_5470'>    And crested helms, and bolts and locks that city-gates had borne;</a>
<a id='line_5471'>    And spears and shields, and thrusting-beaks from ships of battle torn.</a>
<a id='line_5472'>    There with Quirinus' crooked staff, girt in the shortened gown,</a>
<a id='line_5473'>    With target in his left hand held, was Picus set adown,--</a>
<a id='line_5474'>    The horse-tamer, whom Circe fair, caught with desire erewhile,</a>
<a id='line_5475'>    Smote with that golden rod of hers, and, sprinkling venom's guile,   190</a>
<a id='line_5476'>    Made him a fowl, and colours fair blent on his shifting wings.</a>
<a id='line_5477'></a>
<a id='line_5478'>    In such a temple of the Gods, in such a house of kings,</a>
<a id='line_5479'>    Latinus sat when he had called those Teucrian fellows in,</a>
<a id='line_5480'>    And from his quiet mouth and grave such converse did begin:</a>
<a id='line_5481'>    "What seek ye, sons of Dardanus? for not unknown to me</a>
<a id='line_5482'>    Is that your city or your blood; and how ye crossed the sea,</a>
<a id='line_5483'>    That have I heard. But these your ships, what counsel or what lack</a>
<a id='line_5484'>    Hath borne them to Ausonian strand o'er all the blue sea's back?</a>
<a id='line_5485'>    If ye have strayed from out your course, or, driven by stormy tide</a>
<a id='line_5486'>    (For such things oft upon the sea must seafarers abide),             200</a>
<a id='line_5487'>    Have entered these our river-banks in haven safe to lie,</a>
<a id='line_5488'>    Flee not our welcome, nor unknown the Latin folk pass by;</a>
<a id='line_5489'>    The seed of Saturn, bound to right by neither law nor chain,</a>
<a id='line_5490'>    But freely following in the ways whereof the God was fain.</a>
<a id='line_5491'>    Yea now indeed I mind a tale, though now with years outworn,</a>
<a id='line_5492'>    How elders of Aurunce said that mid these fields was born</a>
<a id='line_5493'>    That Dardanus, who reached at last the Phrygian Ida's walls,</a>
<a id='line_5494'>    And Thracian Samos, that the world now Samothracia calls:</a>
<a id='line_5495'>    From Tuscan stead of Corythus he went upon his ways;</a>
<a id='line_5496'>    Whose throne is set in golden heaven, the star-besprinkled place,    210</a>
<a id='line_5497'>    Who adds one other to the tale of altared deities."</a>
<a id='line_5498'></a>
<a id='line_5499'>    He ended, but Ilioneus followed in words like these:</a>
<a id='line_5500'>    "O king, O glorious Faunus' child, no storm upon the main</a>
<a id='line_5501'>    Drave us amid the drift of waves your country coast to gain;</a>
<a id='line_5502'>    And neither star nor strand made blind the region of our road;</a>
<a id='line_5503'>    But we by counsel and free will have sought out thine abode,</a>
<a id='line_5504'>    Outcast from such a realm as once was deemed the mightiest</a>
<a id='line_5505'>    The Sun beheld, as o'er the heaven she ran from east to west.</a>
<a id='line_5506'>    Jove is the well-spring of our race; the Dardan children joy</a>
<a id='line_5507'>    In Jove for father; yea, our king, Æneas out of Troy,                220</a>
<a id='line_5508'>    Who sends us to thy door, himself is of the Highest's seed.</a>
<a id='line_5509'>    How great a tempest was let loose o'er our Idæan mead,</a>
<a id='line_5510'>    From dire Mycenæ Sent; what fate drave either clashing world,</a>
<a id='line_5511'>    Europe and Asia, till the war each against each they hurled,</a>
<a id='line_5512'>    His ears have heard, who dwells afar upon the land alone</a>
<a id='line_5513'>    That ocean beats; and his no less the bondman of the zone,</a>
<a id='line_5514'>    That midmost lieth of the four, by cruel sun-blaze worn.</a>
<a id='line_5515'>    Lo, from that flood we come to thee, o'er waste of waters borne,</a>
<a id='line_5516'>    Praying a strip of harmless shore our House-Gods' home to be,</a>
<a id='line_5517'>    And grace of water and of air to all men lying free.                 230</a>
<a id='line_5518'>    We shall not foul our land's renown; and thou, thy glory fair</a>
<a id='line_5519'>    We know, and plenteous fruit of thanks this deed of thine shall bear:</a>
<a id='line_5520'>    Nor ever may embrace of Troy Ausonia's soul despite.</a>
<a id='line_5521'>    Now by Æneas' fates I swear, and by his hand of might,</a>
<a id='line_5522'>    Whether in troth it hath been tried, or mid the hosts of war,</a>
<a id='line_5523'>    That many folks--yea, scorn us not that willingly we bore</a>
<a id='line_5524'>    These fillets in our hands today with words beseeching peace--</a>
<a id='line_5525'>    That many lands have longed for us, and yearned for our increase.</a>
<a id='line_5526'>    But fate of Gods and Gods' command would ever drive us home</a>
<a id='line_5527'>    To this your land: this is the place whence Dardanus was come,       240</a>
<a id='line_5528'>    And hither now he comes again: full sore Apollo drave</a>
<a id='line_5529'>    To Tuscan Tiber, and the place of dread Numicius' wave.</a>
<a id='line_5530'>    Moreover, here some little gifts of early days of joy</a>
<a id='line_5531'>    Giveth our king, a handful gleaned from burning-tide of Troy:</a>
<a id='line_5532'>    Anchises at the altar erst would pour from out this gold;</a>
<a id='line_5533'>    This was the gear that Priam used when in the guise of old</a>
<a id='line_5534'>    He gave his gathered folk the law; sceptre, and holy crown,</a>
<a id='line_5535'>    And weed the work of Ilian wives."</a>
<a id='line_5536'></a>
<a id='line_5537'>    Now while Ilioneus so spake Latinus held his face,</a>
<a id='line_5538'>    Musing and steadfast, on the ground setting his downcast gaze,       250</a>
<a id='line_5539'>    Rolling his eyes all thought-fulfilled; nor did the broidered gear</a>
<a id='line_5540'>    Of purple move the King so much, nor Priam's sceptre fair,</a>
<a id='line_5541'>    As on his daughter's bridal bed the thoughts in him had rest,</a>
<a id='line_5542'>    For ancient Faunus' fateful word he turned within his breast.</a>
<a id='line_5543'>    Here was the son, the fate-foretold, the outland wanderer,</a>
<a id='line_5544'>    Called on by equal doom of God the equal throne to share;</a>
<a id='line_5545'>    He from whose loins those glorious sons of valour should come forth</a>
<a id='line_5546'>    To take the whole world for their own by utter might of worth.</a>
<a id='line_5547'></a>
<a id='line_5548'>    At last he spake out joyfully: "God grace our deed begun,</a>
<a id='line_5549'>    And his own bidding! man of Troy, thine asking shall be done:        260</a>
<a id='line_5550'>    I take your gifts: nought shall ye lack from King Latinus' hand,</a>
<a id='line_5551'>    Riches of Troy, nor health and wealth of fat and fruitful land.</a>
<a id='line_5552'>    But let Æneas come himself if he so yearn for me,</a>
<a id='line_5553'>    If he be eager for our house, and would our fellow be;</a>
<a id='line_5554'>    Nor let him fear to look upon friends' faces close anigh,</a>
<a id='line_5555'>    Part of the peace-troth shall be this, my hand in his to lie.</a>
<a id='line_5556'>    And now bear back unto your king this bidding that I send:</a>
<a id='line_5557'>    I have a daughter; her indeed with countryman to blend</a>
<a id='line_5558'>    The answers of my father's house forbid, and many a sign</a>
<a id='line_5559'>    Sent down from heaven: from over sea comes one to wed our line;      270</a>
<a id='line_5560'>    They say this bideth Latin Land; a man to raise our blood</a>
<a id='line_5561'>    Up to the very stars of heaven: that this is he fate would,</a>
<a id='line_5562'>    I think, yea hope, if any whit my heart herein avail."</a>
<a id='line_5563'></a>
<a id='line_5564'>    He spake, and bade choose horses out from all his noble tale,</a>
<a id='line_5565'>    Whereof three hundred sleek and fair stood in the stables high:</a>
<a id='line_5566'>    These biddeth he for Teucrian men be led forth presently,</a>
<a id='line_5567'>    Wing-footed purple-bearing beasts, with pictures o'er them flung</a>
<a id='line_5568'>    Of woven stuff, and, on their breasts are golden collars hung:</a>
<a id='line_5569'>    Gold-housed are they, and champ in teeth the yellow-golden chain</a>
<a id='line_5570'>    But to Æneas, absent thence, a car and yoke-beasts twain             280</a>
<a id='line_5571'>    He sends: the seed of heaven are they, and breathing very fire,</a>
<a id='line_5572'>    The blood of those that Circe stole when she beguiled her sire,</a>
<a id='line_5573'>    That crafty mistress, winning them, bastards, from earthy mare.</a>
<a id='line_5574'>    So back again Æneas' folk high on their horses fare,</a>
<a id='line_5575'>    Bearing Latinus' gifts and words, and all the tale of peace.</a>
<a id='line_5576'></a>
<a id='line_5577'>    But lo, where great Jove's bitter wife comes from the town of Greece,</a>
<a id='line_5578'>    From Argos wrought of Inachus, and holds the airy way.</a>
<a id='line_5579'>    Far off she sees Æneas' joy, and where the ship-host lay</a>
<a id='line_5580'>    Of Dardans: yea from Sicily and far Pachynus head</a>
<a id='line_5581'>    She seeth him on earth at last and raising roofèd stead,             290</a>
<a id='line_5582'>    And all the ships void: fixed she stood, smit through with bitter wrath,</a>
<a id='line_5583'>    And shook her head: then from her breast the angry words came forth:</a>
<a id='line_5584'></a>
<a id='line_5585'>    "Ah, hated race! Ah, Phrygian fates that shear my fates atwain!</a>
<a id='line_5586'>    Was there no dead man's place for you on that Sigean plain?</a>
<a id='line_5587'>    Had ye no might to wend as slaves? gave Troy so poor a flame</a>
<a id='line_5588'>    To burn her men, that through the fire and through the swords ye came?</a>
<a id='line_5589'>    I think at last my godhead's might is wearied and gone by,</a>
<a id='line_5590'>    That I have drunk enough of hate, and now at rest may lie:-- I,</a>
<a id='line_5591'>    who had heart to follow up those outcasts from their land,</a>
<a id='line_5592'>    And as they fled o'er all the sea still in their path would stand.   300</a>
<a id='line_5593'>    Against these Teucrians sea and sky have spent their strength for nought:</a>
<a id='line_5594'>    Was Syrtes aught, or Scylla aught, or huge Charybdis aught?</a>
<a id='line_5595'>    Lo now the longed-for Tiber's breast that nation cherisheth</a>
<a id='line_5596'>    Safe from the deep and safe from me: while Mars might do to death</a>
<a id='line_5597'>    Those huge-wrought folk of Lapithæ: the very Father-God</a>
<a id='line_5598'>    Gave up the ancient Calydon to Dian's wrath and rod.</a>
<a id='line_5599'>    What was the guilt of Lapithæ? what crime wrought Calydon?</a>
<a id='line_5600'>    But I, the mighty spouse of Jove, who nought have left undone</a>
<a id='line_5601'>    My evil hap might compass, I who ran through all craft's tale</a>
<a id='line_5602'>    Am vanquished of Æneas now. But if of no avail                       310</a>
<a id='line_5603'>    My godhead be, I will not spare to pray what is of might,</a>
<a id='line_5604'>    Since Heaven I move not, needs must I let loose the Nether Night.</a>
<a id='line_5605'>    Ah! say it is not fated me the Latin realm to ban,</a>
<a id='line_5606'>    Lavinia must be fated wife of this same Trojan man,</a>
<a id='line_5607'>    Yet may I draw out time at least, and those great things delay;</a>
<a id='line_5608'>    At least may I for either king an host of people slay:</a>
<a id='line_5609'>    For father and for son-in-law shall plenteous price be paid,</a>
<a id='line_5610'>    With Trojan and Rutulian blood shalt thou be dowered, O maid;</a>
<a id='line_5611'>    Bellona's self shall bridal thee; not Cisseus' seed alone</a>
<a id='line_5612'>    Was big with brand; not she alone with wedding-ring has shone:       320</a>
<a id='line_5613'>    Yea, and this too is Venus' child; another Paris comes</a>
<a id='line_5614'>    To kindle deadly torch again in new-born Trojan homes."</a>
<a id='line_5615'></a>
<a id='line_5616'>    So spake she terrible, and sank into the earth below,</a>
<a id='line_5617'>    Yea to the nether night, and stirred Alecto, forge of woe,</a>
<a id='line_5618'>    From the dread Goddesses' abode: sad wars she loveth well,</a>
<a id='line_5619'>    And murderous wrath, and lurking guile, and evil deeds and fell:</a>
<a id='line_5620'>    E'en Pluto loathes her; yea, e'en they of that Tartarean place,</a>
<a id='line_5621'>    Her sisters, hate her: sure she hath as many a changing face,</a>
<a id='line_5622'>    As many a cruel body's form, as her black snakes put forth.</a>
<a id='line_5623'>    To whom in such wise Juno spake and whetted on her wrath:            330</a>
<a id='line_5624'></a>
<a id='line_5625'>    "Win me a work after thine heart, O Virgin of the night,</a>
<a id='line_5626'>    Lest all my fame, unstained of old, my glory won aright,</a>
<a id='line_5627'>    Give place: lest there Æneas' sons Latinus overcome</a>
<a id='line_5628'>    By wedlock, and in Italy set up their house and home:</a>
<a id='line_5629'>    Thou, who the brothers of one heart canst raise up each 'gainst each,</a>
<a id='line_5630'>    And overturn men's homes with hate, and through the house-walls' breach</a>
<a id='line_5631'>    Bear in the stroke and deadly brand--a thousand names hast thou,--</a>
<a id='line_5632'>    A thousand arts of ill: Stir up thy fruitful bosom now;</a>
<a id='line_5633'>    Be render of the plighted peace; of war-seed be the sower;           339</a>
<a id='line_5634'>    That men may yearn for arms, and ask, and snatch in one same hour."</a>
<a id='line_5635'></a>
<a id='line_5636'>    Thereon Alecto, steeped at heart with Gorgon venoming.</a>
<a id='line_5637'>    Sought Latium first and high-built house of that Laurentian king,</a>
<a id='line_5638'>    And by the silent threshold stood whereby Amata lay,</a>
<a id='line_5639'>    In whose hot heart a woman's woe and woman's wrath did play,</a>
<a id='line_5640'>    About those Teucrian new-comers and Turnus' bridal bed:</a>
<a id='line_5641'>    On her she cast an adder blue, a tress from off her head,</a>
<a id='line_5642'>    And sent it to her breast to creep her very heart-strings through,</a>
<a id='line_5643'>    That she, bewildered by the bane, may all the house undo.</a>
<a id='line_5644'>    So he betwixt her bosom smooth and dainty raiment slid,</a>
<a id='line_5645'>    And crawled as if he touched her not, and maddened her yet hid,      350</a>
<a id='line_5646'>    And breathed the adder's soul in her: the dreadful wormy thing</a>
<a id='line_5647'>    Seemed the wrought gold about her neck, or the long silken string</a>
<a id='line_5648'>    That knit her hair, and slippery soft it glided o'er her limbs.</a>
<a id='line_5649'>    And now while first the plague begins, and soft the venom swims,</a>
<a id='line_5650'>    Touching her sense, and round her bones the fiery web is pressed,</a>
<a id='line_5651'>    Nor yet her soul had caught the flame through all her poisoned breast,</a>
<a id='line_5652'>    Still soft, and e'en as mothers will, she spake the word and said</a>
<a id='line_5653'>    Her woes about her daughter's case, and Phrygian bridal bed.</a>
<a id='line_5654'></a>
<a id='line_5655'>    "To Teucrian outcasts shall our maid, Lavinia, wedded be?</a>
<a id='line_5656'>    O Father, hast thou nought of ruth of her, forsooth, and thee?       360</a>
<a id='line_5657'>    Nor of the mother, whom that man forsworn shall leave behind,</a>
<a id='line_5658'>    Bearing the maiden o'er the sea with the first northern wind?</a>
<a id='line_5659'>    Nay, not e'en so the Phrygian herd pierced Lacedæmon's fold,</a>
<a id='line_5660'>    And bore Ledæan Helen off unto the Trojan hold.</a>
<a id='line_5661'>    Nay, where is gone thine hallowed faith, thy kinsomeness of yore?</a>
<a id='line_5662'>    Thine hand that oft to Turnus' hand, thy kinsman, promise bore?</a>
<a id='line_5663'>    Lo, if we needs must seek a son strange to the Latin folk,</a>
<a id='line_5664'>    And Father Faunus' words on thee are e'en so strait a yoke,</a>
<a id='line_5665'>    I deem, indeed, that every land free from our kingdom's sway</a>
<a id='line_5666'>    Is stranger land, and even so I deem the Gods would say:             370</a>
<a id='line_5667'>    And Turnus comes, if we shall seek beginning of his race.</a>
<a id='line_5668'>    From Inachus, Acrisius old, and mid Mycenæ's place."</a>
<a id='line_5669'></a>
<a id='line_5670'>    But when she thus had said in vain, and saw Latinus still</a>
<a id='line_5671'>    Withstand her: when all inwardly the maddening serpent's ill</a>
<a id='line_5672'>    Hath smitten through her heart of hearts and passed through all her frame,</a>
<a id='line_5673'>    Then verily the hapless one, with dreadful things aflame,</a>
<a id='line_5674'>    Raves through the city's length and breadth in God-wrought agonies:</a>
<a id='line_5675'>    As 'neath the stroke of twisted lash at whiles the whip-top flies,</a>
<a id='line_5676'>    Which lads all eager for the game drive, ever circling wide</a>
<a id='line_5677'>    Round some void hall; it, goaded on beneath the strip of hide,       380</a>
<a id='line_5678'>    From circle unto circle goes; the silly childish throng</a>
<a id='line_5679'>    Still hanging o'er, and wondering how the box-tree spins along,</a>
<a id='line_5680'>    The while their lashes make it live: no quieter she ran</a>
<a id='line_5681'>    Through the mid city, borne amid fierce hearts of many a man.</a>
<a id='line_5682'>    Then in the wilderness she feigns the heart that Bacchus fills,</a>
<a id='line_5683'>    And stirs a greater madness up, beginning greater ills,</a>
<a id='line_5684'>    And mid the leafy mountain-side her daughter hides away,</a>
<a id='line_5685'>    To snatch her from the Teucrian bed, the bridal torch to stay;</a>
<a id='line_5686'>    Foaming: "Hail, Bacchus! thou alone art worthy lord to wed</a>
<a id='line_5687'>    This virgin thing: for thee she takes the spear's soft-fruited head,  390</a>
<a id='line_5688'>    For thee she twinkleth dancing feet, and feeds her holy hair."</a>
<a id='line_5689'></a>
<a id='line_5690'>    The rumour flies, and one same rage all mother-folk doth bear,</a>
<a id='line_5691'>    Heart-kindled by the Fury's ill, to roofs of all unrest:</a>
<a id='line_5692'>    They flee the house and let the wind play free o'er hair and breast:</a>
<a id='line_5693'>    While others fill the very heavens with shrilly quivering wail,</a>
<a id='line_5694'>    And skin-clad toss about the spear the wreathing vine-leaves veil:</a>
<a id='line_5695'>    But she ablaze amidst of them upholds the fir-lit flame,</a>
<a id='line_5696'>    And sings her daughter's bridal song, and sings of Turnus' name,</a>
<a id='line_5697'>    Rolling her blood-shot eyes about; then eager suddenly</a>
<a id='line_5698'>    She shouts: "Ho, mothers! Latin wives, wherever ye may be,           400</a>
<a id='line_5699'>    Hearken! if in your righteous souls abideth any love</a>
<a id='line_5700'>    Of lorn Amata; if your souls a mother's right may move,</a>
<a id='line_5701'>    Cast off the fillets from your locks, with me the madness bear."</a>
<a id='line_5702'></a>
<a id='line_5703'>    So through the woodland wilderness and deserts of the deer</a>
<a id='line_5704'>    Alecto drave the Queen around, with Bacchus' stings beset</a>
<a id='line_5705'>    But when she deemed enough was wrought that rage of hers to whet,</a>
<a id='line_5706'>    And that Latinus' rede and house was utterly undone,</a>
<a id='line_5707'>    Forthwith away on dusky wings is borne that evil one</a>
<a id='line_5708'>    Unto the bold Rutulian's wall: a city, saith the tale,</a>
<a id='line_5709'>    Raised up by Danaë for her Acrisian folks' avail                     410</a>
<a id='line_5710'>    When on the hurrying South she fled: Ardea in days of yore</a>
<a id='line_5711'>    Our fathers called it; nor as yet is name thereof passed o'er,</a>
<a id='line_5712'>    Though wealth be gone: there Turnus lay within his house on high,</a>
<a id='line_5713'>    And midmost sleep of dusky night was winning peacefully.</a>
<a id='line_5714'>    When there Alecto cruel face and hellish body shed,</a>
<a id='line_5715'>    And to an ancient woman's like her shape she fashionèd,</a>
<a id='line_5716'>    Wrinkling her forehead villanous; and hoary coifèd hair</a>
<a id='line_5717'>    She donned, and round about it twined the olive-garland fair,</a>
<a id='line_5718'>    And seemed the ancient Calybé of Juno's holy place;</a>
<a id='line_5719'>    And so with such a word she thrust before the hero's face:           420</a>
<a id='line_5720'></a>
<a id='line_5721'>    "Turnus, and wilt thou bear it now, such labour spent in vain,</a>
<a id='line_5722'>    And give thy folk to Dardan men, the outcasts of the main?</a>
<a id='line_5723'>    The King gainsays thy wedding couch, and dowry justly bought</a>
<a id='line_5724'>    By very blood, and for his throne an outland heir is sought.</a>
<a id='line_5725'>    Go, thou bemocked, and thrust thyself mid perils none shall thank;</a>
<a id='line_5726'>    For cloaking of the Latin peace o'erthrow the Tuscan rank!</a>
<a id='line_5727'>    The mighty Saturn's Seed herself hath bid me openly</a>
<a id='line_5728'>    To bear thee this, while thou in peace of middle night shouldst lie.</a>
<a id='line_5729'>    So up! be merry! arm the lads! bid wend from out the gate.</a>
<a id='line_5730'>    Up, up, and arm! The Phrygian folk who in the fair stream wait,</a>
<a id='line_5731'>    Burn thou their dukes of men with fire! burn every painted keel!</a>
<a id='line_5732'>    'Tis heavenly might that biddeth this. Let King Latinus feel</a>
<a id='line_5733'>    Thy strength, and learn to know at last what meaneth Turnus' sword,</a>
<a id='line_5734'>    Unless he grant the wedding yet, and hold his plighted word."</a>
<a id='line_5735'></a>
<a id='line_5736'>    But therewithal the young man spake, and answered her in scorn:</a>
<a id='line_5737'>    "Thou errest: tidings of all this failed nowise to be borne</a>
<a id='line_5738'>    Unto mine ears, how stranger ships the Tiber-flood beset.</a>
<a id='line_5739'>    Nay, make me not so sore afeared,--belike she minds me yet,</a>
<a id='line_5740'>    Juno, the Queen of Heaven aloft.</a>
<a id='line_5741'>    Nay, mother, Eld the mouldy-dull, the empty of all sooth,            440</a>
<a id='line_5742'>    Tormenteth thee with cares in vain, and mid the arms of kings</a>
<a id='line_5743'>    Bemocks the seer with idle shows of many fearful things.</a>
<a id='line_5744'>    Nay, 'tis for thee to watch God's house, and ward the images,</a>
<a id='line_5745'>    And let men deal with peace and war; for they were born for these."</a>
<a id='line_5746'></a>
<a id='line_5747'>    But at such word Alecto's wrath in utter fire outbrake;</a>
<a id='line_5748'>    A tremor ran throughout his limbs e'en as the word he spake;</a>
<a id='line_5749'>    Fixed stared his eyes, the Fury hissed with Serpent-world so dread,</a>
<a id='line_5750'>    And such a mighty body woke: then rolling in her head</a>
<a id='line_5751'>    Her eyes of flame, she thrust him back, stammering and seeking speech,</a>
<a id='line_5752'>    As on her head she reared aloft two adders each by each,             450</a>
<a id='line_5753'>    And sounded all her fearful whip, and cried from raving mouth:</a>
<a id='line_5754'></a>
<a id='line_5755'>    "Lo, I am she, the mouldy-dull, whom Eld, the void of sooth,</a>
<a id='line_5756'>    Bemocks amid the arms of kings with empty lies of fear!</a>
<a id='line_5757'>    Look, look! for from the Sisters' House, the Dread Ones, come I here;</a>
<a id='line_5758'>    And war and death I have in hand."</a>
<a id='line_5759'></a>
<a id='line_5760'>    She spake, and on the youth she cast her torch and set its blaze,</a>
<a id='line_5761'>    A mirky gleam of smoke-wreathed flame, amidmost of his heart:</a>
<a id='line_5762'>    And mighty dread his slumber brake, and forth from every part,</a>
<a id='line_5763'>    From bones and body, burst the sweat, and o'er his limbs 'gan fall;</a>
<a id='line_5764'>    And wild he cries for arms, and seeks for arms from bed and wall:    460</a>
<a id='line_5765'>    The sword-lust rageth in his soul, and wicked thirst of war.</a>
<a id='line_5766'>    So was it as at whiles it is, when with a mighty roar</a>
<a id='line_5767'>    The twiggen flame goes up about the hollow side of brass;</a>
<a id='line_5768'>    The water leapeth up therewith, within comes rage to pass,</a>
<a id='line_5769'>    The while the cloudy foaming flood spouts up a bubbling stir,</a>
<a id='line_5770'>    Until the sea refrains no more; the black cloud flies in air.</a>
<a id='line_5771'>    So to the dukes of men he shows how peace hath evil end,</a>
<a id='line_5772'>    And on Latinus biddeth them in weed of war to wend;</a>
<a id='line_5773'>    That they may save their Italy, and thrust the foemen forth.</a>
<a id='line_5774'>    And he will fare unto the field more than the twain of worth,        470</a>
<a id='line_5775'>    Teucrians and Latins: so he saith, and calls the Gods to aid.</a>
<a id='line_5776'>    Then eagerly Rutulian men to war and battle bade:</a>
<a id='line_5777'>    For some his glorious beauty stirred, and some his youth drave on,</a>
<a id='line_5778'>    And some his sires; and some were moved by deeds his hand had done.</a>
<a id='line_5779'></a>
<a id='line_5780'>    But while he fills Rutulian souls with love for glorious things,</a>
<a id='line_5781'>    Alecto to the Teucrians wends on Stygian-fashioned wings,</a>
<a id='line_5782'>    With fresh guile spying out the place where goodly on the shore,</a>
<a id='line_5783'>    With toils and speed 'gainst woodland beasts, Iulus waged the war.</a>
<a id='line_5784'>    Here for his hounds Cocytus' Maid a sudden madness blent,</a>
<a id='line_5785'>    Crossing the nostrils of the beasts with long familiar scent,        480</a>
<a id='line_5786'>    As eagerly they chased a hart. This first began the toil,</a>
<a id='line_5787'>    And kindled field-abiders' souls to war and deadly broil.</a>
<a id='line_5788'></a>
<a id='line_5789'>    There was a hart most excellent, a noble hornèd thing,</a>
<a id='line_5790'>    That Tyrrheus' sons had stolen from its own dam's cherishing,</a>
<a id='line_5791'>    And fostered: he, their father, had the kingly herd to heed,</a>
<a id='line_5792'>    And well was trusted far and wide, the warden of the mead.</a>
<a id='line_5793'>    But to their sister Sylvia's hand the beast was used, and oft</a>
<a id='line_5794'>    She decked him lovingly, and wreathed his horns with leafage soft,</a>
<a id='line_5795'>    And combed him oft, and washed him oft in water of the well.</a>
<a id='line_5796'>    Tame to her hand, and used enow amid manfolk to dwell,               490</a>
<a id='line_5797'>    He strayed the woods; but day by day betook him evermore,</a>
<a id='line_5798'>    Of his own will at twilight-tide, to that familiar door.</a>
<a id='line_5799'>    Him now Iulus' hunting hounds mad-eager chanced to stir</a>
<a id='line_5800'>    Afar from home, and floating whiles adown the river fair,</a>
<a id='line_5801'>    Or whiles on bank of grassy green beguiling summer's flame.</a>
<a id='line_5802'>    Therewith Ascanius, all afire with lust of noble fame,</a>
<a id='line_5803'>    Turned on the beast the spiky reed from out the curvèd horn;</a>
<a id='line_5804'>    Nor lacked the God to his right hand; on was the arrow borne</a>
<a id='line_5805'>    With plenteous whirr, and smote the hart through belly and through flank;</a>
<a id='line_5806'>    Who, wounded, to the well-known house fled fast, and groaning shrank</a>
<a id='line_5807'>    Into the stalls of his abode, and bloody, e'en as one                501</a>
<a id='line_5808'>    Who cries for pity, filled the place with woefulness of moan.</a>
<a id='line_5809'></a>
<a id='line_5810'>    Then first the sister Sylvia there, smiting her breast, cried out,</a>
<a id='line_5811'>    Calling to aid the hardy hearts of field-folk thereabout;</a>
<a id='line_5812'>    And swifter than the thought they came; for still that bitter Bane</a>
<a id='line_5813'>    Lurked in the silent woods: this man a half-burned brand did gain</a>
<a id='line_5814'>    For weapon; that a knotted stake: whate'er came first to hand,</a>
<a id='line_5815'>    The seeker's wrath a weapon made: there Tyrrheus cheers his band,</a>
<a id='line_5816'>    Come from the cleaving of an oak with foursome driven wedge,</a>
<a id='line_5817'>    Panting and fierce he tossed aloft the wood-bill's grinded edge.     510</a>
<a id='line_5818'>    But she, that Evil, on the watch, noting the death anigh,</a>
<a id='line_5819'>    Climbs up upon the stall-house loft, and from its roof on high</a>
<a id='line_5820'>    Singeth the shepherd's gathering sign, and through the crookèd horn</a>
<a id='line_5821'>    Sends voice of hell: and e'en therewith, as forth the notes were borne,</a>
<a id='line_5822'>    The forest trembled; the deep woods resounded; yea afar</a>
<a id='line_5823'>    The mere of Trivia heard the sound, and that white water, Nar,</a>
<a id='line_5824'>    That bears the sulphur down its stream; the Veline well-springs heard:</a>
<a id='line_5825'>    Mothers caught up their little ones, and trembled sore afeard.</a>
<a id='line_5826'>    Then hurrying at the voice sent forth by the dread war-horn's song,</a>
<a id='line_5827'>    The hardy-hearted folk of fields from everywhither throng,           520</a>
<a id='line_5828'>    With weapons caught in haste: and now the Trojan folk withal</a>
<a id='line_5829'>    Pour from their opened gates, and on to aid Ascanius fall.</a>
<a id='line_5830'>    And there the battle is arrayed; and now no war they wake,</a>
<a id='line_5831'>    Where field-folk strive with knotty club or fire-behardened stake;</a>
<a id='line_5832'>    But with the two-edged sword they strive: the meadows bristle black</a>
<a id='line_5833'>    With harvest of the naked steel: the gleaming brass throws back</a>
<a id='line_5834'>    Unto the clouds that swim aloft the smiting of the sun:</a>
<a id='line_5835'>    As when the whitening of the wind across the flood doth run,</a>
<a id='line_5836'>    And step by step the sea gets up, and higher heaps the wave,</a>
<a id='line_5837'>    Until heaven-high it sweeps at last up from its lowest cave.         530</a>
<a id='line_5838'></a>
<a id='line_5839'>    And here, by dint of whistling shaft in forefront of the fight,</a>
<a id='line_5840'>    A youth, e'en Tyrrheus' eldest son, by name of Almo hight,</a>
<a id='line_5841'>    Was laid alow: there in his throat the reedy bane abode,</a>
<a id='line_5842'>    And shut with blood the path of speech, the tender life-breath's road.</a>
<a id='line_5843'>    And many a body fell around: there, thrusting through the press</a>
<a id='line_5844'>    With peaceful word, Galæsus old died in his righteousness;</a>
<a id='line_5845'>    Most just of men; most rich erewhile of all Ausonian land:</a>
<a id='line_5846'>    Five flocks of bleaters once he had: five-fold came home to hand</a>
<a id='line_5847'>    His herds of neat: an hundred ploughs turned up the earth for him.   539</a>
<a id='line_5848'></a>
<a id='line_5849'>    But while they wrought these deeds of Mars mid doubtful fate and dim,</a>
<a id='line_5850'>    The Goddess, strong in pledge fulfilled, since she the war had stained</a>
<a id='line_5851'>    With very blood, and death of men in that first battle gained,</a>
<a id='line_5852'>    Leaveth the Westland, and upborne along the hollow sky,</a>
<a id='line_5853'>    To Juno such a word of pride sets forth victoriously:</a>
<a id='line_5854'></a>
<a id='line_5855'>    "Lo thou, the discord fashioned fair with misery of fight!</a>
<a id='line_5856'>    Come let them join in friendship now, and troth together plight!</a>
<a id='line_5857'>    But now, since I have sprinkled Troy with that Ausonian blood,</a>
<a id='line_5858'>    I will do more, if thereunto thy will abideth good;</a>
<a id='line_5859'>    For all the cities neighbouring to war my word shall bring,</a>
<a id='line_5860'>    And in their souls the love of Mars and maddening fire shall fling   550</a>
<a id='line_5861'>    Till all strike in, and all the lea crops of my sowing bear."</a>
<a id='line_5862'></a>
<a id='line_5863'>    But Juno answered: "Full enough there is of fraud and fear;</a>
<a id='line_5864'>    Fast stands the stumbling-block of war, and hand to hand they fight:</a>
<a id='line_5865'>    The sword that Fate first gave to them hath man's death stained aright</a>
<a id='line_5866'>    Forsooth let King Latinus now and Venus' noble son</a>
<a id='line_5867'>    Join hand to hand, and hold high feast for such a wedding won.</a>
<a id='line_5868'>    But thee, the Father of the Gods, lord of Olympus high,</a>
<a id='line_5869'>    Will nowise have a-wandering free beneath the worldly sky:</a>
<a id='line_5870'>    Give place; and whatso more of toil Fortune herein may make</a>
<a id='line_5871'>    Myself shall rule."                                                  560</a>
<a id='line_5872'>                        Such words as these Saturnian Juno spake,</a>
<a id='line_5873'>    And on the wing the Evil rose, with snaky sweeping whirr,</a>
<a id='line_5874'>    Seeking Cocytus' house, and left the light world's steep of air.</a>
<a id='line_5875'>    Midst Italy a place there is 'neath mountains high set down,</a>
<a id='line_5876'>    Whose noble tale in many a land hath fame and great renown,</a>
<a id='line_5877'>    The valley of Amsanctus called, hemmed in by woody steep</a>
<a id='line_5878'>    On either side, and through whose midst a rattling stream doth leap,</a>
<a id='line_5879'>    With clattering stones and eddying whirl: a strange den gapeth there,</a>
<a id='line_5880'>    The very breathing-hole of Dis; an awful place of fear,</a>
<a id='line_5881'>    A mighty gulf of baneful breath that Acheron hath made</a>
<a id='line_5882'>    When he brake forth: therein as now the baneful Fury laid            570</a>
<a id='line_5883'>    Her hated godhead, lightening so the load of earth and heaven.</a>
<a id='line_5884'></a>
<a id='line_5885'>    No less meanwhile did Saturn's Queen still turn her hand to leaven</a>
<a id='line_5886'>    That war begun. The shepherd folk rush from the battle-wrack</a>
<a id='line_5887'>    Into the city of the king, bearing their dead aback,</a>
<a id='line_5888'>    Almo the lad, Galæsus slain with changed befoulèd face.</a>
<a id='line_5889'>    They bid Latinus witness bear, and cry the Gods for grace.</a>
<a id='line_5890'>    Turnus is there, and loads the tale of bale-fire and the sword,</a>
<a id='line_5891'>    And swells the fear: "The land shall have a Teucrian host for lord:</a>
<a id='line_5892'>    With Phrygians shall ye foul your race and drive me from your door."</a>
<a id='line_5893'>    Then they, whose mothers midst the wood God Bacchus overbore,</a>
<a id='line_5894'>    To lead the dance--Amata's name being held in nowise light--         581</a>
<a id='line_5895'>    Together draw from every side, and weary for the fight.</a>
<a id='line_5896'>    Yea, all with froward heart and voice cry out for war and death,</a>
<a id='line_5897'>    That signs of heaven forbid so sore, that high God gainsayeth,</a>
<a id='line_5898'>    And King Latinus' house therewith beset they eagerly;</a>
<a id='line_5899'>    But he unmoved against them stands as crag amid the sea;</a>
<a id='line_5900'>    As crag amid the sea, that stands unmoved and huge to meet</a>
<a id='line_5901'>    The coming crash, while plenteously the waves bark round its feet:</a>
<a id='line_5902'>    Vain is the roaring on the rocks and rattling shingly crash,</a>
<a id='line_5903'>    The wrack from off its smitten sides falls down amid the wash.       590</a>
<a id='line_5904'></a>
<a id='line_5905'>    But when no might is given him their blindness to o'ercome,</a>
<a id='line_5906'>    And by the road fell Juno would the matter must win home,</a>
<a id='line_5907'>    Sore called the father on the Gods and emptiness of air:</a>
<a id='line_5908'>    "Ah, broken by the Fates," he cried, "amid the storm we bear!</a>
<a id='line_5909'>    Ye with your godless blood yourselves shall pay the penalty,</a>
<a id='line_5910'>    Unhappy men! But Turnus, thou, thine ill deed bideth thee</a>
<a id='line_5911'>    With woe enough, and overlate the Gods shalt thou adore.</a>
<a id='line_5912'>    For me, my rest is gained, my foot the threshold passeth o'er;</a>
<a id='line_5913'>    Yet is my happy ending spilled."</a>
<a id='line_5914'>                                      Nor further would he say;</a>
<a id='line_5915'>    But, hedged within his house, he cast the reins of rule away.        600</a>
<a id='line_5916'></a>
<a id='line_5917'>    In Latium of the Westland world a fashion was whilome,</a>
<a id='line_5918'>    Thence hallowed of the Alban folk, held holy thence by Rome,</a>
<a id='line_5919'>    Earth's mightiest thing: and this they used what time soe'er they woke</a>
<a id='line_5920'>    Mars unto battle; whether they against the Getic folk,</a>
<a id='line_5921'>    Ind, Araby, Hyrcanian men, fashioned the woeful wrack,</a>
<a id='line_5922'>    Or mid the dawn from Parthian men the banners bade aback.</a>
<a id='line_5923'>    For twofold are the Gates of War--still bear they such a name--</a>
<a id='line_5924'>    Hallowed by awe of Mars the dread, and worship of his fame,</a>
<a id='line_5925'>    Shut by an hundred brazen bolts, and iron whose avail</a>
<a id='line_5926'>    Shall never die: nor ever thence doth door-ward Janus fail.          610</a>
<a id='line_5927'>    Now when amid the Fathers' hearts fast is the war-rede grown,</a>
<a id='line_5928'>    The Consul, girt in Gabine wise, and with Quirinus gown</a>
<a id='line_5929'>    Made glorious, doth himself unbar the creaking door-leaves great,</a>
<a id='line_5930'>    And he himself cries on the war; whom all men follow straight,</a>
<a id='line_5931'>    The while their brazen yea-saying the griding trumpets blare.</a>
<a id='line_5932'></a>
<a id='line_5933'>    In e'en such wise Latinus now was bidden to declare</a>
<a id='line_5934'>    The battle 'gainst Æneas' folk, and ope the gates of woe.</a>
<a id='line_5935'>    But from their touch the Father shrank, and fleeing lest he do</a>
<a id='line_5936'>    The evil deed, in eyeless dark he hideth him away.</a>
<a id='line_5937'>    Then slipped the Queen of Gods from heaven, and ended their delay;</a>
<a id='line_5938'>    For back upon their hinges turned the Seed of Saturn bore            621</a>
<a id='line_5939'>    The tarrying leaves, and burst apart the iron Gates of War,</a>
<a id='line_5940'>    And all Ausonia yet unstirred brake suddenly ablaze:</a>
<a id='line_5941'>    And some will go afoot to field, and some will wend their ways</a>
<a id='line_5942'>    Aloft on horses dusty-fierce: all seek their battle-gear.</a>
<a id='line_5943'>    Some polish bright the buckler's face and rub the pike-point clear</a>
<a id='line_5944'>    With fat of sheep; and many an axe upon the wheel is worn.</a>
<a id='line_5945'>    They joy to rear the banners up and hearken to the horn.</a>
<a id='line_5946'>    And now five mighty cities forge the point and edge anew</a>

<a id='line_6077'></a>
<a id='line_6078'>    Then Umbro of the hardy heart went on the battle-way;                750</a>
<a id='line_6079'>    Priest was he of Marruvian folk; about his helm was bent</a>
<a id='line_6080'>    The happy olive, leaf and twig: him King Archippus sent:</a>
<a id='line_6081'>    Wont was he with his hand and voice the bitter viper-kind</a>
<a id='line_6082'>    And water-worms of evil breath in bonds of sleep to bind;</a>
<a id='line_6083'>    And he would soothe the wrath of them, and dull their bite by craft,</a>
<a id='line_6084'>    Yet nothing might he heal the hurt that came of Dardan shaft;</a>
<a id='line_6085'>    Nay, nothing might the sleepy song avail against his bane,</a>
<a id='line_6086'>    All herbs on Marsian mountains plucked were nought thereto and vain.</a>
<a id='line_6087'>    Anguitia's thicket wept for thee, Fucinus wave of glass,</a>
<a id='line_6088'>    The thin wan waters wept for thee.                                   760</a>
<a id='line_6089'></a>
<a id='line_6090'>    Most goodly Virbius went to war, Hippolytus' own son:</a>
<a id='line_6091'>    His mother fair Aricia sent this battle-glorious one</a>
<a id='line_6092'>    From fostering of Egeria's wood, from out the marish place</a>
<a id='line_6093'>    Where standeth Dian's altar rich fulfilled of plenteous grace.</a>
<a id='line_6094'>    For folk say, when Hippolytus, undone by step-dame's lie,</a>
<a id='line_6095'>    Had paid unto his father's wrath that utmost penalty,</a>
<a id='line_6096'>    He, piecemeal torn by maddened steeds, yet came aback to live</a>
<a id='line_6097'>    Beneath the starry firmament, and air that heaven doth give,</a>
<a id='line_6098'>    Brought back to life by healing herbs and Dian's cherishing:</a>
<a id='line_6099'>    Then the Almighty Father, wroth that any mortal thing                770</a>
<a id='line_6100'>    Should rise again to light of life from nether shadows wan,</a>
<a id='line_6101'>    Beat down with bolt to Stygian wave the Phoebus-gotten man,</a>
<a id='line_6102'>    The finder of such healing craft, the wise in such an art.</a>
<a id='line_6103'>    But Trivia's lovingkindness hid Hippolytus apart,</a>
<a id='line_6104'>    And in the nymph Egeria's wood she held him many a day:</a>
<a id='line_6105'>    Alone in woods of Italy he wore his life away,</a>
<a id='line_6106'>    Deedless, his very name all changed, and Virbius by-named then.</a>
<a id='line_6107'>    So for this cause to Trivia's fane and hallowed grove do men</a>
<a id='line_6108'>    Drive horn-foot steeds, because, o'ercome by sea-beasts dread of yore,</a>
<a id='line_6109'>    Piecemeal the chariot and the man they strewed about the shore.      780</a>
<a id='line_6110'>    No less his son would drive the steeds across the level plain</a>
<a id='line_6111'>    For all their heat, and rush to war aloft in battle-wain.</a>
<a id='line_6112'></a>
<a id='line_6113'>    Now mid the forefront Turnus self of body excellent,</a>
<a id='line_6114'>    Strode sword in hand: there by the head all others he outwent:</a>
<a id='line_6115'>    His threefold crested helm upbore Chimæra in her wrath;</a>
<a id='line_6116'>    Where very flame of Ætna's womb her jaws were pouring forth;</a>
<a id='line_6117'>    And fiercer of her flames was she, and madder of her mood</a>
<a id='line_6118'>    As bloomed the battle young again with more abundant blood.</a>
<a id='line_6119'>    But on the smoothness of his shield was golden Io shown</a>
<a id='line_6120'>    With upraised horns, with hairy skin, a very heifer grown,--         790</a>
<a id='line_6121'>    A noble tale;--and Argus there was wrought, the maiden's ward;</a>
<a id='line_6122'>    And father Inachus from bowl well wrought the river poured.</a>
<a id='line_6123'></a>
<a id='line_6124'>    A cloud of foot-folk follow him; his shielded people throng</a>
<a id='line_6125'>    The meadows all about; forth goes the Argive manhood strong;</a>
<a id='line_6126'>    Aruncan men and Rutuli, Sicanians of old years,</a>
<a id='line_6127'>    Sacranian folk, Labicus' band the blazoned shield-bearers:</a>
<a id='line_6128'>    Thy thicket-biders, Tiber; those that holy acres till</a>
<a id='line_6129'>    Beside Numicus, those that plough Rutulian holt and hill,</a>
<a id='line_6130'>    And ridges of Circæi: they whose meadows Anxur Jove</a>
<a id='line_6131'>    Looks down on, where Feronia joys amid her fair green grove;         800</a>
<a id='line_6132'>    Where Satura's black marish lies, where chilly Ufens glides,</a>
<a id='line_6133'>    Seeking a way through lowest dales, till in the sea he hides.</a>
<a id='line_6134'></a>
<a id='line_6135'>    And after these from Volscian folk doth fair Camilla pass,</a>
<a id='line_6136'>    Leading a mighty host of horse all blossoming with brass;</a>
<a id='line_6137'>    A warrior maid, whose woman's hands unused to ply the rock,</a>
<a id='line_6138'>    Unused to bear Minerva's crate, were wise in battle's shock.</a>
<a id='line_6139'>    The very winds might she outgo with hurrying maiden feet,</a>
<a id='line_6140'>    Or speed across the topmost blades of tall unsmitten wheat,</a>
<a id='line_6141'>    Nor ever hurt the tender ears below her as she ran;</a>
<a id='line_6142'>    Or she might walk the middle sea, and cross the welter wan,          810</a>
<a id='line_6143'>    Nor dip the nimble soles of her amid the wavy ways.</a>
<a id='line_6144'>    From house and field the youth pours forth to wonder and to gaze;</a>
<a id='line_6145'>    The crowd of mothers stands at stare all marvelling, and beholds</a>
<a id='line_6146'>    Her going forth; how kingly cloak of purple dye enfolds</a>
<a id='line_6147'>    Her shining shoulders, how the clasp of gold knots up her hair,</a>
<a id='line_6148'>    And how a quiver Lycian-wrought the Queen herself doth bear,</a>

<a id='line_6235'>    And duly in his hollow hand he lifted water fair                      69</a>
<a id='line_6236'>    From out the stream, and unto heaven in such wise poured his prayer:</a>
<a id='line_6237'></a>
<a id='line_6238'>    "O Nymphs, Laurentian Nymphs, from whence the race of rivers springs,</a>
<a id='line_6239'>    And thou, O father Tiber fair, with holy wanderings,</a>
<a id='line_6240'>    Cherish Æneas; thrust from me the bitter following bane,</a>
<a id='line_6241'>    What pool soe'er may nurse thy spring, O pityer of my pain,</a>
<a id='line_6242'>    From whatso land, O loveliest, thy stream may issue forth.</a>
<a id='line_6243'>    For ever will I give thee gifts, and worship well thy worth,</a>
<a id='line_6244'>    Horned river, of all Westland streams the very king and lord;</a>
<a id='line_6245'>    Only be with me; faster bind thy great God-uttered word."</a>
<a id='line_6246'></a>
<a id='line_6247'>    Thus having said, two twi-banked keels he chooseth from the fleet,</a>
<a id='line_6248'>    And mans the oars and dights his folk with gear and weapons meet.     80</a>
<a id='line_6249'></a>
<a id='line_6250'>    But lo meanwhile a wondrous sign is thrust before his eyes;</a>
<a id='line_6251'>    For on the green-sward of the wood a snow-white sow there lies</a>
<a id='line_6252'>    Down by the strand, her little ones, like-hued, about her pressed;</a>
<a id='line_6253'>    Whom god-loving Æneas slays to thee, O mightiest,</a>
<a id='line_6254'>    O Juno, at thine altar-fires hallowing both dam and brood.</a>
<a id='line_6255'></a>
<a id='line_6256'>    Now while the long night wore away, the swelling of his flood</a>
<a id='line_6257'>    Had Tiber soothed, and eddying back in peace the stream was stayed,</a>
<a id='line_6258'>    And in the manner of a mere the water's face was laid,</a>
<a id='line_6259'>    Or as a pool, that so the oars unstrained their work may ply.</a>
<a id='line_6260'>    So now they speed their journey forth amid a happy cry;               90</a>
<a id='line_6261'>    The oiled fir slips along the seas, the waves fall wondering then,--</a>
<a id='line_6262'>    The woods, unused, fall wondering sore to see the shields of men</a>
<a id='line_6263'>    Shine far up stream; to see the keels bepainted swimming there:</a>
<a id='line_6264'>    But day and night, with beat of oars, the watery way they wear,</a>
<a id='line_6265'>    And conquer reaches long, o'erlaid with many a shifting tree,</a>
<a id='line_6266'>    And cleave the forest fair and green along the waveless sea.</a>
<a id='line_6267'></a>
<a id='line_6268'>    Unto the midmost crown of heaven had climbed the fiery sun,</a>
<a id='line_6269'>    By then the walls, and far-off burg, and few roofs one by one</a>
<a id='line_6270'>    They see; the place raised high as heaven by mightiness of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_6271'>    Where in those days Evander had an unrich, scanty home:              100</a>
<a id='line_6272'>    So thither swift they turned their prows, and toward the city drew.</a>
<a id='line_6273'></a>
<a id='line_6274'>    That day it chanced the Arcadian King did yearly honour do</a>
<a id='line_6275'>    Unto Amphitryon's mighty son, and on the God did call</a>
<a id='line_6276'>    In grove before the city-walls: Pallas, his son, withal,</a>
<a id='line_6277'>    The battle-lords, the senate poor of that unwealthy folk</a>
<a id='line_6278'>    Cast incense there; with yet warm blood the altars were a-smoke.</a>
<a id='line_6279'>    But when they saw the tall ships glide amidst the dusky shade</a>
<a id='line_6280'>    Of woody banks, and might of men on oars all silent laid,</a>
<a id='line_6281'>    Scared at the sudden sight they rise, and all the boards forsake:</a>
<a id='line_6282'>    But Pallas, of the hardy heart, forbids the feast to break,          110</a>
<a id='line_6283'>    While he, with weapon caught in haste, flies forth to meet the men,</a>
<a id='line_6284'>    And crieth from a mound afar:</a>
<a id='line_6285'>                                  "Fellows, what drave you then?</a>
<a id='line_6286'>    And whither wend ye on your ways by road untried before?</a>
<a id='line_6287'>    What folk and from what home are ye? and is it peace or war?"</a>
<a id='line_6288'></a>
<a id='line_6289'>    Then spake the father Æneas the lofty deck aboard,</a>
<a id='line_6290'>    As with the peaceful olive-bough he reached his hand abroad;</a>
<a id='line_6291'>    "Troy's folk ye see and weapons whet against the Latin side,</a>
<a id='line_6292'>    Whom they have driven forth by war amid their plenteous pride.</a>
<a id='line_6293'>    We seek Evander: go ye forth and tell him this, and say</a>
<a id='line_6294'>    That chosen dukes of Troy are come for plighted troth to pray."      120</a>
<a id='line_6295'></a>
<a id='line_6296'>    The sound of such a mighty name smote Pallas with amaze:</a>
<a id='line_6297'>    "Come forth," he said, "whoso ye be: before my father's face</a>
<a id='line_6298'>    Say what ye would; come to our Gods and in our house be guest."</a>
<a id='line_6299'></a>
<a id='line_6300'>    So saying he gave his hand to him, and hard his right hand pressed;</a>
<a id='line_6301'>    Therewith they leave the river-bank, and wend amidst the wood:</a>
<a id='line_6302'>    But spake Æneas to the king fair friendly words and good:</a>
<a id='line_6303'></a>
<a id='line_6304'>    "O best of Greeks, whom fortune wills that I should now beseech,</a>
<a id='line_6305'>    And unto thee the suppliant staff of olive garlands reach,</a>
<a id='line_6306'>    I feared thee not for Arcas' seed or Duke of Danai,</a>
<a id='line_6307'>    Nor for thy being to Atreus' twins a kinsman born anigh:             130</a>
<a id='line_6308'>    Rather my heart, and holy words that Gods have given forth,</a>
<a id='line_6309'>    Our fathers' kin, the world-wide tale that goeth of thy worth,</a>
<a id='line_6310'>    Bind me to thee, and make me fain of what Fate bids befall.</a>
<a id='line_6311'>    Now Dardanus, first setter-up and sire of Ilian wall,</a>
<a id='line_6312'>    Born of Electra, Atlas' child, as Greekish stories say,</a>
<a id='line_6313'>    Came to the Teucrians: Atlas huge Electra gave today,</a>
<a id='line_6314'>    Atlas, who on his shoulders rears the round-wrought heavenly house:</a>
<a id='line_6315'>    But Mercury thy father is, whom Maia glorious</a>
<a id='line_6316'>    Conceived, and shed on earth one day on high Cyllene cold;</a>
<a id='line_6317'>    But Atlas Maia too begot, if we may trow tale told,                  140</a>
<a id='line_6318'>    That very Atlas who the stars of heavenly house doth raise,</a>
<a id='line_6319'>    So from one root the race of us wends on its twofold ways.</a>
<a id='line_6320'>    Stayed by these things none else I sent, nor guilefully have sought,</a>
<a id='line_6321'>    Assaying of thee, but myself unto thyself I brought,</a>
<a id='line_6322'>    And mine own head; and here I stand a suppliant at thy door.</a>
<a id='line_6323'>    And that same Daunian folk of men drive us with bitter war</a>
<a id='line_6324'>    As fall on thee: if us they chase, what stay but utterly,</a>
<a id='line_6325'>    (So deem they) all the Westland earth beneath their yoke shall lie,</a>
<a id='line_6326'>    With all the upper flood of sea, and nether waters' wash.</a>
<a id='line_6327'>    Take troth and give it: hearts are we stout in the battle's clash,   150</a>
<a id='line_6328'>    High-counselled souls, men well beheld in deeds that try the man."</a>
<a id='line_6329'></a>
<a id='line_6330'>    He ended: but Evander's look this long while overran</a>
<a id='line_6331'>    His face, his speaking eyes, and all his body fair to see;</a>
<a id='line_6332'>    Then in few words he answered thus:</a>
<a id='line_6333'>                                        "How sweet to welcome thee,</a>
<a id='line_6334'>    Best heart of Troy! and how I mind the words, and seem to hear</a>
<a id='line_6335'>    Anchises' voice, and see the face that mighty man did bear:</a>
<a id='line_6336'>    For I remember Priam erst, child of Laomedon,</a>
<a id='line_6337'>    Came to Hesione's abode, to Salamis passed on,</a>
<a id='line_6338'>    And thence would wend his ways to seek Arcadia's chilly place.</a>
<a id='line_6339'>    The blossom of the spring of life then bloomed upon my face,         160</a>
<a id='line_6340'>    When on the Teucrian lords I looked with joy and wonderment;</a>
<a id='line_6341'>    On Priam, too: but loftier there than any other went</a>
<a id='line_6342'>    Anchises; and his sight in me struck youthful love awake.</a>
<a id='line_6343'>    I yearned to speak unto the man, and hand in hand to take:</a>
<a id='line_6344'>    So fain I met him, led him in to Phineus' wallèd place;</a>
<a id='line_6345'>    And he, departing, gave to me a noble arrow-case</a>
<a id='line_6346'>    And Lycian shafts; a cloak thereto, all shot across with gold,</a>
<a id='line_6347'>    And golden bridles twain, that now Pallas, my son, doth hold.</a>
<a id='line_6348'>    Lo, then, the right hand that ye sought is joined in troth to thine;</a>
<a id='line_6349'>    And when tomorrow's light once more upon the world shall shine,      170</a>
<a id='line_6350'>    Glad, holpen, shall I send you forth and stay you with my store.</a>
<a id='line_6351'>    Meanwhile, since here ye come our friends, with us the Gods adore</a>
<a id='line_6352'>    At this our hallowed yearly feast, which ill it were to stay:</a>
<a id='line_6353'>    Be kind, and with your fellows' boards make friends without delay."</a>
<a id='line_6354'></a>
<a id='line_6355'>    Therewith he bids bring forth once more the wine-cups and the meat,</a>
<a id='line_6356'>    And he himself sets down the men upon a grassy seat;</a>
<a id='line_6357'>    But chiefly to the bed bedight with shaggy lion's skin</a>
<a id='line_6358'>    He draws Æneas, bidding him the throne of maple win.</a>
<a id='line_6359'>    Then vie the chosen youth-at-arms, the altar-priest brings aid;</a>
<a id='line_6360'>    They bear in roasted flesh of bulls, and high the baskets lade       180</a>
<a id='line_6361'>    With gifts of Ceres fashioned well, and serve the Bacchus' joy;</a>
<a id='line_6362'>    So therewithal Æneas eats and men-at-arms of Troy</a>
<a id='line_6363'>    Of undivided oxen chines and inwards of the feast.</a>
<a id='line_6364'>    But when the lust of meat was dulled and hunger's gnawing ceased,</a>
<a id='line_6365'>    Saith King Evander:</a>
<a id='line_6366'>                        "This high-tide that we are holding thus,</a>
<a id='line_6367'>    This ordered feast, this altar raised to God all-glorious,</a>
<a id='line_6368'>    No idle task of witch-work is, that knoweth not the Gods</a>
<a id='line_6369'>    Of ancient days: O Trojan chief, we, saved from fearful odds,</a>
<a id='line_6370'>    Here worship, and give glory new to deeds done gloriously.</a>
<a id='line_6371'>    Note first the crag, whose world of stones o'ertoppleth there anigh;  190</a>
<a id='line_6372'>    What stone-heaps have been cast afar, how waste and wild is grown</a>
<a id='line_6373'>    The mountain-house, what mighty wrack the rocks have dragged adown.</a>
<a id='line_6374'>    Therein a cave was erst, that back a long way burrowing ran,</a>
<a id='line_6375'>    Held by the dreadful thing, the shape of Cacus, monster-man.</a>
<a id='line_6376'>    A place the sun might never see, for ever warm and wet</a>
<a id='line_6377'>    With reek of murder newly wrought; o'er whose proud doorways set</a>
<a id='line_6378'>    The heads of men were hanging still wan mid the woeful gore.</a>
<a id='line_6379'>    Vulcan was father of this fiend; his black flame did he pour</a>
<a id='line_6380'>    Forth from his mouth, as monster-great he wended on his ways.</a>
<a id='line_6381'>    But to our aid, as whiles it will, brought round the lapse of days   200</a>
<a id='line_6382'>    The help and coming of a God: for that most mighty one,</a>
<a id='line_6383'>    All glorious with the death and spoils of threefold Geryon,</a>
<a id='line_6384'>    Alcides, our avenger came, driving the victor's meed,</a>
<a id='line_6385'>    His mighty bulls, who down the dale and river-bank did feed.</a>
<a id='line_6386'>    But Cacus, mad with furious heart, that nought undared might be</a>
<a id='line_6387'>    Of evil deeds, or nought untried of guile and treachery,</a>
<a id='line_6388'>    Drave from the fold four head of bulls of bodies excellent,</a>
<a id='line_6389'>    And e'en so many lovely kine, whose fashion all outwent;</a>
<a id='line_6390'>    Which same, that of their rightful road the footprints clean might lack,</a>
<a id='line_6391'>    Tail-foremost dragged he to his den, turning their way-marks back;   210</a>
<a id='line_6392'>    And so he hid them all away amid that stonydark,</a>
<a id='line_6393'>    Nor toward the cave might he that sought find any four-foot mark.</a>
<a id='line_6394'></a>
<a id='line_6395'>    "Meanwhile, his beasts all satiate, from fold Amphitryon's son</a>
<a id='line_6396'>    Now gets them ready for the road, and busks him to be gone;</a>
<a id='line_6397'>    When lo, the herd falls bellowing, and with its sorrow fills</a>
<a id='line_6398'>    The woodland as it goes away, and lowing leaves the hills.</a>
<a id='line_6399'>    Therewith a cow gave back the sound, and in the cavern hid</a>
<a id='line_6400'>    Lowed out, and in despite his heed all Cacus' hope undid.</a>
<a id='line_6401'>    Then verily Alcides' ire and gall of heart outbroke</a>
<a id='line_6402'>    In fury, and his arms he caught and weight of knotty oak,            220</a>
<a id='line_6403'>    And running, sought the hill aloft that thrusteth toward the skies.</a>
<a id='line_6404'>    Then first our folk saw Cacus scared and trouble in his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_6405'>    And in a twinkling did he flee, no eastern wind as fleet,</a>
<a id='line_6406'>    Seeking his den, and very fear gave wings unto his feet;</a>
<a id='line_6407'>    But scarcely was he shut therein, and, breaking down the chains,</a>
<a id='line_6408'>    Had dropped the monstrous rock that erst his crafty father's pains</a>
<a id='line_6409'>    Hung there with iron; scarce had he blocked the doorway with the same,</a>
<a id='line_6410'>    When lo, the man of Tiryns there, who with his heart aflame</a>
<a id='line_6411'>    Eyed all the entries, here and there turning about his face,</a>
<a id='line_6412'>    Gnashing his teeth: afire with wrath, thrice all that hilly place    230</a>
<a id='line_6413'>    Of Aventine he eyeth o'er, thrice tries without avail</a>
<a id='line_6414'>    The rocky door, thrice sits him down awearied in the dale.</a>
<a id='line_6415'></a>
<a id='line_6416'>    "There was a peakèd rock of flint with ragged edges dight,</a>
<a id='line_6417'>    Which at the cave's back rose aloft exceeding high to sight,</a>
<a id='line_6418'>    A dwelling meet for evil fowl amidst their nests to bide;</a>
<a id='line_6419'>    This, that hung o'er the brow above the river's leftward side,</a>
<a id='line_6420'>    Hard from the right he beareth on, and shakes, and from its roots</a>
<a id='line_6421'>    Wrencheth it loose, and suddenly adown the bent side shoots.</a>
<a id='line_6422'>    Then ringeth all the mighty heaven with thunder of its wrack,</a>
<a id='line_6423'>    The banks are rent, the frighted stream its waters casteth back;     240</a>
<a id='line_6424'>    But Cacus' den and kingly house showed all uncovered there,</a>
<a id='line_6425'>    The inmost of the shadowy cave was laid undoored and bare:</a>
<a id='line_6426'>    As if the inner parts of earth 'neath mighty stroke should gape,</a>
<a id='line_6427'>    Unlocking all the house of hell, showing that country's shape,</a>
<a id='line_6428'>    The wan land all forlorn of God: there shows the unmeasured pit,</a>
<a id='line_6429'>    And ghosts aquake with light of day shot through the depths of it.</a>
<a id='line_6430'></a>
<a id='line_6431'>    "But Cacus, caught unwares by day whereof he had no doubt,</a>
<a id='line_6432'>    Imprisoned in the hollow rock, in strange voice bellowing out,</a>
<a id='line_6433'>    Alcides fell on from above, calling all arms to aid,</a>
<a id='line_6434'>    And plenteous cast of boughs and stones upon the monster laid;       250</a>
<a id='line_6435'>    While he, since now no flight availed to 'scape that peril's hold,</a>
<a id='line_6436'>    Pours from his mouth a mighty smoke, O wondrous to be told!</a>
<a id='line_6437'>    Enwrapping all the house about with blinding misty shroud,</a>
<a id='line_6438'>    Snatching the sight from eyes of men, and rolling on the cloud,</a>
<a id='line_6439'>    A reeking night with heart of fire and utter blackness blent.</a>
<a id='line_6440'>    Alcides' spirit bore it nought; his body swift he sent</a>
<a id='line_6441'>    With headlong leap amid the fire where thickest rolled the wave</a>
<a id='line_6442'>    Of smoke, and with its pitchy mist was flooding all the cave;</a>
<a id='line_6443'>    Cacus he catcheth in the dark spueing out fire in vain,</a>
<a id='line_6444'>    And knitteth him in knot about, and, strangling him, doth strain     260</a>
<a id='line_6445'>    The starting eyes from out of him, and throat that blood doth lack:</a>
<a id='line_6446'>    Then the mirk house is opened wide; the doors are torn aback;</a>
<a id='line_6447'>    The stolen kine, that prey his oath foreswore to heaven are shown,</a>
<a id='line_6448'>    And by the feet is dragged today the body hideous grown;</a>
<a id='line_6449'>    Nor may men satiate their hearts by gazing on the thing;</a>
<a id='line_6450'>    His fearful eyes, the face of him, the man-beast's fashioning</a>
<a id='line_6451'>    Of bristled breast; those jaws of his, whence faded is the flame.</a>
<a id='line_6452'></a>
<a id='line_6453'>    "Hence is this honour celebrate, and they that after came</a>
<a id='line_6454'>    Still kept the day all joyfully; Potitius wrought it first,</a>
<a id='line_6455'>    This feast of mighty Hercules; the house Pinarian nursed,            270</a>

<a id='line_6462'>    He spake: the leaf of Hercules, the poplar coloured twain,</a>
<a id='line_6463'>    Shaded his hair; the leaves entwined hung down aback his head;</a>
<a id='line_6464'>    The holy beaker filled his hand: then merry all men sped,</a>
<a id='line_6465'>    And on the table poured their gift, and called the Gods to hear.</a>
<a id='line_6466'></a>
<a id='line_6467'>    Meanwhile unto the slopes of heaven the Western Star drew near,      280</a>
<a id='line_6468'>    And then the priests, and chief thereof, Potitius, thither came,</a>

<a id='line_6478'>    Troy and Oechalia: how he won through thousand toils o'ergreat,</a>
<a id='line_6479'>    That King Eurystheus laid on him by bitter Juno's fate.</a>
<a id='line_6480'>    "O thou Unconquered, thou whose hand beat down the cloud-born two,</a>
<a id='line_6481'>    Pholeus, Hylæus, twin-wrought things, and Cretan monsters slew:</a>
<a id='line_6482'>    O thou who slew'st the lion huge 'neath that Nemean steep,</a>
<a id='line_6483'>    The Stygian mere hath quaked at thee, the ward of Orcus deep</a>
<a id='line_6484'>    Quaked in his den above his bed of half-gnawed bones and blood.</a>
<a id='line_6485'>    At nothing fashioned wert thou feared; not when Typhoeus stood</a>
<a id='line_6486'>    Aloft in arms: nor from thine heart fell any rede away</a>
<a id='line_6487'>    When round thee headed-manifold the Worm of Lerna lay.               300</a>
<a id='line_6488'>    O very child of Jupiter, O Heaven's new glory, hail!</a>
<a id='line_6489'>    Fail not thy feast with friendly foot, nor us, thy lovers, fail!"</a>
<a id='line_6490'></a>
<a id='line_6491'>    With such-like song they sing the praise, and add to all the worth</a>
<a id='line_6492'>    The cave of Cacus, and the beast that breathed the wildfire forth.</a>
<a id='line_6493'>    The woods sing with them as they sing; the hills are light with song.</a>
<a id='line_6494'></a>
<a id='line_6495'>    So, all the holy things fulfilled, they wend their ways along</a>
<a id='line_6496'>    Unto the city: the old king afoot was with them there,</a>
<a id='line_6497'>    And bade Æneas and his son close to his side to fare,</a>
<a id='line_6498'>    And as he went made light the way with talk of many a thing.</a>
<a id='line_6499'>    Æneas wonders, and his eyes go lightly wandering                     310</a>
<a id='line_6500'>    O'er all; but here and there they stay, as, joyful of his ways,</a>
<a id='line_6501'>    He asks and hears of tokens left by men of earlier days.</a>
<a id='line_6502'></a>
<a id='line_6503'>    Then spake the King Evander, he who built up Rome of old:</a>
<a id='line_6504'>    "These woods the earth-born Fauns and Nymphs in time agone did hold,</a>
<a id='line_6505'>    And men from out the tree-trunk born and very heart of oak;</a>
<a id='line_6506'>    No fashion of the tilth they knew, nor how the bulls to yoke,</a>
<a id='line_6507'>    Nor how to win them store of wealth, or spare what they had got;</a>
<a id='line_6508'>    The tree-boughs only cherished them and rugged chase and hot.</a>
<a id='line_6509'>    Then from Olympus of the heavens first Saturn came adown,</a>
<a id='line_6510'>    Fleeing the war of Jupiter and kingdom overthrown:                   320</a>
<a id='line_6511'>    He laid in peace the rugged folk amid the mountains steep</a>
<a id='line_6512'>    Scattered about, and gave them laws, and willed them well to keep</a>
<a id='line_6513'>    The name of Latium, since he lay safe hidden on that shore.</a>
<a id='line_6514'>    They call the days the Golden Days that 'neath that king outwore,</a>
<a id='line_6515'>    Amid such happiness of peace o'er men-folk did he reign.</a>
<a id='line_6516'>    But worsened time as on it wore, and gathered many a stain;</a>
<a id='line_6517'>    And then the battle-rage was born, and lust of gain outbroke:</a>
<a id='line_6518'>    Then came the host Ausonian; then came Sicanian folk;</a>
<a id='line_6519'>    And oft and o'er again the land of Saturn cast its name.             329</a>
<a id='line_6520'>    Then kings there were, and Thybris fierce, of monstrous body came,</a>
<a id='line_6521'>    From whom the Tiber flood is named by us of Italy,</a>
<a id='line_6522'>    Its old true name of Albula being perished and gone by.</a>
<a id='line_6523'>    Me, driven from my land, and strayed about the ocean's ends,</a>
<a id='line_6524'>    Almighty Fortune and the Fate no struggling ever bends</a>
<a id='line_6525'>    Set in these steads; my mother's word well worshipped hither drave,</a>
<a id='line_6526'>    The nymph Carmentis; and a god, Apollo, wayfare gave."</a>
<a id='line_6527'></a>
<a id='line_6528'>    Now, as he spake, hard thereunto the altar-stead doth show,</a>
<a id='line_6529'>    And gate that by Carmentis' name the Roman people know;</a>
<a id='line_6530'>    An honour of the olden time to nymph Carmentis, she,</a>
<a id='line_6531'>    The faithful seer, who first foretold what mighty men should be      340</a>
<a id='line_6532'>    Æneas' sons; how great a name from Pallanteum should come.</a>
<a id='line_6533'>    Then the great grove that Romulus hallowed the fleer's home</a>
<a id='line_6534'>    He showeth, and Lupercal set beneath the cliff acold,</a>
<a id='line_6535'>    Called of Lycæan Pan in wise Parrhasia used of old.</a>
<a id='line_6536'>    Thereafter Argiletum's grove he shows and bids it tell,</a>
<a id='line_6537'>    A very witness, where and how the guesting Argus fell.</a>
<a id='line_6538'>    Next, then, to the Tarpeian stead and Capitol they went,</a>
<a id='line_6539'>    All golden now, but wild of yore with thickets' tanglement:</a>
<a id='line_6540'>    E'en then at its dread holiness the folk afield would quake</a>
<a id='line_6541'>    And tremble sore to look upon its cliff-besetting brake.             350</a>
<a id='line_6542'></a>
<a id='line_6543'>    "This grove," saith he, "this hill thou seest with thicket-covered brow,</a>
<a id='line_6544'>    Some godhead haunts, we know not who: indeed Arcadians trow</a>
<a id='line_6545'>    That very Jove they there have seen, when he his blackening shield</a>
<a id='line_6546'>    Hath shaken whiles and stirred the storm amidst the heavenly field.</a>
<a id='line_6547'>    Look therewithal on those two burgs with broken walls foredone!</a>
<a id='line_6548'>    There thou beholdest tokens left by folk of long agone:</a>
<a id='line_6549'>    For one did Father Janus old, and one did Saturn raise,</a>
<a id='line_6550'>    Janiculum, Saturnia, they hight in ancient days."</a>
<a id='line_6551'></a>
<a id='line_6552'>    Amid such talk they reach the roofs whereunder did abide</a>
<a id='line_6553'>    Unrich Evander; and they see the herd-beasts feeding wide            360</a>
<a id='line_6554'>    And lowing through the Roman Courts amid Carinæ's shine.</a>
<a id='line_6555'></a>
<a id='line_6556'>    But when they came unto the house, "Beneath these doors of mine</a>
<a id='line_6557'>    Conquering Alcides went," he said; "this king's house took him in.</a>
<a id='line_6558'>    Have heart to scorn world's wealth, O guest, and strive thou too to win</a>
<a id='line_6559'>    A godhead's worth: take thou no scorn of our unrich estate."</a>
<a id='line_6560'></a>
<a id='line_6561'>    He spake, and 'neath the narrow roof Æneas' body great</a>
<a id='line_6562'>    He led withal, and set him down; and such a bed was there</a>
<a id='line_6563'>    As 'twas of leaves, and overlaid with skin of Libyan bear.</a>
<a id='line_6564'></a>
<a id='line_6565'>    Night falleth, and its dusky wings spreads o'er the face of earth,</a>
<a id='line_6566'>    When Venus, fearful in her soul (nor less than fear 'twas worth),    370</a>
<a id='line_6567'>    Sore troubled by Laurentine threats and all the tumult dread,</a>
<a id='line_6568'>    Bespeaketh Vulcan, as she lay upon his golden bed,</a>
<a id='line_6569'>    And holiness of very love amidst her words she bore:</a>
<a id='line_6570'></a>
<a id='line_6571'>    "When Argive kings were wasting Troy predestined with their war,</a>
<a id='line_6572'>    Were wracking towers foredoomed to fall mid flames of hating men,</a>
<a id='line_6573'>    No help of thine for hapless ones, no arms I asked for then,</a>
<a id='line_6574'>    Wrought by thy craft and mastery: nor would I have thee spend</a>
<a id='line_6575'>    Thy labour, O beloved spouse, to win no happy end;</a>
<a id='line_6576'>    Though many things to Priam's house meseemeth did I owe,</a>
<a id='line_6577'>    And oftentimes I needs must weep Æneas' pain and woe.                380</a>
<a id='line_6578'>    But now that he by Jove's command Rutulian shores hath won,</a>
<a id='line_6579'>    I am thy suppliant, asking arms, a mother for her son,</a>
<a id='line_6580'>    Praying thy godhead's holiness: time was when Nereus' seed,</a>
<a id='line_6581'>    Tithonus' wife, with many tears could bend thee to thy need.</a>
<a id='line_6582'>    Look round, what peoples gather now; what cities shut within</a>
<a id='line_6583'>    Their barrèd gates are whetting sword to slay me and my kin."</a>
<a id='line_6584'></a>
<a id='line_6585'>    She spake: with snowy arms of God she fondled him about,</a>
<a id='line_6586'>    And wound him in her soft embrace, while yet he hung in doubt:</a>
<a id='line_6587'>    Sudden the wonted fire struck home; unto his inmost drew</a>
<a id='line_6588'>    The old familiar heat, and all his melting bones ran through:        390</a>
<a id='line_6589'>    No otherwise than whiles it is when rolls the thunder loud,</a>
<a id='line_6590'>    And gleaming of the fiery rent breaks up the world of cloud.</a>
<a id='line_6591'>    In glory of her loveliness she felt her guile had gained.</a>
<a id='line_6592'>    Then spake the Father, overcome by Love that ne'er hath waned:</a>
<a id='line_6593'></a>
<a id='line_6594'>    "Why fish thy reasons from the deep? where is thy trust in me,</a>
<a id='line_6595'>    I prithee, O my God and Love? Had such wish weighed on thee,</a>
<a id='line_6596'>    Then, also, had it been my part to arm the Teucrian hand,</a>
<a id='line_6597'>    Nor had the Almighty Sire nor Fate forbidden Troy to stand,</a>
<a id='line_6598'>    And Priam might have held it out another ten years yet.</a>
<a id='line_6599'>    And now if thou wouldst wage the war, if thus thy soul is set,       400</a>
<a id='line_6600'>    Thy longing shall have whatsoe'er this craft of mine may lend;</a>
<a id='line_6601'>    Whatever in iron may be done, or silver-golden blend;</a>
<a id='line_6602'>    Whatever wind and fire may do: I prithee pray no more,</a>
<a id='line_6603'>    But trust the glory of thy might."</a>
<a id='line_6604'>                                        So when his words wore o'er</a>
<a id='line_6605'>    He gave the enfolding that she would, and shed upon her breast</a>
<a id='line_6606'>    He lay, and over all his limbs he drew the sleepy rest.</a>
<a id='line_6607'>    But when the midmost night was worn, and slumber, past its prime,</a>
<a id='line_6608'>    Had faded out, in sooth it was that woman's rising-time,</a>
<a id='line_6609'>    Who needs must prop her life with rock and slender mastery           409</a>
<a id='line_6610'>    That Pallas gives: she wakes the ash and flames that smouldering lie,</a>
<a id='line_6611'>    And, adding night unto her toil, driveth her maids to win</a>
<a id='line_6612'>    Long task before its kindled light, that she may keep from sin</a>
<a id='line_6613'>    Her bride-bed; that her little ones well waxen-up may be.</a>
<a id='line_6614'>    Not otherwise that Might of Fire, no sluggard more than she,</a>
<a id='line_6615'>    To win his art and handicraft from that soft bed arose.</a>
<a id='line_6616'>    Upon the flank of Sicily there hangs an island close</a>
<a id='line_6617'>    To Lipari of Æolus, with shear-hewn smoky steep;</a>
<a id='line_6618'>    Beneath it thunder caves and dens Ætnæan, eaten deep</a>
<a id='line_6619'>    With forges of the Cyclops: thence men hear the anvils cry</a>
<a id='line_6620'>    'Neath mighty strokes, and through the cave the hissing sparkles fly  420</a>
<a id='line_6621'>    From iron of the Chalybes, and pants the forge with flame.</a>
<a id='line_6622'>    The house is Vulcan's, and the land Vulcania hath to name.</a>
<a id='line_6623'></a>
<a id='line_6624'>    Thither the Master of the Fire went down from upper air,</a>
<a id='line_6625'>    Where Cyclop folk in mighty den were forging iron gear;</a>
<a id='line_6626'>    Pyracmon of the naked limbs, Brontes and Steropes.</a>
<a id='line_6627'>    A thunderbolt half-fashioned yet was in the hands of these,</a>
<a id='line_6628'>    Part-wrought, suchwise as many an one the Father casts on earth</a>
<a id='line_6629'>    From all the heaven, but otherwhere unfinished from the birth,</a>
<a id='line_6630'>    Three rays they wrought of writhen storm, three of the watery wrack;</a>
<a id='line_6631'>    Nor do the three of ruddy flame nor windy winging lack:              430</a>
<a id='line_6632'>    And now the work of fearful flash, and roar, and dread they won,</a>
<a id='line_6633'>    And blent amid their craftsmanship the flame that followeth on.</a>
<a id='line_6634'>    But otherwhere they dight the wain and wingèd wheels of Mars,</a>
<a id='line_6635'>    Wherewith the men and walls of men he waketh up to wars.</a>
<a id='line_6636'>    There angry Pallas's arms they wrought and Ægis full of fear,</a>
<a id='line_6637'>    And set the gold and serpent scales, and did with mighty care</a>
<a id='line_6638'>    The knitted adders, and for breast of very God did deck</a>
<a id='line_6639'>    The Gorgon rolling eyen still above her severed neck.</a>
<a id='line_6640'>    "Do all away," he said, "lay by the labour so far done;</a>
<a id='line_6641'>    Cyclops of Ætna, turn your minds to this one thing alone:            440</a>
<a id='line_6642'>    Arms for a great man must be wrought; betake ye to your might;</a>
<a id='line_6643'>    Betake ye to your nimble hands and all your mastery's sleight,</a>
<a id='line_6644'>    And hurry tarrying into haste."</a>
<a id='line_6645'>                    No more he spake: all they</a>
<a id='line_6646'>    Fall swift to work and portion out the labour of the day:</a>
<a id='line_6647'>    The brazen rivers run about with metal of the gold,</a>
<a id='line_6648'>    And soft the Chalyb bane-master flows in the forges' hold.</a>
<a id='line_6649'>    A mighty shield they set on foot to match all weapons held</a>
<a id='line_6650'>    By Latin men, and sevenfold ring on ring about it weld.</a>
<a id='line_6651'>    Meanwhile, in windy bellows' womb some in the breezes take</a>
<a id='line_6652'>    And give them forth, some dip the brass all hissing in the lake,     450</a>
<a id='line_6653'>    And all the cavern is agroan with strokes on anvil laid.</a>
<a id='line_6654'>    There turn and turn about betwixt, with plenteous might to aid,</a>
<a id='line_6655'>    They rear their arms; with grip of tongs they turn the iron o'er.</a>
<a id='line_6656'></a>
<a id='line_6657'>    But while the Lemnian Father thus speeds on the Æolean shore</a>
<a id='line_6658'>    The lovely light Evander stirs amid his lowly house,</a>
<a id='line_6659'>    And morning song of eave-dwellers from sleep the king doth rouse.</a>
<a id='line_6660'>    Riseth that ancient man of days and on his kirtle does,</a>
<a id='line_6661'>    And both his feet he binds about with bonds of Tyrrhene shoes;</a>
<a id='line_6662'>    Then Tegeæan sword he girds to shoulder and to side,</a>
<a id='line_6663'>    And on the left he flings aback the cloak of panther-hide.           460</a>
<a id='line_6664'>    Moreover, from the threshold step goes either watchful ward,</a>
<a id='line_6665'>    Two dogs to wit, that follow close the footsteps of their lord.</a>
<a id='line_6666'>    So to the chamber of his guest the hero goes his way,</a>
<a id='line_6667'>    Well mindful of his spoken word and that well-promised stay.</a>
<a id='line_6668'>    Nor less Æneas was afoot betimes that morning-tide,</a>
<a id='line_6669'>    And Pallas and Achates went each one their lord beside.</a>
<a id='line_6670'>    So met, they join their right hands there and in the house sit down,</a>
<a id='line_6671'>    And win the joy of spoken words, that lawful now hath grown;</a>
<a id='line_6672'>    And thuswise speaks Evander first:</a>
<a id='line_6673'></a>
<a id='line_6674'>    "O mightiest duke of Trojan men,--for surely, thou being safe,       470</a>
<a id='line_6675'>    My heart may never more believe in Troy-town's vanquishing,--</a>
<a id='line_6676'>    The battle-help that I may give is but a little thing</a>
<a id='line_6677'>    For such a name: by Tuscan stream on this side are we bound;</a>
<a id='line_6678'>    On that side come Rutulian arms to gird our walls with sound.</a>
<a id='line_6679'>    But 'tis my rede to join to you a mighty folk of fight,</a>
<a id='line_6680'>    A wealthy lordship: chance unhoped this hope for us hath dight;</a>
<a id='line_6681'>    So draw thou thither whereunto the Fates are calling on.</a>
<a id='line_6682'>    Not far hence is a place of men, on rock of yore agone</a>
<a id='line_6683'>    Built up; Agylla's city 'tis, where glorious folk of war,</a>
<a id='line_6684'>    The Lydian folk, on Tuscan hills pitched their abode of yore.        480</a>
<a id='line_6685'>    A many years of blooming once they had, until the king</a>
<a id='line_6686'>    Mezentius held them 'neath his pride and cruel warfaring.</a>
<a id='line_6687'>    Why tell those deaths unspeakable, and many a tyrant's deed?</a>
<a id='line_6688'>    May the Gods store them for the heads of him and all his seed!</a>
<a id='line_6689'>    Yea, yea, dead corpses would he join to bodies living yet,</a>
<a id='line_6690'>    And hand to hand, O misery! and mouth to mouth would set;</a>
<a id='line_6691'>    There, drenched with gore and drenched with dew of death, must they abide,</a>
<a id='line_6692'>    A foul embrace unspeakable, and long and long they died.</a>
<a id='line_6693'>    Worn out at last, his folk in arms beset his house about,</a>
<a id='line_6694'>    And him therein all mad with rage, cut off his following rout,        490</a>
<a id='line_6695'>    And cast the wildfire therewithal over his roof on high:</a>
<a id='line_6696'>    But he, amidst the slaughter slipped, to fields of Rutuli</a>
<a id='line_6697'>    Made shift to flee, and there is held a guest by Turnus' sword.</a>
<a id='line_6698'>    So by just anger raised today Etruria is abroad,</a>
<a id='line_6699'>    Crying with Mars to aid, 'Give back the king to pay the cost!'</a>
<a id='line_6700'>    Æneas, I will make thee now the captain of their host:</a>
<a id='line_6701'>    For down the whole coast goes the roar from out their ship-host's pack;</a>

<a id='line_6725'>    Scarce had he said, and still their gaze unto the earth did cling,   520</a>
<a id='line_6726'>    Æneas of Anchises born and his Achates true,</a>
<a id='line_6727'>    For many thoughts of matters hard their minds were running through,</a>
<a id='line_6728'>    When Cytherea gave a sign amid the open sky;</a>
<a id='line_6729'>    For from the left a flash of light went quivering suddenly,</a>
<a id='line_6730'>    And sound went with it, and all things in utter turmoil fared,</a>
<a id='line_6731'>    And clangour of the Tyrrhene trump along the heavens blared.</a>
<a id='line_6732'>    They look up; ever and anon a mighty clash they hear,</a>
<a id='line_6733'>    And gleams they see betwixt the clouds, amid the sky-land clear,</a>
<a id='line_6734'>    The glitter of the arms of God, the thunder of their clang.</a>
<a id='line_6735'></a>
<a id='line_6736'>    The man of Troy, while others' hearts amazed and fearful hang,       530</a>
<a id='line_6737'>    Knoweth the sound, the promised help, his Goddess-mother's meed.</a>
<a id='line_6738'>    He saith: "Yea, verily, O host, to ask is little need</a>
<a id='line_6739'>    What hap this portent draweth on: the Gods will have me wend;</a>
<a id='line_6740'>    The God that made me promised erst such heavenly signs to send</a>
<a id='line_6741'>    If war were toward; and through the sky she promised to bear down</a>
<a id='line_6742'>    Arms Vulcan-fashioned for my need.</a>
<a id='line_6743'>    Woe's me for poor Laurentium's folk! what death, what bloody graves!</a>
<a id='line_6744'>    --Ah, Turnus, thou shalt pay it me!--how many 'neath thy waves,</a>
<a id='line_6745'>    O Father Tiber, shalt thou roll the shields and helms of men,</a>
<a id='line_6746'>    And bodies of the mighty ones! Cry war, oath-breakers, then!"        540</a>
<a id='line_6747'></a>
<a id='line_6748'>    And as he spake the word he rose from off the lofty throne,</a>
<a id='line_6749'>    And the slaked fire of Hercules roused on the altar-stone;</a>
<a id='line_6750'>    And joyfully he drew anear the God of yesterday</a>
<a id='line_6751'>    And little House-Gods: chosen ewes in manner due they slay,</a>
<a id='line_6752'>    Evander and the youth of Troy together side by side.</a>
<a id='line_6753'>    Then to the ships they wend their ways, where yet their fellows bide:</a>
<a id='line_6754'>    There men to follow him in fight he chooseth from the peers,</a>
<a id='line_6755'>    The flower of hardy hearts; the rest the downlong water bears;</a>
<a id='line_6756'>    Deedless they swim adown the stream, Ascanius home to bring</a>
<a id='line_6757'>    The tidings of his coming sire and matters flourishing.              550</a>
<a id='line_6758'></a>
<a id='line_6759'>    But horses get such Teucrian men as are for Tyrrhene mead;</a>
<a id='line_6760'>    By lot they choose Æneas one which yellow lion's weed</a>
<a id='line_6761'>    Goes all about; full fair it shone, for it was golden-clawed.</a>
<a id='line_6762'>    Then sudden through the little town the rumour flies abroad,</a>
<a id='line_6763'>    That knights will speedily ride forth to Tyrrhene kingly stead.</a>
<a id='line_6764'>    Then fear redoubleth mothers' prayers, and nigher draweth dread</a>
<a id='line_6765'>    In peril's hand, and greater still the face of Mars doth grow.</a>
<a id='line_6766'></a>
<a id='line_6767'>    Father Evander strains the hand of him that needs must go,</a>
<a id='line_6768'>    Clinging with tears insatiate, and such a word doth say:</a>
<a id='line_6769'>    "O me! would Jove bring back again the years long worn away!         560</a>
<a id='line_6770'>    Were I as when the foremost foes upon Præneste's field</a>
<a id='line_6771'>    I felled, and burnt victoriously a heap of shield on shield:</a>
<a id='line_6772'>    When with this very hand I sent King Herilus to Hell,</a>
<a id='line_6773'>    Whose dam, Feronia, at his birth,--wild is the tale to tell,--</a>
<a id='line_6774'>    Had given him gift of threefold life; three times the sword to shake,</a>
<a id='line_6775'>    And thrice to fall upon the field: yet did this right hand take</a>
<a id='line_6776'>    That threefold life away from him, thrice spoiled him of his gear.</a>
<a id='line_6777'>    O were I such, ne'er would I break from thine embracing dear,</a>
<a id='line_6778'>    O son; nor had Mezentius erst, the tyrant neighbour lord,</a>
<a id='line_6779'>    In my despite so many deaths wrought with his cruel sword,           570</a>
<a id='line_6780'>    Nor widowed this our city here of such a host of sons.</a>
<a id='line_6781'>    But ye, O Gods!--thou Mightiest, King of all heavenly ones,</a>
<a id='line_6782'>    O Jove, have pity now, I pray, upon the Arcadian King,</a>
<a id='line_6783'>    And hear a father's prayers! for if your mighty governing,--</a>
<a id='line_6784'>    If Fate shall keep my Pallas safe, and I may live to see</a>
<a id='line_6785'>    His face again,--if he return to keep our unity,</a>
<a id='line_6786'>    Then may I live, and any toil, such as ye will, abide!</a>
<a id='line_6787'>    But, Fortune, if thou threatenest ill, and misery betide,</a>
<a id='line_6788'>    Then let me now, yea, now indeed, the cruel life break through,</a>
<a id='line_6789'>    While yet my fear is unfulfilled and hope may yet come true;         580</a>
<a id='line_6790'>    While thee, belovèd joy of eld, I wrap mine arms around,</a>
<a id='line_6791'>    Ere yet the tale of evil hap mine ancient ears may wound."</a>
<a id='line_6792'></a>
<a id='line_6793'>    Thus at their last departing-tide the father poured the prayer,</a>
<a id='line_6794'>    Whom, fainting now, the serving-men back within doors must bear;</a>
<a id='line_6795'>    While forth from out the open gate the host of horsemen ride,</a>
<a id='line_6796'>    Æneas and Achates leal in forefront of their pride,</a>
<a id='line_6797'>    And then the other Trojan lords: amidst the company,</a>
<a id='line_6798'>    In cloak adorned and painted arms, was Pallas fair to see:</a>
<a id='line_6799'>    E'en such as Lucifer, when he bathed in the ocean stream,</a>
<a id='line_6800'>    The light beloved of Venus well o'er every starry beam,              590</a>
<a id='line_6801'>    Hath raised his holy head in heaven and down the darkness rent.</a>
<a id='line_6802'>    The fearful mothers on the walls their eyen after sent,</a>
<a id='line_6803'>    Following the dusty cloud of them and ranks of glittering brass.</a>
<a id='line_6804'>    But mid the thicket places there by nighest road they pass</a>
<a id='line_6805'>    Unto their end in weed of war: with shout and serried band</a>
<a id='line_6806'>    The clattering hooves of four-foot things shake down the dusty land.</a>
<a id='line_6807'></a>
<a id='line_6808'>    There is a mighty thicket-place by chilly Cæres' side,</a>
<a id='line_6809'>    By ancient dread of fathers gone held holy far and wide:</a>
<a id='line_6810'>    A place that hollow hills shut in and pine-wood black begirds.</a>
<a id='line_6811'>    Men say that to Silvanus erst, the God of fields and herds,          600</a>
<a id='line_6812'>    The old Pelasgi hallowed it, and made a holy day,</a>
<a id='line_6813'>    E'en those who in the time agone on Latin marches lay.</a>
<a id='line_6814'>    No great way hence the Tuscan folk and Tarcho held them still</a>
<a id='line_6815'>    In guarded camp; the host of them from rising of a hill</a>
<a id='line_6816'>    Might now be seen, as far and wide they spread about the field.</a>
<a id='line_6817'>    Father Æneas and his folk, the mighty under shield,</a>
<a id='line_6818'>    Speed hither, and forewearied now their steeds and bodies tend.</a>
<a id='line_6819'>    But through the clouds of heavenly way doth fair white Venus wend,</a>
<a id='line_6820'>    Bearing the gift; who when she saw in hidden valley there</a>
<a id='line_6821'>    Her son afar, apart from men by river cool and fair,                 610</a>
<a id='line_6822'>    Then kind she came before his eyes, and in such words she spake:</a>
<a id='line_6823'>    "These promised gifts, my husband's work, O son, I bid thee take:</a>
<a id='line_6824'>    So shalt thou be all void of doubt, O son, when presently</a>
<a id='line_6825'>    Laurentines proud and Turnus fierce thou bidst the battle try."</a>
<a id='line_6826'></a>
<a id='line_6827'>    So spake the Cytherean one and sought her son's embrace,</a>
<a id='line_6828'>    And hung the beaming arms upon an oak that stood in face.</a>
<a id='line_6829'>    But he, made glad by godhead's gift, and such a glory great,</a>
<a id='line_6830'>    Marvelleth and rolleth o'er it all his eyes insatiate,</a>
<a id='line_6831'>    And turns the pieces o'er and o'er his hands and arms between;</a>
<a id='line_6832'>    The helm that flasheth flames abroad with crest so dread beseen:     620</a>
<a id='line_6833'>    The sword to do the deeds of Fate; the hard-wrought plates of brass,</a>
<a id='line_6834'>    Blood-red and huge; yea, e'en as when the bright sun brings to pass</a>
<a id='line_6835'>    Its burning through the coal-blue clouds and shines o'er field and fold:</a>
<a id='line_6836'>    The light greaves forged and forged again of silver-blend and gold:</a>
<a id='line_6837'>    The spear, and, thing most hard to tell, the plating of the shield.</a>
<a id='line_6838'>    For there the tale of Italy and Roman joy afield</a>
<a id='line_6839'>    That Master of the Fire had wrought, not unlearned of the seers,</a>
<a id='line_6840'>    Or blind to see the days before. The men of coming years,</a>
<a id='line_6841'>    Ascanius stem, all foughten fields, were wrought in due array.</a>
<a id='line_6842'></a>
<a id='line_6843'>    In the green den of Mavors there the fostering she-wolf lay,         630</a>
<a id='line_6844'>    The twin lads sporting round the beast, clung to her udders there,</a>
<a id='line_6845'>    And sucked the nursing mother-wolf, and nothing knew of fear;</a>
<a id='line_6846'>    But she, with lithe neck turned about, now this now that caressed,</a>
<a id='line_6847'>    And either body with her tongue for hardy shaping pressed.</a>
<a id='line_6848'>    Rome had he done anigh thereto and Sabine maidens caught</a>
<a id='line_6849'>    From concourse of the hollow seats when roundway games were wrought</a>
<a id='line_6850'>    There for the sons of Romulus the sudden war upstarts</a>
<a id='line_6851'>    With Tatius, the old king of days, and Cures' hardy hearts.</a>
<a id='line_6852'>    Then those two kings, the battle quenched, yet clad in battle-gear,</a>
<a id='line_6853'>    Stand with the bowl in hand before the fire of Jupiter,              640</a>
<a id='line_6854'>    As each to each o'er slaughtered sow the troth of peace they plight.</a>
<a id='line_6855'></a>
<a id='line_6856'>    Anigh is Metius piecemeal dragged by foursome chariots light.</a>
<a id='line_6857'>    --Ah, Alban, by the troth of words 'twere better to abide!--</a>

<a id='line_6859'>    Nor sprinkling of a traitor's blood the bramble-bushes lack.</a>
<a id='line_6860'></a>
<a id='line_6861'>    There was Porsena bidding men take outcast Tarquin back,</a>
<a id='line_6862'>    The while his mighty leaguer lay about the city's weal.</a>
<a id='line_6863'>    For freedom there Æneas' sons were rushing on the steel:</a>
<a id='line_6864'>    As full of wrath, as one who threats, might ye behold his frown,</a>
<a id='line_6865'>    Because that Cocles was of heart to break the bridge adown;          650</a>
<a id='line_6866'>    And Cloelia from her bursten bonds was swimming o'er the flood.</a>
<a id='line_6867'></a>
<a id='line_6868'>    On topmost of Tarpeian burg the warden Manlius stood</a>
<a id='line_6869'>    Before the house of God, and held the Capitol high-set;</a>
<a id='line_6870'>    Whereon with straw of Romulus the roof was bristling yet.</a>
<a id='line_6871'>    There fluttering mid the golden porch the silver goose was done,</a>
<a id='line_6872'>    The seer that told of Gaulish feet unto the threshold won:</a>
<a id='line_6873'>    Then through the brake the Gauls were come, and held the castle's height,</a>
<a id='line_6874'>    Beneath the shielding of the mirk and gift of shadowy night.</a>
<a id='line_6875'>    All golden are the locks of these, and golden is their gear,         659</a>

<a id='line_6877'>    The twisted gold; each one in hand two Alpine spears doth wield,</a>

<a id='line_6879'></a>
<a id='line_6880'>    The Salii in their dancing game; the naked Luperci,</a>
<a id='line_6881'>    With crests that bore the tuft of wool and shields from out the sky,</a>
<a id='line_6882'>    There had he wrought: the mothers chaste in softly-gliding car</a>

<a id='line_6888'></a>
<a id='line_6889'>    The image of the swelling sea amidst of these there lay</a>
<a id='line_6890'>    All golden, with the blue o'erfoamed with flecks of hoary spray,</a>
<a id='line_6891'>    And dolphins shining silver-white with tail-stroke swept the wave,</a>

<a id='line_6893'>    And in the midst were brazen fleets and show of Actium's wars</a>
<a id='line_6894'>    And all Leucate set a-boil with ordered game of Mars</a>

<a id='line_6896'>    Augustus Cæsar, leading on Italian men to fight</a>
<a id='line_6897'>    With Father-folk, and Household Gods, and Gods of greater name,</a>
<a id='line_6898'>    Stood high on deck: his joyful brow flashed forth a twofold flame,   680</a>

<a id='line_6924'></a>
<a id='line_6925'>    All this Apollo, Actian-housed, beheld, and bent his bow</a>

<a id='line_6966'>    Now while a long way off therefrom do these and those such deed,</a>
<a id='line_6967'>    Saturnian Juno Iris sends from heaven aloft to speed</a>

<a id='line_6976'>    Nay more, hath reached the utmost steads, the towns of Corythus       10</a>

<a id='line_6983'>    The warrior knew her, and to heaven he cast up either hand,</a>
<a id='line_6984'>    And with such voice of spoken things he followed as she fled:</a>
<a id='line_6985'>    "O Iris, glory of the skies, and who thy ways hath sped</a>
<a id='line_6986'>    Amidst the clouds to earth and me? Whence this so sudden clear</a>
<a id='line_6987'>    Of weather? Lo, the midmost heaven I see departed shear,              20</a>
<a id='line_6988'>    And through the zenith stray the stars: such signs I follow on,</a>
<a id='line_6989'>    Whoso ye be that call to war."</a>
<a id='line_6990'>                                    And therewithal he won</a>
<a id='line_6991'>    Unto the stream, and from its face drew forth the water fair,</a>
<a id='line_6992'>    Praying the Gods, and laid a load of vows upon the air.</a>
<a id='line_6993'></a>
<a id='line_6994'>    And now the host drew out to war amid the open meads,</a>
<a id='line_6995'>    With wealth of painted gear and gold, and wealth of noble steeds.</a>
<a id='line_6996'>    Messapus leads the first array, and Tyrrheus' children ward</a>
<a id='line_6997'>    The latter host, and in the midst is Turnus' self the lord.</a>
<a id='line_6998'>    Such is the host as Ganges deep, arising mid the hush</a>
<a id='line_6999'>    With sevenfold rivers' solemn flow, or Nile-flood's fruitful rush,    30</a>
<a id='line_7000'>    When he hath ebbed from off the fields and hid him in his bed.</a>
<a id='line_7001'></a>
<a id='line_7002'>    But now the Teucrians see the cloud of black dust grow to head</a>
<a id='line_7003'>    From far away, and dusty-dark across the plain arise:</a>
<a id='line_7004'>    And first from off the mound in face aloud Caïcus cries:</a>
<a id='line_7005'>    "Ho! what is this that rolleth on, this misty, mirky ball?</a>
<a id='line_7006'>    Swords, townsmen, swords! Bring point and edge; haste up to climb the wall.</a>
<a id='line_7007'>    Ho, for the foeman is at hand!"</a>
<a id='line_7008'>                                    Then, with a mighty shout,</a>
<a id='line_7009'>    The Trojans swarm through all the gates and fill the walls about;</a>
<a id='line_7010'>    For so Æneas, war-lord wise, had bidden them abide</a>
<a id='line_7011'>    At his departing; if meantime some new hap should betide,             40</a>
<a id='line_7012'>    They should not dare nor trust themselves to pitch the fight afield,</a>
<a id='line_7013'>    But hold the camp and save the town beneath the ramparts' shield.</a>
<a id='line_7014'>    Therefore, though shame and anger bade go forth and join the play,</a>
<a id='line_7015'>    They bolt and bar the gates no less and all his word obey;</a>
<a id='line_7016'>    And armed upon the hollow towers abide the coming foe.</a>
<a id='line_7017'></a>
<a id='line_7018'>    But Turnus, flying forward fast, outwent the main host slow,</a>
<a id='line_7019'>    And with a score of chosen knights is presently at hand</a>
<a id='line_7020'>    Before the town: borne on he was on horse of Thracian land,</a>
<a id='line_7021'>    White-flecked, and helmeted was he with ruddy-crested gold.</a>
<a id='line_7022'>    "Who will be first with me, O youths, play with the foe to hold?      50</a>
<a id='line_7023'>    Lo, here!" he cried; and on the air a whirling shaft he sent,</a>
<a id='line_7024'>    The first of fight, and borne aloft about the meadows went.</a>
<a id='line_7025'>    His fellows take it up with shouts, and dreadful cry on rolls</a>
<a id='line_7026'>    As fast they follow, wondering sore at sluggard Teucrian souls,--</a>
<a id='line_7027'>    That men should shun the battle pitched, nor dare the weapon-game,</a>
<a id='line_7028'>    But hug their walls. So round the walls, high-horsed, with heart aflame,</a>
<a id='line_7029'>    He rides about, and tries a way where never was a way:</a>
<a id='line_7030'>    E'en as a wolf the sheep-fold full besetteth on a day,</a>
<a id='line_7031'>    And howleth round about the garth, by wind and rain-drift beat,</a>
<a id='line_7032'>    About the middle of the night, while safe the lamb-folk bleat         60</a>
<a id='line_7033'>    Beneath their mothers: wicked-fierce against them safe and near</a>
<a id='line_7034'>    He rageth; hunger-madness long a-gathering him doth wear,</a>
<a id='line_7035'>    With yearning for that blood beloved to wet his parchèd jaws.</a>
<a id='line_7036'>    E'en so in that Rutulian duke to flame the anger draws,</a>
<a id='line_7037'>    As he beholdeth walls and camp: sore burnt his hardy heart</a>
<a id='line_7038'>    For shifts to come at them; to shake those Teucrians shut apart</a>
<a id='line_7039'>    From out their walls and spread their host about the meadows wide.</a>
<a id='line_7040'></a>
<a id='line_7041'>    So on the ships he falls, that lay the campment's fence beside,</a>
<a id='line_7042'>    Hedged all about with garth and mound and by the river's flood,</a>
<a id='line_7043'>    And to the burning crieth on his folk of joyous mood,                 70</a>
<a id='line_7044'>    And eager fills his own right hand with branch of blazing fir:</a>
<a id='line_7045'>    Then verily they fall to work whom Turnus' gaze doth stir,</a>
<a id='line_7046'>    And all the host of them in haste hand to the black torch lays.</a>
<a id='line_7047'>    They strip the hearths; the smoky brand sends forth pitch-laden blaze,</a>
<a id='line_7048'>    And starward soot-bemingled flame drave Vulcan as he burned.</a>
<a id='line_7049'></a>
<a id='line_7050'>    Say, Muse, what God from Teucrian folk such sore destruction turned?</a>
<a id='line_7051'>    Who drave away from Trojan keels so mighty great a flame?</a>
<a id='line_7052'>    Old is the troth in such a tale, but never dies its fame.</a>
<a id='line_7053'>    What time Æneas first began on Phrygian Ida's steep</a>
<a id='line_7054'>    To frame his ships, and dight him there to ride upon the deep,        80</a>
<a id='line_7055'>    The Berecynthian Mother-Queen spake, as the tale doth fare,</a>
<a id='line_7056'>    Unto the Godhead of great Jove:</a>
<a id='line_7057'>                                    "Son, grant unto my prayer</a>
<a id='line_7058'>    That which thy lovèd mother asks from heaven all tamed to peace:</a>
<a id='line_7059'>    A wood of pines I have, beloved through many years' increase.</a>
<a id='line_7060'>    There is a thicket on my height wherein men worship me,</a>
<a id='line_7061'>    Dim with the blackening of the firs and trunks of maple-tree:</a>
<a id='line_7062'>    These to the Dardan youth in need of ship-host grudged I nought,</a>
<a id='line_7063'>    But in my anxious soul as now is born a troubling thought.</a>
<a id='line_7064'>    Do off my dread, and let, I pray, a mother's prayers avail,</a>
<a id='line_7065'>    That these amid no shattering sea or whirling wind may fail;          90</a>
<a id='line_7066'>    Let it avail them that my heights first brought them unto birth."</a>
<a id='line_7067'></a>
<a id='line_7068'>    Answered her son, that swayeth still the stars that rule the earth:</a>
<a id='line_7069'>    "O mother, whither call'st thou Fate? what wouldst thou have them be?</a>
<a id='line_7070'>    Shall keels of mortal fashioning gain immortality?</a>
<a id='line_7071'>    And shall Æneas well assured stray every peril through?</a>
<a id='line_7072'>    Shall this be right? hath any God the power such things to do?</a>
<a id='line_7073'>    No less when they have done their work, and safe in Italy</a>
<a id='line_7074'>    Lie in the haven, which soe'er have overpassed the sea,</a>
<a id='line_7075'>    And borne the Duke of Dardan men to that Laurentine home,</a>
<a id='line_7076'>    From such will I take mortal shape, and bid them to become           100</a>
<a id='line_7077'>    Queens of the sea-plain, such as are Doto the Nereus child,</a>
<a id='line_7078'>    And Galatea, whose bosoms cleave the foaming waters wild."</a>
<a id='line_7079'></a>
<a id='line_7080'>    He spake and swore it by the flood his Stygian Brother rules,</a>
<a id='line_7081'>    And by its banks that reek with pitch o'er its black whirling pools,</a>
<a id='line_7082'>    And with the bowing of his head did all Olympus shake.</a>
<a id='line_7083'></a>
<a id='line_7084'>    And now the promised day was come, nor will the Parcæ break</a>
<a id='line_7085'>    The time fulfilled; when Turnus' threat now bade the Mother heed</a>
<a id='line_7086'>    That she from those her holy ships should turn the fire at need.</a>
<a id='line_7087'>    Strange light before the eyes of men shone forth; a mighty cloud</a>
<a id='line_7088'>    Ran from the dawning down the sky, and there was clashing loud       110</a>
<a id='line_7089'>    Of Ida's hosts, and from the heavens there fell a voice of fear,</a>
<a id='line_7090'>    That through Rutulia's host and Troy's fulfillèd every ear:</a>
<a id='line_7091'>    "Make no great haste, O Teucrian men, these ships of mine to save!</a>
<a id='line_7092'>    Nor arm thereto! for Turnus here shall burn the salt sea wave</a>
<a id='line_7093'>    Sooner than these, my holy pines. But ye--depart, go free!</a>
<a id='line_7094'>    The Mother biddeth it: depart, Queens, Goddesses, of sea!"</a>
<a id='line_7095'></a>
<a id='line_7096'>    Straightway the ships brake each the chain that tied them to the bank,</a>
<a id='line_7097'>    And, as the dolphins dive adown, with plunging beaks they sank</a>
<a id='line_7098'>    Down to the deeps, from whence, O strange! they come aback once more;</a>
<a id='line_7099'>    As many brazen beaks as erst stood fast beside the shore,            120</a>
<a id='line_7100'>    So many shapes of maidens now seaward they wend their ways.</a>
<a id='line_7101'></a>
<a id='line_7102'>    Appalled were those Rutulian hearts; yea, feared with all amaze,</a>
<a id='line_7103'>    Messapus sat mid frighted steeds: the rough-voiced stream grew black;</a>
<a id='line_7104'>    Yea, Tiberinus from the deep his footsteps drew aback.</a>
<a id='line_7105'>    But Turnus of the hardy heart, his courage nothing died;</a>
<a id='line_7106'>    Unmoved he stirs their souls with speech, unmoved he falls to chide:</a>
<a id='line_7107'></a>
<a id='line_7108'>    "These portents seek the Teucrians home; the very Jupiter</a>
<a id='line_7109'>    Snatches their wonted aid from them, that might not bide to bear</a>
<a id='line_7110'>    Rutulian fire and sword: henceforth the sea-plain lacketh road</a>
<a id='line_7111'>    For Teucrian men: their flight is dead, and half the world's abode   130</a>
<a id='line_7112'>    Is reft from them: and earth, forsooth, upon our hands it waits,</a>
<a id='line_7113'>    With thousands of Italian swords. For me, I fear no Fates:</a>
<a id='line_7114'>    For if the Phrygians boast them still of answering words of God,</a>
<a id='line_7115'>    Enough for Venus and the Fates that Teucrian men have trod</a>
<a id='line_7116'>    The fair Ausonia's fruitful field: and answering fates have I:</a>
<a id='line_7117'>    A wicked folk with edge of sword to root up utterly,</a>
<a id='line_7118'>    For stolen wife: this grief hath grieved others than Atreus' sons,</a>
<a id='line_7119'>    And other folk may run to arms than those Mycenian ones.</a>
<a id='line_7120'>    --Enough one downfall is, say ye?--Enough had been one sin.</a>
<a id='line_7121'>    Yea, I had deemed all womankind your hatred well might win.          140</a>
<a id='line_7122'>    --Lo, these are they to whom a wall betwixt the sword and sword,</a>
<a id='line_7123'>    The little tarrying of a ditch,--such toys the death to ward!--</a>
<a id='line_7124'>    Give hearts of men! What, saw they not the war-walls of Troy-town,</a>
<a id='line_7125'>    The fashioning of Neptune's hand, amid the flame sink down?</a>
<a id='line_7126'>    But ye, my chosen, who is dight with me to break the wall,</a>
<a id='line_7127'>    That we upon their quaking camp with point and edge may fall?</a>
<a id='line_7128'>    No need I have of Vulcan's arms or thousand ships at sea</a>
<a id='line_7129'>    Against these Teucrians; yea, though they should win them presently,</a>
<a id='line_7130'>    The Tuscan friendship: deeds of dusk and deedless stolen gain</a>
<a id='line_7131'>    Of that Palladium, and the guards of topmost castle slain,           150</a>
<a id='line_7132'>    Let them not fear: we shall not lurk in horse's dusky womb:</a>
<a id='line_7133'>    In open day to gird your walls with wildfire is the doom.</a>
<a id='line_7134'>    Let them not deem they have to put the Danaans to the proof,</a>
<a id='line_7135'>    Pelasgian lads that Hector's hand for ten years held aloof.</a>
<a id='line_7136'>    --But come, since all the best of day is well-nigh worn to end,</a>
<a id='line_7137'>    Joy in our good beginning, friends, and well your bodies tend,</a>
<a id='line_7138'>    And bide in hope and readiness the coming of the fight."</a>
<a id='line_7139'></a>
<a id='line_7140'>    Therewith Messapus hath the charge with outguards of the night</a>
<a id='line_7141'>    To keep the gates, and all the town with watch-fires round to ring:</a>
<a id='line_7142'>    Twice seven are chosen out to hold the town inleaguering             160</a>
<a id='line_7143'>    Of Rutuli: an hundred youths, they follow each of these;</a>
<a id='line_7144'>    A purple-crested folk that gleam with golden braveries:</a>
<a id='line_7145'>    They pace the round, they shift the turn, or scattered o'er the grass</a>
<a id='line_7146'>    Please heart and soul with wine, and turn the empty bowl of brass:</a>
<a id='line_7147'>    The watch-fires shine around in ring; through sport and sleeplessness</a>
<a id='line_7148'>    Their warding weareth night away.</a>
<a id='line_7149'></a>
<a id='line_7150'>    The Trojans from their walls of war look down on all these things;</a>
<a id='line_7151'>    They hold the heights in arms, and search the great gate's fastenings</a>
<a id='line_7152'>    With hurrying fear; or, spear in hand, gangway to battlement         169</a>
<a id='line_7153'>    They yoke. There Mnestheus urged the work; there hot Serestus went;</a>
<a id='line_7154'>    They whom Æneas, if perchance the time should call thereto,</a>
<a id='line_7155'>    Had made first captains of the host, lords of all things to do.</a>
<a id='line_7156'>    So all the host along the walls the peril shareth out,</a>
<a id='line_7157'>    Falling to watch, and plays its part in turn and turn about.</a>
<a id='line_7158'></a>
<a id='line_7159'>    Nisus was warder of the gate, the eager under shield,</a>
<a id='line_7160'>    The son of Hyrtacus, whom erst did huntress Ida yield</a>
<a id='line_7161'>    Unto Æneas' fellowship, keen with the shaft and spear.</a>
<a id='line_7162'>    Euryalus, his friend, stood by, than whom none goodlier</a>
<a id='line_7163'>    Went with Æneas or did on the battle-gear of Troy:</a>
<a id='line_7164'>    Youth's bloom unshorn was on his cheek, scarce was he but a boy.     180</a>
<a id='line_7165'>    Like love the twain had each for each; in battle side by side</a>
<a id='line_7166'>    They went; and now as gatewards twain together did abide.</a>
<a id='line_7167'></a>
<a id='line_7168'>    Now Nisus saith: "Doth very God so set the heart on fire,</a>
<a id='line_7169'>    Euryalus, or doth each man make God of his desire?</a>
<a id='line_7170'>    My soul is driving me to dare the battle presently,</a>
<a id='line_7171'>    Or some great deed; nor pleased with peace at quiet will it be.</a>
<a id='line_7172'>    Thou seest how those Rutulian men trust in their warding keep;</a>
<a id='line_7173'>    How wide apart the watch-fires shine; how slack with wine and sleep</a>
<a id='line_7174'>    Men lie along; how far and wide the hush o'er all things lies.</a>
<a id='line_7175'>    Note now what stirreth in my mind, what thoughts in me arise:        190</a>
<a id='line_7176'>    They bid call back Æneas now, fathers, and folk, and all,</a>
<a id='line_7177'>    And send out men to bear to him sure word of what doth fall.</a>
<a id='line_7178'>    Now if the thing I ask for thee they promise,--for to me</a>
<a id='line_7179'>    The deed's fame is enough,--meseems beneath yon mound I see</a>
<a id='line_7180'>    A way whereby to Pallanteum in little space to come."</a>
<a id='line_7181'></a>
<a id='line_7182'>    Euryalus, by mighty love of glory smitten home,</a>
<a id='line_7183'>    Stood all amazed, then answered thus his fiery-hearted friend:</a>
<a id='line_7184'>    "O Nisus, wilt thou yoke me not to such a noble end?</a>
<a id='line_7185'>    And shall I send thee unto deeds so perilous alone?</a>
<a id='line_7186'>    My sire Opheltes, wise in war, nourished no such an one,             200</a>
<a id='line_7187'>    Reared mid the terror of the Greeks and Troy-town's miseries;</a>
<a id='line_7188'>    Nor yet with thee have I been wont to deedless deeds like these,</a>
<a id='line_7189'>    Following Æneas' mighty heart through Fortune's furthest way.</a>
<a id='line_7190'>    Here is a soul that scorns the light, and deems it good to pay</a>
<a id='line_7191'>    With very life for such a fame as thou art brought anear."</a>
<a id='line_7192'></a>
<a id='line_7193'>    Saith Nisus: "Nay, I feared of thee no such a thing, I swear,</a>

<a id='line_7195'>    Great Jove, or whosoe'er beholds these things with equal eyes.</a>
<a id='line_7196'>    But if some hap (thou seest herein how many such may fall),</a>
<a id='line_7197'>    If any hap, if any God bear me the end of all,                       210</a>
<a id='line_7198'>    Fain were I thou wert left: thine age is worthier life-day's gain;</a>
<a id='line_7199'>    Let there be one to buy me back snatched from amidst the slain,</a>

<a id='line_7201'>    Do thou the rites, and raise the tomb unto the missing man;</a>
<a id='line_7202'>    Nor make me of thy mother's woe the fashioner accurst:</a>
<a id='line_7203'>    She who, O friend, alone of all our many mothers durst</a>

<a id='line_7205'></a>
<a id='line_7206'>    He said: "For weaving of delay vain is thy shuttle thrown;</a>
<a id='line_7207'>    Nor is my heart so turned about that I will leave the play:</a>

<a id='line_7209'>                      Therewithal he stirs the guards, and they          220</a>
<a id='line_7210'>    Come up in turn, wherewith he leaves the warding-stead behind,</a>
<a id='line_7211'>    And goes with Nisus, and the twain set forth the prince to find.</a>
<a id='line_7212'></a>
<a id='line_7213'>    All other creatures, laid asleep o'er all the earthly soil,</a>
<a id='line_7214'>    Let slip the cares from off their hearts, forgetful of their toil,</a>
<a id='line_7215'>    But still the dukes of Trojan men and chosen folk of war</a>
<a id='line_7216'>    Held counsel of that heavy tide that on the kingdom bore,</a>
<a id='line_7217'>    What was to do, or who would go Æneas' messenger.</a>
<a id='line_7218'>    There shield on arm, and leaned upon the length of shafted spear,</a>
<a id='line_7219'>    They stand amid their stronghold's mead: in eager haste the twain,</a>
<a id='line_7220'>    Nisus and young Euryalus, the presence crave to gain,                230</a>
<a id='line_7221'>    For matters great and worth the time: straight doth Iulus take</a>
<a id='line_7222'>    Those hurried men to him, and bids that Nisus speech should wake.</a>
<a id='line_7223'></a>
<a id='line_7224'>    Then saith the son of Hyrtacus: "Just-hearted, hearken now,</a>
<a id='line_7225'>    Folk of Æneas, neither look upon the things we show</a>
<a id='line_7226'>    As by our years. The Rutuli slackened by wine and sleep</a>
<a id='line_7227'>    Lie hushed, and we have seen whereby upon our way to creep,</a>
<a id='line_7228'>    E'en by the double-roaded gate that near the sea-strand lies:</a>
<a id='line_7229'>    Their fires are slaked, and black the smoke goes upward to the skies.</a>
<a id='line_7230'>    If ye will suffer us to use this fortune that doth fall</a>
<a id='line_7231'>    We will go seek Æneas now and Pallanteum's wall:                     240</a>
<a id='line_7232'>    Ye shall behold him and his spoils from mighty victory wrought</a>
<a id='line_7233'>    Come hither presently: the way shall fail our feet in nought,</a>
<a id='line_7234'>    For we have seen the city's skirts amid the valleys dim</a>
<a id='line_7235'>    In daily hunt, whereby we learned the river's uplong brim."</a>
<a id='line_7236'></a>
<a id='line_7237'>    Then spake Aletes weighty-wise, heart-ripe with plenteous eld:</a>
<a id='line_7238'>    "Gods of our fathers, under whom the weal of Troy is held,</a>
<a id='line_7239'>    Ye have not doomed all utterly the Teucrian folk undone,</a>
<a id='line_7240'>    When ye for us such souls of youth, such hardy hearts have won."</a>
<a id='line_7241'></a>
<a id='line_7242'>    So saying by shoulder and by hand he took the goodly twain,</a>
<a id='line_7243'>    While all his countenance and cheeks were wet with plenteous rain,   250</a>
<a id='line_7244'>    "What gifts may I deem worthy, men, to pay such hearts athirst</a>
<a id='line_7245'>    For utmost glory? certainly the fairest and the first</a>
<a id='line_7246'>    The Gods and your own hearts shall grant: the rest your lord shall give,</a>
<a id='line_7247'>    Godly Æneas; and this man with all his life to live,</a>
<a id='line_7248'>    Ascanius here, no memory of such desert shall lack."</a>
<a id='line_7249'></a>
<a id='line_7250'>    "But I," Ascanius breaketh in, "whose father brought aback</a>
<a id='line_7251'>    Is all my heal--Nisus, I pray by those great Gods of mine,</a>
<a id='line_7252'>    By him of old, Assaracus, by hoary Vesta's shrine,</a>
<a id='line_7253'>    Bring back my father! whatsoe'er is left with me today</a>
<a id='line_7254'>    Of Fate or Faith, into your breasts I give it all away.              260</a>
<a id='line_7255'>    O give me back the sight of him, and grief is all gone by.</a>
<a id='line_7256'>    Two cups of utter silver wrought and rough with imagery</a>
<a id='line_7257'>    I give you, which my father took from wracked Arisbe's hold;</a>
<a id='line_7258'>    Two tripods eke, two talents' weight of fire-beproven gold;</a>
<a id='line_7259'>    A beaker of the time agone, Sidonian Dido's gift.</a>
<a id='line_7260'>    But if we hap to win the day and spoil of battle shift,</a>
<a id='line_7261'>    If we lay hand on Italy and staff of kingship bear,--</a>
<a id='line_7262'>    Ye saw the horse that bore today gold Turnus and his gear,</a>
<a id='line_7263'>    That very same, the shield withal, and helm-crest ruddy dyed,</a>
<a id='line_7264'>    Thy gifts, O Nisus, from the spoil henceforth I set aside.           270</a>
<a id='line_7265'>    Moreover of the mother-folk twice six most excellent</a>
<a id='line_7266'>    My sire shall give, and captive men with all their armament,</a>
<a id='line_7267'>    And therewithal the kingly field, Latinus' garden-place.</a>
<a id='line_7268'>    But thou, O boy most worshipful, whom nigher in the race</a>
<a id='line_7269'>    Mine own years follow, thee I take unto mine inmost heart,</a>
<a id='line_7270'>    Embracing thee my very friend in all to have a part;</a>
<a id='line_7271'>    Nor any glory of my days without thee shall I seek,</a>
<a id='line_7272'>    Whether I fashion peace or war; all that I do or speak</a>
<a id='line_7273'>    I trust to thee."</a>
<a id='line_7274'>                      In answer thus Euryalus 'gan say:</a>
<a id='line_7275'>    "No day henceforth of all my life shall prove me fallen away         280</a>
<a id='line_7276'>    From this my deed: only may fate in kindly wise befall,</a>
<a id='line_7277'>    Nor stand against me: now one gift I ask thee over all:</a>
<a id='line_7278'>    I have a mother born on earth from Priam's ancient race,</a>
<a id='line_7279'>    Who wretched in the land of Troy had no abiding-place,</a>
<a id='line_7280'>    Nor in Acesta's steadfast wall; with me she still must wend:</a>
<a id='line_7281'>    Her, who knows nought of this my risk, whatever may be the end</a>
<a id='line_7282'>    Unto thy safeguard do I leave: Night and thy right hand there</a>
<a id='line_7283'>    Be witness that my mother's tears I had no heart to bear.</a>
<a id='line_7284'>    But solace thou her lack, I pray; comfort her desert need;</a>
<a id='line_7285'>    Yea let me bear this hope with me, and boldlier shall I speed        290</a>
<a id='line_7286'>    Amid all haps."</a>
<a id='line_7287'>                    Touched to the heart the Dardans might not keep</a>
<a id='line_7288'>    Their tears aback, and chief of all did fair Iulus weep,</a>
<a id='line_7289'>    The image of his father's love so flashed upon his soul:</a>
<a id='line_7290'>    And therewithal he spake the word:</a>
<a id='line_7291'></a>
<a id='line_7292'>    "All things I duly answer for worthy thy deed of fame;</a>
<a id='line_7293'>    Thy mother shall my mother be, nor lack but e'en the name</a>
<a id='line_7294'>    To be Creusa: store of thanks no little hath she won</a>
<a id='line_7295'>    That bore thee. Whatsoever hap thy valorous deed bear on,</a>
<a id='line_7296'>    By this my head, whereon my sire is wont the troth to plight,</a>
<a id='line_7297'>    Whatever I promised thee come back, with all things wrought aright,  300</a>
<a id='line_7298'>    Thy mother and thy kin shall bide that very same reward."</a>
<a id='line_7299'>    So spake he, weeping, and did off his shoulder-girded sword</a>
<a id='line_7300'>    All golden, that with wondrous craft Lycaon out of Crete</a>
<a id='line_7301'>    Had fashioned, fitting it withal in ivory scabbard meet.</a>
<a id='line_7302'></a>
<a id='line_7303'>    And Mnestheus unto Nisus gives a stripped-off lion's hide</a>
<a id='line_7304'>    And shaggy coat; and helm for helm giveth Aletes tried.</a>
<a id='line_7305'>    Then forth they wend in weed of war, and they of first estate,</a>
<a id='line_7306'>    Young men and old, went forth with them, and leave them at the gate</a>
<a id='line_7307'>    With following vows; and therewithal Iulus, goodly-wrought,</a>
<a id='line_7308'>    Who far beyond his tender years had mind of manly thought,           310</a>
<a id='line_7309'>    Charged them with many messages unto his father's ear,--</a>
<a id='line_7310'>    Vain words the night-winds bore away and gave the clouds to bear.</a>
<a id='line_7311'></a>
<a id='line_7312'>    Forth now they wend and pass the ditch, and through the mirk night gain</a>
<a id='line_7313'>    The baneful camp: yet ere their death they too shall be the bane</a>
<a id='line_7314'>    Of many: bodies laid in sleep and wine they see strewed o'er</a>
<a id='line_7315'>    The herbage, and the battle-cars upreared along the shore;</a>
<a id='line_7316'>    And mid the reins and wheels thereof are men and weapons blent</a>
<a id='line_7317'>    With wine-jars: so Hyrtacides such word from tooth-hedge sent:</a>
<a id='line_7318'></a>
<a id='line_7319'>    "Euryalus, the hand must dare, the time cries on the deed;</a>
<a id='line_7320'>    Here lies the way: do thou afar keep watch and have good heed,       320</a>
<a id='line_7321'>    Lest any hand aback of us arise 'gainst thee and me:</a>
<a id='line_7322'>    Here will I make a waste forsooth, and wide thy way shall be."</a>
<a id='line_7323'></a>
<a id='line_7324'>    He speaks, and hushes all his voice, and so with naked blade</a>
<a id='line_7325'>    Falls on proud Rhamnes; who, as happed, on piled-up carpets laid,</a>
<a id='line_7326'>    Amid his sleep was blowing forth great voice from inner breast.</a>
<a id='line_7327'>    A king he was; king Turnus' seer, of all belovèd best;</a>
<a id='line_7328'>    Yet nought availed his wizardry to drive his bane away.</a>
<a id='line_7329'>    Three thralls unware, as heeding nought amid the spears they lay,</a>
<a id='line_7330'>    He endeth: Remus' shield-bearer withal and charioteer,               329</a>
<a id='line_7331'>    Caught 'neath the very steeds: his sword their drooping necks doth shear;</a>
<a id='line_7332'>    Then from their lord he takes the head, and leaves the trunk to spout</a>
<a id='line_7333'>    Gushes of blood: the earth is warm with black gore all about.</a>
<a id='line_7334'>    The beds are wet. There Lamyrus and Lamus doth he slay,</a>
<a id='line_7335'>    And young Serranus fair of face, who played the night away</a>
<a id='line_7336'>    For many an hour, until his limbs 'neath God's abundance failed,</a>
<a id='line_7337'>    And down he lay: ah! happier 'twere if he had still prevailed</a>
<a id='line_7338'>    To make the live-long night one game until the morning cold.</a>
<a id='line_7339'>    As famished lion Nisus fares amid the sheep-filled fold,</a>
<a id='line_7340'>    When ravening hunger driveth on; the soft things, dumb with dread,</a>
<a id='line_7341'>    He draggeth off, devouring them, and foams from mouth blood-red.     340</a>
<a id='line_7342'></a>
<a id='line_7343'>    Nor less the death Euryalus hath wrought; for all aflame</a>
<a id='line_7344'>    He wades in wrath, and on the way slays many lacking name:</a>
<a id='line_7345'>    Fadus, Herbesus therewithal, Rhoetus and Abaris;</a>
<a id='line_7346'>    Unwary they: but Rhoetus waked, and looking on all this,</a>
<a id='line_7347'>    Fulfilled of fear was hiding him behind a wine-jar pressed:</a>
<a id='line_7348'>    The foe was on him as he rose; the sword-blade pierced his breast</a>
<a id='line_7349'>    Up to the hilts, and drew aback abundant stream of death.</a>
<a id='line_7350'>    His purple life he poureth forth, and, dying, vomiteth</a>
<a id='line_7351'>    Blent blood and wine. On death-stealth still onward the Trojan went,</a>
<a id='line_7352'>    And toward Messapus' leaguer drew, where watch-fires well-nigh spent</a>
<a id='line_7353'>    He saw, and horses all about, tethered in order due,                 351</a>
<a id='line_7354'>    Cropping the grass: but Nisus spake in hasty words and few,</a>
<a id='line_7355'>    Seeing him borne away by lust of slaughter overmuch:</a>
<a id='line_7356'></a>
<a id='line_7357'>    "Hold we our hands, for dawn our foe hasteth the world to touch:</a>
<a id='line_7358'>    Deep have we drunk of death, and cut a road amid the foe."</a>
<a id='line_7359'></a>
<a id='line_7360'>    The gear of men full goodly-wrought of silver through and through</a>
<a id='line_7361'>    They leave behind, and bowls therewith, and carpets fashioned fair.</a>
<a id='line_7362'>    Natheless Euryalus caught up the prophet Rhamnes' gear</a>
<a id='line_7363'>    And gold-bossed belt, which Cædicus, the wealthy man of old,</a>
<a id='line_7364'>    Sent to Tiburtine Remulus, that he his name might hold,              360</a>
<a id='line_7365'>    Though far he were; who, dying, gave his grandson their delight;</a>
<a id='line_7366'>    And he being dead, Rutulian men won them in war and fight</a>
<a id='line_7367'>    These now he takes, and all for nought does on his valorous breast,</a>
<a id='line_7368'>    And dons Messapus' handy helm with goodly-fashioned crest,</a>
<a id='line_7369'>    Wherewith they leave the camp and gain the road that safer lay.</a>
<a id='line_7370'></a>
<a id='line_7371'>    But horsemen from the Latin town meantime were on the way,</a>
<a id='line_7372'>    Sent on before to carry word to Turnus, lord and king,</a>
<a id='line_7373'>    While in array amid the fields the host was tarrying.</a>
<a id='line_7374'>    Three hundred knights, all shielded folk, 'neath Volscens do they fare.</a>
<a id='line_7375'>    And now they drew anigh the camp and 'neath its rampart were,        370</a>
<a id='line_7376'>    When from afar they saw the twain on left-hand footway lurk;</a>
<a id='line_7377'>    Because Euryalus' fair helm mid glimmer of the mirk</a>
<a id='line_7378'>    Betrayed the heedless youth, and flashed the moonbeams back again.</a>
<a id='line_7379'>    Nor was the sight unheeded: straight cries Volscens midst his men:</a>
<a id='line_7380'>    "Stand ho! why thus afoot, and why in weapons do ye wend,</a>
<a id='line_7381'>    And whither go ye?"</a>
<a id='line_7382'>                        Nought had they an answer back to send,</a>
<a id='line_7383'>    But speed their fleeing mid the brake, and trust them to the night;</a>
<a id='line_7384'>    The horsemen cast themselves before each crossway known aright,</a>
<a id='line_7385'>    And every outgoing there is with guard they girdle round.            379</a>
<a id='line_7386'>    Rough was the wood; a thicket-place where black holm-oaks abound,</a>
<a id='line_7387'>    And with the tanglement of thorns choked up on every side,</a>
<a id='line_7388'>    The road but glimmering faintly out from where the foot-tracks hide.</a>
<a id='line_7389'>    The blackness of overhanging boughs and heavy battle-prey</a>
<a id='line_7390'>    Hinder Euryalus, and fear beguiles him of the way.</a>
<a id='line_7391'>    Nisus comes out, and now had won unwitting from the foe,</a>
<a id='line_7392'>    And reached the place from Alba's name called Alban Meadows now;</a>
<a id='line_7393'>    Where King Latinus had as then his high-built herd-houses.</a>
<a id='line_7394'>    So there he stands, and, looking round, his fellow nowhere sees:</a>
<a id='line_7395'></a>
<a id='line_7396'>    "Hapless Euryalus! ah me, where have I left thy face?</a>
<a id='line_7397'>    Where shall I seek thee, gathering up that tangle of the ways        390</a>
<a id='line_7398'>    Through the blind wood?"</a>
<a id='line_7399'>                              So therewithal he turns upon his track,</a>
<a id='line_7400'>    Noting his footsteps, and amid the hushed brake strays aback,</a>
<a id='line_7401'>    Hearkening the horse-hoofs and halloos and calls of following folk.</a>
<a id='line_7402'>    Nor had he long abided there, ere on his ears outbroke</a>
<a id='line_7403'>    Great clamour, and Euryalus he sees, whom all the band</a>
<a id='line_7404'>    Hath taken, overcome by night, and blindness of the land,</a>
<a id='line_7405'>    And wildering tumult: there in vain he strives in battle-play.</a>
<a id='line_7406'>    Ah, what to do? What force to dare, what stroke to snatch away</a>
<a id='line_7407'>    The youth? Or shall he cast himself amid the swords to die,</a>
<a id='line_7408'>    And hasten down the way of wounds to lovely death anigh?             400</a>
<a id='line_7409'>    Then swiftly, with his arm drawn back and brandishing his spear,</a>
<a id='line_7410'>    He looks up at the moon aloft, and thuswise poureth prayer:</a>
<a id='line_7411'></a>
<a id='line_7412'>    "To aid, thou Goddess! Stay my toil, and let the end be good!</a>
<a id='line_7413'>    Latonian glory of the stars, fair watcher of the wood,</a>
<a id='line_7414'>    If ever any gift for me upon thine altars gave</a>
<a id='line_7415'>    My father Hyrtacus; if I for thee the hunting drave;</a>
<a id='line_7416'>    If aught I hung upon thy dome, or set upon thy roof,</a>
<a id='line_7417'>    Give me to break their gathered host, guide thou my steel aloof!"</a>
<a id='line_7418'></a>
<a id='line_7419'>    He spake, and in the shafted steel set all his body's might,         409</a>
<a id='line_7420'>    And hurled it: flying forth the spear clave through the dusk of night,</a>
<a id='line_7421'>    And, reaching Sulmo turned away, amidst his back it flew,</a>
<a id='line_7422'>    And brake there; but the splintering shaft his very heart pierced through,</a>
<a id='line_7423'>    And o'er he rolleth, vomiting the hot stream from his breast:</a>
<a id='line_7424'>    Then heave his flanks with long-drawn sobs and cold he lies at rest.</a>
<a id='line_7425'>    On all sides then they peer about: but, whetted on thereby,</a>
<a id='line_7426'>    The quivering shaft from o'er his ear again he letteth fly.</a>
<a id='line_7427'>    Amid their wilderment the spear whistleth through either side</a>
<a id='line_7428'>    Of Tagus' temples, and wet-hot amidst his brain doth bide.</a>
<a id='line_7429'>    Fierce Volscens rageth, seeing none who might the spear-shot send,</a>
<a id='line_7430'>    Or any man on whom his wrath and heat of heart to spend.             420</a>
<a id='line_7431'></a>
<a id='line_7432'>    "But thou, at least, with thine hot blood shalt pay the due award</a>
<a id='line_7433'>    For both," he cries; and therewithal, swift drawing forth the sword,</a>
<a id='line_7434'>    He falleth on Euryalus. Then, wild with all affright,</a>
<a id='line_7435'>    Nisus shrieks out, and cares no more to cloak himself with night,</a>
<a id='line_7436'>    And hath no heart to bear against so great a misery.</a>
<a id='line_7437'>    "On me, me! Here--I did the deed! turn ye the sword on me,</a>
<a id='line_7438'>    Rutulians!--all the guilt is mine: he might not do nor dare.</a>
<a id='line_7439'>    May heaven and those all-knowing stars true witness of it bear!</a>
<a id='line_7440'>    Only with too exceeding love he loved his hapless friend."           429</a>
<a id='line_7441'></a>
<a id='line_7442'>    Such words he poured forth, but the sword no less its way doth wend,</a>
<a id='line_7443'>    Piercing the flank and rending through the goodly breast of him;</a>
<a id='line_7444'>    And rolls Euryalus in death: in plenteous blood they swim</a>
<a id='line_7445'>    His lovely limbs, his drooping neck low on his shoulder lies:</a>
<a id='line_7446'>    As when the purple field-flower faints before the plough and dies,</a>
<a id='line_7447'>    Or poppies when they hang their heads on wearied stems outworn,</a>
<a id='line_7448'>    When haply by the rainy load their might is overborne.</a>
<a id='line_7449'></a>
<a id='line_7450'>    Then Nisus falls amidst of them, and Volscens seeks alone</a>
<a id='line_7451'>    For aught that any man may do: save him he heedeth none.</a>
<a id='line_7452'>    About him throng the foe: all round the strokes on him are laid</a>
<a id='line_7453'>    To thrust him off: but on he bears, whirling his lightning blade,    440</a>
<a id='line_7454'>    Till full in Volscens' shouting mouth he burieth it at last,</a>
<a id='line_7455'>    Tearing the life from out the foe, as forth his own life passed.</a>
<a id='line_7456'>    Then, ploughed with wounds, he cast him down upon his lifeless friend,</a>
<a id='line_7457'>    And so in quietness of death gat resting in the end.</a>
<a id='line_7458'></a>
<a id='line_7459'>    O happy twain, if anywise my song-craft may avail,</a>
<a id='line_7460'>    From out the memory of the world no day shall blot your tale,</a>
<a id='line_7461'>    While on the rock-fast Capitol Æneas' house abides,</a>
<a id='line_7462'>    And while the Roman Father still the might of empire guides.</a>
<a id='line_7463'></a>
<a id='line_7464'>    The Rutuli, victorious now with spoils and prey of war,</a>
<a id='line_7465'>    But sorrowing still, amid the camp the perished Volscens bore.       450</a>
<a id='line_7466'>    Nor in the camp was grief the less, when they on Rhamnes came</a>
<a id='line_7467'>    Bloodless; and many a chief cut off by one death and the same;</a>
<a id='line_7468'>    Serranus dead and Numa dead: a many then they swarm</a>
<a id='line_7469'>    About the dead and dying men, and places wet and warm</a>
<a id='line_7470'>    With new-wrought death, and runnels full with plenteous foaming blood.</a>
<a id='line_7471'>    Then one by one the spoils they note; the glittering helm and good</a>
<a id='line_7472'>    Messapus owned: the gear such toil had won back from the dead.</a>
<a id='line_7473'></a>
<a id='line_7474'>    But timely now Aurora left Tithonus' saffron bed,</a>
<a id='line_7475'>    And over earth went scattering wide the light of new-born day:</a>
<a id='line_7476'>    The sun-flood flowed, and all the world unveiled by daylight lay.    460</a>
<a id='line_7477'></a>
<a id='line_7478'>    Then Turnus, clad in arms himself, wakes up the host to arms,</a>
<a id='line_7479'>    And every lord to war-array bids on his brazen swarms;</a>
<a id='line_7480'>    And men with diverse tidings told their battle-anger whet.</a>
<a id='line_7481'>    Moreover (miserable sight!) on upraised spears they set</a>
<a id='line_7482'>    Those heads, and follow them about with most abundant noise,</a>
<a id='line_7483'>    Euryalus and Nisus dead.</a>
<a id='line_7484'></a>
<a id='line_7485'>    Meanwhile Æneas' hardy sons upon their leftward wall</a>
<a id='line_7486'>    Stand in array; for on the right the river girdeth all.</a>
<a id='line_7487'>    In woe they ward the ditches deep, and on the towers on high         469</a>
<a id='line_7488'>    Stand sorrowing; for those heads upreared touch all their hearts anigh,</a>
<a id='line_7489'>    Known overwell to their sad eyes mid the black flow of gore.</a>
<a id='line_7490'>    Therewith in wingèd fluttering haste, the trembling city o'er</a>
<a id='line_7491'>    Goes tell-tale Fame, and swift amidst the mother's ears doth glide;</a>
<a id='line_7492'>    And changed she was, nor in her bones the life-heat would abide:</a>
<a id='line_7493'>    The shuttle falls from out her hand, unrolled the web doth fall,</a>
<a id='line_7494'>    And with a woman's hapless shrieks she flieth to the wall:</a>
<a id='line_7495'>    Rending her hair, beside herself, she faced the front of fight,</a>
<a id='line_7496'>    Heedless of men, and haps of death, and all the weapons' flight,</a>
<a id='line_7497'>    And there the very heavens she filled with wailing of her grief:</a>
<a id='line_7498'></a>
<a id='line_7499'>    "O son, and do I see thee so? Thou rest and last relief              480</a>
<a id='line_7500'>    Of my old days! hadst thou the heart to leave me lone and spent?</a>
<a id='line_7501'>    O cruel! might I see thee not on such a peril sent?</a>
<a id='line_7502'>    Was there no time for one last word amid my misery?</a>
<a id='line_7503'>    A prey for Latin fowl and dogs how doth thy body lie,</a>
<a id='line_7504'>    On lands uncouth! Not e'en may I, thy mother, streak thee, son,</a>
<a id='line_7505'>    Thy body dead; or close thine eyes, or wash thy wounds well won,</a>
<a id='line_7506'>    Or shroud thee in the cloth I wrought for thee by night and day,</a>
<a id='line_7507'>    When hastening on the weaving-task I kept eld's cares at bay?</a>
<a id='line_7508'>    Where shall I seek thee? What earth hides thy body, mangled sore,</a>
<a id='line_7509'>    And perished limbs? O son, to me bringest thou back no more          490</a>
<a id='line_7510'>    Than this? and have I followed this o'er every land and sea?</a>
<a id='line_7511'>    O pierce me through, if ye be kind; turn all your points on me,</a>
<a id='line_7512'>    Rutulians! Let me first of all with battle-steel be sped!</a>
<a id='line_7513'>    Father of Gods, have mercy thou! Thrust down the hated head</a>
<a id='line_7514'>    Beneath the House of Tartarus with thine own weapon's stress,</a>
<a id='line_7515'>    Since otherwise I may not break my life-days' bitterness."</a>
<a id='line_7516'></a>
<a id='line_7517'>    Their hearts were shaken with her wail, and Sorrow fain will weep,</a>
<a id='line_7518'>    And in all men their battle-might unbroken lay asleep.</a>
<a id='line_7519'>    But Actor and Idæus take that flaming misery,</a>
<a id='line_7520'>    As bade Ilioneus, and young Iulus, sore as he                        500</a>
<a id='line_7521'>    Went weeping: back in arms therewith they bear her 'neath the roof.</a>
<a id='line_7522'></a>
<a id='line_7523'>    But now the trump with brazen song cast fearful sound aloof,</a>
<a id='line_7524'>    Chiding to war; and shouts rise up and belloweth back the heaven,</a>
<a id='line_7525'>    And forth the Volscians fare to speed the shield-roof timely driven.</a>
<a id='line_7526'>    Some men fall on to fill the ditch and pluck the ramparts down;</a>
<a id='line_7527'>    Some seek approach and ladders lay where daylight rends the crown</a>
<a id='line_7528'>    Of wall-wards, and would get them up where stands the hedge of war</a>
<a id='line_7529'>    Thinner of men: against their way the Teucrian warders pour</a>
<a id='line_7530'>    All weapon-shot: with hard-head pikes they thrust them down the steep.</a>
<a id='line_7531'>    Long was the war wherein they learned the battle-wall to keep.       510</a>
<a id='line_7532'>    Stones, too, of deadly weight they roll, if haply they may break</a>
<a id='line_7533'>    The shield-roof of the battle-rush; but sturdily those take</a>
<a id='line_7534'>    All chances of the play beneath their close and well-knit hold.</a>
<a id='line_7535'>    Yet fail they; for when hard at hand their world of war was rolled,</a>
<a id='line_7536'>    A mighty mass by Teucrians moved rolls on and rushes o'er,</a>
<a id='line_7537'>    And fells the host of Rutuli and breaks the tiles of war.</a>
<a id='line_7538'>    Nor longer now the Rutuli, the daring hearts, may bear</a>
<a id='line_7539'>    To play with Mars amid the dark, but strive the walls to clear</a>
<a id='line_7540'>    With storm of shaft and weapon shot.</a>
<a id='line_7541'></a>
<a id='line_7542'>    But now Mezentius otherwhere, a fearful sight to see,                520</a>
<a id='line_7543'>    Was tossing high the Tuscan pine with smoke-wreathed fiery heart:</a>
<a id='line_7544'>    While Neptune's child, the horse-tamer Messapus, played his part,</a>
<a id='line_7545'>    Rending the wall, and crying out for ladders to be laid.</a>
<a id='line_7546'></a>
<a id='line_7547'>    Speak, Song-maids: thou, Calliope, give thou the singer aid</a>
<a id='line_7548'>    To tell what wise by Turnus' sword the field of fight was strown;</a>
<a id='line_7549'>    What death he wrought; what man each man to Orcus sent adown.</a>
<a id='line_7550'>    Fall to with me to roll abroad the mighty skirts of war,</a>
<a id='line_7551'>    Ye, Goddesses, remember all, and ye may tell it o'er.</a>
<a id='line_7552'></a>
<a id='line_7553'>    There was a tower built high overhead, with gangways up in air,</a>
<a id='line_7554'>    Set well for fight, 'gainst which the foe their utmost war-might bear,  530</a>
<a id='line_7555'>    And all Italians strive their most to work its overthrow:</a>
<a id='line_7556'>    Gainst whom the Trojans ward it well, casting the stones below,</a>
<a id='line_7557'>    And through the hollow windows speed the shot-storm thick and fast.</a>
<a id='line_7558'>    There Turnus first of all his folk a flaming firebrand cast,</a>
<a id='line_7559'>    And fixed it in the turret's flank: wind-nursed it caught great space</a>
<a id='line_7560'>    Of planking, and amid the doors, consuming, kept its place.</a>
<a id='line_7561'>    Then they within, bewildered sore, to flee their ills are fain,</a>
<a id='line_7562'>    But all for nought; for while therein they huddle from the bane,</a>
<a id='line_7563'>    And draw aback to place yet free from ruin, suddenly                 539</a>
<a id='line_7564'>    O'erweighted toppleth down the tower, and thundereth through the sky.</a>
<a id='line_7565'></a>
<a id='line_7566'>    Half-dead the warders fall to earth by world of wrack o'erborne,</a>
<a id='line_7567'>    Pierced with their own shafts, and their breasts with hardened splinters torn.</a>
<a id='line_7568'>    Yea, Lycus and Helenor came alone of all their peers</a>
<a id='line_7569'>    Alive to earth: Helenor, now in spring-tide of his years:</a>
<a id='line_7570'>    Bond-maid Licymnia privily to that Mæonian king</a>
<a id='line_7571'>    Had borne the lad, and sent him forth to Troy's beleaguering</a>
<a id='line_7572'>    With arms forbidden, sheathless sword and churl's unpainted shield.</a>
<a id='line_7573'>    But when he saw himself amidst the thousand-sworded field</a>
<a id='line_7574'>    Of Turnus, Latins on each side, behind, and full in face,</a>
<a id='line_7575'>    E'en as a wild beast hedged about by girdle of the chase             550</a>
<a id='line_7576'>    Rages against the point and edge, and, knowing death anear,</a>
<a id='line_7577'>    Leaps forth, and far is borne away down on the hunter's spear;</a>
<a id='line_7578'>    Not otherwise the youth falls on where thickest spear-points lie,</a>
<a id='line_7579'>    And in the middle of the foe he casts himself to die.</a>
<a id='line_7580'></a>
<a id='line_7581'>    But Lycus, nimbler far of foot, betwixt the foemen slipped,</a>
<a id='line_7582'>    Betwixt the swords, and gained the wall, and at the coping gripped,</a>
<a id='line_7583'>    And strove to draw him up with hand, the friendly hands to feel;</a>
<a id='line_7584'>    But Turnus both with foot and spear hath followed hard at heel,</a>
<a id='line_7585'>    And mocks him thus in victory: "How was thy hope so grown</a>
<a id='line_7586'>    Of 'scaping from my hand, O fool?"                                   560</a>
<a id='line_7587'>                                        Therewith he plucks him down</a>
<a id='line_7588'>    From where he hung, and space of wall tears downward with the man.</a>
<a id='line_7589'>    As when it chanceth that a hare or snowy-bodied swan</a>
<a id='line_7590'>    Jove's shield-bearer hath borne aloft in snatching hookèd feet;</a>
<a id='line_7591'>    Or lamb, whose mother seeketh him with most abundant bleat,</a>
<a id='line_7592'>    Some wolf of Mars from fold hath caught.</a>
<a id='line_7593'>                                              Goes up great cry around:</a>
<a id='line_7594'>    They set on, and the ditches filled with o'erturned garth and mound,</a>
<a id='line_7595'>    While others cast the blazing brands on roof and battlement.</a>
<a id='line_7596'>    Ilioneus with mighty stone, a shard from hillside rent,</a>
<a id='line_7597'>    Lucetius felled, as fire in hand unto the gate he drew.</a>
<a id='line_7598'>    Then Liger felled Emathion, for craft of spear he knew;              570</a>
<a id='line_7599'>    Asylas Corynæus, by dint of skill in bowshaft's ways,</a>
<a id='line_7600'>    Cæneus Ortygius fells, and him, victorious, Turnus slays,</a>
<a id='line_7601'>    And Itys, Clonius, Promolus, Dioxippus withal,</a>
<a id='line_7602'>    And Sagaris, and Idas set on topmost turret-wall.</a>
<a id='line_7603'>    Then Capys slays Privernus; him Themilla's light-winged spear</a>
<a id='line_7604'>    Had grazed, whereon he dropped his shield, and his left hand did bear</a>
<a id='line_7605'>    Upon the hurt; when lo, thereto the wingèd shaft did win,</a>
<a id='line_7606'>    And nailed the hand unto the side, and, buried deep within,</a>
<a id='line_7607'>    Burst all the breathing-ways of life with deadly fatal sore.</a>
<a id='line_7608'>    But lo, where standeth Arcens' child in goodly weed of war,          580</a>
<a id='line_7609'>    Fair with his needle-painted cloak, with Spanish scarlet bright,</a>
<a id='line_7610'>    Noble of face: Arcens, his sire, had sent him to the fight</a>
<a id='line_7611'>    From nursing of his mother's grove about Symæthia's flood,</a>
<a id='line_7612'>    Whereby Palicus' altar stands, the wealthy and the good.</a>
<a id='line_7613'>    Mezentius now laid by his spear, and took his whistling sling,</a>
<a id='line_7614'>    And whirled it thrice about his head at length of tugging string,</a>
<a id='line_7615'>    And with the flight of molten lead his midmost forehead clave,</a>
<a id='line_7616'>    And to the deep abundant sand his outstretched body gave.</a>
<a id='line_7617'></a>
<a id='line_7618'>    Then first they say Ascanius aimed his speedy shafts in war,</a>
<a id='line_7619'>    Wherewith but fleeing beasts afield he used to fright before:        590</a>
<a id='line_7620'>    But now at last his own right hand the stark Numanus slays,</a>
<a id='line_7621'>    Who had to surname Remulus, and in these latter days</a>
<a id='line_7622'>    King Turnus' sister, young of years, had taken to his bed:</a>
<a id='line_7623'>    He in the forefront of the fight kept crying out, and said</a>
<a id='line_7624'>    Things worthy and unworthy tale: puffed up with pride of place</a>
<a id='line_7625'>    New-won he went, still clamouring out his greatness and his grace.</a>
<a id='line_7626'></a>
<a id='line_7627'>    "O twice-caught Phrygians, shames you nought thus twice amid the wars</a>

<a id='line_7651'>    That singer of such wicked speech, that caster forth of words,       620</a>
<a id='line_7652'>    Ascanius brooked not: breasting now his horse-hair full at strain,</a>
<a id='line_7653'>    He aimed the shaft, and therewithal drew either arm atwain,</a>
<a id='line_7654'>    And stood so; but to Jupiter first suppliant fell to pray:</a>
<a id='line_7655'></a>
<a id='line_7656'>    "O Jove Almighty, to my deeds, thus new-begun, nod yea,</a>
<a id='line_7657'>    And I myself unto thy fane the yearly gifts will bear,</a>
<a id='line_7658'>    And bring before thine altar-stead a snow-white gilt-horned steer,</a>
<a id='line_7659'>    Whose head unto his mother's head is evenly upborne,</a>
<a id='line_7660'>    Of age to spurn the sand with hoof and battle with the horn."</a>
<a id='line_7661'></a>
<a id='line_7662'>    The Father heard, and out of heaven, wherein no cloud-fleck hung,</a>
<a id='line_7663'>    His leftward thunder fell, wherewith the fateful bow outrung,        630</a>
<a id='line_7664'>    The back-drawn shaft went whistling forth with dreadful sound, and sped</a>
<a id='line_7665'>    To pierce the skull of Remulus and hollow of his head:</a>
<a id='line_7666'>    "Go to, then, and thy mocking words upon men's valour call,</a>
<a id='line_7667'>    The twice-caught Phrygians answer back Rutulians herewithal."</a>
<a id='line_7668'></a>
<a id='line_7669'>    This only word Ascanius spake: the Teucrians raise their cry</a>
<a id='line_7670'>    And shout for joy, and lift their heart aloft unto the sky.</a>
<a id='line_7671'>    Long-haired Apollo then by hap high-set in airy place,</a>
<a id='line_7672'>    Looked down upon Ausonian host and leaguered city's case,</a>
<a id='line_7673'>    And thus the victor he bespeaks from lofty seat of cloud:</a>
<a id='line_7674'>    "Speed on in new-born valour, child! this is the starward road,      640</a>
<a id='line_7675'>    O son of Gods and sire of Gods! Well have the Fates ordained</a>
<a id='line_7676'>    That 'neath Assaracus one day all war shall be refrained.</a>

<a id='line_7678'>                              With that word he stoops from heaven aloft</a>
<a id='line_7679'>    And puts away on either side the wind that meets him soft,</a>
<a id='line_7680'>    And seeks Ascanius: changed is he withal, and putteth on</a>
<a id='line_7681'>    The shape of Butes old of days, shield-bearer time agone</a>
<a id='line_7682'>    Unto Anchises, Dardan king, and door-ward true and tried;</a>

<a id='line_7684'>    Like this old man in every wise, voice, hue, and hoary hair,</a>
<a id='line_7685'>    And arms that cried on cruel war, now did Apollo fare,               650</a>
<a id='line_7686'>    And to Iulus hot of heart in such wise went his speech:</a>
<a id='line_7687'></a>
<a id='line_7688'>    "Enough, O child of Æneas, that thou with shaft didst reach</a>
<a id='line_7689'>    Numanus' life unharmed thyself, great Phoebus grants thee this,</a>
<a id='line_7690'>    Thy first-born praise, nor grudgeth thee like weapons unto his.</a>

<a id='line_7692'>                                          So spake Apollo then,</a>
<a id='line_7693'>    And in the midmost of his speech fled sight of mortal men,</a>
<a id='line_7694'>    And faded from their eyes away afar amid the air.</a>
<a id='line_7695'>    The Dardan dukes, they knew the God and holy shooting-gear,</a>
<a id='line_7696'>    And as he fled away from them they heard his quiver shrill.</a>
<a id='line_7697'>    Therefore Ascanius, fain of fight, by Phoebus' word and will       660</a>
<a id='line_7698'>    They hold aback: but they themselves fare to the fight again,</a>
<a id='line_7699'>    And cast their souls amidst of all the perils bare and plain.</a>
<a id='line_7700'></a>
<a id='line_7701'>    Then goes the shout adown the wall, along the battlement;</a>
<a id='line_7702'>    The javelin-thongs are whirled about, the sharp-springed bows are bent,</a>
<a id='line_7703'>    And all the earth is strewn with shot: the shield, the helmet's cup,</a>

<a id='line_7705'>    As great as, when the watery kids are setting, beats the rain</a>
<a id='line_7706'>    Upon the earth; as plentiful as when upon the main</a>
<a id='line_7707'>    The hail-clouds fall, when Jupiter, fierce with the southern blasts,</a>

<a id='line_7719'>    Twin oak-trees spring, and tops unshorn uprear the skies to meet,    680</a>
<a id='line_7720'>    And with their heads high over earth nod ever in the wind.</a>
<a id='line_7721'></a>
<a id='line_7722'>    So now the Rutuli fall on when clear the way they find,</a>
<a id='line_7723'>    But Quercens, and Æquicolus the lovely war-clad one,</a>
<a id='line_7724'>    And Tmarus of the headlong soul, and Hæmon, Mavors' son,</a>
<a id='line_7725'>    Must either turn their backs in flight, with all their men of war,</a>
<a id='line_7726'>    Or lay adown their lovèd lives on threshold of the door.</a>
<a id='line_7727'>    Then bitterer waxeth battle-rage in hate-fulfillèd hearts,</a>
<a id='line_7728'>    And there the Trojans draw to head and gather from all parts,</a>
<a id='line_7729'>    Eager to deal in handy strokes, full fierce afield to fare.</a>
<a id='line_7730'></a>
<a id='line_7731'>    But as duke Turnus through the fight was raging otherwhere,          690</a>
<a id='line_7732'>    Confounding folk, there came a man with tidings that the foe,</a>
<a id='line_7733'>    Hot with new death, the door-leaves wide to all incomers throw.</a>
<a id='line_7734'>    Therewith he leaves the work in hand, and, stirred by anger's goad,</a>
<a id='line_7735'>    Against the Dardan gate goes forth, against the brethren proud:</a>
<a id='line_7736'>    There first Antiphates he slew, who fought amid the first,</a>
<a id='line_7737'>    The bastard of Sarpedon tall, by Theban mother nursed.</a>
<a id='line_7738'>    With javelin-cast he laid him low: the Italian cornel flies</a>
<a id='line_7739'>    Through the thin air, pierceth his maw, and 'neath his breast-bone lies</a>
<a id='line_7740'>    Deep down; the hollow wound-cave pours a flood of gore and foam,</a>
<a id='line_7741'>    And warm amid him lies the steel, amid his lung gone home.           700</a>
<a id='line_7742'>    Then Meropes', and Erymas', Aphidnus' lives he spilled;</a>
<a id='line_7743'>    Then Bitias of the flaming eyes and heart with ire fulfilled;--</a>
<a id='line_7744'>    Not with the dart, for to no dart his life-breath had he given;--</a>
<a id='line_7745'>    But whirled and whizzing mightily came on the sling-spear, driven</a>
<a id='line_7746'>    Like lightning-flash; against whose dint two bull-hides nought availed,</a>
<a id='line_7747'>    Nor yet the golden faithful fence of war-coat double-scaled:</a>
<a id='line_7748'>    His fainting limbs fell down afield, and earth gave out a groan,</a>
<a id='line_7749'>    And rang the thunder of his shield huge on his body thrown:</a>
<a id='line_7750'>    E'en as upon Euboean shore of Baiæ falleth whiles</a>
<a id='line_7751'>    A stony pillar, which built up of mighty bonded piles                710</a>
<a id='line_7752'>    They set amid the sea: suchwise it draggeth mighty wrack</a>
<a id='line_7753'>    Headlong adown, and deep in sea it lieth dashed aback:</a>
<a id='line_7754'>    The seas are blent, black whirl of sand goes up confusedly;</a>
<a id='line_7755'>    And with the noise quakes Prochytas, and quakes Inarimè,</a>
<a id='line_7756'>    The unsoft bed by Jove's command upon Typhoeus laid.</a>
<a id='line_7757'></a>
<a id='line_7758'>    Then Mars, the mighty in the war, brings force and strength to aid</a>
<a id='line_7759'>    The Latin men, and in their hearts he stirs his bitter goads,</a>
<a id='line_7760'>    The while with fleeing and black fear the Teucrian heart he loads:</a>
<a id='line_7761'>    From everywhither run the folk, since here is battle rich,</a>
<a id='line_7762'>    And in all hearts the war-god wakes.                                 720</a>
<a id='line_7763'></a>
<a id='line_7764'>    But Pandarus, beholding now his brother laid to earth,</a>
<a id='line_7765'>    And whitherward wends Fortune now, and what Time brings to birth,</a>
<a id='line_7766'>    Back-swinging on the hinge again with might the door-leaf sends,</a>
<a id='line_7767'>    By struggle of his shoulders huge; and many of his friends</a>
<a id='line_7768'>    Shut outward of the walls he leaves, amid the fierce debate;</a>
<a id='line_7769'>    While others, with himself shut in, poured backward through the gate.</a>
<a id='line_7770'>    Madman! who saw not how the king Rutulian mid the band</a>
<a id='line_7771'>    Came rushing, but amidst the town now shut him with his hand,</a>
<a id='line_7772'>    E'en as a tiger pent amidst a helpless flock of sheep.</a>
<a id='line_7773'>    Then dreadfully his armour rings, light from his eyes doth leap,--   730</a>
<a id='line_7774'>    A strange new light: the blood-red crest upon his helm-top quakes,</a>
<a id='line_7775'>    And from the circle of his shield a glittering lightning breaks.</a>
<a id='line_7776'>    Sudden Æneas' frighted folk behold his hated face</a>
<a id='line_7777'>    And mighty limbs: but Pandarus breaks forth amid the place</a>
<a id='line_7778'>    Huge, and his heart afire with rage for his lost brother's death.</a>
<a id='line_7779'></a>
<a id='line_7780'>    "Nay, this is not Amata's home, the dowry house," he saith,</a>
<a id='line_7781'>    "Nor yet doth Ardea's midmost wall hold kindred Turnus in:</a>
<a id='line_7782'>    The foeman's camp thou seest, wherefrom thou hast no might to win."</a>
<a id='line_7783'></a>
<a id='line_7784'>    But from his all untroubled breast laughed Turnus, as he said:</a>
<a id='line_7785'>    "Begin, if thou hast heart thereto, let hand to hand be laid!        740</a>
<a id='line_7786'>    Thou shalt tell Priam how thou found'st a new Achilles here."</a>
<a id='line_7787'></a>
<a id='line_7788'>    He spake: the other put all strength to hurling of his spear,</a>
<a id='line_7789'>    A shaft all rough with knots, and still in its own tree-bark bound.</a>
<a id='line_7790'>    Straightway the thin air caught it up, but that swift-speeding wound</a>
<a id='line_7791'>    Saturnian Juno turned aside and set it in the door.</a>
<a id='line_7792'>    --"But now thou 'scapest not this steel mine own hand maketh sure,</a>
<a id='line_7793'>    Nought such as thine the weapon-smith, the wound-smith----"</a>
<a id='line_7794'>                                                                With the word</a>
<a id='line_7795'>    He riseth up unto the high uprising of the sword,</a>
<a id='line_7796'>    Wherewith betwixt the temples twain he clave his midmost head,</a>
<a id='line_7797'>    And with a fearful wound apart the cheeks unbearded shred.           750</a>
<a id='line_7798'>    Then came a sound, and shook the earth 'neath the huge weight of him:</a>
<a id='line_7799'>    With armour wet with blood and brain, with fainting, slackened limb,</a>
<a id='line_7800'>    He strewed the ground in death; his head, sheared clean and evenly,</a>
<a id='line_7801'>    From either shoulder hanging down, this side and that did lie.</a>
<a id='line_7802'></a>
<a id='line_7803'>    Then turn and flee the Trojan folk, by quaking terror caught;</a>
<a id='line_7804'>    And if the conquering man as then one moment had had thought</a>
<a id='line_7805'>    To burst the bolts and let his folk in through the opened door,</a>
<a id='line_7806'>    That day had been the last of days for Trojans and their war.</a>
<a id='line_7807'>    But utter wrath of heart and soul, and wildering lust of death</a>
<a id='line_7808'>    Drave him afire amidst the foe.                                      760</a>
<a id='line_7809'>    Then Phaleris he catcheth up, and ham-strung Gyges then,</a>
<a id='line_7810'>    Whose spears, snatched up, he hurleth on against the backs of men;</a>
<a id='line_7811'>    For Juno finds him might enough and heart wherewith to do,</a>
<a id='line_7812'>    Halys he sendeth down with these, Phegeus with targe smit through;</a>
<a id='line_7813'>    Then, as they roused the war on wall, nor wotted aught of this,</a>
<a id='line_7814'>    Alcander stark, and Halius stout, Noëmon, Prytanis.</a>
<a id='line_7815'>    Then Lynceus, as he ran to aid and cheered his folk withal,</a>
<a id='line_7816'>    He reacheth at with sweeping sword from right hand of the wall</a>
<a id='line_7817'>    And smiteth; and his helm and head, struck off with that one blow,</a>
<a id='line_7818'>    Lie far away: Amycus then, the wood-deer's wasting foe,              770</a>
<a id='line_7819'>    He slayeth: happier hand had none in smearing of the shaft</a>
<a id='line_7820'>    And arming of the iron head the poison-wound to waft.</a>
<a id='line_7821'>    Then Clytius, son of Æolus, and Cretheus Muse-beloved,--</a>
<a id='line_7822'>    Cretheus the Muses' fellow-friend, whose heart was ever moved</a>
<a id='line_7823'>    By song and harp, and measured sound along the strainèd string;</a>
<a id='line_7824'>    Who still of steeds, and arms, and men, and battle-tide would sing.</a>
<a id='line_7825'></a>
<a id='line_7826'>    At last the Trojan dukes of men, Mnestheus, Serestus fierce,</a>
<a id='line_7827'>    Draw to a head when all this death is borne unto their ears,</a>
<a id='line_7828'>    And see their folk all scattering wide, the foe amidst them see.     779</a>
<a id='line_7829'>    Then Mnestheus cries: "And whither now, and whither will ye flee?</a>
<a id='line_7830'>    What other walls, what other town have ye a hope to find?</a>
<a id='line_7831'>    Hath one man, O my town-fellows, whom your own ramparts bind,</a>
<a id='line_7832'>    Wrought such a death and unavenged amid your very town,</a>
<a id='line_7833'>    And sent so many lords of war by Orcus' road adown?</a>
<a id='line_7834'>    O dastards, your unhappy land, your Gods of ancient days,</a>
<a id='line_7835'>    Your great Æneas--what! no shame, no pity do they raise?"</a>
<a id='line_7836'></a>
<a id='line_7837'>    Fired by such words, they gather heart and stand in close array,</a>
<a id='line_7838'>    Till step by step 'gins Turnus now to yield him from the play,</a>
<a id='line_7839'>    And seek the river and the side the wet wave girds about.</a>
<a id='line_7840'>    Then fiercer fall the Teucrians on, and raise a mighty shout,        790</a>
<a id='line_7841'>    And lock their ranks: as when a crowd of men-folk and of spears</a>
<a id='line_7842'>    Falls on a lion hard of heart, and he, beset by fears,</a>
<a id='line_7843'>    But fierce and grim-eyed, yieldeth way, though anger and his worth</a>
<a id='line_7844'>    Forbid him turn his back about: no less to fare right forth</a>
<a id='line_7845'>    Through spears and men avails him not, though ne'er so fain he be.</a>
<a id='line_7846'>    Not otherwise unhasty feet drew Turnus doubtfully</a>
<a id='line_7847'>    Abackward, all his heart a-boil with anger's overflow.</a>
<a id='line_7848'>    Yea, twice, indeed, he falls again amidmost of the foe,</a>
<a id='line_7849'>    And twice more turns to huddled flight their folk along the walls;</a>
<a id='line_7850'>    But, gathered from the camp about, the whole host on him falls,      800</a>
<a id='line_7851'>    Nor durst Saturnian Juno now his might against them stay;</a>
<a id='line_7852'>    For Jupiter from heaven hath sent Iris of airy way,</a>
<a id='line_7853'>    No soft commands of his high doom bearing his sister down,</a>
<a id='line_7854'>    If Turnus get him not away from Troy's high-builded town.</a>
<a id='line_7855'>    So now the warrior's shielded left the play endureth not,</a>
<a id='line_7856'>    Nought skills his right hand; wrapped around in drift of weapon shot</a>
<a id='line_7857'>    About his temples' hollow rings his helm with ceaseless clink;</a>
<a id='line_7858'>    The starkly-fashioned brazen plates amid the stone-cast chink;</a>
<a id='line_7859'>    The crest is battered from his head; nor may the shield-boss hold</a>
<a id='line_7860'>    Against the strokes: the Trojans speed the spear-storm manifold,     810</a>
<a id='line_7861'>    And lightening Mnestheus thickeneth it: then over all his limbs</a>
<a id='line_7862'>    The sweat bursts out, and all adown a pitchy river swims:</a>
<a id='line_7863'>    Hard grows his breath, and panting sharp shaketh his body spent.</a>
<a id='line_7864'>    Until at last, all clad in arms, he leapt adown, and sent</a>
<a id='line_7865'>    His body to the river fair, who in his yellow flood</a>
<a id='line_7866'>    Caught him, and bore him forth away on ripple soft and good,</a>
<a id='line_7867'>    And gave him merry to his men, washed from the battle's blood.</a>

<a id='line_7880'>    Meanwhile is opened wide the door of dread Olympus' walls,</a>
<a id='line_7881'>    And there the Sire of Gods and Men unto the council calls,</a>
<a id='line_7882'>    Amid the starry place, wherefrom, high-throned, he looks adown</a>
<a id='line_7883'>    Upon the folk of Latin land and that beleaguered town.</a>
<a id='line_7884'>    There in the open house they sit, and he himself begins:</a>

<a id='line_7886'>    "O Dwellers in the House of Heaven, why backward thuswise wins</a>
<a id='line_7887'>    Your purpose? Why, with hearts unruled, raise ye the strife so sore?</a>
<a id='line_7888'>    I clean forbade that Italy should clash with Troy in war.</a>
<a id='line_7889'>    Now why the war that I forbade? who egged on these or those</a>
<a id='line_7890'>    To fear or fight, or drave them on with edge of sword to close?       10</a>
<a id='line_7891'>    Be not o'ereager in your haste: the hour of fight shall come,</a>
<a id='line_7892'>    When dreadful Carthage on a day against the walls of Rome,</a>

<a id='line_7894'>    Then may ye battle, hate to hate, and reach and grasp and rend:</a>
<a id='line_7895'>    But now forbear, and joyfully knit fast the plighted peace."</a>
<a id='line_7896'></a>
<a id='line_7897'>    Few words spake Jove; but not a few in answer unto these</a>

<a id='line_7912'>    Now if without thy peace, without thy Godhead's will to speed,</a>
<a id='line_7913'>    The Trojans sought for Italy, let ill-hap pay ill deed,</a>

<a id='line_7937'>    Ah, what availed that through the midst of Argive flames they bore</a>
<a id='line_7938'>    To wear down perils of wide lands, and perils of the main,</a>
<a id='line_7939'>    While Teucrian men sought Latin land and Troy new-born again?</a>
<a id='line_7940'>    Ah, better had it been for them by Troy's cold ash to stay,</a>

<a id='line_7942'>    Their Xanthus and their Simoïs unto that wretched folk,</a>

<a id='line_7945'>    Then spake Queen Juno, heavy wroth: "Why driv'st thou me to part</a>

<a id='line_7956'>    'Tis wrong for Italy, forsooth, the ring of fire to lay</a>

<a id='line_7961'>    Or choose them sons-in-law, or brides from mothers' bosoms tear?</a>
<a id='line_7962'>    Or, holding peace within their hands, lade ships with weapon-gear?    80</a>
<a id='line_7963'>    Thou erst hadst might from Greekish hands Æneas' self to draw,</a>
<a id='line_7964'>    To thrust a cloud and empty wind in stead of man of war,</a>
<a id='line_7965'>    And unto sea-nymphs ship by ship the ship-host mayst thou change.</a>
<a id='line_7966'>    But we to help the Rutuli, 'tis horrible and strange!</a>
<a id='line_7967'>    --Unware Æneas is away?--let him abide unware!</a>
<a id='line_7968'>    Paphus thou hast, Idalium, and high Cythera fair,</a>
<a id='line_7969'>    Then why with cities big with war and hearts of warriors deal?</a>
<a id='line_7970'>    What! we it was who strove to wrack the fainting Trojan weal?</a>
<a id='line_7971'>    We!--or the one who thwart the Greeks the wretched Trojans dashed?</a>
<a id='line_7972'>    Yea, and what brought it all about that thus in arms they clashed,    90</a>
<a id='line_7973'>    Europe and Asia? that men brake the plighted peace by theft?</a>
<a id='line_7974'>    Did I the Dardan lecher lead, who Sparta's jewel reft?</a>
<a id='line_7975'>    Did I set weapons in his hand, breed lust to breed debate?</a>
<a id='line_7976'>    Then had thy care for thine been meet, but now indeed o'erlate</a>
<a id='line_7977'>    With wrongful plaint thou risest up, and bickerest emptily."</a>
<a id='line_7978'></a>
<a id='line_7979'>    So pleaded Juno, and all they, the heavenly folk anigh,</a>
<a id='line_7980'>    Murmured their doom in diverse wise; as when the first of wind</a>
<a id='line_7981'>    Caught in the woods is murmuring on, and rolleth moanings blind,</a>
<a id='line_7982'>    Betraying to the mariners the onset of the gale.</a>
<a id='line_7983'>    Then spake the Almighty Sire, in whom is all the world's avail,      100</a>
<a id='line_7984'>    And as he spake the high-built house of God was quieted,</a>
<a id='line_7985'>    And earth from her foundations shook, and heaven was hushed o'erhead,</a>
<a id='line_7986'>    The winds fell down, the face of sea was laid in quiet fair:</a>
<a id='line_7987'></a>
<a id='line_7988'>    "Take ye these matters to your hearts, and set my sayings there;</a>
<a id='line_7989'>    Since nowise the Ausonian folk the plighted troth may blend</a>
<a id='line_7990'>    With Teucrians, and your contest seems a strife without an end;</a>
<a id='line_7991'>    What fortune each may have today, what hope each one shears out,</a>
<a id='line_7992'>    Trojan or Rutulan, will I hold all in balanced doubt,</a>
<a id='line_7993'>    Whether the camp be so beset by fate of Italy,</a>
<a id='line_7994'>    Or hapless wanderings of Troy, and warnings dealt awry.              110</a>
<a id='line_7995'>    Nor loose I Rutulans the more; let each one's way-faring</a>
<a id='line_7996'>    Bear its own hap and toil, for Jove to all alike is king;</a>
<a id='line_7997'>    The Fates will find a way to wend."</a>
<a id='line_7998'>                                        He nodded oath withal</a>
<a id='line_7999'>    By his own Stygian brother's stream, the pitchy waters' fall,</a>
<a id='line_8000'>    And blazing banks, and with his nod shook all Olympus' land.</a>
<a id='line_8001'>    Then fell the talk; from golden throne did Jupiter upstand,</a>
<a id='line_8002'>    The heaven-abiders girt him round and brought him to the door.</a>
<a id='line_8003'></a>
<a id='line_8004'>    The Rutuli amid all this are pressing on in war,</a>
<a id='line_8005'>    Round all the gates to slay the men, the walls with fire to ring,</a>
<a id='line_8006'>    And all Æneas' host is pent with fenced beleaguering.                120</a>
<a id='line_8007'>    Nor is there any hope of flight; upon the towers tall</a>
<a id='line_8008'>    They stand, the hapless men in vain, thin garland for the wall;</a>
<a id='line_8009'>    Asius, the son of Imbrasus, Thymoetes, and the two</a>
<a id='line_8010'>    Assaraci, and Thymbris old, with Castor, deeds they do</a>
<a id='line_8011'>    In the forefront; Sarpedon's sons, twin brethren, with them bide,</a>
<a id='line_8012'>    Clarus and Themon, born erewhile in lofty Lycia's side.</a>
<a id='line_8013'>    And now Lyrnessian Acmon huge with strain of limbs strives hard,</a>
<a id='line_8014'>    And raises up a mighty stone, no little mountain shard;</a>
<a id='line_8015'>    As great as father Clytius he, or brother Mnestheus' might:          129</a>
<a id='line_8016'>    So some with stones, with spear-cast some, they ward the walls in fight,</a>
<a id='line_8017'>    They deal with fire or notch the shaft upon the strainèd string.</a>
<a id='line_8018'>    But lo amidst, most meetly wrought for Venus cherishing,</a>
<a id='line_8019'>    His goodly head the Dardan boy unhooded there doth hold,</a>
<a id='line_8020'>    As shineth out some stone of price, cleaving the yellow gold,</a>
<a id='line_8021'>    Fair for the bosom or the head; or as the ivory shines,</a>
<a id='line_8022'>    That with Orician terebinth the art of man entwines,</a>
<a id='line_8023'>    Or mid the boxwood; down along his milk-white neck they lie</a>
<a id='line_8024'>    The streams of hair, which golden wire doth catch about and tie.</a>
<a id='line_8025'>    The mighty nations, Ismarus, there saw thee deft to speed</a>
<a id='line_8026'>    The bane of men, envenoming the deadly flying reed;                  140</a>
<a id='line_8027'>    Thou lord-born of Moeonian house, whereby the tiller tills</a>
<a id='line_8028'>    Rich acres, where Pactolus' flood gold overflowing spills.</a>
<a id='line_8029'>    There, too, was Mnestheus, whom his deed late done of thrusting forth</a>
<a id='line_8030'>    King Turnus from the battlements hath raised to heavenly worth,</a>
<a id='line_8031'>    And Capys, he whose name is set upon Campania's town.</a>
<a id='line_8032'></a>
<a id='line_8033'>    But while the bitter play of war went bickering up and down,</a>
<a id='line_8034'>    Æneas clave the seas with keel amidst the dead of night:</a>
<a id='line_8035'>    For when Evander he had left and reached the Tuscan might,</a>
<a id='line_8036'>    He met their king and told his name, and whence his race of old,</a>
<a id='line_8037'>    And what he would and how he wrought: and of the host he told,       150</a>
<a id='line_8038'>    Mezentius now had gotten him, and Turnus' wrothful heart;</a>
<a id='line_8039'>    He warned him in affairs of men to trust not Fortune's part;</a>
<a id='line_8040'>    And therewithal he mingleth prayers: Tarchon no while doth wait,</a>
<a id='line_8041'>    But joineth hosts and plighteth troth; and so, set free by Fate,</a>
<a id='line_8042'>    A-shipboard go the Lydian folk by God's command and grace,</a>
<a id='line_8043'>    Yet 'neath the hand of outland duke: Æneas' ship hath place</a>
<a id='line_8044'>    In forefront: Phrygian lions hang above its armèd tyne</a>
<a id='line_8045'>    O'ertopped by Ida, unto those Troy's outcasts happy sign:</a>
<a id='line_8046'>    There great Æneas sits, and sends his mind a-wandering wide</a>
<a id='line_8047'>    Through all the shifting chance of war; and by his left-hand side    160</a>
<a id='line_8048'>    Is Pallas asking of the stars and night-tide's journey dim,</a>
<a id='line_8049'>    Or whiles of haps by land or sea that fortuned unto him.</a>
<a id='line_8050'></a>
<a id='line_8051'>    Ye Goddesses, ope Helicon, and raise the song to say</a>
<a id='line_8052'>    What host from out the Tuscan land Æneas led away,</a>
<a id='line_8053'>    And how they dight their ships, and how across the sea they drave.</a>
<a id='line_8054'></a>
<a id='line_8055'>    In brazen Tiger Massicus first man the sea-plain clave;</a>
<a id='line_8056'>    A thousand youths beneath him are that Clusium's walls have left</a>
<a id='line_8057'>    And Cosæ's city: these in war with arrow-shot are deft,</a>
<a id='line_8058'>    And bear light quivers of the bark, and bear the deadly bow.</a>
<a id='line_8059'></a>
<a id='line_8060'>    Then comes grim Abas, all his host with glorious arms aglow,         170</a>
<a id='line_8061'>    And on his stern Apollo gleams, well wrought in utter gold.</a>
<a id='line_8062'>    But Populonia's mother-land had given him there to hold</a>
<a id='line_8063'>    Six hundred of the battle-craft; three hundred Ilva sent,</a>
<a id='line_8064'>    Rich isle, whose wealth of Chalyb ore wastes never nor is spent.</a>
<a id='line_8065'></a>
<a id='line_8066'>    The third is he, who carrieth men the words God hath to say,</a>
<a id='line_8067'>    Asylas, whom the hearts of beasts and stars of heaven obey,</a>
<a id='line_8068'>    And tongues of birds, and thunder-fire that coming tidings bears.</a>
<a id='line_8069'>    A thousand men he hurrieth on with bristling of the spears;</a>
<a id='line_8070'>    Pisa, the town Alpheüs built amid the Tuscan land,</a>
<a id='line_8071'>    Bids them obey.</a>
<a id='line_8072'>                    Came Astur next, goodliest of all the band;          180</a>
<a id='line_8073'>    Astur, who trusteth in his horse and shifty-coloured weed;</a>
<a id='line_8074'>    Three hundred hath he, of one heart to wend as he shall lead:</a>
<a id='line_8075'>    And these are they in Cæres' home and Minios' lea that bide,</a>
<a id='line_8076'>    The Pyrgi old, and they that feel Gravisca's heavy tide.</a>
<a id='line_8077'></a>
<a id='line_8078'>    Nor thee, best war-duke, Cinyras, of that Ligurian crew,</a>
<a id='line_8079'>    Leave I unsung: nor thee the more, Cupavo lord of few,</a>
<a id='line_8080'>    Up from the cresting of whose helm the feathery swan-wings rise.</a>
<a id='line_8081'>    Love was thy guilt; thy battle-sign was thine own father's guise.</a>
<a id='line_8082'>    For Cycnus, say they, while for love of Phaëthon he grieves.</a>
<a id='line_8083'>    And sings beneath his sisters' shade, beneath the poplar-leaves;     190</a>
<a id='line_8084'>    While with the Muse some solace sweet for woeful love he won,</a>
<a id='line_8085'>    A hoary eld of feathers soft about him doth he on,</a>
<a id='line_8086'>    Leaving the earth and following the stars with tuneful wails;</a>
<a id='line_8087'>    And now his son amid his peers with Tuscan ship-host sails,</a>
<a id='line_8088'>    Driving with oars the Centaur huge, who o'er the waters' face</a>
<a id='line_8089'>    Hangs, threatening ocean with a rock, huge from his lofty place,</a>
<a id='line_8090'>    And ever with his length of keel the deep sea furrows o'er.</a>
<a id='line_8091'></a>
<a id='line_8092'>    Then he, e'en Ocnus, stirreth up folk from his father's shore,</a>
<a id='line_8093'>    Who from the love of Tuscan flood and fate-wise Manto came,</a>
<a id='line_8094'>    And gave, O Mantua, walls to thee, and gave his mother's name:       200</a>
<a id='line_8095'>    Mantua, the rich in father-folk, though not one-stemmed her home.</a>
<a id='line_8096'>    Three stems are there, from each whereof four peoples forth are come,</a>
<a id='line_8097'>    While she herself, the head of all, from Tuscan blood hath might.</a>
<a id='line_8098'>    Five hundred thence Mezentius arms against himself in fight,</a>
<a id='line_8099'>    Whom Mincius' flood, Benacus' son, veiled in the sedges grey,</a>
<a id='line_8100'>    Was leading in the fir of fight across the watery way.</a>
<a id='line_8101'></a>
<a id='line_8102'>    Then heavy-huge Aulestes goes; the oar-wood hundred-fold</a>
<a id='line_8103'>    Rises for beating of the flood, as foam the seas uprolled.</a>
<a id='line_8104'>    Huge Triton ferries him, whose shell the deep blue sea doth fright:</a>
<a id='line_8105'>    Up from the shaggy naked waist manlike is he to sight                210</a>
<a id='line_8106'>    As there he swims, but underneath whale-bellied is he grown;</a>
<a id='line_8107'>    Beneath the half-beast breast of him the foaming waters moan.</a>
<a id='line_8108'></a>
<a id='line_8109'>    So many chosen dukes of men in thrice ten keels they sail,</a>
<a id='line_8110'>    And cut with brass the meads of brine for Troy and its avail.</a>
<a id='line_8111'></a>
<a id='line_8112'>    And now had day-tide failed the sky, and Phoebe, sweet and fair,</a>
<a id='line_8113'>    Amid her nightly-straying wain did mid Olympus wear.</a>
<a id='line_8114'>    Æneas, who might give his limbs no whit of peacefulness,</a>
<a id='line_8115'>    Was sitting with the helm in hand, heeding the sail-gear's stress,</a>
<a id='line_8116'>    When lo a company of friends his midmost course do meet:</a>
<a id='line_8117'>    The Nymphs to wit, who Cybele, the goddess holy-sweet,               220</a>
<a id='line_8118'>    Bade turn from ships to very nymphs, and ocean's godhead have.</a>
<a id='line_8119'>    So evenly they swam the sea, and sundered wave and wave,</a>
<a id='line_8120'>    As many as the brazen beaks once by the sea-side lay;</a>
<a id='line_8121'>    Afar they know their king, and round in dancing-wise they play;</a>
<a id='line_8122'>    But one of them, Cymodocea, who speech-lore knew the best,</a>
<a id='line_8123'>    Drew nigh astern and laid thereon her right hand, with her breast</a>
<a id='line_8124'>    Above the flood, the while her left through quiet waves rowed on,</a>
<a id='line_8125'>    And thus bespoke him all unware:</a>
<a id='line_8126'>                                      "Wak'st thou, O Godhead's son!</a>
<a id='line_8127'>    Æneas, wake! and loose the sheets and let all canvas fill!</a>
<a id='line_8128'>    We were the pine-trees on a time of Ida's holy hill,                 230</a>
<a id='line_8129'>    Thy ship-host once, but sea-nymphs now: when that Rutulian lord</a>
<a id='line_8130'>    Fell faithless, headlong, on our lives with firebrand and the sword,</a>
<a id='line_8131'>    Unwillingly we brake our bonds and sought thee o'er the main.</a>
<a id='line_8132'>    The Mother in her pity thus hath wrought our shape again,</a>
<a id='line_8133'>    And given us gift of godhead's life in house of ocean's ground.</a>
<a id='line_8134'>    Lo now, the boy Ascanius by dyke and wall is bound</a>
<a id='line_8135'>    Amid the spears, the battle-wood that Latins forth have sent.</a>
<a id='line_8136'>    And now the horse of Arcady, with stout Etruscans blent,</a>
<a id='line_8137'>    Holdeth due tryst. Now is the mind of Turnus firmly set</a>
<a id='line_8138'>    To thrust between them, lest thy camp they succour even yet.         240</a>
<a id='line_8139'>    Wherefore arise, and when the dawn first climbs the heavenly shore</a>
<a id='line_8140'>    Call on thy folk, and take thy shield unconquered evermore,</a>
<a id='line_8141'>    The Fire-lord's gift, who wrought its lips with circling gold about:</a>
<a id='line_8142'>    Tomorrow's light, unless thou deem'st my words are all to doubt,</a>
<a id='line_8143'>    Shall see Rutulian death in heaps a-lying on the land."</a>
<a id='line_8144'></a>
<a id='line_8145'>    Therewith departing, forth she thrust the tall ship with her hand,</a>
<a id='line_8146'>    As one who had good skill therein, and then across the seas</a>
<a id='line_8147'>    Swifter than dart she fled, or shaft that matcheth well the breeze,</a>
<a id='line_8148'>    And straight the others hastened on. All mazed was he of Troy,</a>
<a id='line_8149'>    Anchises' seed, but yet the sign upraised his heart with joy,        250</a>
<a id='line_8150'>    And, looking to the hollow heaven, in few words prayed he thus</a>
<a id='line_8151'></a>
<a id='line_8152'>    "Kind Ida-Mother of the Gods, whose heart loves Dindymus</a>
<a id='line_8153'>    And towered towns, and lions yoked and tamed to bear the bit,</a>
<a id='line_8154'>    Be thou my battle-leader now, and do thou further it,</a>
<a id='line_8155'>    This omen, and with favouring foot the Trojan folk draw nigh."</a>
<a id='line_8156'></a>
<a id='line_8157'>    But while he spake, Day, come again, had run adown the sky,</a>
<a id='line_8158'>    With light all utter perfect wrought, and driven away the night.</a>
<a id='line_8159'>    Then folk he biddeth follow on the banners of the fight,</a>
<a id='line_8160'>    And make them ready for the play and shape their hearts for war.</a>
<a id='line_8161'>    But he, aloft upon the poop, now sees them where they are,           260</a>
<a id='line_8162'>    His leaguered Teucrians, as his left uprears the blazing shield;</a>
<a id='line_8163'>    And then, the sons of Dardanus up to the starry field</a>
<a id='line_8164'>    Send forth the cry, and hope is come to whet their battle-wrath.</a>
<a id='line_8165'>    Thick flies their spear-storm: 'tis as when the Strymon cranes give forth</a>
<a id='line_8166'>    Their war-sign on the mirky rack, and down the heavens they run</a>
<a id='line_8167'>    Sonorous, fleeing southern breeze with clamour following on.</a>
<a id='line_8168'>    But wondrous to Rutulian king and dukes of Italy</a>
<a id='line_8169'>    That seemed, until they look about, and lo, the keels they see</a>
<a id='line_8170'>    Turned shoreward; yea, a sea of ships onsetting toward the shore.</a>
<a id='line_8171'>    Yea, and the helm is all ablaze, beams from the crest outpour,       270</a>
<a id='line_8172'>    The golden shield-boss wide about a world of flame doth shed.</a>
<a id='line_8173'>    E'en so, amid the clear of night, the comets bloody-red</a>
<a id='line_8174'>    Blush woeful bright; nor otherwise is Sirius' burning wrought,</a>
<a id='line_8175'>    When drought and plagues for weary men the birth of him hath wrought,</a>
<a id='line_8176'>    And that unhappy light of his hath saddened all the heaven.</a>
<a id='line_8177'>    But nought from Turnus' hardy heart was high hope ever driven</a>
<a id='line_8178'>    To take the strand of them and thrust those comers from the shore:</a>
<a id='line_8179'>    Eager he chid, hot-heart, with words men's courage he upbore:</a>
<a id='line_8180'></a>
<a id='line_8181'>    "Lo, now your prayers have come about, that hand meet hand in strife,</a>
<a id='line_8182'>    And Mars is in the brave man's hand: let each one's home and wife</a>
<a id='line_8183'>    Be in his heart! Call ye to mind those mighty histories,             281</a>
<a id='line_8184'>    The praises of our father-folk! Come, meet them in the seas,</a>
<a id='line_8185'>    Amid their tangle, while their feet yet totter on the earth:</a>
<a id='line_8186'>    For Fortune helpeth them that dare."</a>
<a id='line_8187'></a>
<a id='line_8188'>    So saying, he turneth in his mind with whom on these to fall,</a>
<a id='line_8189'>    And unto whom to leave meanwhile the leaguering of the wall.</a>
<a id='line_8190'>    Meanwhile Æneas from his ships high-built his folk doth speed</a>
<a id='line_8191'>    Ashore by bridges: many men no less the back-draught heed</a>
<a id='line_8192'>    Of the spent seas, and, trusting shoals, they make the downward leap;</a>
<a id='line_8193'>    And others slide adown the oars. Tarchon the shore doth sweep,       290</a>
<a id='line_8194'>    Espying where the waves break not, nor back the sea doth roar,</a>
<a id='line_8195'>    But where the sea-flood harmlessly with full tide swims ashore,</a>
<a id='line_8196'>    And thither straight he lays his keels, and prays unto his folk:</a>
<a id='line_8197'></a>
<a id='line_8198'>    "O chosen, on the stark oars lay! now up unto the stroke;</a>
<a id='line_8199'>    Bear on the ships, and with your beaks cleave ye this foeman's earth;</a>
<a id='line_8200'>    And let the very keels themselves there furrow them their berth.</a>
<a id='line_8201'>    On such a haven nought I heed, though ship and all we break,</a>
<a id='line_8202'>    If once we gain the land."</a>
<a id='line_8203'>                                Therewith, as such a word he spake,</a>
<a id='line_8204'>    His fellows rise together hard on every shaven tree,</a>
<a id='line_8205'>    In mind to bear their ships befoamed up on the Latin lea,            300</a>
<a id='line_8206'>    Until their tynes are high and dry, and fast is every keel</a>
<a id='line_8207'>    Unhurt: save, Tarchon, thine alone, that winneth no such weal;</a>
<a id='line_8208'>    For on the shallows driven aground, on evil ridge unmeet,</a>
<a id='line_8209'>    She hangeth balanced a long while, and doth the waters beat;</a>
<a id='line_8210'>    Then, breaking, droppeth down her men amidmost of the waves,</a>
<a id='line_8211'>    Entangled in the wreck of oars, and floating thwarts and staves;</a>
<a id='line_8212'>    And in the back-draught of the seas their feet are caught withal.</a>
<a id='line_8213'></a>
<a id='line_8214'>    No dull delay holds Turnus back; but fiercely doth he fall,</a>
<a id='line_8215'>    With all his host, on them of Troy, and meets them on the strand.    309</a>
<a id='line_8216'>    The war-horns sing. Æneas first breaks through the field-folk's band,</a>
<a id='line_8217'>    --Fair omen of the fight--and lays the Latin folk alow.</a>
<a id='line_8218'>    Thero he slays, most huge of men, whose own heart bade him go</a>
<a id='line_8219'>    Against Æneas: through the links of brass the sword doth fare,</a>
<a id='line_8220'>    And through the kirtle's scaly gold, and wastes the side laid bare.</a>
<a id='line_8221'>    Then Lichas smites he, ripped erewhile from out his mother dead,</a>
<a id='line_8222'>    And hallowed, Phoebus, unto thee, because his baby head</a>
<a id='line_8223'>    Had 'scaped the steel: nor far from thence he casteth down to die</a>
<a id='line_8224'>    Hard Cisseus, Gyas huge, who there beat down his company</a>
<a id='line_8225'>    With might of clubs; nought then availed that Herculean gear,</a>
<a id='line_8226'>    Nor their stark hands, nor yet their sire Melampus, though he were   320</a>
<a id='line_8227'>    Alcides' friend so long as he on earth wrought heavy toil.</a>
<a id='line_8228'>    Lo Pharo! while a deedless word he flingeth mid the broil,</a>
<a id='line_8229'>    The whirring of the javelin stays within his shouting mouth.</a>
<a id='line_8230'>    Thou, Cydon, following lucklessly thy new delight, the youth</a>
<a id='line_8231'>    Clytius, whose first of fallow down about his cheeks is spread</a>
<a id='line_8232'>    Art well-nigh felled by Dardan hand, and there hadst thou lain dead,</a>
<a id='line_8233'>    At peace from all the many loves wherein thy life would stray,</a>
<a id='line_8234'>    Had not thy brethren's serried band now thrust across the way</a>
<a id='line_8235'>    E'en Phorcus' seed: sevenfold of tale and sevenfold spears they wield:</a>
<a id='line_8236'>    But some thereof fly harmless back from helm-side and from shield,   330</a>
<a id='line_8237'>    The rest kind Venus turned aside, that grazing past they flew;</a>
<a id='line_8238'>    But therewithal Æneas spake unto Achates true:</a>
<a id='line_8239'></a>
<a id='line_8240'>    "Reach me my shafts: not one in vain my right hand now shall speed</a>
<a id='line_8241'>    Against Rutulians, of all those that erst in Ilian mead</a>
<a id='line_8242'>    Stood in the bodies of the Greeks."</a>
<a id='line_8243'>                                        Then caught he a great spear</a>
<a id='line_8244'>    And cast it, and it flew its ways the brazen shield to shear</a>
<a id='line_8245'>    Of Mæon, breaking through his mail, breaking his breast withal:</a>
<a id='line_8246'>    Alcanor is at hand therewith, to catch his brother's fall</a>
<a id='line_8247'>    With his right hand; but through his arm the spear without a stay</a>
<a id='line_8248'>    Flew hurrying on, and held no less its straight and bloody way,      340</a>
<a id='line_8249'>    And by the shoulder-nerves the hand hung down all dead and vain.</a>
<a id='line_8250'>    Then Numitor, his brother's spear caught from his brother slain,</a>
<a id='line_8251'>    Falls on Æneas; yet to smite the mighty one in face</a>
<a id='line_8252'>    No hap he had, but did the thigh of great Achates graze.</a>
<a id='line_8253'>    Clausus of Cures, trusting well in his young body's might,</a>
<a id='line_8254'>    Now cometh, and with stiff-wrought spear from far doth Dryops smite</a>
<a id='line_8255'>    Beneath the chin; home went its weight, and midst his shouting's birth</a>
<a id='line_8256'>    From rent throat snatched both voice and life, and prone he smote the ear</a>
<a id='line_8257'>    And from his mouth abundantly shed forth the flood of gore.</a>
<a id='line_8258'>    Three Thracians also, men whose stem from Boreas came of yore,       350</a>
<a id='line_8259'>    Three whom their father Idas sent, and Ismara their land,</a>
<a id='line_8260'>    In various wise he fells. And now Halesus comes to hand,</a>
<a id='line_8261'>    And his Aruncans: Neptune's seed now cometh thrusting in,</a>
<a id='line_8262'>    Messapus, excellent of horse. Hard strife the field to win!</a>
<a id='line_8263'>    On this side and on that they play about Ausonia's door.</a>
<a id='line_8264'>    As whiles within the mighty heaven the winds are making war,</a>
<a id='line_8265'>    And equal heart they have thereto, and equal might they wield:</a>
<a id='line_8266'>    Yields none to none, nor yields the rack, nor aught the waters yield;</a>
<a id='line_8267'>    Long hangs the battle; locked they stand, all things are striving then:</a>
<a id='line_8268'>    Not otherwise the Trojan host and host of Latin men                  360</a>
<a id='line_8269'>    Meet foot to foot, and man to man, close pressing in the fray.</a>
<a id='line_8270'></a>
<a id='line_8271'>    But in another place, where erst the torrent in its way</a>
<a id='line_8272'>    Had driven the rolling rocks along and torn trees of the banks,</a>
<a id='line_8273'>    Did Pallas see the Arcadian folk, unused to fight in ranks</a>
<a id='line_8274'>    Of footmen, turn their backs before the Latins in the chase,</a>
<a id='line_8275'>    Since they forsooth had left their steeds for roughness of the place:</a>
<a id='line_8276'>    Wherefore he did the only deed that failing Fortune would,</a>
<a id='line_8277'>    Striving with prayers and bitter words to make their valour good:</a>
<a id='line_8278'></a>
<a id='line_8279'>    "Where flee ye, fellows? Ah, I pray, by deeds that once were bold,</a>
<a id='line_8280'>    By name of King Evander dear, by glorious wars of old,               370</a>
<a id='line_8281'>    By my own hope of praise that springs to mate my father's praise,</a>
<a id='line_8282'>    Trust not your feet! with point and edge ye needs must cleave your ways</a>
<a id='line_8283'>    Amidst the foe. Where yon array of men doth thickest wend,</a>
<a id='line_8284'>    Thither our holy fatherland doth you and Pallas send:</a>
<a id='line_8285'>    No Gods weigh on us; mortal foes meet mortal men today;</a>
<a id='line_8286'>    As many hands we have to use, as many lives to pay.</a>
<a id='line_8287'>    Lo, how the ocean shuts us in with yonder watery wall!</a>
<a id='line_8288'>    Earth fails for flight--what! seaward then, or Troyward shall we fall?"</a>
<a id='line_8289'></a>
<a id='line_8290'>    Thus said, forthwith he breaketh in amid the foeman's press,</a>
<a id='line_8291'>    Whom Lagus met the first of all, by Fate's unrighteousness           380</a>
<a id='line_8292'>    Drawn thitherward: him, while a stone huge weighted he upheaves,</a>
<a id='line_8293'>    He pierceth with a whirling shaft just where the backbone cleaves</a>
<a id='line_8294'>    The ribs atwain, and back again he wrencheth forth the spear</a>
<a id='line_8295'>    Set mid the bones: nor him the more did Hisbo take unware,</a>
<a id='line_8296'>    Though that he hoped; for Pallas next withstood him, rushing on</a>
<a id='line_8297'>    All heedless-wild at that ill death his fellow fair had won,</a>
<a id='line_8298'>    And buried all his sword deep down amid his wind-swelled lung.</a>
<a id='line_8299'>    Then Sthenelus he meets, and one from ancient Rhoetus sprung,</a>
<a id='line_8300'>    Anchemolus, who dared defile his own stepmother's bed.</a>
<a id='line_8301'>    Ye also on Rutulian lea twin Daucus' sons lay dead,                  390</a>
<a id='line_8302'>    Larides, Thymber; so alike, O children, that by nought</a>
<a id='line_8303'>    Your parents knew you each from each, and sweet the error thought.</a>
<a id='line_8304'></a>
<a id='line_8305'>    But now to each did Pallas give a cruel marking-sign;</a>
<a id='line_8306'>    For, Thymber, the Evandrian sword smote off that head of thine:</a>
<a id='line_8307'>    And thy lopped right, Larides, seeks for that which was its lord,</a>
<a id='line_8308'>    The half-dead fingers quiver still and grip unto the sword.</a>
<a id='line_8309'></a>
<a id='line_8310'>    But now the Arcadians cheered by words, beholding his great deed,</a>
<a id='line_8311'>    The mingled shame and sorrow arm and 'gainst the foeman lead.</a>
<a id='line_8312'>    Then Pallas thrusteth Rhoeteus through a-flitting by in wain;</a>
<a id='line_8313'>    And so much space, so much delay, thereby did Ilus gain,             400</a>
<a id='line_8314'>    For 'twas at Ilus from afar that he his spear had cast</a>
<a id='line_8315'>    But Rhoeteus met it on the road fleeing from you full fast,</a>
<a id='line_8316'>    Best brethren, Teuthras, Tyres there: down from the car rolled he,</a>
<a id='line_8317'>    And with the half-dead heel of him beat the Rutulian lea.</a>
<a id='line_8318'></a>
<a id='line_8319'>    As when amidst the summer-tide he gains the wished-for breeze,</a>
<a id='line_8320'>    The shepherd sets the sparkled flame amid the thicket trees,</a>
<a id='line_8321'>    The wood's heart catches suddenly, the flames spread into one,</a>
<a id='line_8322'>    And fearful o'er the meadows wide doth Vulcan's army run,</a>
<a id='line_8323'>    While o'er the flames the victor sits and on their joy looks down.</a>
<a id='line_8324'>    No less the valour of thy folk unto a head was grown                 410</a>
<a id='line_8325'>    To help thee, Pallas: but behold, Halesus, fierce in field,</a>
<a id='line_8326'>    Turns on the foe, and gathers him 'neath cover of his shield.</a>
<a id='line_8327'>    Ladon, Pheres, Demodocus, all these he slaughtered there;</a>
<a id='line_8328'>    With gleaming sword he lopped the hand Strymonius did uprear</a>
<a id='line_8329'>    Against his throat: in Thoas' face withal a stone he sent,</a>
<a id='line_8330'>    And drave apart the riven bones with blood and brains all blent</a>
<a id='line_8331'>    Halesus' sire, the wise of Fate, in woods had hidden him;</a>
<a id='line_8332'>    But when that elder's whitening eyes at last in death did swim,</a>
<a id='line_8333'>    Fate took Halesus, hallowing him to King Evander's blade:</a>
<a id='line_8334'>    For Pallas aimeth at him now, when such wise he had prayed:          420</a>
<a id='line_8335'></a>
<a id='line_8336'>    "O Father Tiber, grant this spear, that herewithal I shake,</a>
<a id='line_8337'>    Through hard Halesus' breast forthwith a happy way may take;</a>
<a id='line_8338'>    So shall thine oak-tree have the arms, the warrior's battle-spoil."</a>
<a id='line_8339'></a>
<a id='line_8340'>    The God heard: while Halesus shields Imaon in the broil,</a>
<a id='line_8341'>    To that Arcadian shaft he gives his luckless body bared.</a>
<a id='line_8342'>    But nought would Lausus, lord of war, let all his host be scared,</a>
<a id='line_8343'>    E'en at the death of such a man: first Abas doth he slay,</a>
<a id='line_8344'>    Who faces him, the very knot and holdfast of the play.</a>
<a id='line_8345'>    Then fall Arcadia's sons to field; felled is Etruria's host,</a>
<a id='line_8346'>    And ye, O Teucrian bodies, erst by Grecian death unlost.             430</a>
<a id='line_8347'>    Then meet the hosts with lords well-matched and equal battle-might;</a>
<a id='line_8348'>    The outskirts of the battle close, nor 'mid the press of fight</a>
<a id='line_8349'>    May hand or spear move: busy now is Pallas on this side,</a>
<a id='line_8350'>    Lausus on that; nor is the space between their ages wide,</a>
<a id='line_8351'>    Those noble bodies: and both they were clean forbid of Fate</a>
<a id='line_8352'>    Return unto their lands: but he who rules Olympus great</a>
<a id='line_8353'>    Would nowise suffer them to meet themselves to end the play,</a>
<a id='line_8354'>    The doom of each from mightier foe abideth each today.</a>
<a id='line_8355'></a>
<a id='line_8356'>    But Turnus' sister warneth him to succour Lausus' war,</a>
<a id='line_8357'>    The gracious Goddess: straight he cleaves the battle in his car,     440</a>
<a id='line_8358'>    And when he sees his folk, cries out: "'Tis time to leave the fight!</a>
<a id='line_8359'>    Lone against Pallas do I fare, Pallas is mine of right;</a>
<a id='line_8360'>    I would his sire himself were here to look upon the field."</a>
<a id='line_8361'></a>
<a id='line_8362'>    He spake, and from the space forbid his fellow-folk did yield,</a>
<a id='line_8363'>    But when the Rutuli were gone, at such a word of pride</a>
<a id='line_8364'>    Amazed, the youth on Turnus stares, and lets his gaze go wide</a>
<a id='line_8365'>    O'er the huge frame, and from afar with stern eyes meets it all,</a>
<a id='line_8366'>    And 'gainst the words the tyrant spake such words from him there fall:</a>
<a id='line_8367'></a>
<a id='line_8368'>    "Now shall I win me praise of men for spoiling of a King,</a>
<a id='line_8369'>    Or for a glorious death: my sire may outface either thing:           450</a>
<a id='line_8370'>    Forbear thy threats."</a>
<a id='line_8371'>                          He spake, and straight amid the war-field drew;</a>
<a id='line_8372'>    But cold in that Arcadian folk therewith the heart-blood grew;</a>
<a id='line_8373'>    While Turnus from his war-wain leapt to go afoot to fight:</a>
<a id='line_8374'>    And as a lion sees afar from off his watch burg's height</a>
<a id='line_8375'>    A bull at gaze amid the mead with battle in his thought,</a>
<a id='line_8376'>    And flies thereto, so was the shape of coming Turnus wrought.</a>
<a id='line_8377'></a>
<a id='line_8378'>    But now, when Pallas deemed him come within the cast of spear,</a>
<a id='line_8379'>    He would be first, if Fate perchance should help him swift to dare,</a>
<a id='line_8380'>    And his less might, and thus he speaks unto the boundless sky:</a>
<a id='line_8381'>    "Now by my father's guesting-tide and board thou drew'st anigh,      460</a>
<a id='line_8382'>    A stranger, O Alcides, help this great deed I begin!</a>
<a id='line_8383'>    His bloody gear from limbs half-dead let Turnus see me win;</a>
<a id='line_8384'>    And on the dying eyes of him be victor's image pressed."</a>
<a id='line_8385'></a>
<a id='line_8386'>    Alcides heard the youth, and 'neath the inmost of his breast</a>
<a id='line_8387'>    He thrust aback a heavy groan, and empty tears he shed:</a>
<a id='line_8388'>    But to his son in kindly wise such words the Father said:</a>
<a id='line_8389'>    "His own day bideth every man; short space that none may mend</a>
<a id='line_8390'>    Is each man's life: but yet by deeds wide-spreading fame to send,</a>
<a id='line_8391'>    Man's valour hath this work to do: 'neath Troy's high-builded wall</a>
<a id='line_8392'>    How many sons of God there died: yea there he died withal,           470</a>
<a id='line_8393'>    Sarpedon my own progeny. Yea too and Turnus' Fates</a>
<a id='line_8394'>    Are calling him: he draweth nigh his life's departing-gates."</a>
<a id='line_8395'></a>
<a id='line_8396'>    He spake and turned his eyes away from fields of Rutuli:</a>
<a id='line_8397'>    But Pallas with great gathered strength the spear from him let fly,</a>
<a id='line_8398'>    And drew therewith from hollow sheath his sword all eager-bright.</a>
<a id='line_8399'>    The spear flew gleaming where the arms rise o'er the shoulder's height,</a>
<a id='line_8400'>    Smote home, and won its way at last through the shield's outer rim,</a>
<a id='line_8401'>    And Turnus' mighty body reached and grazed the flesh of him.</a>
<a id='line_8402'>    Long Turnus shook the oak that bore the bitter iron head,</a>
<a id='line_8403'>    Then cast at Pallas, and withal a word he cast and said:             480</a>
<a id='line_8404'>    "Let see now if this shaft of mine may better win a pass!"</a>
<a id='line_8405'>    He spake; for all its iron skin and all its plates of brass,</a>
<a id='line_8406'>    For all the swathing of bull-hides that round about it went,</a>
<a id='line_8407'>    The quivering spear smote through the shield and through its midmost rent</a>
<a id='line_8408'>    And through the mailcoat's staying fence the mighty breast did gain.</a>
<a id='line_8409'>    Then at the spear his heart-blood warmed did Pallas clutch in vain;</a>
<a id='line_8410'>    By one way and the same his blood and life, away they fare;</a>
<a id='line_8411'>    But down upon the wound he rolled, and o'er him clashed his gear,</a>
<a id='line_8412'>    And dying there his bloody mouth sought out the foeman's sod:</a>
<a id='line_8413'>    Whom Turnus overstrides and says:                                    490</a>
<a id='line_8414'></a>
<a id='line_8415'>    "Hearken Arcadians, bear ye back Evander words well learned:</a>
<a id='line_8416'>    Pallas I send him back again, dealt with as he hath earned,</a>
<a id='line_8417'>    If there be honour in a tomb, or solace in the earth,</a>
<a id='line_8418'>    I grudge it not--Ænean guests shall cost him things of worth."</a>
<a id='line_8419'></a>
<a id='line_8420'>    So spake he, and his left foot then he set upon the dead,</a>
<a id='line_8421'>    And tore the girdle thence away full heavy fashionèd,</a>
<a id='line_8422'>    And wrought with picture of a guilt; that youthful company</a>
<a id='line_8423'>    Slain foully on one wedding-night: bloody the bride-beds lie.</a>
<a id='line_8424'>    This Clonus son of Eurytus had wrought in plenteous gold,</a>
<a id='line_8425'>    Now Turnus wears it triumphing, merry such spoil to hold.--          500</a>
<a id='line_8426'>    --O heart of man, unlearned in Fate and what the days may hide,</a>
<a id='line_8427'>    Unlearned to be of measure still when swelled with happy tide!</a>
<a id='line_8428'>    The time shall come when Turnus wealth abundantly would pay</a>
<a id='line_8429'>    For Pallas whole, when he shall loathe that spoil, that conquering day.</a>
<a id='line_8430'></a>
<a id='line_8431'>    But Pallas' folk with plenteous groans and tears about him throng,</a>
<a id='line_8432'>    And laid upon his battle-shield they bear the dead along.</a>
<a id='line_8433'>    O thou, returning to thy sire, great grief and glory great,</a>
<a id='line_8434'>    Whom one same day gave unto war and swept away to fate,</a>
<a id='line_8435'>    Huge heaps of death Rutulian thou leav'st the meadow still.</a>
<a id='line_8436'></a>
<a id='line_8437'>    And now no rumour, but sure word of such a mighty ill                510</a>
<a id='line_8438'>    Flies to Æneas, how his folk within the deathgrip lie,</a>
<a id='line_8439'>    And how time pressed that he should aid the Teucrians turned to fly.</a>
<a id='line_8440'>    So all things near with sword he reaps, and wide he drives the road</a>
<a id='line_8441'>    Amid the foe with fiery steel, seeking thee, Turnus proud,</a>
<a id='line_8442'>    Through death new wrought; and Pallas now, Evander, all things there</a>
<a id='line_8443'>    Live in his eyes: the boards whereto that day he first drew near,</a>
<a id='line_8444'>    A stranger, and those plighted hands. Four youths of Sulmo wrought,</a>
<a id='line_8445'>    And the like tale that Ufens erst into the world's life brought,</a>
<a id='line_8446'>    He takes alive to slay them--gifts for that great ghost's avail,</a>
<a id='line_8447'>    And with a shower of captive blood to slake the dead men's bale.     520</a>
<a id='line_8448'>    Then next at Magus from afar the shaft of bane he sent;</a>
<a id='line_8449'>    Deftly he cowered, and on above the quivering weapon went,</a>
<a id='line_8450'>    And clasping both Æneas' knees thus spake the suppliant one:</a>
<a id='line_8451'></a>
<a id='line_8452'>    "O by thy father's ghost, by hope Iulus hath begun,</a>
<a id='line_8453'>    I pray thee for my sire and son my life yet let me win:</a>
<a id='line_8454'>    I have a high house, silver wrought is dug adown therein,</a>
<a id='line_8455'>    A talent's weight, and store therewith of wrought and unwrought gold:</a>
<a id='line_8456'>    This will not snatch the victory from out the Teucrian's hold,</a>
<a id='line_8457'>    Nor can the life of one alone such mighty matter make."</a>
<a id='line_8458'></a>
<a id='line_8459'>    So he, but answering thereunto this word Æneas spake:                530</a>
<a id='line_8460'>    "Thy gold and silver talent's weight, whereof thou tell'st such store,</a>
<a id='line_8461'>    Spare for thy sons! thy Turnus slew such chaffering of war</a>
<a id='line_8462'>    When Pallas' death he brought about a little while ago;</a>
<a id='line_8463'>    So deems my sire Anchises' ghost, Iulus deemeth so."</a>
<a id='line_8464'>    Then with his left he caught the helm and hilt-deep thrust the blade</a>
<a id='line_8465'>    Into the back-bent throat of him e'en as the prayer he prayed.</a>
<a id='line_8466'></a>
<a id='line_8467'>    Not far hence was Hæmonides, Phoebus' and Trivia's priest,</a>
<a id='line_8468'>    The holy fillets on his brow, his glory well increased</a>
<a id='line_8469'>    With glorious arms, and glittering gear shining on every limb.</a>
<a id='line_8470'>    Him the King chaseth o'er the field, and, standing over him,         540</a>
<a id='line_8471'>    Hides him in mighty dusk of death; whose gleanèd battle-gear,</a>
<a id='line_8472'>    A gift to thee, O battle-god, back doth Serestus bear.</a>
<a id='line_8473'>    Then Cæculus of Vulcan's stem the hedge of battle fills,</a>
<a id='line_8474'>    And Umbro cometh unto fight down from the Marsian hills.</a>
<a id='line_8475'>    On them his rage the Dardan child let slip. But next his blade</a>
<a id='line_8476'>    Anxur's left hand and orbèd shield upon the meadow laid.</a>
<a id='line_8477'>    Proud things had Anxur said, and deemed his word was matched by might,</a>
<a id='line_8478'>    And so perchance he raised his soul up to the heavenly height,</a>
<a id='line_8479'>    And hoary eld he looked to see, and many a peaceful year.</a>
<a id='line_8480'>    Tarquitius, proud of heart and soul, in glittering battle-gear,      550</a>
<a id='line_8481'>    Whom the nymph Dryope of yore to woodland Faunus gave,</a>
<a id='line_8482'>    Came thrusting thwart his fiery way; his back-drawn spear he drave,</a>
<a id='line_8483'>    Pinning his mail-coat unto him, and mighty mass of shield:</a>
<a id='line_8484'>    His vainly-praying head, that strove with words, upon the field</a>
<a id='line_8485'>    He swept therewith, and rolling o'er his carcase warm with death,</a>
<a id='line_8486'>    Above him from the heart of hate such words as this he saith:</a>
<a id='line_8487'></a>
<a id='line_8488'>    "Lie there, fear-giver! no more now thy mother most of worth</a>
<a id='line_8489'>    Shall load thee with thy father's tomb, or lay thee in the earth:</a>
<a id='line_8490'>    Thou shalt be left to birds of prey, or deep adown the flood</a>
<a id='line_8491'>    The waves shall bear thee, and thy wounds be hungry fishes' food."   560</a>
<a id='line_8492'></a>
<a id='line_8493'>    Next Lucas and Antæus stout, foremost of Turnus' men,</a>
<a id='line_8494'>    He chaseth: Numa staunch of heart and yellow Camers then;</a>
<a id='line_8495'>    A man from high-souled Volscens sprung, field-wealthiest one of all</a>
<a id='line_8496'>    Ausonian men, and lord within the hushed Amyclæ's wall.</a>
<a id='line_8497'></a>
<a id='line_8498'>    E'en as Ægæon, who they say had arms an hundred-fold,</a>
<a id='line_8499'>    And hundred hands, from fifty mouths and maws the wildfire rolled,</a>
<a id='line_8500'>    What time in arms against the bolts from Jove of Heaven that flew</a>
<a id='line_8501'>    He clashed upon the fifty shields and fifty sword-points drew:</a>
<a id='line_8502'>    So conquering, over all the mead Æneas' fury burns                   569</a>
<a id='line_8503'>    When once his sword is warm with death: and now, behold, he turns</a>
<a id='line_8504'>    Upon Niphæus' four-yoked steeds, and breasts their very breath.</a>
<a id='line_8505'>    But when they see him striding far, and threatening doom and death,</a>
<a id='line_8506'>    In utter dread they turn about, and rushing back again,</a>
<a id='line_8507'>    They shed their master on the earth and shoreward drag the wain.</a>
<a id='line_8508'></a>
<a id='line_8509'>    Meanwhile with twi-yoked horses white fares Lucagus midst men,</a>
<a id='line_8510'>    His brother Liger by his side, who holdeth rein as then,</a>
<a id='line_8511'>    And turneth steed, while Lucagus the drawn sword whirleth wide.</a>
<a id='line_8512'>    Them and their war-rage in no wise Æneas might abide,</a>
<a id='line_8513'>    But on he rushes, showing huge with upheaved threatening shaft.</a>
<a id='line_8514'>    Then Liger cast a word at him:                                       580</a>
<a id='line_8515'>    "No steeds of Diomede thou seest, and no Achilles' car</a>
<a id='line_8516'>    Or Phrygian fields: this hour shall end thy life-days and the war</a>
<a id='line_8517'>    Here on this earth."</a>
<a id='line_8518'>                          Such words as these from witless Liger stray,</a>
<a id='line_8519'>    But nought in bandying of words the man of Troy would play;</a>
<a id='line_8520'>    Rather his mighty battle-shaft he hurled against the foe,</a>
<a id='line_8521'>    While Lucagus his horses drives with spear-butt, bending low</a>
<a id='line_8522'>    Over the lash, and setteth forth his left foot for the fight.</a>
<a id='line_8523'>    Beneath the bright shield's nether rim the spear-shaft takes its flight,</a>
<a id='line_8524'>    Piercing his groin upon the left: then shaken from his wain,</a>
<a id='line_8525'>    He tumbleth down and rolleth o'er in death upon the plain.           590</a>
<a id='line_8526'>    To whom a fierce and bitter word godly Æneas said:</a>
<a id='line_8527'></a>
<a id='line_8528'>    "Ho, Lucagus! no dastard flight of steeds thy car betrayed,</a>
<a id='line_8529'>    No empty shadow turned them back from facing of the foe,</a>
<a id='line_8530'>    But thou thyself hast leapt from wheel and let the yoke-beasts go."</a>
<a id='line_8531'></a>
<a id='line_8532'>    He spake, and caught the reins withal; slipped down that wretched one</a>
<a id='line_8533'>    His brother, and stretched forth the hands that little deed had done:</a>
<a id='line_8534'>    "By thee, by those that brought thee forth so glorious unto day,</a>
<a id='line_8535'>    O Trojan hero, spare my life, and pity me that pray!"</a>
<a id='line_8536'></a>
<a id='line_8537'>    Æneas cut athwart his speech: "Not so erewhile ye spake.</a>
<a id='line_8538'>    Die! ill it were for brother thus a brother to forsake."             600</a>
<a id='line_8539'>    And in his breast the sword he drave home to the house of breath.</a>
<a id='line_8540'></a>
<a id='line_8541'>    Thus through the meads the Dardan Duke set forth the tale of death,</a>
<a id='line_8542'>    With rage as of the rushing flood, or whirl-storm of the wind.</a>
<a id='line_8543'>    At last they break forth into field and leave their camp behind,</a>
<a id='line_8544'>    Ascanius and the lads of war in vain beleaguerèd.</a>
<a id='line_8545'></a>
<a id='line_8546'>    Meanwhile to Juno Jupiter set forth the speech and said:</a>
<a id='line_8547'>    "O thou who art my sister dear and sweetest wife in one,</a>
<a id='line_8548'>    'Tis Venus as thou deemedst, (nought thy counsel is undone),</a>
<a id='line_8549'>    Who upholds Trojan might forsooth: they lack fight-eager hand,</a>
<a id='line_8550'>    They lack fierce heart and steady soul the peril to withstand!"      610</a>
<a id='line_8551'></a>
<a id='line_8552'>    To whom spake Juno, meek of mood: "And why, O fairest lord,</a>
<a id='line_8553'>    Dost thou so vex me sad at heart, fearing thy heavy word?</a>
<a id='line_8554'>    But in my soul were love as strong as once it used to be,</a>
<a id='line_8555'>    And should be, thou though all of might wouldst ne'er deny it me,</a>
<a id='line_8556'>    That Turnus I should draw away from out the midst of fight,</a>
<a id='line_8557'>    That I might keep him safe to bless his father Daunus' sight.</a>
<a id='line_8558'>    Now let him die, let hallowed blood the Teucrian hate atone:</a>
<a id='line_8559'>    And yet indeed his name and race from blood of ours hath grown;</a>
<a id='line_8560'>    He from Pilumnus is put forth: yea, good gifts furthermore</a>
<a id='line_8561'>    His open hand full oft hath piled within thine holy door."           620</a>
<a id='line_8562'></a>
<a id='line_8563'>    To whom air-high Olympus' king short-worded answer made:</a>
<a id='line_8564'>    "If for the youth who soon must fall respite of death is prayed,</a>
<a id='line_8565'>    And tarrying-time, nor aught thou deem'st but that my doom must stand,</a>
<a id='line_8566'>    Then carry Turnus off by flight, snatch him from fate at hand.</a>
<a id='line_8567'>    So far thy longing may I please: but if a greater grace</a>
<a id='line_8568'>    Lurk 'neath thy prayers, and thou hast hope to change the battle's face,</a>
<a id='line_8569'>    And turmoil everything once more, thou feedest hope in vain."</a>
<a id='line_8570'></a>
<a id='line_8571'>    Then Juno weeping: "Ah, but if thy heart should give the gain</a>
<a id='line_8572'>    Thy voice begrudgeth! if 'twere doomed that he in life abide--</a>
<a id='line_8573'>    But ill-end dogs the sackless man, unless I wander wide              630</a>
<a id='line_8574'>    Away from sooth--Ah, yet may I be mocked of fear-wrought lies,</a>
<a id='line_8575'>    And may thy rede as thou hast might be turned to better wise."</a>
<a id='line_8576'></a>
<a id='line_8577'>    She spake the word and cast herself adown from heaven the high,</a>
<a id='line_8578'>    Girt round with rain-cloud, driving on a storm amid the sky,</a>
<a id='line_8579'>    And that Laurentian leaguer sought and Ilium's hedge of fight.</a>
<a id='line_8580'>    And there she fashioned of the cloud a shadow lacking might:</a>
<a id='line_8581'>    With image of Æneas' shape the wondrous show is drest,</a>
<a id='line_8582'>    She decks it with the Dardan spear and shield, and mocks the crest</a>
<a id='line_8583'>    Of that all-godlike head, and gives a speech that empty flows,</a>
<a id='line_8584'>    Sound without soul, and counterfeits the gait wherewith he goes,--   640</a>
<a id='line_8585'>    As dead men's images they say about the air will sweep,</a>
<a id='line_8586'>    Or as the senses weary-drenched are mocked with dreams of sleep.</a>
<a id='line_8587'>    But in the forefront of the fight war-merry goes the thing,</a>
<a id='line_8588'>    And cries the warrior on with words and weapons brandishing:</a>
<a id='line_8589'>    On whom falls Turnus, and afar hurleth his whizzing spear:</a>
<a id='line_8590'>    Then turns the phantom back about and fleeth as in fear.</a>
<a id='line_8591'>    Then verily when Turnus deemed he saw Æneas fled.</a>
<a id='line_8592'>    With all the emptiness of hope his headlong heart he fed:</a>
<a id='line_8593'>    "Where fleest thou, Æneas, then? why leave thy plighted bride?       649</a>
<a id='line_8594'>    This hand shall give thee earth thou sought'st so far across the tide."</a>
<a id='line_8595'>    So cries he following, brandishing his naked sword on high,</a>
<a id='line_8596'>    Nor sees what wise adown the wind his battle-bliss goes by.</a>
<a id='line_8597'></a>
<a id='line_8598'>    By hap a ship was moored anear unto a ledgy stone,</a>
<a id='line_8599'>    With ladders out and landing-bridge all ready to let down,</a>
<a id='line_8600'>    That late the King Orsinius bore from Clusium o'er the sea;</a>
<a id='line_8601'>    And thereinto the hurrying lie, Æneas' shape, did flee,</a>
<a id='line_8602'>    And down its lurking-places dived: but Turnus none the more</a>
<a id='line_8603'>    Hangs back, but beating down delay swift runs the high bridge o'er.</a>
<a id='line_8604'>    Scarce on the prow, ere Juno brake the mooring-rope atwain,</a>
<a id='line_8605'>    And rapt the sundered ship away o'er back-draught of the main.       660</a>
<a id='line_8606'>    And there afar from fight is he on whom Æneas cries,</a>
<a id='line_8607'>    Still sending down to death's abode an host of enemies;</a>
<a id='line_8608'>    Nor any more the image then will seek his shape to shroud,</a>
<a id='line_8609'>    But flying upward blendeth him amid the mirky cloud.</a>
<a id='line_8610'></a>
<a id='line_8611'>    Meanwhile, as midmost of the sea the flood bore Turnus on,</a>
<a id='line_8612'>    Blind to the deed that was in hand, thankless for safety won,</a>
<a id='line_8613'>    He looketh round, and hands and voice starward he reacheth forth:</a>
<a id='line_8614'>    "Almighty Father, deemedst thou my guilt so much of worth?</a>
<a id='line_8615'>    And wouldst thou have me welter through such woeful tide of pain?</a>
<a id='line_8616'>    Whence? whither? why this flight? what man shall I come back again?</a>
<a id='line_8617'>    Ah, shall I see Laurentum's walls, or see my camp once more?         671</a>
<a id='line_8618'>    What shall betide the fellowship that followed me to war,</a>
<a id='line_8619'>    Whom I have left? O misery to die the death alone!</a>
<a id='line_8620'>    I see them scattered even now, I hear the dying groan.</a>
<a id='line_8621'>    What do I? what abyss of earth is deep enough to hide</a>
<a id='line_8622'>    The wretched man? But ye, O winds, be merciful this tide,</a>
<a id='line_8623'>    On rocks, on stones--I, Turnus, thus adore you with good will--</a>
<a id='line_8624'>    Drive ye the ship, or cast it up on Syrtes' shoals of ill,</a>
<a id='line_8625'>    Where Rutuli and tell-tale Fame shall never find me out!"</a>
<a id='line_8626'></a>
<a id='line_8627'>    Hither and thither as he spake his spirit swam in doubt,             680</a>
<a id='line_8628'>    Shall he now fall upon the point, whom shame hath witless made,</a>
<a id='line_8629'>    Amid most of his very ribs driving the bitter blade;</a>
<a id='line_8630'>    Or casting him amid the waves swim for the hollow strand,</a>
<a id='line_8631'>    And give his body back again to sworded Teucrian band?</a>
<a id='line_8632'>    Thrice either deed he fell to do, and thrice for very ruth</a>
<a id='line_8633'>    The mightiest Juno stayed his hand and held aback his youth.</a>
<a id='line_8634'>    So 'neath a fair and following wind he glideth o'er the sea,</a>
<a id='line_8635'>    And to his father's ancient walls is ferried presently.</a>
<a id='line_8636'></a>
<a id='line_8637'>    Meanwhile, by Jupiter's command, Mezentius props the fight,</a>
<a id='line_8638'>    And all ablaze he falleth on the gladdened Teucrian might:           690</a>
<a id='line_8639'>    The Tuscan host rush up, and all upon one man alone</a>
<a id='line_8640'>    Press on with hatred in their hearts and cloud of weapons thrown.</a>
<a id='line_8641'>    Yet is he as a rock thrust out amid the mighty deep</a>
<a id='line_8642'>    To meet the raging of the winds, bare to the water's sweep.</a>
<a id='line_8643'>    All threats of sea and sky it bears, all might that they may wield,</a>
<a id='line_8644'>    Itself unmoved. Dolichaon's son he felleth unto field,</a>
<a id='line_8645'>    One Hebrus; Latagus with him, and Palmus as he fled.</a>
<a id='line_8646'>    But Latagus with stone he smites, a mighty mountain-shred,</a>
<a id='line_8647'>    Amid the face and front of him, and Palmus, slow to dare,</a>
<a id='line_8648'>    Sends rolling ham-strung: but their arms he biddeth Lausus bear       700</a>
<a id='line_8649'>    Upon his back, and with their crests upon his helm to wend.</a>
<a id='line_8650'>    Phrygian Evanthes then he slays, and Mimas, whiles the friend</a>
<a id='line_8651'>    Like-aged of Paris; unto day and Amycus his sire</a>
<a id='line_8652'>    Theano gave him on the night that she who went with fire,</a>
<a id='line_8653'>    E'en Cisseus' daughter, Paris bore: now Paris lies asleep</a>
<a id='line_8654'>    In ancient Troy; Laurentian land unknown doth Mimas keep.</a>
<a id='line_8655'></a>
<a id='line_8656'>    Tis as a boar by bite of hounds from the high mountains driven,</a>
<a id='line_8657'>    Who on pine-nursing Vesulus a many years hath thriven,</a>
<a id='line_8658'>    Or safe in that Laurentian marsh long years hath had his home,</a>
<a id='line_8659'>    And fed adown the reedy wood; now mid the toil-nets come             710</a>
<a id='line_8660'>    He stands at bay, and foameth fierce, and bristleth up all o'er,</a>
<a id='line_8661'>    And none hath heart to draw anigh and rouse the wrath of war,</a>
<a id='line_8662'>    But with safe shouts and shafts aloof they press about the place;</a>
<a id='line_8663'>    While he, unhastening, unafeard, doth everywhither face,</a>
<a id='line_8664'>    Gnashing his teeth and shaking off the spears from out his back.</a>
<a id='line_8665'>    So they, who 'gainst Mezentius there just wrath do nowise lack,</a>
<a id='line_8666'>    Lack heart to meet him hand to hand with naked brandished blade,</a>
<a id='line_8667'>    But clamour huge and weapon-shot from far upon him laid.</a>
<a id='line_8668'></a>
<a id='line_8669'>    From that old land of Corythus erewhile had Acron come,</a>
<a id='line_8670'>    A Grecian man; half-wed he passed the threshold of his home:         720</a>
<a id='line_8671'>    Whom when Mezentius saw afar turmoiling the mid fight,</a>
<a id='line_8672'>    Purple with plumes and glorious web his love for him had dight;</a>
<a id='line_8673'>    E'en as a lion hunger-pinched about the high-fenced fold,</a>
<a id='line_8674'>    When ravening famine driveth him, if he by chance behold</a>
<a id='line_8675'>    Some she-goat, or a hart that thrusts his antlers up in air,</a>
<a id='line_8676'>    Merry he waxeth, gaping fierce his mane doth he uprear,</a>
<a id='line_8677'>    And hugs the flesh he lies upon; a loathsome sea of blood</a>
<a id='line_8678'>    Washes the horror of his mouth.</a>
<a id='line_8679'>    So merry runs Mezentius forth amid the press of foes,</a>
<a id='line_8680'>    And hapless Acron falls, and pounds the black earth mid his throes   730</a>
<a id='line_8681'>    With beat of heel; staining the shaft that splintered in the wound.</a>
<a id='line_8682'>    Scorn had he then Orodes swift to fell unto the ground</a>
<a id='line_8683'>    Amidst his flight, or give blind bane with unknown cast afar;</a>
<a id='line_8684'>    He ran to meet him man to man, prevailing in the war</a>
<a id='line_8685'>    By nought of guile or ambushing, but by the dint of blade.</a>
<a id='line_8686'>    Foot on the fallen then he set, and strength to spear-shaft laid:</a>
<a id='line_8687'>    "Fellows, here tall Orodes lies, no thrall in battle throng."</a>
<a id='line_8688'>    Then merrily his following folk shout forth their victory-song:</a>
<a id='line_8689'>    Yet saith the dying:</a>
<a id='line_8690'>                        "Whosoe'er thou art, thou winnest me</a>
<a id='line_8691'>    Not unavenged: thy joy grows old: the like fate looks for thee,      740</a>
<a id='line_8692'>    And thou the self-same lea shalt hold within a little while!"</a>
<a id='line_8693'></a>
<a id='line_8694'>    To whom Mezentius spake, his wrath crossed by a gathering smile:</a>
<a id='line_8695'>    "Die thou! the Father of the Gods, the earth-abider's lord,</a>
<a id='line_8696'>    Will look to me."</a>
<a id='line_8697'>                     He drew the spear from out him at the word,</a>
<a id='line_8698'>    And iron slumber fell on him, hard rest weighed down his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_8699'>    And shut were they for evermore by night that never dies.</a>
<a id='line_8700'></a>
<a id='line_8701'>    Now Cædicus slays Alcathous; Sacrator ends outright</a>

<a id='line_8713'>    But in Jove's house the Gods had ruth of rage that nothing wrought,</a>

<a id='line_8717'>    But lo, Mezentius fierce and fell, shaking a mighty spear,</a>
<a id='line_8718'>    Stalks o'er the plain.--Lo now, how great doth great Orion sweep</a>
<a id='line_8719'>    Afoot across the Nereus' field, the mid sea's mightiest deep,</a>
<a id='line_8720'>    Cleaving his way, raised shoulder-high above the billowy wash;</a>
<a id='line_8721'>    Or when from off the mountain-top he bears an ancient ash</a>
<a id='line_8722'>    His feet are on the soil of earth, the cloud-rack hides his head:</a>
<a id='line_8723'>    --E'en so in mighty battle-gear afield Mezentius sped.</a>
<a id='line_8724'></a>
<a id='line_8725'>    But now Æneas, noting him adown the battle-row,</a>
<a id='line_8726'>    Wendeth to meet him; undismayed he bideth for his foe,               770</a>
<a id='line_8727'>    Facing the great-souled man, and stands unmoved, a mighty mass:</a>
<a id='line_8728'>    Then measuring the space between if spear thereby may pass:</a>
<a id='line_8729'>    "Right hand," he cries, "my very God, and fleeing spear I shake,</a>
<a id='line_8730'>    To aid! Thee, Lausus, clad in arms that I today shall take</a>
<a id='line_8731'>    From body of the sea-thief here I vow for gift of war</a>
<a id='line_8732'>    Over Æneas slain."</a>
<a id='line_8733'>                      He spake, and hurled the shaft afar</a>
<a id='line_8734'>    Loud whistling: from the shield it glanced, and flying far and wide</a>
<a id='line_8735'>    Smit glory-great Antores down through bowels and through side:</a>
<a id='line_8736'>    Antores friend of Hercules, who, erst from Argos come,               780</a>
<a id='line_8737'>    Clung to Evander, and abode in that Italian home:</a>
<a id='line_8738'>    There laid to earth by straying wound he looketh on the sky,</a>
<a id='line_8739'>    With lovely Argos in his heart, though death be come anigh.</a>
<a id='line_8740'></a>
<a id='line_8741'>    Then good Æneas cast his spear, and through the hollow round</a>
<a id='line_8742'>    Of triple brass, through linen skin, through craftsmanship inwound,</a>
<a id='line_8743'>    With threefold bull-hides, pierced the shaft, and in the groin did lie,</a>
<a id='line_8744'>    Nor further could its might avail. Then swiftly from his thigh</a>
<a id='line_8745'>    Æneas caught his glaive, and glad the Tyrrhene blood to see,</a>
<a id='line_8746'>    Set on upon his wildered foe hot-heart and eagerly.</a>
<a id='line_8747'>    But Lausus, by his father's love sore moved, did all behold,</a>
<a id='line_8748'>    And groaned aloud, while o'er his cheeks a heavy tear-flood rolled   790</a>
<a id='line_8749'>    --Ah, I will tell of thine ill-fate and deeds that thou hast done;</a>
<a id='line_8750'>    If any troth in stories told may reach from yore agone,</a>
<a id='line_8751'>    My speech, O unforgotten youth, in nowise shalt thou lack--</a>
<a id='line_8752'>    The father with a halting foot hampered and spent drew back,</a>
<a id='line_8753'>    Still dragging on the foeman's spear that hung amid his shield;</a>
<a id='line_8754'>    But mingling him in battle-rush the son took up the field,</a>
<a id='line_8755'>    And as Æneas' right hand rose well laden with the blow</a>
<a id='line_8756'>    He ran beneath, bore off the sword, and stayed the eager foe,</a>
<a id='line_8757'>    And with a mighty shout behind his fellows follow on,</a>
<a id='line_8758'>    While shielded by his son's defence the father gat him gone,         800</a>
<a id='line_8759'>    And shafts they cast and vex the foe with weapon shot afar.</a>
<a id='line_8760'>    Mad wroth Æneas grows, but bides well covered from the war;</a>
<a id='line_8761'>    And as at whiles the clouds come down with furious pelt of hail,</a>
<a id='line_8762'>    And every driver of the plough the beaten lea doth fail,</a>
<a id='line_8763'>    And every one that works afield, while safe the traveller lurks</a>
<a id='line_8764'>    In castle of the river-bank or rock-wrought cloister-works,</a>
<a id='line_8765'>    The while the rain is on the earth, that they may wear the day</a>
<a id='line_8766'>    When once again the sun comes back;--so on Æneas lay</a>
<a id='line_8767'>    The shaft-storm, so the hail of fight loud thundering he abode,</a>
<a id='line_8768'>    And Lausus with the wrath of words, Lausus with threats did load.    810</a>
<a id='line_8769'>    "Ah, whither rushest thou to die, and darest things o'ergreat?</a>
<a id='line_8770'>    Thy love betrays thine heedless heart."</a>
<a id='line_8771'>                                           No less, the fool of fate,</a>
<a id='line_8772'>    He rusheth on, till high and fierce the tide of wrath doth win</a>
<a id='line_8773'>    O'er heart of that Dardanian duke, and now the Parcæ spin</a>
<a id='line_8774'>    Lausus' last thread: for his stark sword Æneas drives outright</a>
<a id='line_8775'>    Through the young body, hiding it hilt-deep therein from light</a>
<a id='line_8776'>    It pierced the shield and glittering gear wherewith he threatened war,</a>
<a id='line_8777'>    And kirtle that his mother erst with gold had broidered o'er,</a>
<a id='line_8778'>    And flooded all his breast with blood; and woeful down the wind</a>
<a id='line_8779'>    His spirit sought the under-world, and left his corpse behind.       820</a>
<a id='line_8780'></a>
<a id='line_8781'>    But when Anchises' son beheld the face of that dead man,</a>
<a id='line_8782'>    His face that in a wondrous wise grew faded out and wan,</a>
<a id='line_8783'>    Groaning for ruth his hand therewith down toward him did he move,</a>
<a id='line_8784'>    For o'er his soul the image came of his own father's love:</a>
<a id='line_8785'>    "O boy, whom all shall weep, what then for such a glorious deed,</a>
<a id='line_8786'>    What gift can good Æneas give, thy bounteous valour's meed?</a>
<a id='line_8787'>    Keep thou the arms thou joyedst in. I give thy body here</a>
<a id='line_8788'>    Unto thy father's buried ghosts, if thou thereof hast care.</a>
<a id='line_8789'>    But let this somewhat solace thee for thine unhappy death,</a>
<a id='line_8790'>    By great Æneas' hand thou diest."</a>
<a id='line_8791'>                                     Then chiding words he saith         830</a>
<a id='line_8792'>    Unto his fellows hanging back, and lifteth up the dead</a>
<a id='line_8793'>    From off the lea, where blood defiled the tresses of his head.</a>
<a id='line_8794'></a>
<a id='line_8795'>    Meanwhile the father by the wave that ripples Tiber's breast</a>
<a id='line_8796'>    With water staunched his bleeding hurt and gave his body rest,</a>
<a id='line_8797'>    Leaning against a tree-trunk there: high up amid the tree</a>
<a id='line_8798'>    Hangeth his brazen helm; his arms lie heavy on the lea;</a>
<a id='line_8799'>    The chosen war-youths stand about: he, sick and panting now,</a>
<a id='line_8800'>    Nurseth his neck, and o'er his breast his combed-down beard lets flow.</a>
<a id='line_8801'>    Much about Lausus did he ask, and sore to men he spake</a>
<a id='line_8802'>    To bid him back, or warning word from his sad sire to take.          840</a>
<a id='line_8803'>    But Lausus dead his weeping folk were bearing on his shield;</a>
<a id='line_8804'>    A mighty heart, to mighty hand the victory must he yield</a>
<a id='line_8805'>    The father's soul foretaught of ill, afar their wail he knew,</a>
<a id='line_8806'>    And fouled his hoar hair with the dust, and both his hands upthrew</a>
<a id='line_8807'>    Toward heaven aloft; then clinging fast unto that lifeless one:</a>
<a id='line_8808'></a>
<a id='line_8809'>    "What lust," saith he, "of longer life so held my heart, O son,</a>
<a id='line_8810'>    That thee, my son, I suffered thus to bare thee to the bane</a>
<a id='line_8811'>    Instead of me; that I, thy sire, health of thy hurts I gain,</a>
<a id='line_8812'>    Life of thy death! Ah now at last my exile is become</a>
<a id='line_8813'>    A woe unto my weary heart; yea, now the wound goes home.             850</a>
<a id='line_8814'>    For I am he who stained thy name, O son, with guilt of mine,</a>
<a id='line_8815'>    Thrust forth by Fate from fatherland and sceptre of my line:</a>
<a id='line_8816'>    I should have paid the penalty unto my country's hate,</a>
<a id='line_8817'>    And given up my guilty soul to death, my very fate.</a>
<a id='line_8818'>    I live: I leave not sons of men, nor let the light go by--</a>
<a id='line_8819'>    --Yet will I leave them."</a>
<a id='line_8820'>                             So he spake, and on his halting thigh</a>
<a id='line_8821'>    Rose up, and, howsoe'er his hurt might drag his body down,</a>
<a id='line_8822'>    Unvanquished yet, he called his horse, his very pleasures crown,</a>
<a id='line_8823'>    And glory; who had borne him forth victorious from all war;</a>
<a id='line_8824'>    And thus he spake unto the beast that seemed to sorrow sore:         860</a>
<a id='line_8825'></a>
<a id='line_8826'>    "Rhoebus, o'erlong--if aught be long to men that pass away--</a>
<a id='line_8827'>    Have we twain lived: those bloody spoils shalt thou bring home today,</a>
<a id='line_8828'>    And carrying Æneas' head avenge my Lausus' woe.</a>
<a id='line_8829'>    Or if our might no more may make a road whereby to go,</a>
<a id='line_8830'>    Thou too shalt fall: I deem indeed thou, stout-heart, hast no will</a>
<a id='line_8831'>    To suffer other men's commands, or Trojan joy fulfil."</a>
<a id='line_8832'></a>
<a id='line_8833'>    And therewithal he backeth him, and as he used of old</a>
<a id='line_8834'>    Settleth his limbs: good store of shafts his either hand doth hold:</a>
<a id='line_8835'>    His head is glittering o'er with brass, and horse-hair shags his crest.</a>
<a id='line_8836'>    So midmost of the fight he bears, and ever in his breast             870</a>
<a id='line_8837'>    Swelleth the mighty sea of shame and mingled miseries.</a>
<a id='line_8838'>    And now across the fight his voice thrice on Æneas cries.</a>
<a id='line_8839'>    Æneas knew it well forsooth, and joyfully he prayed:</a>
<a id='line_8840'>    "So grant the Father of the Gods! So may Apollo aid</a>
<a id='line_8841'>    That thou may'st fall on me in fight!"</a>
<a id='line_8842'></a>
<a id='line_8843'>    So much he spake, and went his way to meet the foeman's shaft;</a>
<a id='line_8844'>    But spake the other: "Bitter wretch, who took'st away my son,</a>
<a id='line_8845'>    Why fright me now? by that one way my heart might be undone:</a>
<a id='line_8846'>    No death I dread, no God that is, in battle would I spare.</a>
<a id='line_8847'>    Enough--I come to thee to die; but first these gifts I bear."        880</a>
<a id='line_8848'></a>
<a id='line_8849'>    He spake the word, and 'gainst the foe a dart withal he cast,</a>
<a id='line_8850'>    And shaft on shaft he lays on him about him flitting fast,</a>
<a id='line_8851'>    Wide circling; but the golden boss through all the storm bore out</a>
<a id='line_8852'>    Thrice while Æneas faceth him he rides the ring about,</a>
<a id='line_8853'>    Casting the weapons from his hand; and thrice the Trojan lord</a>
<a id='line_8854'>    Bears round a mighty thicket set in brazen battle-board.</a>
<a id='line_8855'>    But when such tarrying wearieth him, such plucking forth of spears,</a>
<a id='line_8856'>    And standing in such ill-matched fight the heart within him wears,</a>
<a id='line_8857'>    Turning the thing o'er manywise, he breaketh forth to speed</a>
<a id='line_8858'>    A shaft amid the hollow brow of that war-famous steed:               890</a>
<a id='line_8859'>    Then beating of the air with hoof uprears the four-foot thing</a>
<a id='line_8860'>    And with his fallen master falls, and 'neath his cumbering</a>
<a id='line_8861'>    Weighs down his shoulders brought to earth, and heavy on him lies.</a>
<a id='line_8862'>    Then Trojan men and Latin men with shouting burn the skies,</a>
<a id='line_8863'>    And swift Æneas runneth up and pulleth forth his sword,</a>
<a id='line_8864'>    And crieth o'er him:</a>
<a id='line_8865'>                          "Where is now Mezentius, eager lord?</a>
<a id='line_8866'>    Where is the fierce heart?"</a>
<a id='line_8867'>                                Unto whom the Tuscan spake, when he</a>
<a id='line_8868'>    Got sense again, and breathed the air, and o'er him heaven did see:</a>
<a id='line_8869'>    "O bitter foe, why chidest thou? why slayest thou with words?        899</a>
<a id='line_8870'>    Slay me and do no wrong! death-safe I came not mid the swords;</a>
<a id='line_8871'>    And no such covenant of war for us my Lausus bought:</a>
<a id='line_8872'>    One thing I pray, if vanquished men of grace may gain them aught,</a>
<a id='line_8873'>    Let the earth hide me! well I know how bitter and how nigh</a>
<a id='line_8874'>    My people's wrath draws in on me: put thou their fury by,</a>
<a id='line_8875'>    And in the tomb beside my son I pray thee let me lie."</a>
<a id='line_8876'></a>
<a id='line_8877'>    He saith, and open-eyed receives the sword-point in his throat,</a>
<a id='line_8878'>    And o'er his arms in waves of blood his life and soul doth float.</a>

<a id='line_8890'></a>
<a id='line_8891'>    Meanwhile Aurora risen up from bed of ocean wends,</a>
<a id='line_8892'>    And King Æneas, though his grief bids him in burying friends</a>
<a id='line_8893'>    To wear the day, and though his heart the death of men dismays,</a>
<a id='line_8894'>    Yet to the Gods of Dawning-tide the worship duly pays.</a>

<a id='line_8899'>    The broken shafts, the mail-coat pierced amid the foughten field</a>
<a id='line_8900'>    With twice six dints: on the left arm he tied the brazen shield,      10</a>
<a id='line_8901'>    And round about the neck he hung the ivory-hilted sword.</a>
<a id='line_8902'>    Then to his friends, a mighty hedge of duke and battle-lord,</a>
<a id='line_8903'>    He turned, and to their joyous hearts these words withal he said:</a>

<a id='line_8920'></a>
<a id='line_8921'>    With weeping eyes he drew aback, e'en as the word he said,</a>
<a id='line_8922'>    Unto the threshold of the place where Pallas, cold and dead,          30</a>
<a id='line_8923'>    The old Acoetes watched, who erst of that Parrhasian King,</a>
<a id='line_8924'>    Evander, was the shield-bearer, but now was following</a>
<a id='line_8925'>    His well-belovèd foster-child in no such happy wise;</a>
<a id='line_8926'>    But round him were the homemen's band and Trojan companies,</a>
<a id='line_8927'>    And Ilian wives with loosened locks in guise of sorrow sore.</a>
<a id='line_8928'>    But when Æneas entereth now beneath the lofty door</a>
<a id='line_8929'>    From beaten breast great moan they cast up to the starry heaven;</a>

<a id='line_8932'>    The snow-white face, the open wound wrought on the smooth young breast</a>
<a id='line_8933'>    By that Ausonian spear, so spake amid his gathered tears:</a>
<a id='line_8934'></a>
<a id='line_8935'>    "O boy bewept, despite the gifts my happy Fortune bears</a>
<a id='line_8936'>    Doth she still grudge it thee to see my kingdom glorious,</a>
<a id='line_8937'>    Or come a victor back again unto thy father's house?</a>
<a id='line_8938'>    Not such the promise that I gave on that departing day</a>
<a id='line_8939'>    Unto thy father, whose embrace then sped me on my way</a>
<a id='line_8940'>    To mighty lordship, while his fear gave forth the warning word</a>
<a id='line_8941'>    That with fierce folk I had to do, hard people of the sword.</a>
<a id='line_8942'>    Now he, deceived by empty hope, belike pours forth the prayer,</a>
<a id='line_8943'>    And pileth up the gifts for nought upon the altars fair,              50</a>
<a id='line_8944'>    While we--in woe with honours vain--about his son we stand,</a>

<a id='line_8947'>    Is this the coming back again? is this the triumph won?</a>
<a id='line_8948'>    Is this my solemn troth?--Yet thee, Evander, bides no sight</a>
<a id='line_8949'>    Of craven beat with shameful wounds, nor for the saved from fight</a>
<a id='line_8950'>    Shalt thou but long for dreadful death.--Woe's me, Ausonian land!</a>
<a id='line_8951'>    Woe's me, Iulus, what a shield is perished from thine hand!"</a>
<a id='line_8952'></a>
<a id='line_8953'>    Such wise he wept him, and bade raise the hapless body dead,</a>
<a id='line_8954'>    And therewithal a thousand men, his war-hosts' flower, he sped        60</a>
<a id='line_8955'>    To wait upon him on the way with that last help of all,</a>
<a id='line_8956'>    And be between his father's tears: forsooth a solace small</a>
<a id='line_8957'>    Of mighty grief; a debt no less to that sad father due.</a>
<a id='line_8958'>    But others speed a pliant bier weaving a wattle through,</a>
<a id='line_8959'>    Of limber twigs of berry-bush and boughs of oaken-tree,</a>
<a id='line_8960'>    And shadow o'er the piled-up bed with leafy canopy.</a>
<a id='line_8961'>    So there upon the wild-wood couch adown the youth is laid;</a>
<a id='line_8962'>    E'en as a blossom dropped to earth from fingers of a maid--</a>
<a id='line_8963'>    The gilliflower's bloom maybe, or jacinth's hanging head,</a>
<a id='line_8964'>    Whose lovely colour is not gone, nor shapely fashion fled,            70</a>
<a id='line_8965'>    Although its mother feedeth not, nor earth its life doth hold.</a>
<a id='line_8966'></a>
<a id='line_8967'>    Thereon two woven webs, all stiff with purple dye and gold,</a>
<a id='line_8968'>    Æneas bringeth forth, which erst with her own fingers fair</a>
<a id='line_8969'>    Sidonian Dido wrought for him, and, glad the toil to bear,</a>
<a id='line_8970'>    Had shot across the web thereof with thin and golden thread:</a>
<a id='line_8971'>    In one of these the youth he wrapped, last honour of the dead,</a>
<a id='line_8972'>    And, woeful, covered up the locks that fire should burn away.</a>
<a id='line_8973'>    And furthermore a many things, Laurentum's battle-prey,</a>
<a id='line_8974'>    He pileth up, and bids the spoil in long array be borne:</a>
<a id='line_8975'>    Horses and battle-gear he adds, late from the foemen torn:            80</a>
<a id='line_8976'>    And men's hands had he bound aback whom shortly should he send</a>
<a id='line_8977'>    Unto the ghosts; whose blood should slake the fire that ate his friend.</a>
<a id='line_8978'>    And trunks of trees with battle-gear from foemen's bodies won</a>
<a id='line_8979'>    He bids the leaders carry forth, with foemen's names thereon.</a>
<a id='line_8980'>    Hapless Acoetes, spent with eld, is brought forth; whiles he wears</a>
<a id='line_8981'>    His bosom with the beat of fists, and whiles his face he tears:</a>
<a id='line_8982'>    Then forth he falls, and grovelling there upon the ground doth lie.</a>
<a id='line_8983'>    They bring the war-wain now, o'errained with blood of Rutuli:</a>
<a id='line_8984'>    Æthon his war-horse comes behind, stripped of his gear of state,</a>
<a id='line_8985'>    Mourning he goes, and wets his face with plenteous tear-drops great.  90</a>
<a id='line_8986'>    Some bring the dead man's spear and helm: victorious Turnus' hand</a>
<a id='line_8987'>    Hath all the rest: then follow on the woeful Teucrian band,</a>
<a id='line_8988'>    All Tuscans, and Arcadian folk with weapons turned about.</a>
<a id='line_8989'></a>
<a id='line_8990'>    But now, when all the following folk were got a long way out,</a>
<a id='line_8991'>    Æneas stood and groaned aloud, and spake these words withal:</a>
<a id='line_8992'>    "Us otherwhere to other tears the same dread war-fates call;</a>
<a id='line_8993'>    Undying greetings go with thee! farewell for evermore,</a>
<a id='line_8994'>    O mightiest Pallas!"</a>
<a id='line_8995'>                        Ending so, to those high walls of war</a>
<a id='line_8996'>    He turned about, and went his ways unto his war-folks' home.</a>
<a id='line_8997'></a>
<a id='line_8998'>    But from the Latin city now were fair speech-masters come,           100</a>
<a id='line_8999'>    Half-hidden by the olive-boughs, and praying for a grace,</a>
<a id='line_9000'>    That he would give them back their men who lay about the place</a>
<a id='line_9001'>    O'erthrown by steel, and let them lie in earth-mound duly dight;</a>
<a id='line_9002'>    Since war was not for men o'ercome, or those that lack the light--</a>
<a id='line_9003'>    That he would spare his whileome hosts, the kinsmen of his bride.</a>
<a id='line_9004'></a>
<a id='line_9005'>    But good Æneas, since their prayer might not be put aside,</a>
<a id='line_9006'>    Let all his pardon fall on them, and sayeth furthermore:</a>
<a id='line_9007'>    "O Latin folk, what hapless fate hath tangled you in war</a>
<a id='line_9008'>    So great and ill? From us, your friends, why must ye flee away?</a>
<a id='line_9009'>    For perished men, dead thralls of Mars, a little peace ye pray,      110</a>
<a id='line_9010'>    But to your living folk indeed fain would I grant the grace.</a>
<a id='line_9011'>    I had not come here, save that Fate here gave me home and place:</a>
<a id='line_9012'>    No battle with your folk I wage; nay, rather 'twas your lord</a>
<a id='line_9013'>    Who left my friendship, trusting him to Turnus' shield and sword.</a>
<a id='line_9014'>    For Turnus to have faced the death were deed of better worth:</a>
<a id='line_9015'>    If he deems hands should end the war and thrust the Teucrians forth,</a>
<a id='line_9016'>    'Twere lovely deed to meet my hand amid the rain of strife;</a>
<a id='line_9017'>    Then let him live to whom the Gods have given the gift of life.</a>
<a id='line_9018'>    Go ye, and 'neath your hapless ones lay ye the bale-fire's blaze."</a>
<a id='line_9019'></a>
<a id='line_9020'>    He made an end; but still they stood and hushed them in amaze,       120</a>
<a id='line_9021'>    And each on each they turned their eyes, and every tongue refrained,</a>
<a id='line_9022'>    Till elder Drances, whom for foe child Turnus well had gained</a>
<a id='line_9023'>    By hate-filled charges, took the word, and in such wise began:</a>
<a id='line_9024'>    "O great in fame, in dint of war yet greater, Trojan man!</a>
<a id='line_9025'>    What praise of words is left to me to raise thee to the sky?</a>
<a id='line_9026'>    For justice shall I praise thee most, or battle's mastery?</a>
<a id='line_9027'>    Now happy, to our fathers' town this answer back we bear,</a>
<a id='line_9028'>    And if good-hap a way thereto may open anywhere,</a>
<a id='line_9029'>    Thee to Latinus will we knit--let Turnus seek his own!--</a>
<a id='line_9030'>    Yea, we shall deem it joy forsooth about your fateful town:          130</a>
<a id='line_9031'>    To raise the walls, and Trojan stones upon our backs to lay."</a>
<a id='line_9032'></a>
<a id='line_9033'>    Such words he spake, and with one mouth did all men murmur yea.</a>
<a id='line_9034'>    For twice six days they covenant; and in war-sundering peace</a>
<a id='line_9035'>    The Teucrians and the Latins blent about the woods increase,</a>
<a id='line_9036'>    About the hill-sides wander safe; the smitten ash doth know</a>
<a id='line_9037'>    The ring of steel; the pines that thrust heaven-high they overthrow;</a>
<a id='line_9038'>    Nor cease with wedge to cleave the oak and cedar shedding scent,</a>
<a id='line_9039'>    Or on the wains to lead away the rowan's last lament.</a>
<a id='line_9040'></a>
<a id='line_9041'>    And now the very Wingèd Fame, with that great grief she bears,</a>
<a id='line_9042'>    Filleth Evander's town and house, filleth Evander's ears;            140</a>
<a id='line_9043'>    Yea, Fame, who erst of Pallas' deeds in conquered Latium told:</a>
<a id='line_9044'>    Rush the Arcadians to the gates, and as they used of old,</a>
<a id='line_9045'>    Snatch up the torches of the dead, and with the long array</a>
<a id='line_9046'>    Of flames the acre-cleaving road gleams litten far away:</a>
<a id='line_9047'>    Then meeteth them the Phrygian crowd, and swells the wailing band;</a>
<a id='line_9048'>    And when the mothers saw them come amid the house-built land,</a>
<a id='line_9049'>    The woeful town they set afire with clamour of their ill.</a>
<a id='line_9050'>    But naught there is hath any might to hold Evander still;</a>
<a id='line_9051'>    He comes amidst, and on the bier where Pallas lies alow</a>
<a id='line_9052'>    He grovels, and with weeping sore and groaning clings thereto;       150</a>
<a id='line_9053'>    And scarce from sorrow at the last his speech might win a way:</a>
<a id='line_9054'>    "Pallas, this holdeth not the word thou gavest me that day,</a>
<a id='line_9055'>    That thou wouldst ward thee warily in game of bitter Mars:</a>
<a id='line_9056'>    Though sooth I knew how strong it is, that first fame of the wars;</a>
<a id='line_9057'>    How strong is that o'er-sweet delight of earliest battle won.</a>
<a id='line_9058'>    O wretched schooling of my child! O seeds of war begun,</a>
<a id='line_9059'>    How bitter hard! O prayers of mine, O vows that none would hear</a>
<a id='line_9060'>    Of all the Gods! O holiest wife, thy death at least was dear,</a>
<a id='line_9061'>    And thou art happy to be gone, not kept for such a tide.</a>
<a id='line_9062'>    But I--my life hath conquered Fate, that here I might abide          160</a>
<a id='line_9063'>    A lonely father. Ah, had I gone with the Trojan host,</a>
<a id='line_9064'>    To fall amid Rutulian spears! were mine the life-days lost;</a>
<a id='line_9065'>    If me, not Pallas, this sad pomp were bringing home today!--</a>
<a id='line_9066'>    Yet, Teucrians, on your troth and you no blaming would I lay,</a>
<a id='line_9067'>    Nor on our hands in friendship joined: 'twas a foreordered load</a>
<a id='line_9068'>    For mine old age: and if my son untimely death abode,</a>
<a id='line_9069'>    'Tis sweet to think he fell amidst the thousand Volscians slain,</a>
<a id='line_9070'>    And leading on the men of Troy the Latin lands to gain.</a>
<a id='line_9071'>    Pallas, no better funeral rites mine heart to thee awards</a>
<a id='line_9072'>    Than good Æneas giveth thee, and these great Phrygian lords,         170</a>
<a id='line_9073'>    The Tyrrhene dukes, the Tyrrhene host, a mighty company;</a>
<a id='line_9074'>    While they whom thine own hand hath slain great trophies bear for thee.</a>
<a id='line_9075'>    Yea, Turnus, thou wert standing there, a huge trunk weapon-clad,</a>
<a id='line_9076'>    If equal age, if equal strength from lapse of years ye had.</a>
<a id='line_9077'>    --But out!--why should a hapless man thus stay the Teucrian swords?</a>
<a id='line_9078'>    Go, and be mindful to your king to carry these my words:</a>
<a id='line_9079'>    If here by loathèd life I bide, with Pallas dead and gone,</a>
<a id='line_9080'>    Thy right hand is the cause thereof, which unto sire and son</a>
<a id='line_9081'>    Owes Turnus, as thou wottest well: no other place there is</a>
<a id='line_9082'>    Thy worth and fate may fill. God wot I seek no life-days' bliss,     180</a>
<a id='line_9083'>    But might I bear my son this tale amid the ghosts of earth!"</a>
<a id='line_9084'></a>
<a id='line_9085'>    Meanwhile the loveliness of light Aurora brought to birth</a>
<a id='line_9086'>    For heartsick men, and brought aback the toil of heart and hand:</a>
<a id='line_9087'>    Father Æneas therewithal down on the hollow strand,</a>
<a id='line_9088'>    And Tarchon with him, rear the bales; and each man thither bears</a>
<a id='line_9089'>    His dead friend in the ancient guise: beneath the black flame flares,</a>
<a id='line_9090'>    The heaven aloft for reek thereof with night is overlaid:</a>
<a id='line_9091'>    Three times about the litten bales in glittering arms arrayed</a>
<a id='line_9092'>    They run the course; three times on steed they beat the earth about</a>
<a id='line_9093'>    Those woeful candles of the dead and sing their wailing out;         190</a>
<a id='line_9094'>    The earth is strewn with tears of men, and arms of men forlorn,</a>
<a id='line_9095'>    And heavenward goes the shout of men and blaring of the horn:</a>
<a id='line_9096'>    But some upon the bale-fires cast gear stripped from Latins slain:</a>
<a id='line_9097'>    War-helms, and well-adornèd swords, and harness of the rein,</a>
<a id='line_9098'>    And glowing wheels: but overwell some knew the gifts they brought,</a>
<a id='line_9099'>    The very shields of their dead friends and weapons sped for nought.</a>
<a id='line_9100'>    Then oxen manifold to Death all round about they slay,</a>
<a id='line_9101'>    And bristled boars, and sheep they snatch from meadows wide away,</a>
<a id='line_9102'>    And hew them down upon the flame; then all the shore about</a>
<a id='line_9103'>    They gaze upon their burning friends, and watch the bale-fires out.  200</a>
<a id='line_9104'>    Nor may they tear themselves away until the dewy night</a>
<a id='line_9105'>    Hath turned the heavens about again with gleaming stars bedight.</a>
<a id='line_9106'></a>
<a id='line_9107'>    Nor less the unhappy Latins build upon another stead</a>
<a id='line_9108'>    The bale-fires numberless of tale: but of their warriors dead,</a>
<a id='line_9109'>    A many bodies there they dig into the earth adown,</a>
<a id='line_9110'>    And bear them into neighbouring lands, or back into the town:</a>
<a id='line_9111'>    The rest, a mighty heap of death piled up confusedly,</a>
<a id='line_9112'>    Untold, unhonoured, there they burn: then that wide-lying lea</a>
<a id='line_9113'>    Glareth with fires that thick and fast keep rising high and high.</a>
<a id='line_9114'>    But when the third dawn drew away cold shadows from the sky,         210</a>
<a id='line_9115'>    Weeping, great heaps of ashes there and blended bones they made,</a>
<a id='line_9116'>    And over them the weight of earth yet warm with fire they laid.</a>
<a id='line_9117'></a>
<a id='line_9118'>    But in the houses, in the town of that rich Latin king</a>
<a id='line_9119'>    More heavy was the wail, more sore the long-drawn sorrowing:</a>
<a id='line_9120'>    Here mothers, wretched fosterers here, here sisters loved and lorn,</a>
<a id='line_9121'>    And sorrowing sore, and lads whose lives from fathers' care were torn,</a>
<a id='line_9122'>    Were cursing of the cruel war, and Turnus and his bride,</a>
<a id='line_9123'>    "He, he, in arms, he with the sword should play it out," they cried,</a>
<a id='line_9124'>    "Who claims the realm of Italy and foremost lordship there."</a>
<a id='line_9125'>    And bitter Drances weights the scale, and witnessing doth bear       220</a>
<a id='line_9126'>    That Turnus only is called forth, the battle-bidden man.</a>
<a id='line_9127'>    But divers words of many folk on Turnus' side yet ran,</a>
<a id='line_9128'>    And he was cloaked about withal by great Amata's name,</a>
<a id='line_9129'>    And plenteous signs of battle won upheld his fair-won fame.</a>
<a id='line_9130'></a>
<a id='line_9131'>    Now midst these stirs and flaming broils the messengers are here</a>
<a id='line_9132'>    From Diomedes' mighty walls; and little is the cheer</a>
<a id='line_9133'>    Wherewith they bring the tidings back that every whit hath failed</a>
<a id='line_9134'>    Their toil and pains: that not a whit hath gold or gifts availed,</a>
<a id='line_9135'>    Or mighty prayers, that Latin folk some other stay in war</a>
<a id='line_9136'>    Must seek, or from the Trojan king a craven peace implore.           230</a>
<a id='line_9137'>    Then e'en Latinus' counsel failed amid such miseries:</a>
<a id='line_9138'>    The wrath of God, the tombs new-wrought that lay before their eyes,</a>
<a id='line_9139'>    Made manifest Æneas come by will of God and Fate.</a>
<a id='line_9140'>    Therefore a mighty parliament, the firstlings of estate,</a>
<a id='line_9141'>    By his commandment summoned there, unto his house he brings.</a>
<a id='line_9142'>    Wherefore they gather, streaming forth unto that house of kings</a>
<a id='line_9143'>    By the thronged ways: there in the midst Latinus sitteth now,</a>
<a id='line_9144'>    First-born of years, first lord of rule, with little joyful brow.</a>
<a id='line_9145'></a>
<a id='line_9146'>    Hereon the men come back again from that Ætolian wall</a>
<a id='line_9147'>    He biddeth tell their errand's speed, what answers did befall,       240</a>
<a id='line_9148'>    Each in their order: thereupon for speech was silence made,</a>
<a id='line_9149'>    And Venulus, obeying him, suchwise began and said:</a>
<a id='line_9150'></a>
<a id='line_9151'>    "Friends, we have looked on Diomede and on the Argive home,</a>
<a id='line_9152'>    And all the road and every hap thereby have overcome:</a>
<a id='line_9153'>    Yea, soothly, we have touched the hand that wracked the Ilian earth:</a>
<a id='line_9154'>    Argyripa he buildeth there, named from his land of birth,</a>
<a id='line_9155'>    In Iapygian Garganus, where he hath conquered place.</a>
<a id='line_9156'>    Where, entered in, and leave being given to speak before his face,</a>
<a id='line_9157'>    We gave our gifts, and told our names, and whence of lands we were,</a>
<a id='line_9158'>    Who waged us war, and for what cause to Arpi we must fare.           250</a>
<a id='line_9159'>    He hearkened and from quiet mouth gave answer thus again:</a>
<a id='line_9160'></a>
<a id='line_9161'>    "'O happy folk of Saturn's land, time-old Ausonian men,</a>
<a id='line_9162'>    What evil hap hath turmoiled you amid your peaceful life,</a>
<a id='line_9163'>    Beguiling you to stir abroad the doubtfulness of strife?</a>
<a id='line_9164'>    All we who on the Ilian fields with sword-edge compassed guilt,</a>
<a id='line_9165'>    --Let be the war-ills we abode before the wall high built;</a>
<a id='line_9166'>    Let be the men whom Simoïs hides--we o'er the wide world driven,</a>
<a id='line_9167'>    Have wrought out pain and punishment for ill deed unforgiven,</a>
<a id='line_9168'>    Till Priam's self might pity us. Witness the star of bane</a>
<a id='line_9169'>    Minerva sent; Euboea's cliffs, Caphereus' vengeful gain!             260</a>
<a id='line_9170'>    'Scaped from that war, and driven away to countries sundered wide,</a>
<a id='line_9171'>    By Proteus' Pillars exiled now, must Menelaüs bide;</a>
<a id='line_9172'>    And those Ætnæan Cyclop-folk Ulysses look upon:</a>
<a id='line_9173'>    Of Pyrrhus's land why tell, or of Idomeneus, that won</a>
<a id='line_9174'>    To ruined house; of Locrian men cast on the Libyan shore?</a>
<a id='line_9175'>    Mycenæ's lord, the duke and king of all the Argive war,</a>
<a id='line_9176'>    There, on the threshold of his house, his wicked wife doth slay.</a>
<a id='line_9177'>    --Asia o'ercome--and in its stead Adultery thwart the way!--</a>
<a id='line_9178'>    Ah, the Gods' hate, that so begrudged my yearning eyes to meet</a>
<a id='line_9179'>    My father's hearth, my longed-for wife, and Calydon the sweet!       270</a>
<a id='line_9180'>    Yea, and e'en now there followeth me dread sight of woeful things:</a>
<a id='line_9181'>    My lost companions wend the air with feathery beat of wings,</a>
<a id='line_9182'>    Or wander, fowl on river-floods: O woe's me for their woe!</a>
<a id='line_9183'>    The voices of their weeping wail about the sea-cliffs go.</a>
<a id='line_9184'>    But all these things might I have seen full surely for me stored</a>
<a id='line_9185'>    Since then, when on the flesh of God I fell with maddened sword,</a>
<a id='line_9186'>    And on the very Venus' hand a wicked wound I won.</a>
<a id='line_9187'>    Nay, nay, to no such battles more I pray you drive me on!</a>
<a id='line_9188'>    No war for me with Teucrian men since Pergamus lies low;</a>
<a id='line_9189'>    Nor do I think or joy at all in ills of long ago.                    280</a>
<a id='line_9190'>    The gifts, that from your fatherland unto my throne ye bear,</a>
<a id='line_9191'>    Turn toward Æneas. We have stood, time was, spear meeting spear,</a>
<a id='line_9192'>    Hand against hand: trust me, who tried, how starkly to the shield</a>
<a id='line_9193'>    He riseth up, how blows the wind when he his spear doth wield.</a>
<a id='line_9194'>    If two such other men had sprung from that Idæan home,</a>
<a id='line_9195'>    Then Dardanus with none to drive to Inachus had come,</a>
<a id='line_9196'>    And seen our walls, and Greece had mourned reversal of her day.</a>
<a id='line_9197'>    About the walls of stubborn Troy, whatso we found of stay,</a>
<a id='line_9198'>    By Hector's and Æneas' hands the Greekish victory</a>
<a id='line_9199'>    Was tarried, and its feet held back through ten years wearing by.    290</a>
<a id='line_9200'>    Both these in heart and weapon-skill were full of fame's increase,</a>
<a id='line_9201'>    But this one godlier: let your hands meet in the plighted peace</a>
<a id='line_9202'>    E'en as ye may: but look to it if sword to sword ye bring.'</a>
<a id='line_9203'></a>
<a id='line_9204'>    "Thus have ye heard, most gracious one, the answer of the King,</a>
<a id='line_9205'>    And therewithal what thought he had about this heavy war."</a>
<a id='line_9206'></a>
<a id='line_9207'>    Scarce had he said, when diverse voice of murmuring ran all o'er</a>
<a id='line_9208'>    Those troubled mouths of Italy: as when the rocks refrain</a>
<a id='line_9209'>    The rapid streams, and sounds arise within the eddies' chain,</a>
<a id='line_9210'>    And with the chatter of the waves the neighbouring banks are filled.</a>
<a id='line_9211'>    But when their minds were soothed and all the wildering voices stilled,</a>
<a id='line_9212'>    The King spake first unto the Gods, then thus began to say:          301</a>
<a id='line_9213'></a>
<a id='line_9214'>    "Latins, that ye had counselled you hereon before today</a>
<a id='line_9215'>    Was both my will, and had been good: no time is this to fall</a>
<a id='line_9216'>    To counsel now, when as we speak the foe besets the wall.</a>
<a id='line_9217'>    With folk of God ill war we wage, lords of the Latin town,</a>
<a id='line_9218'>    With all-unconquerable folk; no battles wear them down;</a>
<a id='line_9219'>    Yea, beaten never have they heart to cast the sword away.</a>
<a id='line_9220'>    Lay down the hope ye had to gain Ætolian war-array;</a>
<a id='line_9221'>    Let each man be his proper hope. Lo ye, the straits are sore.</a>
<a id='line_9222'>    How all things lie about us now by ruin all toppled o'er,            310</a>
<a id='line_9223'>    Witness of this the eyes of you, the hands of you have won.</a>
<a id='line_9224'>    No man I blame, what valour could hath verily been done:</a>
<a id='line_9225'>    With all the manhood of our land the battle hath been fought:</a>
<a id='line_9226'>    But now what better way herein my doubtful mind hath thought</a>
<a id='line_9227'>    Will I set forth, and shortly tell the rede that is in me:</a>
<a id='line_9228'>    Hearken! beside the Tuscan stream I own an ancient lea,</a>
<a id='line_9229'>    Which, toward the sunset stretching far, yea o'er Sicanian bounds,</a>
<a id='line_9230'>    Aruncans and Rutulians sow, working the rough hill grounds</a>
<a id='line_9231'>    With draught of plough, but feeding down the roughest with their sheep.</a>
<a id='line_9232'>    Let all this land, and piny place upon the mountain-steep,           320</a>
<a id='line_9233'>    Be yielded for the Teucrian peace: the laws let us declare</a>
<a id='line_9234'>    For plighted troth, and bid the men as friends our realm to share.</a>
<a id='line_9235'>    There let them settle and build walls, if thitherward they yearn;</a>
<a id='line_9236'>    But if unto another land their minds are set to turn,</a>
<a id='line_9237'>    And other folk, and all they ask is from our shore to flee,</a>
<a id='line_9238'>    Then let us build them twice ten ships from oak of Italy,</a>
<a id='line_9239'>    Or more if they have men thereto: good store of ship-stuff lies</a>
<a id='line_9240'>    Hard by the waves; and they shall show their number and their guise;</a>
<a id='line_9241'>    But toil of men, and brass and gear we for their needs will find.</a>
<a id='line_9242'>    And now to carry these our words, and fast the troth-plight bind,    330</a>
<a id='line_9243'>    Send we an hundred speech-masters, the best of Latin land,</a>
<a id='line_9244'>    To seek them thither, stretching forth the peace-bough in the hand,</a>
<a id='line_9245'>    And bearing gifts; a talent's weight of gold and ivory,</a>
<a id='line_9246'>    The throne therewith and welted gown, signs of my lordship high.</a>
<a id='line_9247'>    Take open counsel; stay the State so faint and weary grown."</a>
<a id='line_9248'></a>
<a id='line_9249'>    Then Drances, ever full of hate, whom Turnus' great renown</a>
<a id='line_9250'>    With bitter stings of envy thwart goaded for evermore;</a>
<a id='line_9251'>    Lavish of wealth and fair of speech, but cold-hand in the war;</a>
<a id='line_9252'>    Held for no unwise man of redes, a make-bate keen enow;</a>
<a id='line_9253'>    The lordship of whose life, forsooth, from well-born dam did flow,   340</a>
<a id='line_9254'>    His father being of no account--upriseth now this man,</a>
<a id='line_9255'>    And piles a grievous weight of words with all the wrath he can.</a>
<a id='line_9256'>    "A matter dark to none, and which no voice of mine doth need,</a>
<a id='line_9257'>    Thou counsellest on, sweet King: for all confess in very deed</a>

<a id='line_9259'>    Let him give liberty of speech, and sink his windy pride,</a>
<a id='line_9260'>    Because of whose unhappy fate, and evil life and will--</a>
<a id='line_9261'>    Yea, I will speak, despite his threats to smite me and to kill--</a>
<a id='line_9262'>    So many days of dukes are done, and all the city lies                349</a>
<a id='line_9263'>    O'erwhelmed with grief, the while his luck round camps of Troy he tries,</a>

<a id='line_9265'>    One gift meseems thou shouldest add, most gracious king and lord,</a>
<a id='line_9266'>    Unto the many gifts thou bid'st bear to the Dardan folk,</a>
<a id='line_9267'>    Nor bow thyself to violence, nor lie beneath its yoke.</a>
<a id='line_9268'>    Father, thy daughter nobly wed unto a glorious son,</a>
<a id='line_9269'>    And knit the bonds of peace thereby in troth-plight never done.</a>
<a id='line_9270'>    Or if such terror and so great upon our hearts doth lie,</a>
<a id='line_9271'>    Let us adjure the man himself, and pray him earnestly</a>
<a id='line_9272'>    To yield up this his proper right to country and to king:--</a>
<a id='line_9273'>    --O why into the jaws of death wilt thou so often fling              360</a>
<a id='line_9274'>    Thine hapless folk, O head and fount of all the Latin ill?</a>
<a id='line_9275'>    No safety is in war; all we, for peace we pray thee still,</a>
<a id='line_9276'>    O Turnus,--for the only pledge of peace that may abide.</a>
<a id='line_9277'>    I first, whom thou call'st foe (and nought that name I thrust aside),</a>
<a id='line_9278'>    Lo, suppliant to thy feet I come! Pity thy people then!</a>
<a id='line_9279'>    Sink thine high heart, and, beaten, yield; surely we broken men</a>
<a id='line_9280'>    Have seen enough of deaths, laid waste enough of field and fold.</a>
<a id='line_9281'>    But if fame stir thee, if thine heart such dauntless valour hold,</a>
<a id='line_9282'>    If such a longing of thy soul a kingly dowry be,</a>
<a id='line_9283'>    Dare then, and trust thee in thy might, and breast the enemy.        370</a>
<a id='line_9284'>    Forsooth all we, that Turnus here a queenly wife might gain--</a>
<a id='line_9285'>    We common souls--a heap unwept, unburied, strew the plain.</a>
<a id='line_9286'>    And now for thy part, if in thee some valour hath a place</a>
<a id='line_9287'>    Or memory of the ancient wars, go look him in the face</a>
<a id='line_9288'>    Who calleth thee to come afield."</a>
<a id='line_9289'></a>
<a id='line_9290'>    But Turnus' fury at the word outbrake in sudden flame.</a>
<a id='line_9291'>    He groaned, and from his inmost soul this speech of his outpoured:</a>
<a id='line_9292'>    "O Drances, when the battle-day calleth for hand and sword,</a>
<a id='line_9293'>    Great words good store thou givest still, and first thou comest still</a>
<a id='line_9294'>    When so the Sires are called: but why with words the council fill?   380</a>
<a id='line_9295'>    Big words aflying from thee safe, while yet the walls hold good</a>
<a id='line_9296'>    Against the foe, nor yet the ditch is swimming with our blood.</a>
<a id='line_9297'>    Go, thunder out thy wonted words! lay craven fear on me,</a>
<a id='line_9298'>    O Drances, thou, whose hand has heaped the Teucrian enemy</a>
<a id='line_9299'>    Dead all about, and everywhere has glorified the meads</a>
<a id='line_9300'>    With war-spoil! Thou thyself may'st try how lively valour speeds!</a>
<a id='line_9301'>    'Tis well the time: forsooth the road lieth no long way out</a>
<a id='line_9302'>    To find the foe! on every side they hedge the wall about</a>
<a id='line_9303'>    Go we against them!--tarriest thou? and is thy Mars indeed</a>
<a id='line_9304'>    A dweller in the windy tongue and feet well learned in speed,        390</a>
<a id='line_9305'>    The same today as yesterday?</a>
<a id='line_9306'>    --I beaten! who of right, O beast! shall brand me beaten man,</a>

<a id='line_9309'>    Who seeth those Arcadian men stripped of their battle-gear?</a>
<a id='line_9310'>    Big Pandarus, stout Bitias, found me no craven there,</a>
<a id='line_9311'>    Or all the thousand whom that day to Tartarus I sent,</a>
<a id='line_9312'>    When I was hedged by foeman's wall and mound's beleaguerment</a>
<a id='line_9313'>    No health in war? Fool, sing such song to that Dardanian head,       399</a>
<a id='line_9314'>    And thine own day! cease not to fright all things with mighty dread.</a>
<a id='line_9315'>    Cease not to puff up with thy pride the poor twice-conquered folk,</a>
<a id='line_9316'>    And lay upon the Latin arms the weight of wordy yoke.</a>
<a id='line_9317'>    Yea, sure the chiefs of Myrmidons quake at the Phrygian sword,</a>
<a id='line_9318'>    Tydides and Achilles great, the Larissæan lord;</a>
<a id='line_9319'>    And Aufidus the flood flees back unto the Hadriac sea.</a>
<a id='line_9320'>    But now whereas this guile-smith fains to dread mine enmity,</a>
<a id='line_9321'>    And whetteth with a fashioned fear the bitter point of strife--</a>
<a id='line_9322'>    Nay, quake no more! for this mine hand shall spill no such a life;</a>
<a id='line_9323'>    But it shall dwell within thy breast and have thee for a mate.--</a>
<a id='line_9324'>    Now, Father, unto thee I turn, and all thy words of weight;          410</a>
<a id='line_9325'>    If every hope of mending war thou verily lay'st down;</a>
<a id='line_9326'>    If we are utterly laid waste, and, being once overthrown,</a>
<a id='line_9327'>    Have fallen dead; if Fate no more may turn her feet about,</a>
<a id='line_9328'>    Then pray we peace, and deedless hands, e'en as we may, stretch out.</a>
<a id='line_9329'>    Yet if of all our ancient worth some little yet abide,</a>
<a id='line_9330'>    I deem him excellent of men, craftsmaster of his tide,</a>
<a id='line_9331'>    A noble heart, who, lest his eyes should see such things befall,</a>
<a id='line_9332'>    Hath laid him down in death, and bit the earth's face once for all.</a>
<a id='line_9333'>    And if we still have store of force, and crop of youth unlaid,</a>
<a id='line_9334'>    And many a town, and many a folk of Italy to aid;                    420</a>
<a id='line_9335'>    And if across a sea of blood the Trojan glory came,</a>
<a id='line_9336'>    And they too died, and over all with one blast and the same</a>
<a id='line_9337'>    The tempest swept; why shameless thus do our first footsteps fail?</a>
<a id='line_9338'>    Why quake our limbs, yea e'en before they feel the trumpet's gale?</a>
<a id='line_9339'>    A many things the shifting time, the long laborious days,</a>
<a id='line_9340'>    Have mended oft: a many men hath Fortune's wavering ways</a>
<a id='line_9341'>    Made sport of, and brought back again to set on moveless rock.</a>
<a id='line_9342'>    The Ætolian and his Arpi host help not our battle-shock.</a>
<a id='line_9343'>    Yet is Messapus ours, and ours Tolumnius fortunate,</a>
<a id='line_9344'>    And many a duke and many a folk; nor yet shall tarry late            430</a>
<a id='line_9345'>    The glory of our Latin lords and this Laurentian lea.</a>
<a id='line_9346'>    Here too Camilla, nobly born of Volscian stock, shall be,</a>
<a id='line_9347'>    Leading her companies of horse that blossom brass all o'er.</a>
<a id='line_9348'>    But if the Teucrians me alone are calling to the war,</a>
<a id='line_9349'>    And thus 'tis doomed, and I so much the common good withstand--</a>
<a id='line_9350'>    Well, victory hath not heretofore so fled my hated hand</a>
<a id='line_9351'>    That I should falter from the play with such a prize in sight:</a>
<a id='line_9352'>    Fain shall I face him, yea, though he outgo Achilles' might,</a>
<a id='line_9353'>    And carry battle-gear as good of Vulcan's fashioning,</a>
<a id='line_9354'>    For you, and for Latinus here, my father and my king,                440</a>
<a id='line_9355'>    I, Turnus, second unto none in valour of old years,</a>
<a id='line_9356'>    Devote my life. Æneas calls me only of the peers?</a>
<a id='line_9357'>    --O that he may!--not Drances here--the debt of death to pay</a>
<a id='line_9358'>    If God be wroth, or if Fame win, to bear the prize away."</a>
<a id='line_9359'></a>
<a id='line_9360'>    But while amid their doubtful fate the ball of speech they tossed,</a>
<a id='line_9361'>    Contending sore, Æneas moved his camp and battle-host;</a>
<a id='line_9362'>    And lo, amid the kingly house there runs a messenger</a>
<a id='line_9363'>    Mid tumult huge, who all the town to mighty dread doth stir,</a>
<a id='line_9364'>    With tidings how the Teucrian host and Tuscan men of war</a>
<a id='line_9365'>    Were marching from the Tiber flood, the meadows covering o'er.       450</a>
<a id='line_9366'>    Amazèd are the minds of men; their hearts with tremor shake,</a>
<a id='line_9367'>    And anger stirred by bitter stings is presently awake:</a>
<a id='line_9368'>    In haste and heat they crave for arms; the youth cries on the sword,</a>
<a id='line_9369'>    The Fathers mutter sad and weep: with many a wrangling word</a>
<a id='line_9370'>    A mighty tumult goeth up, and toward the sky doth sweep:</a>
<a id='line_9371'>    Not otherwise than when the fowl amid the thicket deep</a>
<a id='line_9372'>    Sit down in hosts; or when the swans send forth their shrilling song</a>
<a id='line_9373'>    About Padusa's fishy flood, the noisy pools among.</a>
<a id='line_9374'></a>
<a id='line_9375'>    "Come, fellow-folk," cries Turnus then, for he the time doth seize,</a>
<a id='line_9376'>    "Call ye to council even now, and sit and praise the peace,          460</a>
<a id='line_9377'>    And let the armed foe wrack the realm!"</a>
<a id='line_9378'>                                               Nor more he said withal,</a>
<a id='line_9379'>    But turned about and went his ways from that high-builded hall.</a>
<a id='line_9380'>    Said he: "Volusus, lead away the Volscian ranks to fight,</a>
<a id='line_9381'>    And Rutuli! Messapus, thou, afield with horse and knight!</a>
<a id='line_9382'>    Thou, Coras, with thy brother duke sweep down the level mead.</a>
<a id='line_9383'>    Let some make breaches good, and some man the high towers with heed;</a>
<a id='line_9384'>    And let the rest bear arms with me whereso my bidding sends."</a>
<a id='line_9385'></a>
<a id='line_9386'>    Then straightway, running in all haste, to wall the city wends.</a>
<a id='line_9387'>    Sore shaken in his very heart, by that ill tide undone,</a>
<a id='line_9388'>    His council Sire Latinus leaves and those great redes begun:         470</a>
<a id='line_9389'>    Blaming himself that he took not Æneas of free will,</a>
<a id='line_9390'>    Nor gave the town that Dardan lord the place of son to fill.</a>
<a id='line_9391'></a>
<a id='line_9392'>    Now some dig dykes before the gate, or carry stones and stakes,</a>
<a id='line_9393'>    And bloody token of the war the shattering trump awakes.</a>
<a id='line_9394'>    Mothers and lads, a motley guard, they crown the threatened wall,</a>
<a id='line_9395'>    For this last tide of grief and care hath voice to cry for all.</a>
<a id='line_9396'>    Moreover to the temple-stead, to Pallas' house on high,</a>
<a id='line_9397'>    The Queen goes forth hedged all about by matron company,</a>
<a id='line_9398'>    And bearing gifts: next unto whom, the cause of all this woe,</a>
<a id='line_9399'>    With lovely eyes cast down to earth, doth maid Lavinia go.           480</a>
<a id='line_9400'>    They enter and with frankincense becloud the temple o'er,</a>
<a id='line_9401'>    And cast their woeful voices forth from out the high-built door:</a>
<a id='line_9402'>    "O Weapon-great Tritonian Maid, O front of war-array,</a>
<a id='line_9403'>    Break thou the Phrygian robber's sword, and prone his body lay</a>
<a id='line_9404'>    On this our earth; cast him adown beneath our gates high-reared!"</a>
<a id='line_9405'></a>
<a id='line_9406'>    Now eager Turnus for the war his body did begird:</a>
<a id='line_9407'>    The ruddy-gleaming coat of mail upon his breast he did,</a>
<a id='line_9408'>    And roughened him with brazen scales; with gold his legs he hid;</a>
<a id='line_9409'>    With brow yet bare, unto his side he girt the sword of fight,</a>
<a id='line_9410'>    And all a glittering golden man ran down the castle's height.        490</a>
<a id='line_9411'>    High leaps his heart, his hope runs forth the foeman's host to face:</a>
<a id='line_9412'>    As steed, when broken are the bonds, fleeth the stabling place,</a>
<a id='line_9413'>    Set free at last, and, having won the unfenced open mead,</a>
<a id='line_9414'>    Now runneth to the grassy grounds wherein the mare-kind feed;</a>
<a id='line_9415'>    Or, wont to water, speedeth him in well-known stream to wash,</a>
<a id='line_9416'>    And, wantoning, with uptossed head about the world doth dash,</a>
<a id='line_9417'>    While wave his mane-locks o'er his neck, and o'er his shoulders play.</a>
<a id='line_9418'></a>
<a id='line_9419'>    But, leading on the Volscian host, there comes across his way</a>
<a id='line_9420'>    Camilla now, who by the gate leapt from her steed adown,</a>
<a id='line_9421'>    And in likewise her company, who left their horses lone,             500</a>
<a id='line_9422'>    And earthward streamed: therewith the Queen such words as this gave forth:</a>
<a id='line_9423'></a>
<a id='line_9424'>    "Turnus, if any heart may trust in manly might and worth,</a>
<a id='line_9425'>    I dare to promise I will meet Æneas' war array,</a>
<a id='line_9426'>    And face the Tyrrhene knights alone, and deal them battle-play.</a>
<a id='line_9427'>    Let my hand be the first to try the perils of the fight,</a>
<a id='line_9428'>    The while the foot-men townward bide, and hold the walls aright."</a>
<a id='line_9429'></a>
<a id='line_9430'>    Then Turnus answered, with his eyes fixed on the awful maid:</a>
<a id='line_9431'>    "O glory of Italian land, how shall the thanks be paid</a>
<a id='line_9432'>    Worthy thy part? but since all this thy great soul overflies,</a>
<a id='line_9433'>    To portion out our work today with me indeed it lies.                510</a>
<a id='line_9434'>    Æneas, as our spies sent out and rumour saith for sure,</a>
<a id='line_9435'>    The guileful one, his light-armed horse hath now sent on before</a>
<a id='line_9436'>    To sweep the lea-land, while himself, high on the hilly ground,</a>
<a id='line_9437'>    Across the desert mountain-necks on for our walls is bound.</a>
<a id='line_9438'>    But I a snare now dight for him in woodland hollow way</a>
<a id='line_9439'>    Besetting so the straitened pass with weaponed war-array.</a>
<a id='line_9440'>    But bear thy banners forth afield to meet the Tyrrhene horse,</a>
<a id='line_9441'>    With fierce Messapus joined to thee, the Latin battle-force,</a>
<a id='line_9442'>    Yea, and Tiburtus: thou thyself the leader's care shalt take."</a>
<a id='line_9443'></a>
<a id='line_9444'>    So saith he, and with such-like words unto the war doth wake         520</a>
<a id='line_9445'>    Messapus and his brother-lords; then 'gainst the foeman fares.</a>
<a id='line_9446'></a>
<a id='line_9447'>    There was a dale of winding ways, most meet for warlike snares</a>
<a id='line_9448'>    And lurking swords: with press of leaves the mountain bent is black</a>
<a id='line_9449'>    That shutteth it on either side: thence leads a scanty track;</a>
<a id='line_9450'>    By strait-jawed pass men come thereto, a very evil road:</a>
<a id='line_9451'>    But thereabove, upon the height, lieth a plain abode,</a>
<a id='line_9452'>    A mountain-heath scarce known of men, a most safe lurking-place,</a>
<a id='line_9453'>    Whether to right hand or to left the battle ye will face,</a>
<a id='line_9454'>    Or hold the heights, and roll a storm of mighty rocks adown.</a>
<a id='line_9455'>    Thither the war-lord wends his way by country road well known,       530</a>
<a id='line_9456'>    And takes the place, and bideth there within the wood accursed.</a>
<a id='line_9457'></a>
<a id='line_9458'>    Meanwhile within the heavenly house Diana speaketh first</a>
<a id='line_9459'>    To Opis of the holy band, the maiden fellowship,</a>
<a id='line_9460'>    And words of grief most sorrowful Latonia's mouth let slip:</a>
<a id='line_9461'>    "Unto the bitter-cruel war the maid Camilla wends,</a>
<a id='line_9462'>    O maid: and all for nought indeed that dearest of my friends</a>
<a id='line_9463'>    Is girding her with arms of mine."</a>
<a id='line_9464'></a>
<a id='line_9465'>    Nought new-born was the love</a>
<a id='line_9466'>    Diana owned, nor sudden-sweet the soul in her did move:</a>
<a id='line_9467'>    When Metabus, by hatred driven, and his o'erweening pride,</a>
<a id='line_9468'>    Fled from Privernum's ancient town, his fathers' country-side,       540</a>
<a id='line_9469'>    Companion of his exile there, amid the weapon-game,</a>
<a id='line_9470'>    A babe he had with him, whom he called from her mother's name</a>
<a id='line_9471'>    Casmilla, but a little changed, and now Camilla grown.</a>
<a id='line_9472'>    He, bearing her upon his breast, the woody ridges lone</a>
<a id='line_9473'>    Went seeking, while on every side the sword-edge was about,</a>
<a id='line_9474'>    And all around were scouring wide the weaponed Volscian rout.</a>
<a id='line_9475'>    But big lay Amasenus now athwart his very road,</a>
<a id='line_9476'>    Foaming bank-high, such mighty rain from out of heaven had flowed.</a>
<a id='line_9477'>    There, as he dight him to swim o'er, love of his babe, and fear</a>
<a id='line_9478'>    For burden borne so well-beloved, his footsteps back did bear.       550</a>
<a id='line_9479'>    At last, as all things o'er he turned, this sudden rede he took:</a>
<a id='line_9480'>    The huge spear that in mighty hand by hap the warrior shook,</a>
<a id='line_9481'>    A close-knit shaft of seasoned oak with many a knot therein,</a>
<a id='line_9482'>    Thereto did he his daughter bind, wrapped in the cork-tree's skin,</a>
<a id='line_9483'>    And to the middle of the beam he tied her craftily;</a>
<a id='line_9484'>    Then, shaking it in mighty hand, thus spoke unto the sky:</a>
<a id='line_9485'>    "O kind, O dweller in the woods, Latonian Virgin fair,</a>
<a id='line_9486'>    A father giveth thee a maid, who holds thine arms in air</a>
<a id='line_9487'>    As from the foe she flees to thee: O Goddess, take thine own,</a>
<a id='line_9488'>    That now upon the doubtful winds by this mine arm is thrown!"        560</a>
<a id='line_9489'>    He spake, and from his drawn-back arm cast forth the brandished wood;</a>
<a id='line_9490'>    Sounded the waves; Camilla flew across the hurrying flood,</a>
<a id='line_9491'>    A lorn thing bound to whistling shaft, and o'er the river won.</a>
<a id='line_9492'>    But Metabus, with all the band of chasers pressing on,</a>
<a id='line_9493'>    Unto the river gives himself, and reaches maid and spear,</a>
<a id='line_9494'>    And, conquering, from the grassy bank Diana's gift doth tear.</a>
<a id='line_9495'>    To roof and wall there took him thence no city of the land,</a>
<a id='line_9496'>    Nay, he himself, a wild-wood thing, to none had given the hand;</a>
<a id='line_9497'>    Upon the shepherd's lonely hills his life thenceforth he led;</a>
<a id='line_9498'>    His daughter mid the forest-brake, and wild deers' thicket-stead,    570</a>
<a id='line_9499'>    He nourished on the milk that flowed from herd-mare's untamed breast,</a>
<a id='line_9500'>    And to the maiden's tender lips the wild thing's udder pressed;</a>
<a id='line_9501'>    Then from the first of days when she might go upon her feet,</a>
<a id='line_9502'>    The heft of heavy sharpened dart her hand must learn to meet,</a>
<a id='line_9503'>    And from the little maiden's back he hung the shaft and bow;</a>
<a id='line_9504'>    While for the golden hair-clasp fine and long-drawn mantle's flow</a>
<a id='line_9505'>    Down from her head, along her back, a tiger's fell there hung.</a>
<a id='line_9506'>    E'en then too from her tender hand a childish shot she flung,</a>
<a id='line_9507'>    The sling with slender smoothened thong she drave about her head</a>
<a id='line_9508'>    To bring the crane of Strymon down, or lay the white swan dead.      580</a>
<a id='line_9509'>    Then many a mother all about the Tyrrhene towns in vain</a>
<a id='line_9510'>    Would wed her to their sons; but she, a maid without a stain,</a>
<a id='line_9511'>    Alone in Dian's happiness the spear for ever loved,</a>
<a id='line_9512'>    For ever loved the maiden life.</a>
<a id='line_9513'>                                        --"O had she ne'er been moved</a>
<a id='line_9514'>    By such a war, nor dared to cross the Teucrian folk in fight!</a>
<a id='line_9515'>    Then had she been a maid of mine, my fellow and delight.</a>
<a id='line_9516'>    But since the bitterness of fate lies round her life and me,</a>
<a id='line_9517'>    Glide down, O maiden, from the pole, and find the Latin lea,</a>
<a id='line_9518'>    Where now, with evil tokens toward, sad battle they awake;</a>
<a id='line_9519'>    Take these, and that avenging shaft from out the quiver take,        590</a>
<a id='line_9520'>    Wherewith whoso shall wrong with wound my holy-bodied may,</a>
<a id='line_9521'>    Be he of Troy or Italy, see thou his blood doth pay:</a>
<a id='line_9522'>    And then will I her limbs bewept, unspoiled of any gear,</a>
<a id='line_9523'>    Wrap in a hollow cloud, and lay in kindred sepulchre."</a>
<a id='line_9524'></a>
<a id='line_9525'>    She spoke; the other slipped adown the lightsome air of heaven,</a>
<a id='line_9526'>    With wrapping cloak of mirky cloud about her body driven.</a>
<a id='line_9527'></a>
<a id='line_9528'>    But in meanwhile the Trojan folk the city draw anigh,</a>
<a id='line_9529'>    The Tuscan dukes and all their horse in many a company</a>
<a id='line_9530'>    Well ordered: over all the plain neighing the steed doth fare,</a>
<a id='line_9531'>    Prancing, and champing on the bit that turns him here and there,     600</a>
<a id='line_9532'>    And far and wide the lea is rough with iron harvest now.</a>
<a id='line_9533'>    And with the weapons tossed aloft the level meadows glow.</a>
<a id='line_9534'>    Messapus and the Latins swift, lo, on the other hand;</a>
<a id='line_9535'>    And Coras with his brother-lord, and maid Camilla's band,</a>
<a id='line_9536'>    Against them in the field; and lo, far back their arms they fling</a>
<a id='line_9537'>    In couching of the level spears, and shot spears' brandishing.</a>
<a id='line_9538'>    All is afire with neigh of steeds and onfall of the men.</a>
<a id='line_9539'>    And now, within a spear-shot come, short up they rein, and then</a>
<a id='line_9540'>    They break out with a mighty cry, and spur the maddened steeds;</a>
<a id='line_9541'>    And all at once from every side the storm of spear-shot speeds,      610</a>
<a id='line_9542'>    As thick as very snowing is, and darkens down the sun.</a>
<a id='line_9543'></a>
<a id='line_9544'>    And thereon with their levelled spears each against each they run,</a>
<a id='line_9545'>    Tyrrhenus and Aconteus fierce: in forefront of the fight</a>
<a id='line_9546'>    They meet and crash with thundering sound; wracked are the steeds outright,</a>
<a id='line_9547'>    Breast beating in each breast of them: far is Aconteus flung</a>
<a id='line_9548'>    In manner of the lightning bolt, or stone from engine slung;</a>
<a id='line_9549'>    Far off he falls, and on the air pours all his life-breath out.</a>
<a id='line_9550'></a>
<a id='line_9551'>    Then wildered is the war array; the Latins wheel about</a>
<a id='line_9552'>    And sling their targets all aback, and townward turn their steeds.</a>
<a id='line_9553'>    The Trojans follow; first of whom the ranks Asylas leads.            620</a>
<a id='line_9554'>    But when they draw anigh the gates once more the Latin men</a>
<a id='line_9555'>    Raise up the cry, and turn about the limber necks again;</a>
<a id='line_9556'>    Then flee their foes, and far afield with loosened reins they ride;</a>
<a id='line_9557'>    As when the sea-flood setting on with flowing, ebbing tide,</a>
<a id='line_9558'>    Now earthward rolling, overlays the rocks with foaming sea,</a>
<a id='line_9559'>    And with its bosom overwhelms the sand's extremity,</a>
<a id='line_9560'>    Now swiftly fleeing back again, sucks back into its deep</a>
<a id='line_9561'>    The rolling stones, and leaves the shore with softly-gliding sweep.</a>
<a id='line_9562'>    Twice did the Tuscans townward drive the host of Rutuli;</a>
<a id='line_9563'>    Twice, looking o'er their shielded backs, afield they needs must fly;  630</a>
<a id='line_9564'>    But when they joined the battle thrice knit up was all array</a>
<a id='line_9565'>    In one great knot, and man sought man wherewith to play the play.</a>
<a id='line_9566'>    Then verily the dying groans up to the heavens went;</a>
<a id='line_9567'>    Bodies and arms lie deep in blood, and with the men-folk blent,</a>
<a id='line_9568'>    The dying horses wallow there, and fearful fight arose.</a>
<a id='line_9569'></a>
<a id='line_9570'>    Orsilochus with Remulus had scant the heart to close,</a>
<a id='line_9571'>    But hurled his shaft against the horse, and smote him 'neath the ear;</a>
<a id='line_9572'>    The smitten beast bears not the wound, but, maddened, high doth rear</a>
<a id='line_9573'>    The legs of him and breast aloft: his master flung away,</a>
<a id='line_9574'>    Rolls on the earth: Catillus there doth swift Iolas slay;            640</a>
<a id='line_9575'>    Yea, and Herminius, big of soul, and big of limbs and gear,</a>
<a id='line_9576'>    Who went with head by nothing helmed save locks of yellow hair,</a>
<a id='line_9577'>    Who went with shoulders all unarmed, as one without a dread,</a>
<a id='line_9578'>    So open unto fight was he; but through his shoulders sped</a>
<a id='line_9579'>    The quivering spear, and knit him up twi-folded in his pain.</a>
<a id='line_9580'>    So black blood floweth everywhere; men deal out iron bane,</a>
<a id='line_9581'>    And, struggling, seek out lovely death amid the wounds and woe.</a>
<a id='line_9582'></a>
<a id='line_9583'>    But through the middle of the wrack doth glad Camilla go,</a>
<a id='line_9584'>    The quivered war-maid, all one side stripped naked for the play;</a>
<a id='line_9585'>    And now a cloud of limber shafts she scattereth wide away,           650</a>
<a id='line_9586'>    And now with all unwearied hand catcheth the twi-bill strong.</a>
<a id='line_9587'>    The golden bow is at her back, and Dian's arrow-song.</a>
<a id='line_9588'>    Yea, e'en and if she yielded whiles, and showed her back in flight,</a>
<a id='line_9589'>    From back-turned bow the hurrying shaft she yet would aim aright.</a>
<a id='line_9590'>    About her were her chosen maids, daughters of Italy,</a>
<a id='line_9591'>    Larina, Tulla, and Tarpeia, with brazen axe on high,</a>
<a id='line_9592'>    Whom that divine Camilla chose for joy and fame's increase,</a>
<a id='line_9593'>    Full sweet and goodly hand-maidens in battle and in peace:</a>
<a id='line_9594'>    E'en as the Thracian Amazons thresh through Thermodon's flood,</a>
<a id='line_9595'>    When they in painted war-gear wend to battle and to blood:           660</a>
<a id='line_9596'>    Or those about Hippolyta, or round the wain of Mars</a>
<a id='line_9597'>    Wherein Panthesilea wends, when hubbub of the wars</a>
<a id='line_9598'>    The maiden-folk exulting raise, and moony shields uprear.</a>
<a id='line_9599'></a>
<a id='line_9600'>    Whom first, whom last, O bitter Maid, didst thou overthrow with spear?</a>
<a id='line_9601'>    How many bodies of the slain laidst thou upon the field?</a>
<a id='line_9602'>    Eunæus, Clytius' son, was first, whose breast for lack of shield</a>
<a id='line_9603'>    The fir-tree long smit through and through, as there he stood in face;</a>
<a id='line_9604'>    He poureth forth a sea of blood, and, falling in his place,</a>
<a id='line_9605'>    Bites the red earth, and dying writhes about the bitter bane.</a>
<a id='line_9606'>    Liris and Pagasus she slays; one, catching at the rein               670</a>
<a id='line_9607'>    Of his embowelled steed rolls o'er, the other as he ran</a>
<a id='line_9608'>    To aid, and stretched his swordless hand unto the fallen man,</a>
<a id='line_9609'>    Fell headlong too, and there they lie: with these Amastus wends,</a>
<a id='line_9610'>    The son of Hippotas; her spear in chase of men she sends,</a>
<a id='line_9611'>    Harpalycus, Demophoön, Tereus, and Chromis stout</a>
<a id='line_9612'>    As many as her maiden hand the whirling darts send out</a>
<a id='line_9613'>    So many Phrygian falls there are. Far off, in uncouth gear,</a>
<a id='line_9614'>    The hunter Ornytus upon Apulian steed doth fare,</a>
<a id='line_9615'>    Whose warring shoulders bigly wrought with stripped-off bullock's hide</a>
<a id='line_9616'>    Are covered; but his head is helmed with wood-wolf's gaping wide,    680</a>
<a id='line_9617'>    A monstrous mouth, wherein are left the teeth all gleaming white:</a>
<a id='line_9618'>    A wood-spear arms the hand of him, he wheels amid the fight,</a>
<a id='line_9619'>    And by the head he overtops all other men about.</a>
<a id='line_9620'>    Him she o'ertakes, no troublous deed amid the fleeing rout,</a>
<a id='line_9621'>    And, slaying him, from bitter heart this word withal she spake:</a>
<a id='line_9622'></a>
<a id='line_9623'>    "Tuscan, thou deem'dst thee hunting still the deer amid the brake;</a>
<a id='line_9624'>    The day has come when women's arms have cast thy boasting back:</a>
<a id='line_9625'>    Yet going to thy fathers' ghosts a word thou shalt not lack</a>
<a id='line_9626'>    To praise thy life; for thou mayst say, Camilla was my bane."</a>
<a id='line_9627'></a>
<a id='line_9628'>    Orsilochus and Butes next, two huge-wrought Trojans, gain            690</a>
<a id='line_9629'>    Death at her hands: Butes aback she smit through with the spear</a>
<a id='line_9630'>    Betwixt the mail-coat and the helm, wherethrough the neck doth peer</a>
<a id='line_9631'>    As there he sits, and on his left hangs down the target round;</a>
<a id='line_9632'>    But from Orsilochus she flees, wide circling o'er the ground,</a>
<a id='line_9633'>    Then, slipping inward of the ring, chaseth the chaser there,</a>
<a id='line_9634'>    And, rising high, her mighty axe driveth through bones and gear.</a>
<a id='line_9635'>    With blow on blow, mid all his prayers and crying out for grace,</a>
<a id='line_9636'>    Until his hot and bloody brain is flooding all his face.</a>
<a id='line_9637'></a>
<a id='line_9638'>    A man haps on her now, and stands afeard such sight to see;</a>
<a id='line_9639'>    Of Aunus of the Apennines the warring son was he,                    700</a>
<a id='line_9640'>    Great of Ligurians, while the Fates his guile would yet allow:</a>
<a id='line_9641'>    But he, since fleeing out of fight, would nought avail him now,</a>
<a id='line_9642'>    Nor knew he how in any wise to turn the Queen away,</a>
<a id='line_9643'>    With rede of guile and cunning words began to play the play:</a>
<a id='line_9644'></a>
<a id='line_9645'>    "What deed of fame, for woman's heart to trust a horse's might?</a>
<a id='line_9646'>    Wilt thou not set thy speed aside, and 'gainst me dare the fight</a>
<a id='line_9647'>    On equal ground, and gird thyself for foot-fight face to face?</a>
<a id='line_9648'>    See then to whom the windy fame shall bring the victory's grace!"</a>
<a id='line_9649'></a>
<a id='line_9650'>    He spake; but she, in bitter rage, and stung to her heart's root,</a>
<a id='line_9651'>    Unto her fellow gave her steed and faced him there afoot,            710</a>
<a id='line_9652'>    Most unafeard, with naked glaive and target bare and white.</a>
<a id='line_9653'>    Thereat the youth deemed guile had won, and turned at once to flight;</a>
<a id='line_9654'>    Nought tarrying but to turn the reins, he fleeth on his road,</a>
<a id='line_9655'>    And ever with his iron heel the four-foot thing doth goad.</a>
<a id='line_9656'></a>
<a id='line_9657'>    "Empty Ligurian, all in vain thine high heart dost thou raise,</a>
<a id='line_9658'>    And all in vain thou triest today thy father's crafty ways.</a>
<a id='line_9659'>    Nor shall thy lying bring thee safe to lying Aunus' head."</a>
<a id='line_9660'></a>
<a id='line_9661'>    So spake the maid, and all afire on flying feet she sped,</a>
<a id='line_9662'>    Outwent the horse and crossed his road, and catching at the rein,</a>
<a id='line_9663'>    There made her foeman pay for all with bloody steel-wrought bane,    720</a>
<a id='line_9664'>    As easily the holy hawk from craggy place on high</a>
<a id='line_9665'>    In winged chase follows on the dove aloft along the sky,</a>
<a id='line_9666'>    And taketh her in hookèd hold with bitter feet to tear,</a>
<a id='line_9667'>    While blood and riven feathers fall from out the upper air.</a>
<a id='line_9668'></a>
<a id='line_9669'>    Nathless the Sower of manfolk and all the Godly Kind,</a>
<a id='line_9670'>    Upon Olympus set aloft, to this was nothing blind,</a>
<a id='line_9671'>    And Tarchon of the Tyrrhene folk he stirreth up to war,</a>
<a id='line_9672'>    And stingeth all the heart of him with anger bitter-sore;</a>
<a id='line_9673'>    Who, borne on horse 'twixt death of men and faltering war-array,</a>
<a id='line_9674'>    Goads on his bands unto the fight, and many a word doth say,         730</a>
<a id='line_9675'>    And calleth each man by his name, and bids the beaten stand:</a>
<a id='line_9676'></a>
<a id='line_9677'>    "What fear, O hearts that nought may shame, O folk of deedless hand,</a>
<a id='line_9678'>    What dastardy, O Tyrrhene folk, hath now so caught your souls?</a>
<a id='line_9679'>    A woman drives us scattering wide, and back our war-wall rolls.</a>
<a id='line_9680'>    Why bear our hands these useless spears, this steel not made for fight?</a>
<a id='line_9681'>    Ye are not slack in Venus' play or battle of the night,</a>
<a id='line_9682'>    Or when the crookèd fife gives sign that Bacchus' dance is toward</a>
<a id='line_9683'>    Well wait ye onset of the feast and cups of plenteous board:</a>
<a id='line_9684'>    Your love, your hearts, are there, whereas the lucky priest doth bid</a>
<a id='line_9685'>    The holy words, and victims fat call to the thickets hid."           740</a>
<a id='line_9686'></a>
<a id='line_9687'>    He spake, and, fain of death himself, against the foemen spurs,</a>
<a id='line_9688'>    And full in face of Venulus his eager body bears,</a>
<a id='line_9689'>    And catcheth him by arm about, and tears him from his horse,</a>
<a id='line_9690'>    And bears him off on saddle-bow in grip of mighty force:</a>
<a id='line_9691'>    Then goes the clamour up to heaven, and all the Latin eyes</a>
<a id='line_9692'>    Turn thitherward: but fiery-swift across the field he flies,</a>
<a id='line_9693'>    Bearing the weapons and the man; then from his foeman's spear</a>
<a id='line_9694'>    Breaks off the head, and searches close for opening here and there</a>
<a id='line_9695'>    Whereby to give the deadly wound: the foe doth ever fight,           749</a>
<a id='line_9696'>    Thrusting the hand from threatened throat, and puts back might with might.</a>
<a id='line_9697'>    As when a yellow erne aloft skyward a dragon draws,</a>
<a id='line_9698'>    And knits him up within her feet and gripping of her claws:</a>
<a id='line_9699'>    But still the wounded serpent turns in many a winding fold,</a>
<a id='line_9700'>    And bristles all his spiky scales, and hissing mouth doth hold</a>
<a id='line_9701'>    Aloft against her; she no less through all his struggles vain</a>
<a id='line_9702'>    Drives hookèd beak, and still with wings beats through the airy plain;</a>
<a id='line_9703'>    E'en so from those Tiburtine ranks glad Tarchon bears the prey:</a>
<a id='line_9704'>    And, following on their captain's deed, fall on amid the fray</a>
<a id='line_9705'>    Mæonia's sons.</a>
<a id='line_9706'>                    But Arruns now, the foredoomed man of fate,</a>
<a id='line_9707'>    Encompassing Camilla's ways with spear and guile, doth wait          760</a>
<a id='line_9708'>    On all her goings; spying out what hap is easiest.</a>
<a id='line_9709'>    Now, wheresoe'er the hot-heart maid amid the battle pressed,</a>
<a id='line_9710'>    There Arruns winds, and silently holds watch on all her ways:</a>
<a id='line_9711'>    And when from forth the foe she comes, bearing the victory's praise,</a>
<a id='line_9712'>    Still speedily in privy wise the rein he turns about:</a>
<a id='line_9713'>    This way he tries, that way he tries, still wandering in and out</a>
<a id='line_9714'>    On all sides; shaking spear of doom with evil heart of guile.</a>
<a id='line_9715'></a>
<a id='line_9716'>    Now Chloreus, bond of Cybele and priest upon a while,</a>
<a id='line_9717'>    Afar as happed in Phrygian gear gleamed out upon his steed,</a>
<a id='line_9718'>    Foaming and goodly: clad was he in skin-wrought battle-weed,         770</a>
<a id='line_9719'>    With brazen scales done feather-wise, and riveted with gold,</a>
<a id='line_9720'>    And grand was he in outland red and many a purple fold;</a>
<a id='line_9721'>    Gortynian arrows from afar with Lycian horn he sped;</a>
<a id='line_9722'>    Gold rang the bow upon his back; gold-mitred was his head</a>
<a id='line_9723'>    In priestly wise; his saffron scarf, the crackling folds of it</a>
<a id='line_9724'>    Of linen fine, in knot about a red-gold buckle knit;</a>
<a id='line_9725'>    His kirtle was embroidered fair, his hosen outland-wrought.</a>
<a id='line_9726'>    The maiden, whether Trojan gear for temple-gate she sought,</a>
<a id='line_9727'>    Or whether she herself would wend, glorious in war-got gold,</a>
<a id='line_9728'>    Amidst of all the press of arms this man in chase must hold          780</a>
<a id='line_9729'>    Blind as a hunter; all unware amidst the war-array</a>
<a id='line_9730'>    She burned with all a woman's lust for spoil of men and prey:</a>
<a id='line_9731'>    When now, the time at last being seized, from out its lurking-place</a>
<a id='line_9732'>    Arruns drew forth his spear, and prayed the Gods above for grace:</a>
<a id='line_9733'></a>
<a id='line_9734'>    "Highest of Gods, Apollo, ward of dear Soracte's stead,</a>
<a id='line_9735'>    Whom we first honour, unto whom the piny blaze is fed;</a>
<a id='line_9736'>    Whom worshipping, we, waxen strong in might of godliness,</a>
<a id='line_9737'>    The very midmost of the fire with eager foot-soles press--</a>
<a id='line_9738'>    Almighty Father, give me grace to do away our shame!</a>
<a id='line_9739'>    No battle-gear, no trophies won from vanquished maid I claim,        790</a>
<a id='line_9740'>    No spoils I seek; my other deeds shall bring me praise of folk;</a>
<a id='line_9741'>    Let but this dreadful pest of men but fall beneath my stroke,</a>
<a id='line_9742'>    And me wend back without renown unto my father's place!"</a>
<a id='line_9743'></a>
<a id='line_9744'>    Apollo heard, and half the prayer he turned his heart to grace,</a>
<a id='line_9745'>    The other half he flung away adown the wind to go.</a>
<a id='line_9746'>    That he by sudden stroke of death should lay Camilla low,--</a>
<a id='line_9747'>    He granted this: that his high house should see his safe return,</a>
<a id='line_9748'>    He granted not: the hurrying gusts that word to breezes turn.</a>
<a id='line_9749'></a>
<a id='line_9750'>    So when the shaft hurled from his hand gave sound upon the air,</a>
<a id='line_9751'>    All Volscians turn their hardy hearts, and all men's eyen bear       800</a>
<a id='line_9752'>    Upon the Queen: but she no whit had any breeze in mind,</a>
<a id='line_9753'>    Or whistle of the spear that sped from out the house of wind,</a>
<a id='line_9754'>    Until the hurrying shaft beneath her naked bosom stood,</a>
<a id='line_9755'>    And clung there, deeply driven home, drinking her virgin blood.</a>
<a id='line_9756'>    Her frighted damsels run to her and catch the falling maid,</a>
<a id='line_9757'>    But Arruns fleeth fast, forsooth more than all they afraid--</a>
<a id='line_9758'>    Afraid and glad--nor durst he more to trust him to the spear,</a>
<a id='line_9759'>    Or 'neath the hail of maiden darts his body forth to bear.</a>
<a id='line_9760'>    And as the murder-wolf, ere yet the avenging spear-points bite,</a>
<a id='line_9761'>    Straight hideth him in pathless place amid the mountain-height,      810</a>
<a id='line_9762'>    When he hath slain some shepherd-lad or bullock of the fold;</a>
<a id='line_9763'>    Down goes his tail, when once he knows his deed so overbold,</a>
<a id='line_9764'>    Along his belly close it clings as he the woodland seeks.</a>
<a id='line_9765'>    Not otherwise from sight of men the wildered Arruns sneaks,</a>
<a id='line_9766'>    And mingles in the middle fight, glad to be clear away.</a>
<a id='line_9767'></a>
<a id='line_9768'>    Death-smitten, at the spear she plucks; amidst her bones it lay,</a>
<a id='line_9769'>    About the ribs, that iron point in baneful wound and deep:</a>
<a id='line_9770'>    She droopeth bloodless, droop her eyes acold in deadly sleep;</a>
<a id='line_9771'>    From out her cheeks the colour flees that once therewith were clear.</a>
<a id='line_9772'>    Then, passing, Acca she bespeaks, her very maiden peer,              820</a>
<a id='line_9773'>    Her who alone of all the rest might share Camilla's rede,</a>
<a id='line_9774'>    A trusted friend: such words to her the dying mouth doth speed:</a>
<a id='line_9775'></a>
<a id='line_9776'>    "Sister, thus far my might hath gone; but now this bitter wound</a>
<a id='line_9777'>    Maketh an end, and misty dark are grown all things around:</a>
<a id='line_9778'>    Fly forth, and unto Turnus bear my very latest words;</a>
<a id='line_9779'>    Let him to fight, and from the town thrust off the Trojan swords--</a>
<a id='line_9780'>    Farewell, farewell!"--</a>
<a id='line_9781'>                          And with the word the bridle failed her hold,</a>
<a id='line_9782'>    And unto earth unwilling now she flowed, and waxen cold</a>
<a id='line_9783'>    Slowly she slipped her body's bonds; her languid neck she bent,</a>
<a id='line_9784'>    Laid down the head that death had seized, and left her armament;     830</a>
<a id='line_9785'>    And with a groan her life flew forth disdainful into night.</a>
<a id='line_9786'></a>
<a id='line_9787'>    Then rose the cry and smote aloft the starry golden height,</a>
<a id='line_9788'>    And with the Queen so felled to field the fight grew young again,</a>
<a id='line_9789'>    And thronged and serried falleth on the Teucrian might and main,</a>
<a id='line_9790'>    The Tuscan Dukes, Evander's host, the wings of Arcady.</a>
<a id='line_9791'></a>
<a id='line_9792'>    But Opis, Dian's watch of war, set on the mountain high,</a>
<a id='line_9793'>    A long while now all unafeard had eyed the battle o'er,</a>
<a id='line_9794'>    And when far off, amid the cries of maddened men of war,</a>
<a id='line_9795'>    She saw Camilla win the death by bitter ill award,                   839</a>
<a id='line_9796'>    She groaned, and from her inmost heart such words as these she poured:</a>
<a id='line_9797'>    "Alas, O maid, thou payest it o'ermuch and bitterly,</a>
<a id='line_9798'>    That thou unto the Teucrian folk the challenge needs must cry.</a>
<a id='line_9799'>    Ah, nothing it availed thee, maid, through deserts of the deer</a>
<a id='line_9800'>    To worship Dian, or our shafts upon thy back to bear.</a>
<a id='line_9801'>    And yet the Queen hath left thee not alone amidst of shame</a>
<a id='line_9802'>    In grip of death; nor shalt thou die a death without a name</a>
<a id='line_9803'>    In people's ears; nor yet as one all unavenged be told:</a>
<a id='line_9804'>    For whosoever wronged thy flesh with wounding overbold</a>
<a id='line_9805'>    Shall pay the penalty well earned."</a>
<a id='line_9806'>                                          Now 'neath the mountains high,</a>
<a id='line_9807'>    All clad with shady holm-oaks o'er, a mighty mound doth lie,         850</a>
<a id='line_9808'>    The tomb of King Dercennus called, Laurentum's lord of yore;</a>
<a id='line_9809'>    And thitherward her speedy feet that loveliest Goddess bore,</a>
<a id='line_9810'>    And there abiding, Arruns spied from off the high-heaped mound</a>
<a id='line_9811'>    But when the wretch in gleaming arms puffed up with pride she found,</a>
<a id='line_9812'>    "Why," quoth she, "dost thou turn away? Here, hither wend thy feet;</a>
<a id='line_9813'>    Come here and perish; take reward for slain Camilla meet!</a>
<a id='line_9814'>    But ah, for death of such an one is Dian's arrow due?"</a>
<a id='line_9815'></a>
<a id='line_9816'>    Then from the Thracian quiver gilt a wingèd shaft she drew,</a>
<a id='line_9817'>    And bent the horn-wrought bow withal with heart on slaying set:</a>
<a id='line_9818'>    Far drew she, till the curving horns each with the other met:        860</a>
<a id='line_9819'>    Alike she strained her hands to shoot; the left hand felt the steel,</a>
<a id='line_9820'>    The right that drew the string aback her very breast did feel.</a>
<a id='line_9821'>    Then straightway Arruns heard in one the bow-string how it rung,</a>
<a id='line_9822'>    And whistle of the wind; and there the shaft within him clung:</a>
<a id='line_9823'>    His fellows leave him dying there and groaning out his last,</a>
<a id='line_9824'>    Forgotten in an unknown field, amid the sand downcast;</a>
<a id='line_9825'>    While to Olympus on the wing straightway is Opis borne.</a>
<a id='line_9826'></a>
<a id='line_9827'>    But now first flees Camilla's band, their Queen and mistress lorn,</a>
<a id='line_9828'>    And flee the beaten Rutuli, and fierce Atinas flees;</a>
<a id='line_9829'>    The Dukes of men in disarray, the broken companies                   870</a>
<a id='line_9830'>    Now turn their faces to the town, and seek a sheltering place,</a>
<a id='line_9831'>    Nor yet may any turn with spear upon the Teucrian chase,</a>
<a id='line_9832'>    That beareth death of men in hand, or bar the homeward road:</a>
<a id='line_9833'>    Cast back on fainting shoulders now the loose bow hangs a load;</a>
<a id='line_9834'>    The horny hoofs of four-foot things shake down the dusty mead,</a>
<a id='line_9835'>    The mirky cloud of rolling dust doth ever townward speed;</a>
<a id='line_9836'>    And mothers beating of their breasts stand on the watch-towers high,</a>
<a id='line_9837'>    And cast abroad their woman's wail up to the starry sky.</a>
<a id='line_9838'>    But they who in their fleeing first break through the open doors,</a>
<a id='line_9839'>    In mingled tumult on their backs a crowd of foemen pours;            880</a>
<a id='line_9840'>    Nor do they 'scape a wretched death: there, on the threshold-stead,</a>
<a id='line_9841'>    Within their fathers' walls, amidst the peace of home, they shed</a>
<a id='line_9842'>    The lives from out their bodies pierced: then some men shut the gate,</a>
<a id='line_9843'>    Nor durst they open to their friends, or take in them that wait</a>
<a id='line_9844'>    Praying without; and there indeed is woeful slaughter towards</a>
<a id='line_9845'>    Of them that fence the wall with swords, and rushers on the swords.</a>
<a id='line_9846'>    Those shut out 'neath the very eyes of weeping kith and kin,</a>
<a id='line_9847'>    Some headlong down the ditches roll, by fleeing rout thrust in;</a>
<a id='line_9848'>    Some blindly and with loosened rein spur on their steeds to meet</a>
<a id='line_9849'>    As battering-rams the very gates, the ruthless door-leaves beat      890</a>
<a id='line_9850'>    And now, in agony of fight, the mothers on the walls,</a>
<a id='line_9851'>    E'en as they saw Camilla do, (so love of country calls),</a>
<a id='line_9852'>    With hurrying hands the javelins cast, and in the iron's stead</a>
<a id='line_9853'>    Make shift of hardened pale of oak and stake with half-burned head.</a>
<a id='line_9854'>    Hot-heart they are, afire to die the first their town to save.</a>
<a id='line_9855'></a>
<a id='line_9856'>    Meanwhile to Turnus in the woods sweeps in that cruel wave</a>
<a id='line_9857'>    Of tidings: trouble measureless doth Acca to him bring,--</a>
<a id='line_9858'>    The wasting of the Volscian host, Camilla's murdering,</a>
<a id='line_9859'>    The onset of the baneful foe with favouring Mars to aid;</a>
<a id='line_9860'>    The ruin of all things; present fear e'en on the city laid,          900</a>
<a id='line_9861'>    He, madly wroth, (for even so Jove's dreadful might deemed good),</a>
<a id='line_9862'>    Leaveth the hills' beleaguerment and mirky rugged wood.</a>
<a id='line_9863'>    Scarce was he out of sight thereof, and nigh his camp to win,</a>
<a id='line_9864'>    When mid the opened pass and bare Æneas entereth in,</a>
<a id='line_9865'>    Climbeth the ridge, and slippeth through the thicket's shadowy night.</a>
<a id='line_9866'></a>
<a id='line_9867'>    So either toward the city fares with all their battle-might,</a>
<a id='line_9868'>    And no long space of way indeed there was betwixt the twain,</a>
<a id='line_9869'>    For e'en so soon as far away Æneas saw the plain</a>
<a id='line_9870'>    Through dusty reek, and saw withal Laurentum's host afar,</a>
<a id='line_9871'>    Turnus the fierce Æneas knew in all array of war,                    910</a>
<a id='line_9872'>    And heard the marching footmen tramp, and coming horses neigh.</a>
<a id='line_9873'>    Then had they fallen to fight forthwith and tried the battle-play,</a>
<a id='line_9874'>    But rosy Phoebus sank adown amidst Iberian flood</a>
<a id='line_9875'>    His weary steeds, and brought back Night upon the failing day.</a>
<a id='line_9876'>    So there they pitch before the town and make their ramparts good.</a>

<a id='line_9881'>BOOK XII.</a>
<a id='line_9882'></a>
<a id='line_9883'>ARGUMENT.</a>
<a id='line_9884'></a>
<a id='line_9885'>HEREIN ARE ÆNEAS AND TURNUS PLEDGED TO FIGHT THE MATTER OUT IN SINGLE</a>
<a id='line_9886'>COMBAT; BUT THE LATINS BREAK THE PEACE AND ÆNEAS IS WOUNDED: IN THE END</a>
<a id='line_9887'>ÆNEAS MEETETH TURNUS INDEED, AND SLAYETH HIM.</a>
<a id='line_9888'></a>
<a id='line_9889'></a>
<a id='line_9890'>    When Turnus sees the Latin men all failing from the sword,</a>
<a id='line_9891'>    Broken by Mars, and that all folk bethink them of his word,</a>
<a id='line_9892'>    And fall to mark him with their eyes, then fell he burns indeed,</a>
<a id='line_9893'>    And raises up his heart aloft; e'en as in Punic mead</a>
<a id='line_9894'>    The smitten lion, hurt in breast by steel from hunters' ring,</a>
<a id='line_9895'>    Setteth the battle in array, and joyfully doth fling</a>
<a id='line_9896'>    The mane from off his brawny neck, and fearless of his mood</a>
<a id='line_9897'>    Breaks off the clinging robber-spear, and roars from mouth of blood;</a>
<a id='line_9898'>    E'en so o'er Turnus' fiery heart the tide of fury wins,</a>
<a id='line_9899'>    And thus he speaketh to the King, and hasty speech begins:            10</a>
<a id='line_9900'></a>
<a id='line_9901'>    "No hanging back in Turnus is, and no Ænean thrall</a>
<a id='line_9902'>    Hath aught to do to break his word or plighted troth recall:</a>
<a id='line_9903'>    I will go meet him: Father, bring the Gods, the peace-troth plight;</a>
<a id='line_9904'>    Then either I this Dardan thing will send adown to night,--</a>
<a id='line_9905'>    This rag of Asia,--Latin men a-looking on the play,</a>
<a id='line_9906'>    And all alone the people's guilt my sword shall wipe away;</a>
<a id='line_9907'>    Or let him take us beaten folk, and wed Lavinia then!"</a>
<a id='line_9908'></a>
<a id='line_9909'>    But unto him from quiet soul Latinus spake again:</a>
<a id='line_9910'>    "Great-hearted youth, by e'en so much as thou in valorous might</a>
<a id='line_9911'>    Dost more excel, by so much I must counsel me aright,                 20</a>
<a id='line_9912'>    And hang all haps that may betide in those sad scales of mine.</a>
<a id='line_9913'>    Thine are thy father Daunus' realms, a many towns are thine,</a>
<a id='line_9914'>    Won by thine hand: Latinus too his gold and goodwill yields;</a>
<a id='line_9915'>    But other high-born maids unwed dwell in Laurentine fields</a>
<a id='line_9916'>    Or Latin land,--nay, suffer me to set all guile apart,</a>
<a id='line_9917'>    And say a hard thing--do thou take this also to thine heart:</a>
<a id='line_9918'>    To none of all her wooers of old my daughter may I wed;</a>
<a id='line_9919'>    This warning word of prophecy all men and Gods have sped.</a>
<a id='line_9920'>    But by thy kindred blood o'ercome, and by the love of thee,</a>
<a id='line_9921'>    And by my sad wife's tears, I broke all bonds and set me free.        30</a>
<a id='line_9922'>    From son-in-law I rapt his bride, I drew a godless sword.</a>
<a id='line_9923'>    What mishaps and what wrack of peace have been my due reward</a>
<a id='line_9924'>    Thou seest, Turnus, and what grief I was the first to bear.</a>
<a id='line_9925'>    Twice beaten in a woeful fight, scarce is our city here</a>
<a id='line_9926'>    Held by the hope of Italy: still Tiber-flood rolls by,</a>
<a id='line_9927'>    Warm with our blood, and 'neath our bones wide meadows whitening lie.</a>
<a id='line_9928'>    But whither waver I so oft? what folly shifts my mind?</a>
<a id='line_9929'>    If I am ready, Turnus dead, peace with these men to bind,</a>
<a id='line_9930'>    Shall I not rather while thou liv'st cast all the war away?</a>
<a id='line_9931'>    What shall my kindred Rutuli, what shall Italia say,                  40</a>
<a id='line_9932'>    If I deliver thee to death, (Fate thrust the words aside!)</a>
<a id='line_9933'>    Thee, who hast wooed me for thy sire, my daughter for thy bride?</a>
<a id='line_9934'>    Look on the wavering hap of war, pity thy father's eld,</a>
<a id='line_9935'>    Now far from thee in sorrow sore by ancient Ardea held."</a>
<a id='line_9936'></a>
<a id='line_9937'>    But not a whit might all these words the wrath of Turnus bend.</a>
<a id='line_9938'>    Nay, worser waxed he, sickening more by medicine meant to mend:</a>
<a id='line_9939'>    And e'en so soon as he might speak, such words were in his mouth:</a>
<a id='line_9940'>    "Thy trouble for my sake, best lord, e'en for my sake forsooth,</a>
<a id='line_9941'>    Lay down, I prithee; let me buy a little praise with death.</a>
<a id='line_9942'>    I too, O father, sow the spear, nor weak hand scattereth              50</a>
<a id='line_9943'>    The iron seed, with me afield: the blood-springs know my stroke.</a>
<a id='line_9944'>    Nor here shall be his Goddess-dame with woman's cloud to cloak</a>
<a id='line_9945'>    A craven king, and hide herself in empty mirky shade."</a>
<a id='line_9946'></a>
<a id='line_9947'>    But now the Queen, by this new chance of battle sore afraid,</a>
<a id='line_9948'>    Fell weeping, as her fiery son she held with dying eyes:</a>
<a id='line_9949'>    "O Turnus, by these tears, by what of worship for me lies</a>
<a id='line_9950'>    Anigh thy heart; O, only hope of this my latter tide,</a>
<a id='line_9951'>    Sole rest from sorrow! thou, in whom all worship doth abide,</a>
<a id='line_9952'>    All glory of the Latin name, our falling house-wall stay!</a>
<a id='line_9953'>    Set not thine hand to Teucrian war; this thing alone I pray.          60</a>
<a id='line_9954'>    Whatever lot abideth thee, O Turnus, mid the fight,</a>
<a id='line_9955'>    Abideth me, and I with thee will leave the loathed light;</a>
<a id='line_9956'>    Nor will I, made Æneas' thrall, behold him made my son."</a>
<a id='line_9957'></a>
<a id='line_9958'>    Lavinia heard her mother's words with burning cheeks, whereon</a>
<a id='line_9959'>    Lay rain of tears, for thereunto exceeding ruddy flush</a>
<a id='line_9960'>    Had brought the fire that now along her litten face did rush:</a>
<a id='line_9961'>    As when the Indian ivory they wrong with blood-red dye,</a>
<a id='line_9962'>    Or when mid many lilies white the ruddy roses lie,</a>
<a id='line_9963'>    E'en such a mingled colour showed upon the maiden's face.</a>
<a id='line_9964'>    Sore stirred by love upon the maid he fixed his constant gaze,        70</a>
<a id='line_9965'>    And, all the more afire for fight, thus to Amata said:</a>
<a id='line_9966'></a>
<a id='line_9967'>    "I prithee, mother, with these tears, such sign of coming dread,</a>
<a id='line_9968'>    Dog not my feet as forth I wend to Mavors' bitter play;</a>
<a id='line_9969'>    For Turnus is not free to thrust the hour of death away.</a>
<a id='line_9970'>    Go, Idmon, bear the Phrygian lord these very words of mine,</a>
<a id='line_9971'>    Nought for his pleasure: When the dawn tomorrow first shall shine,</a>
<a id='line_9972'>    And from her purple wheels aloft shall redden all the sky,</a>
<a id='line_9973'>    Lead not thy Teucrians to the fight: Teucrians and Rutuli</a>
<a id='line_9974'>    Shall let their swords be; and we twain, our blood shall quench the strife,</a>
<a id='line_9975'>    And we upon that field shall woo Lavinia for a wife."                 80</a>
<a id='line_9976'></a>
<a id='line_9977'>    He spake, and to the roofed place now swiftly wending home,</a>
<a id='line_9978'>    Called for his steeds, and merrily stood there before their foam,</a>
<a id='line_9979'>    E'en those that Orithyia gave Pilumnus, gift most fair,</a>
<a id='line_9980'>    Whose whiteness overpassed the snow, whose speed the wingèd air.</a>
<a id='line_9981'>    The busy horse-boys stand about, and lay upon their breasts</a>
<a id='line_9982'>    The clapping of their hollow hands, and comb their manèd crests.</a>
<a id='line_9983'>    But he the mail-coat doth on him well-wrought with golden scale</a>
<a id='line_9984'>    And latten white; he fits the sword unto his hand's avail:</a>
<a id='line_9985'>    His shield therewith, and hornèd helm with ruddy crest o'erlaid:</a>
<a id='line_9986'>    That sword, the very Might of Fire for father Daunus made,            90</a>
<a id='line_9987'>    And quenched the white-hot edge thereof amidst the Stygian flood.</a>
<a id='line_9988'>    Then the strong spear he took in hand that 'gainst the pillar stood,</a>
<a id='line_9989'>    Amidmost of the house: that spear his hand won mightily</a>
<a id='line_9990'>    From Actor of Auruncum erst; he shakes the quivering tree</a>
<a id='line_9991'>    Loud crying: "Now, O spear of mine, who never heretofore</a>
<a id='line_9992'>    Hast failed my call, the day draws on: thee the huge Actor bore,</a>
<a id='line_9993'>    Now Turnus' right hand wieldeth thee: to aid, that I prevail</a>
<a id='line_9994'>    To lay the Phrygian gelding low, and strip his rended mail</a>
<a id='line_9995'>    By might of hand; to foul with dust the ringlets of his hair,</a>
<a id='line_9996'>    Becrisped with curling-irons hot and drenched with plenteous myrrh!"  100</a>
<a id='line_9997'></a>
<a id='line_9998'>    By such a fury is he driven; from all his countenance</a>
<a id='line_9999'>    The fiery flashes leap, the flames in his fierce eyeballs dance:</a>
<a id='line_10000'>    As when a bull in first of fight raiseth a fearful roar,</a>
<a id='line_10001'>    And teacheth wrath unto his horns and whets them for the war,</a>
<a id='line_10002'>    And 'gainst the tree-trunks pusheth them, and thrusts the breezes home,</a>
<a id='line_10003'>    And with the scattering of the sand preludeth fight to come.</a>
<a id='line_10004'></a>
<a id='line_10005'>    Nor less Æneas, terrible, in Venus' armour dight,</a>
<a id='line_10006'>    Now whetteth war; and in his heart stirreth the wrath of fight,</a>
<a id='line_10007'>    That plighted peace shall lay the war fain is his heart and glad;</a>
<a id='line_10008'>    His fellows' minds and bitter fear that makes Iulus sad              110</a>
<a id='line_10009'>    He solaceth with fate-wise words; then bids his folk to bear</a>
<a id='line_10010'>    His answer to the Latin king and peace-laws to declare.</a>
<a id='line_10011'></a>
<a id='line_10012'>    But scarce the morrow's dawn of day had lit the mountain steeps,</a>
<a id='line_10013'>    And scarce the horses of the Sun drew upward from the deeps,</a>
<a id='line_10014'>    And from their nostrils raised aloft blew forth the morning clear,</a>
<a id='line_10015'>    When Trojans and Rutulian men the field of fight prepare,</a>
<a id='line_10016'>    And measure out a space beneath the mighty city's wall.</a>
<a id='line_10017'>    Midmost the hearths they hallow there to common Gods of all,</a>
<a id='line_10018'>    And grassy altars: other some bear fire, and fountain's flow,</a>
<a id='line_10019'>    All linen clad, and vervain leaves are crowning every brow.          120</a>
<a id='line_10020'>    Forth comes the host of Italy, the men that wield the spear</a>
<a id='line_10021'>    Pour outward from the crowded gate; the Trojan host is there,</a>
<a id='line_10022'>    And all the Tyrrhene company in battle-gear diverse,</a>
<a id='line_10023'>    Nor otherwise in iron clad, than if the War-god fierce</a>
<a id='line_10024'>    Cried on to arms: and in the midst of war-ranks thousandfold</a>
<a id='line_10025'>    The dukes are flitting, well beseen in purple dye and gold,</a>
<a id='line_10026'>    E'en Mnestheus of Assaracus, Asylas huge of force,</a>
<a id='line_10027'>    Messapus, Neptune's very son, the tamer of the horse.</a>
<a id='line_10028'>    But when the sign was given abroad each to his own place won,</a>
<a id='line_10029'>    And set his spear-shaft in the earth and leaned his shield thereon.  130</a>
<a id='line_10030'>    Then streamed forth mothers fain to see and elders feeble grown;</a>
<a id='line_10031'>    The unarmed crowd beset the towers and houses of the town,</a>
<a id='line_10032'>    And others of the people throng the high-built gates around.</a>
<a id='line_10033'></a>
<a id='line_10034'>    But Juno from the steep that men now call the Alban mound</a>
<a id='line_10035'>    (Though neither worship, name, nor fame it bore upon that day),</a>
<a id='line_10036'>    Was looking down upon the lists and either war-array</a>
<a id='line_10037'>    Of Trojan and Laurentine men, and King Latinus' wall,</a>
<a id='line_10038'>    Then upon Turnus' sister's ear her words of God did fall:</a>
<a id='line_10039'>    A goddess she, the queen of mere and sounding river-wave;</a>
<a id='line_10040'>    Which worship Jupiter the King, the Heaven-Abider gave               140</a>
<a id='line_10041'>    A hallowed gift to pay her back for ravished maidenhood:</a>
<a id='line_10042'></a>
<a id='line_10043'>    "O Nymph, the glory of the streams, heart well-beloved and good,</a>
<a id='line_10044'>    Thee only, as thou know'st, I love of all who e'er have come</a>
<a id='line_10045'>    Into the unkind bed of Jove from out a Latin home,</a>
<a id='line_10046'>    With goodwill have I granted thee the heavenly house to share;</a>
<a id='line_10047'>    Therefore, Juturna, know thy grief lest I the blame should bear:</a>
<a id='line_10048'>    While Fortune would, and while the Fates allowed the Latin folk</a>
<a id='line_10049'>    A happy day, so long did I thy town and Turnus cloak;</a>
<a id='line_10050'>    But now I see him hastening on to meet the fated ill:</a>
<a id='line_10051'>    His doomsday comes, the foeman's hand shall soon his hour fulfil.    150</a>
<a id='line_10052'>    I may not look upon the fight, or see the wagered field;</a>
<a id='line_10053'>    But thou, if any present help thou durst thy brother yield,</a>
<a id='line_10054'>    Haste, it behoves thee!--happier days on wretches yet may rise."</a>
<a id='line_10055'></a>
<a id='line_10056'>    Scarce spake she ere Juturna poured the tear-flood from her eyes,</a>
<a id='line_10057'>    And thrice and four times smote with hand her bosom well beseen.</a>
<a id='line_10058'>    "Nay, this is now no weeping-time," saith that Saturnian Queen,</a>
<a id='line_10059'>    "Haste; snatch thy brother from the death if all be not undone,</a>
<a id='line_10060'>    Or wake up war and rend apart the treaty scarce begun;</a>
<a id='line_10061'>    And I am she that bids thee dare."</a>
<a id='line_10062'>                                        She urged her, and she left</a>
<a id='line_10063'>    Her wavering mind and turmoiled heart with sorrow's torment cleft.   160</a>
<a id='line_10064'></a>
<a id='line_10065'>    Meantime the Kings--Latinus there, a world of state around,</a>
<a id='line_10066'>    Is borne upon the fourfold car, his gleaming temples bound</a>
<a id='line_10067'>    With twice six golden rays, the sign of his own grandsire's light,</a>
<a id='line_10068'>    The heavenly Sun; and Turnus wends with twi-yoked horses white,</a>
<a id='line_10069'>    Tossing in hand two shafts of war with broad-beat points of steel.</a>
<a id='line_10070'>    And hither Father Æneas, spring of the Roman weal,</a>
<a id='line_10071'>    Flaming with starry shield and arms wrought in the heavenly home,</a>
<a id='line_10072'>    And next to him Ascanius young, the second hope of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_10073'>    Fare from the camp: the priest thereon, in unstained raiment due,</a>
<a id='line_10074'>    Offereth a son of bristly sow and unshorn yearling ewe,              170</a>
<a id='line_10075'>    And bringeth up the four-foot hosts unto the flaming place.</a>
<a id='line_10076'>    But they, with all eyes turned about the rising sun to face,</a>
<a id='line_10077'>    Give forth the salt meal from the hand, and with the iron sign</a>
<a id='line_10078'>    The victims' brows, and mid the flame pour out the bowls of wine:</a>
<a id='line_10079'>    Then good Æneas draws his sword, and thuswise prays the prayer:</a>
<a id='line_10080'>    "Bear witness, Sun, and thou, O Land, who dost my crying hear!</a>
<a id='line_10081'>    Land, for whose sake I waxed in might, sustaining toils enow;</a>
<a id='line_10082'>    And Thou, Almighty Father, hear! Saturnian Juno thou,</a>
<a id='line_10083'>    Grown kinder, Goddess, I beseech; and thou, most glorious Mars,</a>
<a id='line_10084'>    Father, whose hand of utter might is master of all wars;             180</a>
<a id='line_10085'>    Ye Springs, and River-floods I call, and whatsoever God</a>
<a id='line_10086'>    Is in the air, or whatso rules the blue sea with its rod--</a>
<a id='line_10087'>    If to Ausonian Turnus here Fortune shall give the day,</a>
<a id='line_10088'>    The conquered to Evander's town shall straightly wend their way;</a>
<a id='line_10089'>    Iulus shall depart the land, nor shall Æneas' folk</a>
<a id='line_10090'>    Stir war hereafter, or with sword the Latin wrath provoke.</a>
<a id='line_10091'>    But if the grace of victory here bow down upon our fight;</a>
<a id='line_10092'>    --(As I believe, as may the Gods make certain with their might!)--</a>
<a id='line_10093'>    I will not bid the Italian men to serve the Teucrian's will;</a>
<a id='line_10094'>    Nor for myself seek I the realm; but all unconquered still           190</a>
<a id='line_10095'>    Let either folk with equal laws plight peace for evermore:</a>
<a id='line_10096'>    The Gods and worship I will give, Latinus see to war;</a>
<a id='line_10097'>    My father lawful rule shall have; for me my Teucrians here</a>
<a id='line_10098'>    Shall build a city, and that home Lavinia's name shall bear."</a>
<a id='line_10099'></a>
<a id='line_10100'>    So first Æneas: after whom Latinus swears and says,</a>
<a id='line_10101'>    Looking aloft, and stretching hands up towards the starry ways:</a>
<a id='line_10102'>    "E'en so, Æneas, do I swear by Stars, and Sea, and Earth,</a>
<a id='line_10103'>    By twi-faced Janus, and the twins Latona brought to birth,</a>
<a id='line_10104'>    And by the nether Might of God and shrine of unmoved Dis;</a>
<a id='line_10105'>    And may the Sire who halloweth in all troth-plight hearken this:     200</a>
<a id='line_10106'>    I hold the altars, and these Gods and fires to witness take,</a>
<a id='line_10107'>    That, as for Italy, no day the peace and troth shall break,</a>
<a id='line_10108'>    What thing soever shall befall; no might shall conquer me.</a>
<a id='line_10109'>    Not such as with the wrack of flood shall mingle earth and sea,</a>
<a id='line_10110'>    Nor such as into nether Hell shall melt the heavenly land.</a>
<a id='line_10111'>    E'en as this sceptre"--(for by chance he bore a staff in hand)--</a>
<a id='line_10112'>    "Shall never more to leafage light and twig and shadow shoot,</a>
<a id='line_10113'>    Since when amid the thicket-place, cut off from lowest root,</a>
<a id='line_10114'>    It lost its mother, and the knife hath lopped it, leaf and bough,--</a>
<a id='line_10115'>    A tree once, but the craftsman's hand hath wrapped it seemly now     210</a>
<a id='line_10116'>    With brass about, and made it meet for hands of Latin lords."</a>
<a id='line_10117'></a>
<a id='line_10118'>    So in the sight of all the chiefs with such abundant words</a>
<a id='line_10119'>    They bound the troth-plight fast and sure: then folk in due wise slay</a>
<a id='line_10120'>    The victims on the altar-flame, and draw the hearts away</a>
<a id='line_10121'>    Yet living, and with platters full the holy altars pile.</a>
<a id='line_10122'></a>
<a id='line_10123'>    But unto those Rutulian men unequal this long while</a>
<a id='line_10124'>    The fight had seemed, and in their hearts the mingled trouble rose;</a>
<a id='line_10125'>    And all the more, as nigher now they note the ill-matched foes,</a>
<a id='line_10126'>    This helpeth Turnus' silent step, and suppliant worshipping</a>
<a id='line_10127'>    About the altars, and his eyes that unto earth do cling,             220</a>
<a id='line_10128'>    His faded cheeks, his youthful frame that wonted colour lacks.</a>
<a id='line_10129'>    Wherefore Jaturna, when she hears the talk of people wax,</a>
<a id='line_10130'>    And how the wavering hearts of men in diverse manner sway,</a>
<a id='line_10131'>    Like unto Camers wendeth now amidst of that array;</a>
<a id='line_10132'>    --A mighty man, from mighty blood, his father well renowned</a>
<a id='line_10133'>    For valorous worth, and he himself keen in the battle found.</a>
<a id='line_10134'>    So through the mid array she speeds, well knowing what is toward,</a>
<a id='line_10135'>    And soweth rumour on the wind and speaketh such a word:</a>
<a id='line_10136'></a>
<a id='line_10137'>    "O shame ye not, Rutulian men, to offer up one soul</a>
<a id='line_10138'>    For all your warriors? lack we aught in might or muster-roll         230</a>
<a id='line_10139'>    To match them? Here is all they have--Trojans, Arcadian peers,</a>
<a id='line_10140'>    And that Etruscan Turnus' bane, the fateful band of spears:</a>
<a id='line_10141'>    Why, if we meet, each second man shall scantly find a foe.</a>
<a id='line_10142'>    And now their king, upborne by fame, unto the Gods shall go,</a>
<a id='line_10143'>    Upon whose shrines he vows himself; his name shall live in tale.</a>
<a id='line_10144'>    But we shall lose our fatherland and 'neath proud lords shall fail,</a>
<a id='line_10145'>    E'en those that sit there heavy-slow upon our fields today."</a>
<a id='line_10146'></a>
<a id='line_10147'>    So with such words she lit the hearts of all that young array;</a>
<a id='line_10148'>    Yet more and more a murmur creeps about the ranks of men;</a>
<a id='line_10149'>    Changed even are Laurentine folk; changed are the Latins then;       240</a>
<a id='line_10150'>    They who had hoped that rest from fight and peaceful days were won,</a>
<a id='line_10151'>    Are now but fain of battle-gear, and wish the troth undone,</a>
<a id='line_10152'>    For ruth that such a cruel fate on Turnus' head should fall.</a>
<a id='line_10153'>    But unto these a greater thing Jaturna adds withal,</a>
<a id='line_10154'>    A sign from heaven; and nought so much stirred Italy that day,</a>
<a id='line_10155'>    As this whose prodigy beguiled men's hearts to go astray:</a>
<a id='line_10156'>    For now the yellow bird of Jove amid the ruddy light</a>
<a id='line_10157'>    Was chasing of the river-fowl, and drave in hurried flight</a>
<a id='line_10158'>    The noisy throng; when suddenly down to the waves he ran,</a>
<a id='line_10159'>    And caught in greedy hookèd claws a goodly-bodied swan:              250</a>
<a id='line_10160'>    Uprose the hearts of Italy, for all the fowl cry out,</a>
<a id='line_10161'>    And, wonderful for eyes to see, from fleeing turn about,</a>
<a id='line_10162'>    Darken the air with cloud of wings, and fall upon the foe;</a>
<a id='line_10163'>    Till he, oppressed by might of them and by his prey held low,</a>
<a id='line_10164'>    Gives way, and casts the quarry down from out his hookéd claws</a>
<a id='line_10165'>    Into the river, and aback to inner cloud-land draws.</a>
<a id='line_10166'></a>
<a id='line_10167'>    Then to the sign the Rutuli shout greeting with one breath,</a>
<a id='line_10168'>    And spread their hands abroad; but first the seer Tolumnius saith:</a>
<a id='line_10169'>    "This, this is that, which still my prayers sought oft and o'er again.</a>
<a id='line_10170'>    I take the sign, I know the God! to arms with me, O men!             260</a>
<a id='line_10171'>    Poor people, whom the stranger-thief hath terrified with war.</a>
<a id='line_10172'>    E'en like these feeble fowl; who wastes the acres of your shore,</a>
<a id='line_10173'>    Yet shall he fly, and give his sails unto the outer sea:</a>
<a id='line_10174'>    But ye, your ranks with heart and mind now serry manfully,</a>
<a id='line_10175'>    And ward your ravished King and Duke with all your battle-world!"</a>
<a id='line_10176'></a>
<a id='line_10177'>    He spake, and, running forth, a shaft against the foe he hurled.</a>
<a id='line_10178'>    Forth whizzed the cornel through the air, cleaving its way aright,</a>
<a id='line_10179'>    And therewithal great noise outbreaks, and every wedge of fight</a>
<a id='line_10180'>    Is turmoiled, and the hearts of men are kindled for the fray.</a>
<a id='line_10181'>    On sped the shaft to where there stood across its baneful way        270</a>
<a id='line_10182'>    Nine fair-shaped brethren, whom whilom one faithful Tuscan wife</a>
<a id='line_10183'>    Amid Gylippus' Arcad house brought forth to light and life:</a>
<a id='line_10184'>    Now one of these, e'en where the belt of knitted stitches wrought</a>
<a id='line_10185'>    Chafed on the belly, and the clasp the joining edges caught,</a>
<a id='line_10186'>    A youth most excellent of frame and clad in glittering gear--</a>
<a id='line_10187'>    It pierced his ribs; on yellow sand it stretched him dying there.</a>
<a id='line_10188'>    Thereat his brethren, a fierce folk, with grief and rage alight,</a>
<a id='line_10189'>    Some draw their swords and some catch up the steel of speedy flight,</a>
<a id='line_10190'>    And rush on blind: Laurentum's ranks, against them swift they go,</a>
<a id='line_10191'>    And thick the Trojans from their side the meadows overflow,          280</a>
<a id='line_10192'>    Agyllans and Arcadian men with painted war array;</a>
<a id='line_10193'>    And one lust winneth over all with point and edge to play.</a>
<a id='line_10194'>    They strip the altars; drifting storm of weapon-shot doth gain</a>
<a id='line_10195'>    O'er all the heavens, and ever grows the iron battle-rain.</a>
<a id='line_10196'></a>
<a id='line_10197'>    The bowls and hearths they bear away: Latinus gets him gone,</a>
<a id='line_10198'>    Bearing aback the beaten Gods and troth-plight all undone,</a>
<a id='line_10199'>    But other men rein in the car and leap upon the steed,</a>
<a id='line_10200'>    And there with naked swords they sit, all ready for the need.</a>
<a id='line_10201'></a>
<a id='line_10202'>    Messapus, fain to rend the troth, on hostile horse down-bears</a>
<a id='line_10203'>    Upon Aulestes, Tuscan king, who kingly raiment wears:                290</a>
<a id='line_10204'>    He fled, but as abackward there away from him he went,</a>
<a id='line_10205'>    Came on the altars at his back in hapless tanglement</a>
<a id='line_10206'>    Of head and shoulders: thitherward doth hot Messapus fly</a>
<a id='line_10207'>    With spear in hand, and from his steed he smites him heavily</a>
<a id='line_10208'>    With the great beam amid his prayers, and word withal doth say:</a>
<a id='line_10209'>    "He hath it, and the Gods have got a better host today!"</a>
<a id='line_10210'>    Therewith to strip his body warm up runs the Italian band;</a>
<a id='line_10211'>    But Corynæus from the hearth catches a half-burnt brand,</a>
<a id='line_10212'>    And e'en as Ebusus comes up, and stroke in hand doth bear,</a>
<a id='line_10213'>    He filleth all his face with flame; out doth his great beard flare,  300</a>
<a id='line_10214'>    And sendeth stink of burning forth: the Trojan followed on</a>
<a id='line_10215'>    The wildered man, and with his left grip of his tresses won,</a>
<a id='line_10216'>    And, straining hard with weight of knee, to earth he pinned his foe,</a>
<a id='line_10217'>    And drave the stark sword through his side.</a>
<a id='line_10218'>                                                See Podalirius go,</a>
<a id='line_10219'>    Chasing the shepherd Alsus through the front of weapon-wrack;</a>
<a id='line_10220'>    O'er him he hangs with naked sword; but he, with bill swung back,</a>
<a id='line_10221'>    Cleaveth the foeman facing him through midmost brow and chin,</a>
<a id='line_10222'>    And all about his battle-gear the bloody rain doth win:</a>
<a id='line_10223'>    Then iron slumber fell on him, hard rest weighed down his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_10224'>    And shut were they for evermore in night that never dies.            310</a>
<a id='line_10225'></a>
<a id='line_10226'>    Then good Æneas stretched forth hands all empty of the sword,</a>
<a id='line_10227'>    And called bare-headed on his folk, with eager shouted word:</a>
<a id='line_10228'>    "Where rush ye on, and whither now doth creeping discord rise?</a>
<a id='line_10229'>    Refrain your wrath; the troth is struck; its laws in equal wise</a>
<a id='line_10230'>    Are doomed; and 'tis for me alone the battle to endure.</a>
<a id='line_10231'>    Nay, let me be! cast fear away; my hand shall make it sure.</a>
<a id='line_10232'>    This troth-plight, all these holy things, owe Turnus to my sword."</a>
<a id='line_10233'></a>
<a id='line_10234'>    But while his voice was sounding, lo, amidmost of his word,</a>
<a id='line_10235'>    A whistling speedy-wingèd shaft unto the hero won;</a>
<a id='line_10236'>    Unknown what hand hath sped it forth, what whirlwind bore it on;     320</a>
<a id='line_10237'>    What God, what hap, such glory gave to hands of Rutuli;</a>
<a id='line_10238'>    Beneath the weight of things unknown dead doth the honour lie,</a>
<a id='line_10239'>    Nor boasted any of the hurt Æneas had that day.</a>
<a id='line_10240'></a>
<a id='line_10241'>    But Turnus, when he saw the King give back from that array,</a>
<a id='line_10242'>    And all the turmoil of the Dukes, with hope his heart grew fain;</a>
<a id='line_10243'>    He cried for horse and arms, and leapt aloft to battle-wain,</a>
<a id='line_10244'>    And high of heart set on apace, the bridle in his hand;</a>
<a id='line_10245'>    And many a brave man there he gave unto the deadly land,</a>
<a id='line_10246'>    And rolled o'er wounded men in heaps, and high in car wore down</a>
<a id='line_10247'>    The ranks of men; and fleers' spears from out his hand were thrown:</a>
<a id='line_10248'>    E'en as when litten up to war by Hebrus' chilly flood                331</a>
<a id='line_10249'>    Red Mavors beateth on his shield, and rouseth fightful mood</a>
<a id='line_10250'>    Amid the fury of his steeds, who o'er the level lea</a>
<a id='line_10251'>    In uttermost hoof-smitten Thrace the south and west outflee.</a>
<a id='line_10252'>    And lo, the fellows of the God, the black Fear's bitter face,</a>
<a id='line_10253'>    The Rage of men, the Guile of War anigh him wend apace:</a>
<a id='line_10254'>    E'en so amid the battle-field his horses Turnus sped,</a>
<a id='line_10255'>    Reeking with sweat: there tramples he the woeful heaps of dead,</a>
<a id='line_10256'>    The hurrying hoofs go scattering wide a drift of bloody rain;</a>
<a id='line_10257'>    The gore, all blent with sandy dust, is pounded o'er the plain.      340</a>
<a id='line_10258'>    To death he casteth Sthenelus, Pholus, and Thamyris;</a>
<a id='line_10259'>    Those twain anigh, but him afar; from far the bane he is</a>
<a id='line_10260'>    Of Glaucus and of Lades, sons of Imbrasus, whom he</a>
<a id='line_10261'>    In Lycia bred a while agone, and armed them equally</a>
<a id='line_10262'>    To fight anigh, or on their steeds the winds to overrun.</a>
<a id='line_10263'></a>
<a id='line_10264'>    But otherwhere amidst the fight Eumedes fareth on,</a>
<a id='line_10265'>    The son of Dolon of old time, most well-renowned in fight,</a>
<a id='line_10266'>    And bringing back his father's name in courage and in might:</a>
<a id='line_10267'>    For that was he who while agone the Danaan camp espied,</a>
<a id='line_10268'>    And chose Achilles' car for spoil in his abundant pride:             350</a>
<a id='line_10269'>    But otherwise Tydides paid for such a deed o'erbold,</a>
<a id='line_10270'>    And no more had he any hope Achilles' steeds to hold.</a>
<a id='line_10271'>    So Turnus, when adown the lea this warrior he had seen,</a>
<a id='line_10272'>    First a light spear he sent in chase across the void between,</a>
<a id='line_10273'>    Then stayed his steeds, and leaping down unto the fallen ran,</a>
<a id='line_10274'>    And set his foot upon the neck of that scarce-breathing man,</a>
<a id='line_10275'>    And from his right hand wrenched the sword and bathed its glittering blade</a>
<a id='line_10276'>    Deep in his throat, and therewithal such spoken chiding said:</a>
<a id='line_10277'>    "Down, Trojan! measure out the mead, and that Hesperean land</a>
<a id='line_10278'>    Thou sought'st in war: such are the gifts that fall unto the hand    360</a>
<a id='line_10279'>    Of those that dare the sword with me; such city-walls they raise!"</a>
<a id='line_10280'></a>
<a id='line_10281'>    Asbutes wends 'neath spear-cast then, a fellow of his ways;</a>
<a id='line_10282'>    Chloreus, Dares, Thersilochus, and Sybaris, withal;</a>
<a id='line_10283'>    Thymoetes, who from rearing horse had hap to catch a fall;</a>
<a id='line_10284'>    And e'en as when the breathing forth of Thracian Boreas roars</a>
<a id='line_10285'>    O'er deep Ægean, driving on the wave-press to the shores,</a>
<a id='line_10286'>    Then wheresoe'er the wind stoops down the clouds flee heaven apace;</a>
<a id='line_10287'>    So wheresoe'er cleaves Turnus way all battle giveth place,</a>
<a id='line_10288'>    All war-array is turned to wrack: his onrush beareth him,</a>
<a id='line_10289'>    And in the breeze that meets his car his tossing crest doth swim.    370</a>
<a id='line_10290'></a>
<a id='line_10291'>    This onset of the maddened heart nought Phegeus might abide,</a>
<a id='line_10292'>    But cast himself before the steeds, and caught and wrenched aside</a>
<a id='line_10293'>    The bit-befoaming mouths of them, the heart-stung hurrying steeds.</a>
<a id='line_10294'>    But while he hangeth dragged along, the spear broad-headed speeds</a>
<a id='line_10295'>    Unto his shieldless side, and rends the twilinked coat of mail,</a>
<a id='line_10296'>    And for the razing of his flesh a little doth avail:</a>
<a id='line_10297'>    But he turned round about his shield and at the foemen made,</a>
<a id='line_10298'>    And from his naked sword drawn forth sought most well-needed aid;</a>
<a id='line_10299'>    When now the axle-tree and wheel, unto fresh speeding won,</a>
<a id='line_10300'>    Cast him down headlong unto earth, and Turnus following on,          380</a>
<a id='line_10301'>    Betwixt the lowest of the helm and haubert's upper lip</a>
<a id='line_10302'>    Sheared off his head, and left the trunk upon the sand to slip.</a>
<a id='line_10303'></a>
<a id='line_10304'>    But while victorious Turnus gives these deaths unto the plain,</a>
<a id='line_10305'>    Mnestheus and that Achates leal, Ascanius with the twain,</a>
<a id='line_10306'>    Bring great Æneas to the camp all covered with his blood;</a>
<a id='line_10307'>    There, propping up his halting steps with spear-shaft long, he stood:</a>
<a id='line_10308'>    Mad wroth he is, and strives to pluck the broken reed away,</a>
<a id='line_10309'>    And bids them help by any road, the swiftest that they may,</a>
<a id='line_10310'>    To cut away the wound with sword, cut to the hiding-place</a>
<a id='line_10311'>    Where lies the steel, and send him back to meet the battle's face.   390</a>
<a id='line_10312'>    Iapis, son of Iasus, by Phoebus best beloved,</a>
<a id='line_10313'>    Draws nigh now: Phoebus on a time, by mighty longing moved,</a>
<a id='line_10314'>    Was fain to give him gifts of God, his very heavenly craft--</a>
<a id='line_10315'>    Foresight, or skill of harp-playing, or mastery of the shaft:</a>
<a id='line_10316'>    But he, that from his bed-rid sire the death he yet might stave,</a>
<a id='line_10317'>    Would liefer know the might of herbs, and how men heal and save,</a>
<a id='line_10318'>    And, speeding of a silent craft, inglorious life would wear.</a>
<a id='line_10319'></a>
<a id='line_10320'>    Æneas, fretting bitterly, stood leaning on his spear</a>
<a id='line_10321'>    Midst a great concourse of the lords, with sad Iulus by,</a>
<a id='line_10322'>    Unmoved amid their many tears: the elder, girded high                400</a>
<a id='line_10323'>    In folded gown, in e'en such wise as Pæon erst was dight,</a>
<a id='line_10324'>    With hurrying hand speeds many a salve of Phoebus' herbs of might;</a>
<a id='line_10325'>    But all in vain: his right hand woos the arrow-head in vain;</a>
<a id='line_10326'>    For nought the teeth of pincers grip the iron of the bane;</a>
<a id='line_10327'>    No happy road will Fortune show, no help Apollo yields:</a>
<a id='line_10328'>    And grimly terror more and more prevaileth o'er the fields,</a>
<a id='line_10329'>    And nigher draws the evil hour: they see the dusty pall</a>
<a id='line_10330'>    Spread o'er the heaven; draw horsemen nigh, and shafts begin to fall</a>
<a id='line_10331'>    Thick in the midmost of the camp: grim clamour smites the stars,</a>
<a id='line_10332'>    The shouts of men, the cries of men that fall in game of Mars.       410</a>
<a id='line_10333'></a>
<a id='line_10334'>    Now Mother Venus, sore at heart for her sore-wounded son,</a>
<a id='line_10335'>    Plucketh a stalk of dittany from Cretan Ida won,</a>
<a id='line_10336'>    That with a downy leaf of grey and purple head doth grow,</a>
<a id='line_10337'>    And well enough the mountain-goats the herbage of it know</a>
<a id='line_10338'>    What time the winged shaft of man within them clingeth sore.</a>
<a id='line_10339'>    This Venus brought, with cloudy cloak her body covered o'er,</a>
<a id='line_10340'>    This in the waves of glittering rims she steepeth privily,</a>
<a id='line_10341'>    Drugging the cup, and wholesome juice withal there blendeth she,</a>
<a id='line_10342'>    Wrought of ambrosia; heal-all too most sweet of heavenly smell.</a>
<a id='line_10343'>    So with that stream Iapis old the shaft-wound cherished well         420</a>
<a id='line_10344'>    Unwitting: sudden from the flesh all grievance doth depart,</a>
<a id='line_10345'>    And all the blood is staunched at once up from the wound's deep heart,</a>
<a id='line_10346'>    And comes the shaft unto the hand with nought to force it forth,</a>
<a id='line_10347'>    And freshly to the king returns his ancient might and worth.</a>
<a id='line_10348'>    Then cries Iapis:</a>
<a id='line_10349'>                      "Loiter ye? arms for the hero then!"</a>
<a id='line_10350'>    And he is first against the foe to whet the hearts of men.</a>
<a id='line_10351'>    "Lo, not from any help of man, nor from art's mastery</a>
<a id='line_10352'>    These things have happed, nor hath mine hand, Æneas, holpen thee.</a>
<a id='line_10353'>    A great God wrought to send thee back great deeds of fame to win."</a>
<a id='line_10354'></a>
<a id='line_10355'>    Then, fain of fight, on either side the king his legs shuts in       430</a>
<a id='line_10356'>    With ruddy gold: he loathes delay, and high his war-shaft shakes;</a>
<a id='line_10357'>    And then his left side meets the shield, his back the hauberk takes,</a>
<a id='line_10358'>    And round Iulus casteth he a steel-clad man's embrace,</a>
<a id='line_10359'>    And saith, but lightly kissing him from midst the helmet's space:</a>
<a id='line_10360'></a>
<a id='line_10361'>    "Child, the bare valour learn of me and very earthly toil,</a>
<a id='line_10362'>    Good-hap of others; my right hand shall ward thee in the broil</a>
<a id='line_10363'>    These days that are, and gain for thee exceeding great rewards;</a>
<a id='line_10364'>    But thou, when ripe thine age shall grow, remember well the swords;</a>
<a id='line_10365'>    Then as thine heart seeks through the past for kin to show the road,</a>
<a id='line_10366'>    Well shall thy sire Æneas stir, thine uncle Hector goad."            440</a>
<a id='line_10367'></a>
<a id='line_10368'>    But when these words are cast abroad, huge through the gate he goes,</a>
<a id='line_10369'>    Shaking in hand a mighty spear; then in arrayment close</a>
<a id='line_10370'>    Antheus and Mnestheus rush to war: the camp is left behind,</a>
<a id='line_10371'>    And all the host flows forth; the fields are blent with dust-cloud blind,</a>
<a id='line_10372'>    And, stirred by trample of the feet, the earth's face trembleth sore.</a>
<a id='line_10373'>    But Turnus from a facing mound beheld that coming war.</a>
<a id='line_10374'>    The Ausonians looked, and through their hearts swift ran the chilly fear:</a>
<a id='line_10375'>    And now before all other men first doth Jaturna hear,</a>
<a id='line_10376'>    And know the sound, and, quaking sore, she fleeth back again.</a>
<a id='line_10377'>    On comes he, hurrying on the host black o'er the open plain:         450</a>
<a id='line_10378'>    As when a storm cast on the world from heaven asunder rent,</a>
<a id='line_10379'>    Wendeth across the middle sea: out! how the dread is sent</a>

<a id='line_10393'>    Nay, those that meet him foot to foot, the wielders of the spear,</a>
<a id='line_10394'>    He followeth not: Turnus alone his eyes track everywhere</a>
<a id='line_10395'>    Amid the dust-cloud, him alone he crieth unto fight.</a>
<a id='line_10396'>    Hereby Jaturna's manly mind is shaken with affright;</a>
<a id='line_10397'>    Metiscus, Turnus' charioteer, she plucketh from the rein,</a>
<a id='line_10398'>    And leaveth him fallen down afar from yoking pole and wain:          470</a>
<a id='line_10399'>    But she mounts up, and with her hand the waving bridle guides,</a>
<a id='line_10400'>    The while Metiscus' voice, and limbs, and war-gear with her bides:</a>
<a id='line_10401'>    As when amid a lordling's house there flits a swallow black,</a>

<a id='line_10404'>    Then soundeth through the empty porch, and round the fish-pools wet,</a>
<a id='line_10405'>    So is Jaturna borne on wheels amidmost of the foe,</a>
<a id='line_10406'>    And flying on in hurrying chase by everything doth go,</a>
<a id='line_10407'>    Now here, now there, her brother shows all flushed with victory,</a>

<a id='line_10417'>    But lo, Messapus, speedy-light, who chanced in hand to have</a>
<a id='line_10418'>    Two light and limber shafts of tree, each with its iron head,</a>
<a id='line_10419'>    Now whirling one, a shot well aimed unto the hero sped:              490</a>
<a id='line_10420'>    Ænesis stayed, and gathered him behind his shielding-gear,</a>
<a id='line_10421'>    And sank upon his knee; no less the eager-driven spear</a>
<a id='line_10422'>    Smote on his helm, and shore away the topmost of his crest</a>
<a id='line_10423'>    Then verily his wrath arose; by all that guile oppressed,</a>
<a id='line_10424'>    When he beheld the steeds and car far from his battle borne,</a>
<a id='line_10425'>    He bade Jove witness, and the hearths of troth-plight wronged and torn:</a>
<a id='line_10426'>    He breaks at last amidst of them with Mars to help him on,</a>
<a id='line_10427'>    And fearful speedeth work of death wherein he spareth none,</a>
<a id='line_10428'>    And casteth every rein aside that held his anger in.</a>
<a id='line_10429'></a>
<a id='line_10430'>    What God shall tell me all the woe, what God the song shall win      500</a>
<a id='line_10431'>    Of shifting death and Dukes undone, and all those many dead,</a>

<a id='line_10433'>    O Jupiter, was this thy will, that nations doomed to live</a>
<a id='line_10434'>    In peace hereafter, on that day in such a broil should strive?</a>
<a id='line_10435'></a>
<a id='line_10436'>    Rutulian Sucro was the first that Trojan onset stayed;</a>
<a id='line_10437'>    Æneas met him, and forsooth no long delay he made,</a>
<a id='line_10438'>    But smote his side, and through his ribs and fencing of the breast</a>
<a id='line_10439'>    Drave on his bitter naked sword where way was easiest.</a>
<a id='line_10440'></a>
<a id='line_10441'>    Turnus afoot met Amycus, cast down from off his horse,</a>
<a id='line_10442'>    His brother, swift Diores, too: the first amidst his course          510</a>
<a id='line_10443'>    The long spear smote, the sword the last; the heads of both the twain</a>
<a id='line_10444'>    He hangeth up and beareth on shedding a bloody rain.</a>

<a id='line_10446'>    Talon and Tanais therewith, Cethegus stout to do,</a>
<a id='line_10447'>    All three at once the Trojan sped, and sad Onytes slew,</a>
<a id='line_10448'>    Whom to the name of Echion Peridia's womb did yield.</a>
<a id='line_10449'></a>
<a id='line_10450'>    Then Turnus slew the brethren sent from Phoebus' Lycian field:</a>
<a id='line_10451'>    Menates, too, of Arcady, who loathed the war in vain;</a>
<a id='line_10452'>    By fruitful fishy Lerna's flood was once his life and gain,</a>
<a id='line_10453'>    And unrich house, and nought he knew of mighty men's abode,</a>
<a id='line_10454'>    And hired for a price of men the earth his father sowed.             520</a>
<a id='line_10455'></a>
<a id='line_10456'>    As when two fires, that on a while are sped from diverse ways,</a>
<a id='line_10457'>    Run through the dry and tinder wood, and crackling twigs of bays;</a>
<a id='line_10458'>    As when from off the mountain-tops two hurrying rivers speed,</a>
<a id='line_10459'>    And foaming, roaring, as they rush, drive down to ocean's mead,</a>
<a id='line_10460'>    And each one wastes his proper road; no slothfuller than these,</a>

<a id='line_10464'></a>
<a id='line_10465'>    Murranus, as his sires of sires and ancient name he sings,</a>

<a id='line_10467'>    Æneas, with a mighty rock and whirlwind of a stone,</a>
<a id='line_10468'>    O'erthrows, and stretches on the earth; the wain-wheels roll him on,</a>

<a id='line_10477'>                           Nought his Gods did their Cupencus cloak</a>
<a id='line_10478'>    Against Æneas' rush of war; breast-on he met the stroke,             540</a>
<a id='line_10479'>    And nought availed that hapless one the tarrying golden shield.</a>
<a id='line_10480'></a>
<a id='line_10481'>    Thee also, warring Æolus, did that Laurentine field</a>
<a id='line_10482'>    See fallen, and cumbering the earth with body laid alow;</a>
<a id='line_10483'>    Thou diest, whom the Argive hosts might never overthrow,</a>

<a id='line_10492'>    No tarrying, no rest, they strain in contest measureless.</a>
<a id='line_10493'></a>
<a id='line_10494'>    But now a thought his mother sent Æneas' mind to bless.</a>
<a id='line_10495'>    That he should wend unto the walls, and townward turn his host,</a>
<a id='line_10496'>    And blend amid destruction swift the Latin people lost.</a>
<a id='line_10497'>    For he, now marking Turnus' ways through many a company,</a>
<a id='line_10498'>    Hither and thither turns his eyes, and sees the city lie</a>
<a id='line_10499'>    At peace amid the mighty stir, unharmed amid the fight,</a>
<a id='line_10500'>    And image of a greater war set all his soul alight.                  560</a>
<a id='line_10501'>    Mnestheus, Sergestus then he calls, Serestus battle-strong,</a>
<a id='line_10502'>    The Dukes of war; he mounts a knoll; thither the Teucrians throng</a>
<a id='line_10503'>    In serried ranks, yet lay not by the battle-spear and shield:</a>
<a id='line_10504'>    So there from off the mound he speaks amidmost of the field:</a>
<a id='line_10505'></a>
<a id='line_10506'>    "Let none hang back from these my words, for Jove is standing by;</a>
<a id='line_10507'>    Let none be dull herein because it cometh suddenly:</a>
<a id='line_10508'>    Today the town, the cause of war, the king Latinus' home,</a>
<a id='line_10509'>    Unless they cry them craven men, and 'neath the yoke they come,</a>
<a id='line_10510'>    Will I o'erthrow; the smoking towers upon the ground will lay.</a>
<a id='line_10511'>    What! must I wait till Turnus grows fain of the battle-play?         570</a>
<a id='line_10512'>    And shall he, conquered, take his ease to fight me o'er and o'er?</a>
<a id='line_10513'>    O fellows, this is head and well of all the wicked war.</a>
<a id='line_10514'>    Haste with the torches, set we forth the troth with fire to find!"</a>
<a id='line_10515'></a>
<a id='line_10516'>    He spake; but all they set to work, and striving with one mind</a>
<a id='line_10517'>    Knit close their ranks, and on the town a world of battle bear:</a>
<a id='line_10518'>    Unlooked-for ladders are at hand, and sudden fires appear;</a>
<a id='line_10519'>    While some they run unto the gates, and there the out-guards slay,</a>
<a id='line_10520'>    Or hurl the spears, and with their cloud dim down the light of day.</a>
<a id='line_10521'>    Æneas, in the front of men, lifts hand unto the walls,</a>
<a id='line_10522'>    And in a great and mighty voice guilt on Latinus calls,              580</a>
<a id='line_10523'>    And bids the Gods to witness him twice to the battle driven,</a>
<a id='line_10524'>    Italians twice become his foes, and twice the treaty riven.</a>
<a id='line_10525'>    But mid the turmoiled city-folk arose the bickering then,</a>
<a id='line_10526'>    Some bade unbar and open gates unto the Dardan men;</a>
<a id='line_10527'>    Yea, some unto the walls would drag their very king and lord;</a>
<a id='line_10528'>    But some bear arms and go their ways the walls of war to ward:</a>
<a id='line_10529'>    E'en as the shepherd finds the bees shut in, a fencèd folk,</a>
<a id='line_10530'>    In chinky pumice rock, and fills their house with bitter smoke;</a>
<a id='line_10531'>    But they, all busy-fearful grown within their waxen wall,</a>
<a id='line_10532'>    Run here and there and whet their wrath with mighty humming call:    590</a>
<a id='line_10533'>    The black stink rolleth through their house, and with a murmuring blind</a>
<a id='line_10534'>    The stony hollows moan: the reek the empty air doth find.</a>
<a id='line_10535'></a>
<a id='line_10536'>    Here on the weary Latins fell another stroke of fate,</a>
<a id='line_10537'>    That moved the city deep adown with sorrow sore and great;</a>
<a id='line_10538'>    For when the Queen from house aloft beheld the foe draw nigh,</a>
<a id='line_10539'>    The walls beset, the flaming brands unto the house-roofs fly,</a>
<a id='line_10540'>    And nowhere the Rutulian ranks or Turnus' warring host,</a>
<a id='line_10541'>    The hapless woman deems the youth in stress of battle lost,</a>
<a id='line_10542'>    And, all bewildered in her mind by these so sudden woes,</a>
<a id='line_10543'>    Curses herself for head and spring whence all the evil flows;        600</a>
<a id='line_10544'>    And crying many a bitter word, and mad with sorrow grown,</a>
<a id='line_10545'>    She riveth with her dying hand the queenly purple gown,</a>
<a id='line_10546'>    And knits the knot of loathly death from lofty beam on high.</a>
<a id='line_10547'>    But when the wretched Latin wives know all this misery,</a>
<a id='line_10548'>    Her daughter first, Lavinia, wastes the blossom of her hair,</a>
<a id='line_10549'>    And wounds her rosy cheeks; then they that stood about her there</a>
<a id='line_10550'>    Run wild about, and all the house resoundeth with their wail.</a>
<a id='line_10551'>    Thence through the city flies the sound of that unhappy tale,</a>
<a id='line_10552'>    And all hearts sink: Latinus goes with raiment rent and torn,</a>
<a id='line_10553'>    Stunned by his wife's unhappy lot, and city lost and lorn,           610</a>
<a id='line_10554'>    And scattering o'er his hoariness defilement of the dust;</a>
<a id='line_10555'>    And often he upbraids himself that he took not to trust</a>
<a id='line_10556'>    That Dardan lord, nor willingly had hallowed him his son.</a>
<a id='line_10557'></a>
<a id='line_10558'>    Meanwhile across the outer plain war-Turnus followeth on</a>
<a id='line_10559'>    The last few stragglers, duller grown, and less and less his heart</a>
<a id='line_10560'>    Rejoices in his hurrying steed and their victorious part.</a>
<a id='line_10561'>    The air bore to him noise of men with doubtful terror blent,</a>
<a id='line_10562'>    And round about his hearkening ears confusèd murmur sent;</a>
<a id='line_10563'>    The noise of that turmoilèd town, a sound of nought but woe:</a>
<a id='line_10564'>    "Ah, me!" he cried, "what mighty grief stirs up the city so?         620</a>
<a id='line_10565'>    Why from the walls now goeth up this cry and noise afar?"</a>
<a id='line_10566'></a>
<a id='line_10567'>    He spake, and, wildered, drew the rein and stayed the battle-car:</a>
<a id='line_10568'>    His sister met his questioning, as she in seeming clad</a>
<a id='line_10569'>    Of that Metiscus, all the rule of battle-chariot had,</a>
<a id='line_10570'>    And steeds and bridle:</a>
<a id='line_10571'>                           "Hereaway, O Turnus, drive we on</a>
<a id='line_10572'>    The sons of Troy; where victory shows a road that may be won:</a>
<a id='line_10573'>    For other hands there are, belike, the houses to defend.</a>
<a id='line_10574'>    Æneas falls on Italy, and there doth battle blend;</a>
<a id='line_10575'>    So let our hands give cruel death to Teucrian men this day,</a>
<a id='line_10576'>    No less in tale: so shalt thou hold thine honour in the fray."       630</a>
<a id='line_10577'></a>
<a id='line_10578'>    But Turnus sayeth thereunto:</a>
<a id='line_10579'>    "Sister, I knew thee long ago, when first by art and craft</a>
<a id='line_10580'>    Thou brok'st the troth-plight, and therewith amidst the battle went;</a>
<a id='line_10581'>    And now thou hidest God in vain. But whose will thee hath sent</a>
<a id='line_10582'>    From high Olympus' house to bear such troubles, and so great?</a>
<a id='line_10583'>    Was it to see thy brother's end and most unhappy fate?</a>
<a id='line_10584'>    For what do I? What heal is left in aught that may befall?</a>
<a id='line_10585'>    Mine eyes beheld Murranus die, on me I heard him call:</a>
<a id='line_10586'>    No dearer man in all the world is left me for a friend:</a>
<a id='line_10587'>    Woe's me I that mighty man of men a mighty death must end.           640</a>
<a id='line_10588'>    Ufens is dead, unhappy too lest he our shame behold;</a>
<a id='line_10589'>    E'en as I speak the Teucrians ward his arms and body cold.</a>
<a id='line_10590'>    And now--the one shame wanting yet--shall I stand deedless by</a>
<a id='line_10591'>    Their houses' wrack, nor let my sword cast back that Drances' lie?</a>
<a id='line_10592'>    Shall I give back, and shall this land see craven Turnus fled?</a>
<a id='line_10593'>    Is death, then, such a misery? O rulers of the dead,</a>
<a id='line_10594'>    Be kind! since now the high God's heart is turned away from me;</a>
<a id='line_10595'>    A hallowed soul I go adown, guiltless of infamy,</a>
<a id='line_10596'>    Not all unworthy of the great, my sires of long ago."</a>
<a id='line_10597'></a>
<a id='line_10598'>    Scarce had he said when, here behold, from midmost of the foe,       650</a>
<a id='line_10599'>    Comes Saces on his foaming steed, an arrow in his face,</a>
<a id='line_10600'>    Who, crying prayers on Turnus' name, onrusheth to the place:</a>
<a id='line_10601'>    "Turnus, in thee our last hope lies! pity thy wretched folk!</a>

<a id='line_10603'>    The overthrow of tower and town, and wrack of Italy.</a>
<a id='line_10604'>    The flames are flying toward the roofs; all mouths of Latins cry</a>

<a id='line_10607'>    The Queen to wit, thy faithfullest, is dead by her own hand,</a>
<a id='line_10608'>    And, fearful of the things to come, hath left the daylight land.     660</a>
<a id='line_10609'>    Messapus and Atinas keen alone upbear our might</a>
<a id='line_10610'>    Before the gates: round each of them are gathered hosts of fight</a>
<a id='line_10611'>    Thick-thronging, and a harvest-tide that bristles with the sword;</a>

<a id='line_10613'></a>
<a id='line_10614'>    Bewildered then with images of diverse things he stood</a>
<a id='line_10615'>    In silent stare; and in his heart upswelled a mighty flood</a>
<a id='line_10616'>    Of mingled shame and maddening grief: the Furies goaded sore</a>
<a id='line_10617'>    With bitter love and valour tried and known from time of yore.</a>
<a id='line_10618'>    But when the cloud was shaken off and light relit his soul,</a>
<a id='line_10619'>    His burning eyeballs toward the town, fierce-hearted, did he roll,  670</a>
<a id='line_10620'>    And from the wheels of war looked back unto the mighty town;</a>
<a id='line_10621'>    And lo, behold, a wave of flame into a tongue-shape grown</a>
<a id='line_10622'>    Licked round a tower, and 'twixt its floors rolled upward unto heaven:</a>
<a id='line_10623'>    A tower that he himself had reared with timbers closely driven,</a>

<a id='line_10631'></a>
<a id='line_10632'>    He spake, and from the chariot leapt adown upon the mead,</a>
<a id='line_10633'>    And left his sister lone in grief amidst the foe to speed,</a>
<a id='line_10634'>    Amidst the spears, and breaketh through the midmost press of fight,</a>
<a id='line_10635'>    E'en as a headlong stone sweeps down from off the mountain-height,</a>

<a id='line_10640'>    Amidst its wrack: so Turnus through the broken battle broke</a>
<a id='line_10641'>    Unto the very city-walls, where earth was all a-soak                 690</a>
<a id='line_10642'>    With plenteous blood, and air beset with whistling of the shafts;</a>
<a id='line_10643'>    There with his hand he maketh sign, and mighty speech he wafts:</a>

<a id='line_10657'>    Then Trojan and Rutulian men turn thither all their eyes,</a>
<a id='line_10658'>    And all the folk of Italy, and they that hold the wall,</a>
<a id='line_10659'>    And they that drive against its feet the battering engines' fall</a>
<a id='line_10660'>    All men do off their armour then. Amazed Latinus stands</a>
<a id='line_10661'>    To see two mighty heroes, born in such wide-sundered lands,</a>
<a id='line_10662'>    Meet thus to try what deed of doom in meeting swords may be.</a>
<a id='line_10663'></a>
<a id='line_10664'>    But they, when empty space is cleared amid the open lea,             710</a>
<a id='line_10665'>    Set each on each in speedy wise, and with their war-spears hurled</a>
<a id='line_10666'>    Amid the clash of shield and brass break into Mavors' world;</a>
<a id='line_10667'>    Then groaneth earth; then comes the hail of sword-strokes thick and fast,</a>
<a id='line_10668'>    And in one blended tangle now are luck and valour cast:</a>
<a id='line_10669'>    As when on mighty Sila's side, or on Taburnus height,</a>
<a id='line_10670'>    Two bulls with pushing horny brows are mingled in the fight:</a>
<a id='line_10671'>    The frighted herdsmen draw aback, and all the beasts are dumb</a>
<a id='line_10672'>    For utter fear; the heifers too misdoubt them what shall come,</a>
<a id='line_10673'>    Who shall be master of the grove and leader of the flock;</a>
<a id='line_10674'>    But each on each they mingle wounds with fearful might of shock,     720</a>
<a id='line_10675'>    And gore and push home fencing horns, and with abundant blood</a>
<a id='line_10676'>    Bathe neck and shoulder, till the noise goes bellowing through the wood;</a>
<a id='line_10677'>    E'en so Æneas out of Troy, and he, the Daunian man,</a>
<a id='line_10678'>    Smite shield on shield; and mighty clash through all the heavens there ran.</a>
<a id='line_10679'>    'Tis Jupiter who holds the scales 'twixt even-poisèd tongue;</a>
<a id='line_10680'>    There in the balance needfully their sundered fates he hung,</a>
<a id='line_10681'>    Which one the battle-pain shall doom, in which the death shall lie.</a>
<a id='line_10682'></a>
<a id='line_10683'>    Now Turnus deems him safe, and forth with sword upreared on high,</a>
<a id='line_10684'>    He springs, and all his body strains, and rises to the stroke,</a>
<a id='line_10685'>    And smites: the Trojans cry aloud, and eager Latin folk,             730</a>
<a id='line_10686'>    And both hosts hang 'twixt hope and fear: but lo, the treacherous sword</a>
<a id='line_10687'>    Breaks in the middle of the blow and leaves its fiery lord:--</a>
<a id='line_10688'>    And if the flight shall fail him now!--Swift as the East he flees</a>
<a id='line_10689'>    When in his right hand weaponless an unknown hilt he sees.</a>
<a id='line_10690'></a>
<a id='line_10691'>    They say, that when all eager-hot he clomb his yokèd car</a>
<a id='line_10692'>    In first of fight, that then he left his father's blade of war,</a>
<a id='line_10693'>    And caught in hand his charioteer Metiscus' battle-glaive;</a>
<a id='line_10694'>    And that was well while Trojan fleers backs to the smiting gave,</a>
<a id='line_10695'>    But when they meet Vulcanian arms, the very God's device,</a>
<a id='line_10696'>    Then shivereth all the mortal blade e'en as the foolish ice;         740</a>
<a id='line_10697'>    And there upon the yellow sand the glittering splinters lie.</a>
<a id='line_10698'></a>
<a id='line_10699'>    So diversely about the field doth wildered Turnus fly,</a>
<a id='line_10700'>    And here and there in winding ways he doubleth up and down,</a>
<a id='line_10701'>    For thick all round about the lists was drawn the Teucrian crown:</a>
<a id='line_10702'>    By wide marsh here, by high walls there, his fleeing was begirt.</a>
<a id='line_10703'></a>
<a id='line_10704'>    Nor less Æneas, howsoe'er, hampered by arrow-hurt,</a>
<a id='line_10705'>    His knees might hinder him at whiles and fail him as he ran,</a>
<a id='line_10706'>    Yet foot for foot all eagerly followed the hurrying man;</a>
<a id='line_10707'>    As when a hound hath caught a hart hemmed by the river's ring,</a>
<a id='line_10708'>    Or hedged about by empty fear of crimson-feathered string,           750</a>
<a id='line_10709'>    And swift of foot and baying loud goes following up the flight;</a>
<a id='line_10710'>    But he, all fearful of the snare and of the flood-bank's height,</a>
<a id='line_10711'>    Doubles and turns a thousand ways, while open-mouthed and staunch</a>
<a id='line_10712'>    The Umbrian keen sticks hard at heel, and now, now hath his haunch,</a>
<a id='line_10713'>    Snapping his jaws as though he gripped, and, mocked, but biteth air.</a>
<a id='line_10714'>    Then verily the cry arose; the bank, the spreading mere,</a>
<a id='line_10715'>    Rang back about, and tumult huge ran shattering through the sky.</a>
<a id='line_10716'>    But Turnus as he fled cried out on all his Rutuli,</a>
<a id='line_10717'>    And, calling each man by his name, craved his familiar blade.</a>
<a id='line_10718'>    Meanwhile Æneas threateneth death if any come to aid,                760</a>
<a id='line_10719'>    And swift destruction: and their souls with fearful threats doth fill</a>
<a id='line_10720'>    Of city ruined root and branch; and, halting, followeth still.</a>
<a id='line_10721'>    Five rings of flight their running fills, and back the like they wend:</a>
<a id='line_10722'>    Nought light nor gamesome is the prize for which their feet contend,</a>
<a id='line_10723'>    For there they strive in running-game for Turnus' life and blood.</a>
<a id='line_10724'></a>
<a id='line_10725'>    By hap hard by an olive wild of bitter leaves there stood,</a>
<a id='line_10726'>    Hallowed to Faunus, while agone a most well-worshipped tree,</a>
<a id='line_10727'>    Whereon to that Laurentian God the sailors saved from sea</a>
<a id='line_10728'>    Would set their gifts, and hang therefrom their garments vowed at need.</a>
<a id='line_10729'>    But now the Teucrian men of late had lopped with little heed         770</a>
<a id='line_10730'>    That holy stem, that they might make the lists of battle clear:</a>
<a id='line_10731'>    And there Æneas' war-spear stood; his might had driven it there,</a>
<a id='line_10732'>    And held it now, set hard and fast in stubborn root and stout:</a>
<a id='line_10733'>    The Dardan son bent o'er it now to pluck the weapon out,</a>
<a id='line_10734'>    That he might follow him with shot whom running might not take.</a>
<a id='line_10735'>    But Turnus, wildered with his fear, cried out aloud and spake:</a>
<a id='line_10736'></a>
<a id='line_10737'>    "O Faunus, pity me, I pray! and thou, O kindest Earth,</a>
<a id='line_10738'>    Hold thou the steel for me, who still have worshipped well thy worth,</a>
<a id='line_10739'>    Which ever those Ænean folk with battle would profane!"</a>
<a id='line_10740'></a>
<a id='line_10741'>    He spake, and called the God to aid with vows not made in vain;      780</a>
<a id='line_10742'>    For o'er the tough tree tarrying long, struggling with utter might,</a>
<a id='line_10743'>    No whit Æneas could undo the gripping woody bite.</a>
<a id='line_10744'>    But while he struggleth hot and hard, and hangeth o'er the spear,</a>
<a id='line_10745'>    Again the Daunian Goddess, clad in shape of charioteer</a>
<a id='line_10746'>    Metiscus, Turnus' trusty sword unto his hand doth speed.</a>
<a id='line_10747'>    But Venus, wrathful that the Nymph might dare so bold a deed,</a>
<a id='line_10748'>    Came nigh, and from the deep-set root the shaft of battle drew.</a>
<a id='line_10749'>    So they, high-hearted, stored with hope and battle-gear anew,</a>
<a id='line_10750'>    One trusting in his sword, and one fierce with his spear on high,</a>
<a id='line_10751'>    Stand face to face, the glorious game of panting Mars to try.        790</a>
<a id='line_10752'></a>
<a id='line_10753'>    Meanwhile the King of Heaven the great thus unto Juno saith,</a>
<a id='line_10754'>    As from a ruddy cloud she looked upon the game of death:</a>
<a id='line_10755'>    "What then shall end it, O my wife? what deed is left thine hand?</a>
<a id='line_10756'>    That Heaven shall gain Æneas yet, a Godhead of the land,</a>
<a id='line_10757'>    That Fate shall bear him to the stars thou know'st and hast allowed:</a>
<a id='line_10758'>    What dost thou then, or hoping what hang'st thou in chilly cloud?</a>
<a id='line_10759'>    What! was it right that mortal wound a God's own flesh should wrong?</a>
<a id='line_10760'>    Right to give Turnus--but for thee how was Juturna strong?--</a>
<a id='line_10761'>    The sword he lost? or vanquished men, to give their might increase?</a>
<a id='line_10762'>    I prithee yield unto my prayers, and from thy troubling cease.       800</a>
<a id='line_10763'>    Let not thine hushed grief eat thine heart, or bitter words of care</a>
<a id='line_10764'>    So often from thy sweetest mouth the soul within me wear.</a>
<a id='line_10765'>    The goal is reached: thou hast availed o'er earth and sea to drive</a>
<a id='line_10766'>    The Trojan men; to strike the spark of wicked war alive;</a>
<a id='line_10767'>    To foul their house, and woe and grief mid wedding-feast to bear,</a>
<a id='line_10768'>    And now I bid thee hold thine hand."</a>
<a id='line_10769'>                                        Thuswise said Jupiter,</a>
<a id='line_10770'>    And with a downcast countenance spake that Satumian Queen:</a>
<a id='line_10771'>    "Well have I known, great Jupiter, all that thy will hath been,</a>
<a id='line_10772'>    And Turnus and the worldly land loth have I left alone,</a>
<a id='line_10773'>    Else nowise should'st thou see me bear, sole on this airy throne,    810</a>
<a id='line_10774'>    Things meet and unmeet: flame-begirt the war-ranks would I gain,</a>
<a id='line_10775'>    And drag the host of Trojans on to battle and their bane.</a>
<a id='line_10776'>    Juturna!--yes, I pitied her, and bade her help to bear</a>
<a id='line_10777'>    Unto her brother; good, methought, for life great things to dare;</a>
<a id='line_10778'>    But nought I bade her to the shaft or bending of the bow,</a>
<a id='line_10779'>    This swear I by the ruthless well, the Stygian overflow,</a>
<a id='line_10780'>    The only holy thing there is that weighs on Godhead's oath.</a>
<a id='line_10781'>    And now indeed I yield the place, and leave the fight I loathe.</a>
<a id='line_10782'>    But one thing yet I ask of thee, held in no fateful yoke;</a>
<a id='line_10783'>    For Latium's sake I pray therefore, and glory of thy folk:           820</a>
<a id='line_10784'>    When they at last--so be it now!--pledge peace mid bridal kind,</a>
<a id='line_10785'>    When they at last join law to law, and loving treaty bind,</a>
<a id='line_10786'>    Let them not change their ancient name, those earth-born Latin men,</a>
<a id='line_10787'>    Nor turn them into Trojan folk, or call them Teucrians then:</a>
<a id='line_10788'>    Let not that manfolk shift their tongue, or cast their garb aside;</a>
<a id='line_10789'>    Let Latium and the Alban kings through many an age abide,</a>
<a id='line_10790'>    And cherish thou the Roman stem with worth of Italy:</a>
<a id='line_10791'>    Troy-town is dead: Troy and its name for ever let them die!"</a>
<a id='line_10792'></a>
<a id='line_10793'>    The Fashioner of men and things spake, smiling in her face:</a>
<a id='line_10794'>    "Yea, Jove's own sister; second branch forsooth, of Saturn's race!   830</a>
<a id='line_10795'>    Such are the mighty floods of wrath thou rollest in thy breast.</a>
<a id='line_10796'>    But this thine anger born for nought, I prithee let it rest:</a>
<a id='line_10797'>    I give thine asking; conquered now I yield me, and am glad:</a>
<a id='line_10798'>    The Ausonian men shall keep the tongue and ways their fathers had,</a>
<a id='line_10799'>    And as their name is shall it be: only in body blent</a>
<a id='line_10800'>    Amidst them shall the Teucrians sink; from me shall rites be sent,</a>
<a id='line_10801'>    And holy things, and they shall be all Latins of one tongue.</a>
<a id='line_10802'>    Hence shalt thou see a blended race from blood Ausonian sprung,</a>
<a id='line_10803'>    Whose godliness shall outgo men, outgo the Gods above;</a>
<a id='line_10804'>    Nor any folk of all the world so well thy worth shall love." 840</a>
<a id='line_10805'></a>
<a id='line_10806'>    So gladdened Juno's heart was turned, and yea-saying she bowed,</a>
<a id='line_10807'>    And so departed from the sky and left her watching-cloud.</a>
<a id='line_10808'></a>
<a id='line_10809'>    Another thing the Father now within him turneth o'er,</a>
<a id='line_10810'>    What wise Juturna he shall part from her lost brother's war:</a>
<a id='line_10811'>    Two horrors are there that are called the Dreadful Ones by name,</a>
<a id='line_10812'>    Whom with Megæra of the Pit at one birth and the same</a>
<a id='line_10813'>    Untimely Night brought forth of yore, and round about them twined</a>
<a id='line_10814'>    Like coils of serpents, giving them great wings to hold the wind:</a>
<a id='line_10815'>    About Jove's throne, and close anigh the Stern King's threshold-stead,</a>
<a id='line_10816'>    Do these attend, in sick-heart men to whet the mortal dread,         850</a>
<a id='line_10817'>    Whenso the King-God fashions forth fell death and dire disease,</a>
<a id='line_10818'>    Or smites the guilty cities doomed with battle miseries.</a>
<a id='line_10819'>    Now one of these sent Jupiter swift from the heavenly place,</a>
<a id='line_10820'>    And bade her for a sign of doom to cross Juturna's face.</a>
<a id='line_10821'>    So borne upon a whirl of wind to earth the swift one flies,</a>
<a id='line_10822'>    E'en as an arrow from the string is driven amid the skies,</a>
<a id='line_10823'>    Which headed with the venom fell a Parthian man hath shot,--</a>
<a id='line_10824'>    Parthian, Cydonian, it may be,--the hurt that healeth not;</a>
<a id='line_10825'>    Its hidden whirring sweepeth through the drifting misty flow:</a>
<a id='line_10826'>    So fared the Daughter of the Night, and sought the earth below.      860</a>
<a id='line_10827'></a>
<a id='line_10828'>    But when she saw the Ilian hosts and Turnus' battle-rank,</a>
<a id='line_10829'>    Then sudden into puny shape her body huge she shrank,</a>
<a id='line_10830'>    A fowl that sits on sepulchres, and desert roofs alone</a>
<a id='line_10831'>    In the dead night, and through the mirk singeth her ceaseless moan;</a>
<a id='line_10832'>    In such a shape this bane of men met Turnus' face in field,</a>
<a id='line_10833'>    And, screeching, hovered to and fro, and flapped upon his shield:</a>
<a id='line_10834'>    Strange heaviness his body seized, consuming him with dread,</a>
<a id='line_10835'>    His hair stood up, and in his jaws his voice lay hushed and dead.</a>
<a id='line_10836'></a>
<a id='line_10837'>    But when afar Juturna knew the Dread One's whirring wings,</a>
<a id='line_10838'>    The hapless sister tears her hair and loose its tresses flings,      870</a>
<a id='line_10839'>    Fouling her face with tearing nails, her breast with beat of hand.</a>
<a id='line_10840'></a>
<a id='line_10841'>    "How may my help, O Turnus, now beside my brother stand?</a>
<a id='line_10842'>    How may I harden me 'gainst this? by what craft shall I stay</a>
<a id='line_10843'>    Thy light of life? how cast myself in such a monster's way?</a>
<a id='line_10844'>    Now, now I leave the battle-field; fright not the filled with fear,</a>
<a id='line_10845'>    O birds of ill! full well I know your flapping wings in air,</a>
<a id='line_10846'>    And baneful sound. Thy mastering will I know it holdeth good,</a>
<a id='line_10847'>    O Jove the great!--was this the gift thou gav'st for maidenhood?</a>
<a id='line_10848'>    Why give me everlasting life, and death-doom take away?</a>
<a id='line_10849'>    O, but for that my sorrows sore now surely might I slay,             880</a>
<a id='line_10850'>    And wend beside my brother now amid the nether Night.</a>
<a id='line_10851'>    Am I undying? ah, can aught of all my good delight</a>
<a id='line_10852'>    Without thee, O my brother lost! O Earth, gape wide and well,</a>

<a id='line_10854'></a>
<a id='line_10855'>    So much she said, and wrapped her round with mantle dusky-grey,</a>
<a id='line_10856'>    And, groaning sore, she hid herself within the watery way.</a>
<a id='line_10857'></a>
<a id='line_10858'>    But forth Æneas goes, and high his spear he brandisheth,</a>
<a id='line_10859'>    A mighty tree, and from his heart grown fell a word he saith:</a>
<a id='line_10860'>    "And wherewith wilt thou tarry me? hangs Turnus back again?</a>
<a id='line_10861'>    No foot-strife but the armèd hand must doom betwixt us twain.        890</a>
<a id='line_10862'>    Yea, turn thyself to every shape, and, gathering everything</a>
<a id='line_10863'>    Wherewith thine heart, thy craft is strong, go soaring on the wing,</a>
<a id='line_10864'>    And chase the stars; or deep adown in hollow earth lie stored."</a>
<a id='line_10865'></a>
<a id='line_10866'>    But Turnus shakes his head and saith: "'Tis not thy bitter word</a>
<a id='line_10867'>    That frights me, fierce one; but the Gods, but Jove my foeman grown."</a>
<a id='line_10868'></a>
<a id='line_10869'>    No more he said, but, looking round, espied a weighty stone,</a>
<a id='line_10870'>    An ancient mighty rock indeed, that lay upon the lea,</a>
<a id='line_10871'>    Set for a landmark, judge and end of acre-strife to be,</a>
<a id='line_10872'>    Which scarce twice six of chosen men upon their backs might raise,</a>
<a id='line_10873'>    Of bodies such as earth brings forth amid the latter days:           900</a>
<a id='line_10874'>    But this in hurrying hand he caught, and rising to the cast,</a>
<a id='line_10875'>    He hurled it forth against the foe, and followed on it fast;</a>
<a id='line_10876'>    Yet while he raised the mighty stone, and flung it to its fall.</a>
<a id='line_10877'>    Knew nought that he was running there, or that he moved at all:</a>
<a id='line_10878'>    Totter his knees, his chilly blood freezes with deadly frost,</a>
<a id='line_10879'>    And e'en the hero-gathered stone, through desert distance tossed,</a>
<a id='line_10880'>    O'ercame not all the space betwixt, nor home its blow might bring:</a>
<a id='line_10881'>    E'en as in dreaming-tide of night, when sleep, the heavy thing,</a>
<a id='line_10882'>    Weighs on the eyes, and all for nought we seem so helpless-fain</a>
<a id='line_10883'>    Of eager speed, and faint and fail amidmost of the strain;           910</a>
<a id='line_10884'>    The tongue avails not; all our limbs of their familiar skill</a>
<a id='line_10885'>    Are cheated; neither voice nor words may follow from our will:</a>
<a id='line_10886'>    So Turnus, by whatever might he strives to win a way,</a>
<a id='line_10887'>    The Dread One bans his hope; strange thoughts about his heart-strings play;</a>
<a id='line_10888'>    He stareth on his Rutuli, and on the Latin town</a>
<a id='line_10889'>    Lingering for dread, trembling to meet the spear this instant thrown:</a>
<a id='line_10890'>    No road he hath to flee, no might against the foe to bear;</a>
<a id='line_10891'>    Nowhither may he see his car, or sister charioteer.</a>
<a id='line_10892'></a>
<a id='line_10893'>    Æneas, as he lingereth there, shaketh the fateful shaft,</a>
<a id='line_10894'>    And, following up its fate with eyes, afar the steel doth waft       920</a>
<a id='line_10895'>    With all the might his body hath: no stone the wall-sling bears</a>
<a id='line_10896'>    E'er roars so loud: no thunderclap with such a crashing tears</a>
<a id='line_10897'>    Amid the heaven: on flew the spear, huge as the whirlwind black,</a>
<a id='line_10898'>    And speeding on the dreadful death: it brings to utter wrack</a>
<a id='line_10899'>    The hauberk's skirt and outer rim of that seven-folded shield,</a>
<a id='line_10900'>    And goeth grating through the thigh: then falleth unto field</a>
<a id='line_10901'>    Huge Turnus, with his hampered knee twi-folded with the wound:</a>
<a id='line_10902'>    Then with a groan the Rutuli rise up, and all around</a>
<a id='line_10903'>    Roar back the hill-sides, and afar the groves cast back the cry:</a>
<a id='line_10904'>    But he, downcast and suppliant saith, with praying hand and eye:     930</a>
<a id='line_10905'></a>
<a id='line_10906'>    "Due doom it is; I pray no ruth; use what hath chanced to fall.</a>
<a id='line_10907'>    Yet, if a wretched father's woe may touch thine heart at all,</a>
<a id='line_10908'>    I pray thee--since Anchises once was even such to thee,--</a>
<a id='line_10909'>    Pity my father Daunus' eld, and send me, or, maybe,</a>
<a id='line_10910'>    My body stripped of light and life, back to my kin and land.</a>
<a id='line_10911'>    Thou, thou hast conquered: Italy has seen my craven hand</a>
<a id='line_10912'>    Stretched forth to pray a grace of thee; Lavinia is thy wife:</a>
<a id='line_10913'>    Strain not thine hatred further now!"</a>
<a id='line_10914'>                                          Fierce in the gear of strife</a>
<a id='line_10915'>    Æneas stood with rolling eyes, and held back hand and sword,         939</a>
<a id='line_10916'>    And more and more his wavering heart was softening 'neath the word--</a>
<a id='line_10917'>    When lo, upon the shoulder showed that hapless thong of war!</a>
<a id='line_10918'>    Lo, glittering with familiar boss the belt child Pallas bore,</a>
<a id='line_10919'>    Whom Turnus with a wound overcame and laid on earth alow,</a>
<a id='line_10920'>    And on his body bore thenceforth those ensigns of his foe.</a>
<a id='line_10921'></a>
<a id='line_10922'>    But he, when he awhile had glared upon that spoil of fight,</a>
<a id='line_10923'>    That monument of bitter grief, with utter wrath alight,</a>
<a id='line_10924'>    Cried terrible:</a>
<a id='line_10925'>                    "And shalt thou, clad in my beloved one's prey,</a>
<a id='line_10926'>    Be snatched from me?--Tis Pallas yet, 'tis Pallas thus doth slay,</a>
<a id='line_10927'>    And taketh of thy guilty blood atonement for his death!"</a>
<a id='line_10928'></a>
<a id='line_10929'>    Deep in that breast he driveth sword e'en as the word he saith:      950</a>
<a id='line_10930'>    But Turnus,--waxen cold and spent, the body of him lies,</a>
<a id='line_10931'>    And with a groan through dusk and dark the scornful spirit flies.</a>
<a id='line_10932'></a>
<a id='line_10933'></a>
<a id='line_10934'>THE END.</a>
