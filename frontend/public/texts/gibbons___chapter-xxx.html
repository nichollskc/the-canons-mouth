<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'>     Revolt Of The Goths.—They Plunder Greece.—Two Great Invasions Of</a>

<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>      If the subjects of Rome could be ignorant of their obligations to</a>
<a id='line_8'>      the great Theodosius, they were too soon convinced, how painfully</a>
<a id='line_9'>      the spirit and abilities of their deceased emperor had supported</a>
<a id='line_10'>      the frail and mouldering edifice of the republic. He died in the</a>
<a id='line_11'>      month of January; and before the end of the winter of the same</a>
<a id='line_12'>      year, the Gothic nation was in arms. 1 The Barbarian auxiliaries</a>
<a id='line_13'>      erected their independent standard; and boldly avowed the hostile</a>
<a id='line_14'>      designs, which they had long cherished in their ferocious minds.</a>
<a id='line_15'>      Their countrymen, who had been condemned, by the conditions of</a>
<a id='line_16'>      the last treaty, to a life of tranquility and labor, deserted</a>
<a id='line_17'>      their farms at the first sound of the trumpet; and eagerly</a>
<a id='line_18'>      resumed the weapons which they had reluctantly laid down. The</a>
<a id='line_19'>      barriers of the Danube were thrown open; the savage warriors of</a>
<a id='line_20'>      Scythia issued from their forests; and the uncommon severity of</a>
<a id='line_21'>      the winter allowed the poet to remark, “that they rolled their</a>
<a id='line_22'>      ponderous wagons over the broad and icy back of the indignant</a>
<a id='line_23'>      river.” 2 The unhappy natives of the provinces to the south of</a>
<a id='line_24'>      the Danube submitted to the calamities, which, in the course of</a>
<a id='line_25'>      twenty years, were almost grown familiar to their imagination;</a>
<a id='line_26'>      and the various troops of Barbarians, who gloried in the Gothic</a>
<a id='line_27'>      name, were irregularly spread from woody shores of Dalmatia, to</a>
<a id='line_28'>      the walls of Constantinople. 3 The interruption, or at least the</a>
<a id='line_29'>      diminution, of the subsidy, which the Goths had received from the</a>
<a id='line_30'>      prudent liberality of Theodosius, was the specious pretence of</a>
<a id='line_31'>      their revolt: the affront was imbittered by their contempt for</a>
<a id='line_32'>      the unwarlike sons of Theodosius; and their resentment was</a>
<a id='line_33'>      inflamed by the weakness, or treachery, of the minister of</a>
<a id='line_34'>      Arcadius. The frequent visits of Rufinus to the camp of the</a>
<a id='line_35'>      Barbarians whose arms and apparel he affected to imitate, were</a>
<a id='line_36'>      considered as a sufficient evidence of his guilty correspondence,</a>
<a id='line_37'>      and the public enemy, from a motive either of gratitude or of</a>
<a id='line_38'>      policy, was attentive, amidst the general devastation, to spare</a>
<a id='line_39'>      the private estates of the unpopular præfect. The Goths, instead</a>
<a id='line_40'>      of being impelled by the blind and headstrong passions of their</a>
<a id='line_41'>      chiefs, were now directed by the bold and artful genius of</a>
<a id='line_42'>      Alaric. That renowned leader was descended from the noble race of</a>
<a id='line_43'>      the Balti; 4 which yielded only to the royal dignity of the</a>
<a id='line_44'>      Amali: he had solicited the command of the Roman armies; and the</a>
<a id='line_45'>      Imperial court provoked him to demonstrate the folly of their</a>
<a id='line_46'>      refusal, and the importance of their loss. Whatever hopes might</a>
<a id='line_47'>      be entertained of the conquest of Constantinople, the judicious</a>
<a id='line_48'>      general soon abandoned an impracticable enterprise. In the midst</a>
<a id='line_49'>      of a divided court and a discontented people, the emperor</a>
<a id='line_50'>      Arcadius was terrified by the aspect of the Gothic arms; but the</a>
<a id='line_51'>      want of wisdom and valor was supplied by the strength of the</a>
<a id='line_52'>      city; and the fortifications, both of the sea and land, might</a>
<a id='line_53'>      securely brave the impotent and random darts of the Barbarians.</a>
<a id='line_54'>      Alaric disdained to trample any longer on the prostrate and</a>
<a id='line_55'>      ruined countries of Thrace and Dacia, and he resolved to seek a</a>
<a id='line_56'>      plentiful harvest of fame and riches in a province which had</a>
<a id='line_57'>      hitherto escaped the ravages of war. 5</a>

<a id='line_90'>      conquest of Greece: but the hints and allusion of Claudian are so</a>
<a id='line_91'>      many rays of historic light.]</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>      The character of the civil and military officers, on whom Rufinus</a>
<a id='line_94'>      had devolved the government of Greece, confirmed the public</a>
<a id='line_95'>      suspicion, that he had betrayed the ancient seat of freedom and</a>
<a id='line_96'>      learning to the Gothic invader. The proconsul Antiochus was the</a>
<a id='line_97'>      unworthy son of a respectable father; and Gerontius, who</a>
<a id='line_98'>      commanded the provincial troops, was much better qualified to</a>
<a id='line_99'>      execute the oppressive orders of a tyrant, than to defend, with</a>
<a id='line_100'>      courage and ability, a country most remarkably fortified by the</a>
<a id='line_101'>      hand of nature. Alaric had traversed, without resistance, the</a>
<a id='line_102'>      plains of Macedonia and Thessaly, as far as the foot of Mount</a>
<a id='line_103'>      Oeta, a steep and woody range of hills, almost impervious to his</a>
<a id='line_104'>      cavalry. They stretched from east to west, to the edge of the</a>
<a id='line_105'>      sea-shore; and left, between the precipice and the Malian Gulf,</a>
<a id='line_106'>      an interval of three hundred feet, which, in some places, was</a>
<a id='line_107'>      contracted to a road capable of admitting only a single carriage.</a>
<a id='line_108'>      6 In this narrow pass of Thermopylae, where Leonidas and the</a>
<a id='line_109'>      three hundred Spartans had gloriously devoted their lives, the</a>
<a id='line_110'>      Goths might have been stopped, or destroyed, by a skilful</a>
<a id='line_111'>      general; and perhaps the view of that sacred spot might have</a>
<a id='line_112'>      kindled some sparks of military ardor in the breasts of the</a>
<a id='line_113'>      degenerate Greeks. The troops which had been posted to defend the</a>
<a id='line_114'>      Straits of Thermopylae, retired, as they were directed, without</a>
<a id='line_115'>      attempting to disturb the secure and rapid passage of Alaric; 7</a>
<a id='line_116'>      and the fertile fields of Phocis and Boeotia were instantly</a>
<a id='line_117'>      covered by a deluge of Barbarians who massacred the males of an</a>
<a id='line_118'>      age to bear arms, and drove away the beautiful females, with the</a>
<a id='line_119'>      spoil and cattle of the flaming villages. The travellers, who</a>
<a id='line_120'>      visited Greece several years afterwards, could easily discover</a>
<a id='line_121'>      the deep and bloody traces of the march of the Goths; and Thebes</a>
<a id='line_122'>      was less indebted for her preservation to the strength of her</a>
<a id='line_123'>      seven gates, than to the eager haste of Alaric, who advanced to</a>
<a id='line_124'>      occupy the city of Athens, and the important harbor of the</a>
<a id='line_125'>      Piraeus. The same impatience urged him to prevent the delay and</a>
<a id='line_126'>      danger of a siege, by the offer of a capitulation; and as soon as</a>
<a id='line_127'>      the Athenians heard the voice of the Gothic herald, they were</a>
<a id='line_128'>      easily persuaded to deliver the greatest part of their wealth, as</a>
<a id='line_129'>      the ransom of the city of Minerva and its inhabitants. The treaty</a>
<a id='line_130'>      was ratified by solemn oaths, and observed with mutual fidelity.</a>
<a id='line_131'>      The Gothic prince, with a small and select train, was admitted</a>
<a id='line_132'>      within the walls; he indulged himself in the refreshment of the</a>
<a id='line_133'>      bath, accepted a splendid banquet, which was provided by the</a>
<a id='line_134'>      magistrate, and affected to show that he was not ignorant of the</a>
<a id='line_135'>      manners of civilized nations. 8 But the whole territory of</a>
<a id='line_136'>      Attica, from the promontory of Sunium to the town of Megara, was</a>
<a id='line_137'>      blasted by his baleful presence; and, if we may use the</a>
<a id='line_138'>      comparison of a contemporary philosopher, Athens itself resembled</a>
<a id='line_139'>      the bleeding and empty skin of a slaughtered victim. The distance</a>
<a id='line_140'>      between Megara and Corinth could not much exceed thirty miles;</a>
<a id='line_141'>      but the bad road, an expressive name, which it still bears among</a>
<a id='line_142'>      the Greeks, was, or might easily have been made, impassable for</a>
<a id='line_143'>      the march of an enemy. The thick and gloomy woods of Mount</a>
<a id='line_144'>      Cithaeron covered the inland country; the Scironian rocks</a>
<a id='line_145'>      approached the water’s edge, and hung over the narrow and winding</a>
<a id='line_146'>      path, which was confined above six miles along the sea-shore. 9</a>
<a id='line_147'>      The passage of those rocks, so infamous in every age, was</a>
<a id='line_148'>      terminated by the Isthmus of Corinth; and a small a body of firm</a>
<a id='line_149'>      and intrepid soldiers might have successfully defended a</a>
<a id='line_150'>      temporary intrenchment of five or six miles from the Ionian to</a>
<a id='line_151'>      the Aegean Sea. The confidence of the cities of Peloponnesus in</a>
<a id='line_152'>      their natural rampart, had tempted them to neglect the care of</a>
<a id='line_153'>      their antique walls; and the avarice of the Roman governors had</a>
<a id='line_154'>      exhausted and betrayed the unhappy province. 10 Corinth, Argos,</a>
<a id='line_155'>      Sparta, yielded without resistance to the arms of the Goths; and</a>
<a id='line_156'>      the most fortunate of the inhabitants were saved, by death, from</a>
<a id='line_157'>      beholding the slavery of their families and the conflagration of</a>
<a id='line_158'>      their cities. 11 The vases and statues were distributed among the</a>
<a id='line_159'>      Barbarians, with more regard to the value of the materials, than</a>
<a id='line_160'>      to the elegance of the workmanship; the female captives submitted</a>
<a id='line_161'>      to the laws of war; the enjoyment of beauty was the reward of</a>
<a id='line_162'>      valor; and the Greeks could not reasonably complain of an abuse</a>
<a id='line_163'>      which was justified by the example of the heroic times. 12 The</a>
<a id='line_164'>      descendants of that extraordinary people, who had considered</a>
<a id='line_165'>      valor and discipline as the walls of Sparta, no longer remembered</a>
<a id='line_166'>      the generous reply of their ancestors to an invader more</a>
<a id='line_167'>      formidable than Alaric. “If thou art a god, thou wilt not hurt</a>
<a id='line_168'>      those who have never injured thee; if thou art a man,</a>
<a id='line_169'>      advance:—and thou wilt find men equal to thyself.” 13 From</a>
<a id='line_170'>      Thermopylae to Sparta, the leader of the Goths pursued his</a>
<a id='line_171'>      victorious march without encountering any mortal antagonists: but</a>
<a id='line_172'>      one of the advocates of expiring Paganism has confidently</a>
<a id='line_173'>      asserted, that the walls of Athens were guarded by the goddess</a>
<a id='line_174'>      Minerva, with her formidable Aegis, and by the angry phantom of</a>
<a id='line_175'>      Achilles; 14 and that the conqueror was dismayed by the presence</a>
<a id='line_176'>      of the hostile deities of Greece. In an age of miracles, it would</a>
<a id='line_177'>      perhaps be unjust to dispute the claim of the historian Zosimus</a>
<a id='line_178'>      to the common benefit: yet it cannot be dissembled, that the mind</a>
<a id='line_179'>      of Alaric was ill prepared to receive, either in sleeping or</a>
<a id='line_180'>      waking visions, the impressions of Greek superstition. The songs</a>
<a id='line_181'>      of Homer, and the fame of Achilles, had probably never reached</a>
<a id='line_182'>      the ear of the illiterate Barbarian; and the Christian faith,</a>
<a id='line_183'>      which he had devoutly embraced, taught him to despise the</a>
<a id='line_184'>      imaginary deities of Rome and Athens. The invasion of the Goths,</a>
<a id='line_185'>      instead of vindicating the honor, contributed, at least</a>
<a id='line_186'>      accidentally, to extirpate the last remains of Paganism: and the</a>
<a id='line_187'>      mysteries of Ceres, which had subsisted eighteen hundred years,</a>
<a id='line_188'>      did not survive the destruction of Eleusis, and the calamities of</a>

<a id='line_255'>      Greece. 16 A numerous fleet was equipped in the ports of Italy;</a>
<a id='line_256'>      and the troops, after a short and prosperous navigation over the</a>
<a id='line_257'>      Ionian Sea, were safely disembarked on the isthmus, near the</a>
<a id='line_258'>      ruins of Corinth. The woody and mountainous country of Arcadia,</a>
<a id='line_259'>      the fabulous residence of Pan and the Dryads, became the scene of</a>
<a id='line_260'>      a long and doubtful conflict between the two generals not</a>
<a id='line_261'>      unworthy of each other. The skill and perseverance of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_262'>      at length prevailed; and the Goths, after sustaining a</a>
<a id='line_263'>      considerable loss from disease and desertion, gradually retreated</a>
<a id='line_264'>      to the lofty mountain of Pholoe, near the sources of the Peneus,</a>
<a id='line_265'>      and on the frontiers of Elis; a sacred country, which had</a>
<a id='line_266'>      formerly been exempted from the calamities of war. 17 The camp of</a>
<a id='line_267'>      the Barbarians was immediately besieged; the waters of the river</a>
<a id='line_268'>      18 were diverted into another channel; and while they labored</a>
<a id='line_269'>      under the intolerable pressure of thirst and hunger, a strong</a>
<a id='line_270'>      line of circumvallation was formed to prevent their escape. After</a>
<a id='line_271'>      these precautions, Stilicho, too confident of victory, retired to</a>
<a id='line_272'>      enjoy his triumph, in the theatrical games, and lascivious</a>
<a id='line_273'>      dances, of the Greeks; his soldiers, deserting their standards,</a>
<a id='line_274'>      spread themselves over the country of their allies, which they</a>
<a id='line_275'>      stripped of all that had been saved from the rapacious hands of</a>
<a id='line_276'>      the enemy. Alaric appears to have seized the favorable moment to</a>
<a id='line_277'>      execute one of those hardy enterprises, in which the abilities of</a>
<a id='line_278'>      a general are displayed with more genuine lustre, than in the</a>
<a id='line_279'>      tumult of a day of battle. To extricate himself from the prison</a>
<a id='line_280'>      of Peloponnesus, it was necessary that he should pierce the</a>
<a id='line_281'>      intrenchments which surrounded his camp; that he should perform a</a>
<a id='line_282'>      difficult and dangerous march of thirty miles, as far as the Gulf</a>
<a id='line_283'>      of Corinth; and that he should transport his troops, his</a>
<a id='line_284'>      captives, and his spoil, over an arm of the sea, which, in the</a>
<a id='line_285'>      narrow interval between Rhium and the opposite shore, is at least</a>
<a id='line_286'>      half a mile in breadth. 19 The operations of Alaric must have</a>
<a id='line_287'>      been secret, prudent, and rapid; since the Roman general was</a>
<a id='line_288'>      confounded by the intelligence, that the Goths, who had eluded</a>
<a id='line_289'>      his efforts, were in full possession of the important province of</a>
<a id='line_290'>      Epirus. This unfortunate delay allowed Alaric sufficient time to</a>
<a id='line_291'>      conclude the treaty, which he secretly negotiated, with the</a>
<a id='line_292'>      ministers of Constantinople. The apprehension of a civil war</a>
<a id='line_293'>      compelled Stilicho to retire, at the haughty mandate of his</a>
<a id='line_294'>      rivals, from the dominions of Arcadius; and he respected, in the</a>

<a id='line_334'>      military service. The citizens and subjects had purchased an</a>
<a id='line_335'>      exemption from the indispensable duty of defending their country;</a>
<a id='line_336'>      which was supported by the arms of Barbarian mercenaries. The</a>
<a id='line_337'>      fugitives of Scythia were permitted to disgrace the illustrious</a>
<a id='line_338'>      dignities of the empire; their ferocious youth, who disdained the</a>
<a id='line_339'>      salutary restraint of laws, were more anxious to acquire the</a>
<a id='line_340'>      riches, than to imitate the arts, of a people, the object of</a>

<a id='line_345'>      exhorts the emperor to revive the courage of his subjects, by the</a>
<a id='line_346'>      example of manly virtue; to banish luxury from the court and from</a>

<a id='line_348'>      mercenaries, an army of men, interested in the defence of their</a>
<a id='line_349'>      laws and of their property; to force, in such a moment of public</a>

<a id='line_359'>      servitude, which the Lacedaemonians formerly imposed on the</a>
<a id='line_360'>      captive Helots. 21 The court of Arcadius indulged the zeal,</a>

<a id='line_368'>      visionary, every proposal, which exceeded the measure of their</a>

<a id='line_370'>      While the oration of Synesius, and the downfall of the</a>
<a id='line_371'>      Barbarians, were the topics of popular conversation, an edict was</a>
<a id='line_372'>      published at Constantinople, which declared the promotion of</a>
<a id='line_373'>      Alaric to the rank of master-general of the Eastern Illyricum.</a>
<a id='line_374'>      The Roman provincials, and the allies, who had respected the</a>
<a id='line_375'>      faith of treaties, were justly indignant, that the ruin of Greece</a>
<a id='line_376'>      and Epirus should be so liberally rewarded. The Gothic conqueror</a>
<a id='line_377'>      was received as a lawful magistrate, in the cities which he had</a>
<a id='line_378'>      so lately besieged. The fathers, whose sons he had massacred, the</a>
<a id='line_379'>      husbands, whose wives he had violated, were subject to his</a>
<a id='line_380'>      authority; and the success of his rebellion encouraged the</a>
<a id='line_381'>      ambition of every leader of the foreign mercenaries. The use to</a>
<a id='line_382'>      which Alaric applied his new command, distinguishes the firm and</a>
<a id='line_383'>      judicious character of his policy. He issued his orders to the</a>
<a id='line_384'>      four magazines and manufactures of offensive and defensive arms,</a>
<a id='line_385'>      Margus, Ratiaria, Naissus, and Thessalonica, to provide his</a>
<a id='line_386'>      troops with an extraordinary supply of shields, helmets, swords,</a>
<a id='line_387'>      and spears; the unhappy provincials were compelled to forge the</a>
<a id='line_388'>      instruments of their own destruction; and the Barbarians removed</a>
<a id='line_389'>      the only defect which had sometimes disappointed the efforts of</a>
<a id='line_390'>      their courage. 22 The birth of Alaric, the glory of his past</a>
<a id='line_391'>      exploits, and the confidence in his future designs, insensibly</a>
<a id='line_392'>      united the body of the nation under his victorious standard; and,</a>
<a id='line_393'>      with the unanimous consent of the Barbarian chieftains, the</a>

<a id='line_395'>      custom, on a shield, and solemnly proclaimed king of the</a>
<a id='line_396'>      Visigoths. 23 Armed with this double power, seated on the verge</a>
<a id='line_397'>      of the two empires, he alternately sold his deceitful promises to</a>

<a id='line_564'>      resource of new levies was slow and precarious, the general of</a>

<a id='line_618'>      When Stilicho seemed to abandon his sovereign in the unguarded</a>
<a id='line_619'>      palace of Milan, he had probably calculated the term of his</a>
<a id='line_620'>      absence, the distance of the enemy, and the obstacles that might</a>
<a id='line_621'>      retard their march. He principally depended on the rivers of</a>
<a id='line_622'>      Italy, the Adige, the Mincius, the Oglio, and the Addua, which,</a>
<a id='line_623'>      in the winter or spring, by the fall of rains, or by the melting</a>
<a id='line_624'>      of the snows, are commonly swelled into broad and impetuous</a>
<a id='line_625'>      torrents. 37 But the season happened to be remarkably dry: and</a>
<a id='line_626'>      the Goths could traverse, without impediment, the wide and stony</a>
<a id='line_627'>      beds, whose centre was faintly marked by the course of a shallow</a>
<a id='line_628'>      stream. The bridge and passage of the Addua were secured by a</a>
<a id='line_629'>      strong detachment of the Gothic army; and as Alaric approached</a>
<a id='line_630'>      the walls, or rather the suburbs, of Milan, he enjoyed the proud</a>
<a id='line_631'>      satisfaction of seeing the emperor of the Romans fly before him.</a>
<a id='line_632'>      Honorius, accompanied by a feeble train of statesmen and eunuchs,</a>
<a id='line_633'>      hastily retreated towards the Alps, with a design of securing his</a>
<a id='line_634'>      person in the city of Arles, which had often been the royal</a>
<a id='line_635'>      residence of his predecessors. 3711 But Honorius 38 had scarcely</a>
<a id='line_636'>      passed the Po, before he was overtaken by the speed of the Gothic</a>
<a id='line_637'>      cavalry; 39 since the urgency of the danger compelled him to seek</a>
<a id='line_638'>      a temporary shelter within the fortifications of Asta, a town of</a>
<a id='line_639'>      Liguria or Piemont, situate on the banks of the Tanarus. 40 The</a>
<a id='line_640'>      siege of an obscure place, which contained so rich a prize, and</a>
<a id='line_641'>      seemed incapable of a long resistance, was instantly formed, and</a>
<a id='line_642'>      indefatigably pressed, by the king of the Goths; and the bold</a>
<a id='line_643'>      declaration, which the emperor might afterwards make, that his</a>
<a id='line_644'>      breast had never been susceptible of fear, did not probably</a>
<a id='line_645'>      obtain much credit, even in his own court. 41 In the last, and</a>
<a id='line_646'>      almost hopeless extremity, after the Barbarians had already</a>
<a id='line_647'>      proposed the indignity of a capitulation, the Imperial captive</a>
<a id='line_648'>      was suddenly relieved by the fame, the approach, and at length</a>
<a id='line_649'>      the presence, of the hero, whom he had so long expected. At the</a>
<a id='line_650'>      head of a chosen and intrepid vanguard, Stilicho swam the stream</a>
<a id='line_651'>      of the Addua, to gain the time which he must have lost in the</a>
<a id='line_652'>      attack of the bridge; the passage of the Po was an enterprise of</a>
<a id='line_653'>      much less hazard and difficulty; and the successful action, in</a>
<a id='line_654'>      which he cut his way through the Gothic camp under the walls of</a>
<a id='line_655'>      Asta, revived the hopes, and vindicated the honor, of Rome.</a>
<a id='line_656'>      Instead of grasping the fruit of his victory, the Barbarian was</a>
<a id='line_657'>      gradually invested, on every side, by the troops of the West, who</a>
<a id='line_658'>      successively issued through all the passes of the Alps; his</a>
<a id='line_659'>      quarters were straitened; his convoys were intercepted; and the</a>
<a id='line_660'>      vigilance of the Romans prepared to form a chain of</a>
<a id='line_661'>      fortifications, and to besiege the lines of the besiegers. A</a>
<a id='line_662'>      military council was assembled of the long-haired chiefs of the</a>
<a id='line_663'>      Gothic nation; of aged warriors, whose bodies were wrapped in</a>

<a id='line_666'>      against the advantage of securing their plunder; and they</a>

<a id='line_819'>      to the chance of another battle, he proposed to purchase the</a>

<a id='line_821'>      rejected such terms, the permission of a retreat, and the offer</a>
<a id='line_822'>      of a pension, with contempt and indignation; but he exercised a</a>

<a id='line_824'>      who had raised him, for their service, above the rank of his</a>

<a id='line_834'>      were formed in the camp and council of Alaric. The king of the</a>
<a id='line_835'>      Goths, ambitious to signalize his retreat by some splendid</a>
<a id='line_836'>      achievement, had resolved to occupy the important city of Verona,</a>
<a id='line_837'>      which commands the principal passage of the Rhaetian Alps; and,</a>
<a id='line_838'>      directing his march through the territories of those German</a>
<a id='line_839'>      tribes, whose alliance would restore his exhausted strength, to</a>
<a id='line_840'>      invade, on the side of the Rhine, the wealthy and unsuspecting</a>
<a id='line_841'>      provinces of Gaul. Ignorant of the treason which had already</a>
<a id='line_842'>      betrayed his bold and judicious enterprise, he advanced towards</a>
<a id='line_843'>      the passes of the mountains, already possessed by the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_844'>      troops; where he was exposed, almost at the same instant, to a</a>
<a id='line_845'>      general attack in the front, on his flanks, and in the rear. In</a>
<a id='line_846'>      this bloody action, at a small distance from the walls of Verona,</a>
<a id='line_847'>      the loss of the Goths was not less heavy than that which they had</a>
<a id='line_848'>      sustained in the defeat of Pollentia; and their valiant king, who</a>

<a id='line_850'>      slain or made prisoner, if the hasty rashness of the Alani had</a>
<a id='line_851'>      not disappointed the measures of the Roman general. Alaric</a>

<a id='line_1020'>      quarters of Ravenna gradually contributed to form one of the most</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      important cities of Italy. The principal canal of Augustus poured</a>
<a id='line_1022'>      a copious stream of the waters of the Po through the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_1023'>      city, to the entrance of the harbor; the same waters were</a>
<a id='line_1024'>      introduced into the profound ditches that encompassed the walls;</a>
<a id='line_1025'>      they were distributed by a thousand subordinate canals, into</a>
<a id='line_1026'>      every part of the city, which they divided into a variety of</a>
<a id='line_1027'>      small islands; the communication was maintained only by the use</a>
<a id='line_1028'>      of boats and bridges; and the houses of Ravenna, whose appearance</a>
<a id='line_1029'>      may be compared to that of Venice, were raised on the foundation</a>
<a id='line_1030'>      of wooden piles. The adjacent country, to the distance of many</a>
<a id='line_1031'>      miles, was a deep and impassable morass; and the artificial</a>
<a id='line_1032'>      causeway, which connected Ravenna with the continent, might be</a>
<a id='line_1033'>      easily guarded or destroyed, on the approach of a hostile army</a>
<a id='line_1034'>      These morasses were interspersed, however, with vineyards: and</a>
<a id='line_1035'>      though the soil was exhausted by four or five crops, the town</a>
<a id='line_1036'>      enjoyed a more plentiful supply of wine than of fresh water. 61</a>
<a id='line_1037'>      The air, instead of receiving the sickly, and almost</a>
<a id='line_1038'>      pestilential, exhalations of low and marshy grounds, was</a>
<a id='line_1039'>      distinguished, like the neighborhood of Alexandria, as uncommonly</a>
<a id='line_1040'>      pure and salubrious; and this singular advantage was ascribed to</a>
<a id='line_1041'>      the regular tides of the Adriatic, which swept the canals,</a>
<a id='line_1042'>      interrupted the unwholesome stagnation of the waters, and</a>
<a id='line_1043'>      floated, every day, the vessels of the adjacent country into the</a>
<a id='line_1044'>      heart of Ravenna. The gradual retreat of the sea has left the</a>
<a id='line_1045'>      modern city at the distance of four miles from the Adriatic; and</a>
<a id='line_1046'>      as early as the fifth or sixth century of the Christian era, the</a>
<a id='line_1047'>      port of Augustus was converted into pleasant orchards; and a</a>
<a id='line_1048'>      lonely grove of pines covered the ground where the Roman fleet</a>
<a id='line_1049'>      once rode at anchor. 62 Even this alteration contributed to</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      increase the natural strength of the place, and the shallowness</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      of the water was a sufficient barrier against the large ships of</a>
<a id='line_1052'>      the enemy. This advantageous situation was fortified by art and</a>
<a id='line_1053'>      labor; and in the twentieth year of his age, the emperor of the</a>
<a id='line_1054'>      West, anxious only for his personal safety, retired to the</a>
<a id='line_1055'>      perpetual confinement of the walls and morasses of Ravenna. The</a>
<a id='line_1056'>      example of Honorius was imitated by his feeble successors, the</a>

<a id='line_1096'>      may be usefully applied to reveal the secret and remote causes of</a>

<a id='line_1102'>      they acquired a more solid consistence, and a more formidable</a>
<a id='line_1103'>      power. The Topa soon compelled the pastoral nations of the</a>
<a id='line_1104'>      eastern desert to acknowledge the superiority of their arms; they</a>
<a id='line_1105'>      invaded China in a period of weakness and intestine discord; and</a>
<a id='line_1106'>      these fortunate Tartars, adopting the laws and manners of the</a>

<a id='line_1108'>      near one hundred and sixty years over the northern provinces of</a>
<a id='line_1109'>      the monarchy. Some generations before they ascended the throne of</a>
<a id='line_1110'>      China, one of the Topa princes had enlisted in his cavalry a</a>
<a id='line_1111'>      slave of the name of Moko, renowned for his valor, but who was</a>
<a id='line_1112'>      tempted, by the fear of punishment, to desert his standard, and</a>
<a id='line_1113'>      to range the desert at the head of a hundred followers. This gang</a>
<a id='line_1114'>      of robbers and outlaws swelled into a camp, a tribe, a numerous</a>
<a id='line_1115'>      people, distinguished by the appellation of Geougen; and their</a>
<a id='line_1116'>      hereditary chieftains, the posterity of Moko the slave, assumed</a>

<a id='line_1119'>      which are the school of heroes. He bravely struggled with</a>
<a id='line_1120'>      adversity, broke the imperious yoke of the Topa, and became the</a>
<a id='line_1121'>      legislator of his nation, and the conqueror of Tartary. His</a>
<a id='line_1122'>      troops were distributed into regular bands of a hundred and of a</a>

<a id='line_1159'>      haughty Rhodogast, or Radagaisus, 67 marched from the northern</a>
<a id='line_1160'>      extremities of Germany almost to the gates of Rome, and left the</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      remains of his army to achieve the destruction of the West. The</a>
<a id='line_1162'>      Vandals, the Suevi, and the Burgundians, formed the strength of</a>
<a id='line_1163'>      this mighty host; but the Alani, who had found a hospitable</a>

<a id='line_1165'>      heavy infantry of the Germans; and the Gothic adventurers crowded</a>
<a id='line_1166'>      so eagerly to the standard of Radagaisus, that by some</a>

<a id='line_1168'>      thousand warriors, distinguished above the vulgar by their noble</a>

<a id='line_1267'>      Italy were pillaged, or destroyed; and the siege of Florence, 74</a>
<a id='line_1268'>      by Radagaisus, is one of the earliest events in the history of</a>
<a id='line_1269'>      that celebrated republic; whose firmness checked and delayed the</a>
<a id='line_1270'>      unskillful fury of the Barbarians. The senate and people trembled</a>
<a id='line_1271'>      at their approach within a hundred and eighty miles of Rome; and</a>
<a id='line_1272'>      anxiously compared the danger which they had escaped, with the</a>
<a id='line_1273'>      new perils to which they were exposed. Alaric was a Christian and</a>
<a id='line_1274'>      a soldier, the leader of a disciplined army; who understood the</a>
<a id='line_1275'>      laws of war, who respected the sanctity of treaties, and who had</a>
<a id='line_1276'>      familiarly conversed with the subjects of the empire in the same</a>
<a id='line_1277'>      camps, and the same churches. The savage Radagaisus was a</a>
<a id='line_1278'>      stranger to the manners, the religion, and even the language, of</a>
<a id='line_1279'>      the civilized nations of the South. The fierceness of his temper</a>
<a id='line_1280'>      was exasperated by cruel superstition; and it was universally</a>
<a id='line_1281'>      believed, that he had bound himself, by a solemn vow, to reduce</a>

<a id='line_1284'>      gods who were appeased by human blood. The public danger, which</a>
<a id='line_1285'>      should have reconciled all domestic animosities, displayed the</a>
<a id='line_1286'>      incurable madness of religious faction. The oppressed votaries of</a>

<a id='line_1361'>      Orosius is consistent with the state of the war, and the</a>
<a id='line_1362'>      character of Stilicho. Conscious that he commanded the last army</a>
<a id='line_1363'>      of the republic, his prudence would not expose it, in the open</a>
<a id='line_1364'>      field, to the headstrong fury of the Germans. The method of</a>
<a id='line_1365'>      surrounding the enemy with strong lines of circumvallation, which</a>
<a id='line_1366'>      he had twice employed against the Gothic king, was repeated on a</a>
<a id='line_1367'>      larger scale, and with more considerable effect. The examples of</a>
<a id='line_1368'>      Caesar must have been familiar to the most illiterate of the</a>
<a id='line_1369'>      Roman warriors; and the fortifications of Dyrrachium, which</a>
<a id='line_1370'>      connected twenty-four castles, by a perpetual ditch and rampart</a>
<a id='line_1371'>      of fifteen miles, afforded the model of an intrenchment which</a>
<a id='line_1372'>      might confine, and starve, the most numerous host of Barbarians.</a>
<a id='line_1373'>      78 The Roman troops had less degenerated from the industry, than</a>
<a id='line_1374'>      from the valor, of their ancestors; and if their servile and</a>
<a id='line_1375'>      laborious work offended the pride of the soldiers, Tuscany could</a>
<a id='line_1376'>      supply many thousand peasants, who would labor, though, perhaps,</a>
<a id='line_1377'>      they would not fight, for the salvation of their native country.</a>
<a id='line_1378'>      The imprisoned multitude of horses and men 79 was gradually</a>
<a id='line_1379'>      destroyed, by famine rather than by the sword; but the Romans</a>
<a id='line_1380'>      were exposed, during the progress of such an extensive work, to</a>
<a id='line_1381'>      the frequent attacks of an impatient enemy. The despair of the</a>
<a id='line_1382'>      hungry Barbarians would precipitate them against the</a>
<a id='line_1383'>      fortifications of Stilicho; the general might sometimes indulge</a>
<a id='line_1384'>      the ardor of his brave auxiliaries, who eagerly pressed to</a>
<a id='line_1385'>      assault the camp of the Germans; and these various incidents</a>
<a id='line_1386'>      might produce the sharp and bloody conflicts which dignify the</a>
<a id='line_1387'>      narrative of Zosimus, and the Chronicles of Prosper and</a>
<a id='line_1388'>      Marcellinus. 80 A seasonable supply of men and provisions had</a>
<a id='line_1389'>      been introduced into the walls of Florence, and the famished host</a>
<a id='line_1390'>      of Radagaisus was in its turn besieged. The proud monarch of so</a>
<a id='line_1391'>      many warlike nations, after the loss of his bravest warriors, was</a>
<a id='line_1392'>      reduced to confide either in the faith of a capitulation, or in</a>
<a id='line_1393'>      the clemency of Stilicho. 81 But the death of the royal captive,</a>
<a id='line_1394'>      who was ignominiously beheaded, disgraced the triumph of Rome and</a>
<a id='line_1395'>      of Christianity; and the short delay of his execution was</a>
<a id='line_1396'>      sufficient to brand the conqueror with the guilt of cool and</a>
<a id='line_1397'>      deliberate cruelty. 82 The famished Germans, who escaped the fury</a>
<a id='line_1398'>      of the auxiliaries, were sold as slaves, at the contemptible</a>
<a id='line_1399'>      price of as many single pieces of gold; but the difference of</a>

<a id='line_1606'>      soon became the serious employment of the Latin clergy, the</a>

<a id='line_1613'>      the feeble, the guiltless, the infant portion of the human</a>
<a id='line_1614'>      species. These idle disputants overlooked the invariable laws of</a>
<a id='line_1615'>      nature, which have connected peace with innocence, plenty with</a>
<a id='line_1616'>      industry, and safety with valor. The timid and selfish policy of</a>
<a id='line_1617'>      the court of Ravenna might recall the Palatine legions for the</a>

<a id='line_1623'>      the defence of their houses, their families, and their altars, if</a>

<a id='line_1672'>      from her incessant enemies of the ocean, the mountains, and the</a>
<a id='line_1673'>      Irish coast. 94 But those restless Barbarians could not neglect</a>
<a id='line_1674'>      the fair opportunity of the Gothic war, when the walls and</a>
<a id='line_1675'>      stations of the province were stripped of the Roman troops. If</a>
<a id='line_1676'>      any of the legionaries were permitted to return from the Italian</a>

<a id='line_1678'>      Honorius must have tended to dissolve the bonds of allegiance,</a>
<a id='line_1679'>      and to exasperate the seditious temper of the British army. The</a>
<a id='line_1680'>      spirit of revolt, which had formerly disturbed the age of</a>
<a id='line_1681'>      Gallienus, was revived by the capricious violence of the</a>
<a id='line_1682'>      soldiers; and the unfortunate, perhaps the ambitious, candidates,</a>
<a id='line_1683'>      who were the objects of their choice, were the instruments, and</a>
<a id='line_1684'>      at length the victims, of their passion. 95 Marcus was the first</a>
<a id='line_1685'>      whom they placed on the throne, as the lawful emperor of Britain</a>
<a id='line_1686'>      and of the West. They violated, by the hasty murder of Marcus,</a>
<a id='line_1687'>      the oath of fidelity which they had imposed on themselves; and</a>
<a id='line_1688'>      their disapprobation of his manners may seem to inscribe an</a>
<a id='line_1689'>      honorable epitaph on his tomb. Gratian was the next whom they</a>
<a id='line_1690'>      adorned with the diadem and the purple; and, at the end of four</a>
<a id='line_1691'>      months, Gratian experienced the fate of his predecessor. The</a>
<a id='line_1692'>      memory of the great Constantine, whom the British legions had</a>
<a id='line_1693'>      given to the church and to the empire, suggested the singular</a>
<a id='line_1694'>      motive of their third choice. They discovered in the ranks a</a>
<a id='line_1695'>      private soldier of the name of Constantine, and their impetuous</a>
<a id='line_1696'>      levity had already seated him on the throne, before they</a>
<a id='line_1697'>      perceived his incapacity to sustain the weight of that glorious</a>
<a id='line_1698'>      appellation. 96 Yet the authority of Constantine was less</a>
<a id='line_1699'>      precarious, and his government was more successful, than the</a>
<a id='line_1700'>      transient reigns of Marcus and of Gratian. The danger of leaving</a>
<a id='line_1701'>      his inactive troops in those camps, which had been twice polluted</a>
<a id='line_1702'>      with blood and sedition, urged him to attempt the reduction of</a>
<a id='line_1703'>      the Western provinces. He landed at Boulogne with an</a>
<a id='line_1704'>      inconsiderable force; and after he had reposed himself some days,</a>
<a id='line_1705'>      he summoned the cities of Gaul, which had escaped the yoke of the</a>
<a id='line_1706'>      Barbarians, to acknowledge their lawful sovereign. They obeyed</a>
<a id='line_1707'>      the summons without reluctance. The neglect of the court of</a>
<a id='line_1708'>      Ravenna had absolved a deserted people from the duty of</a>
<a id='line_1709'>      allegiance; their actual distress encouraged them to accept any</a>
<a id='line_1710'>      circumstances of change, without apprehension, and, perhaps, with</a>
<a id='line_1711'>      some degree of hope; and they might flatter themselves, that the</a>
<a id='line_1712'>      troops, the authority, and even the name of a Roman emperor, who</a>
<a id='line_1713'>      fixed his residence in Gaul, would protect the unhappy country</a>
<a id='line_1714'>      from the rage of the Barbarians. The first successes of</a>
<a id='line_1715'>      Constantine against the detached parties of the Germans, were</a>
<a id='line_1716'>      magnified by the voice of adulation into splendid and decisive</a>
<a id='line_1717'>      victories; which the reunion and insolence of the enemy soon</a>
<a id='line_1718'>      reduced to their just value. His negotiations procured a short</a>
<a id='line_1719'>      and precarious truce; and if some tribes of the Barbarians were</a>
<a id='line_1720'>      engaged, by the liberality of his gifts and promises, to</a>
<a id='line_1721'>      undertake the defence of the Rhine, these expensive and uncertain</a>
<a id='line_1722'>      treaties, instead of restoring the pristine vigor of the Gallic</a>
<a id='line_1723'>      frontier, served only to disgrace the majesty of the prince, and</a>
<a id='line_1724'>      to exhaust what yet remained of the treasures of the republic.</a>
<a id='line_1725'>      Elated, however, with this imaginary triumph, the vain deliverer</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      of Gaul advanced into the provinces of the South, to encounter a</a>

<a id='line_1728'>      lay the head of the rebel at the feet of the emperor Honorius;</a>
<a id='line_1729'>      and the forces of Britain and Italy were unworthily consumed in</a>

<a id='line_1776'>      On the side of the Pyrenees, the ambition of Constantine might be</a>
<a id='line_1777'>      justified by the proximity of danger; but his throne was soon</a>
<a id='line_1778'>      established by the conquest, or rather submission, of Spain;</a>
<a id='line_1779'>      which yielded to the influence of regular and habitual</a>
<a id='line_1780'>      subordination, and received the laws and magistrates of the</a>
<a id='line_1781'>      Gallic præfecture. The only opposition which was made to the</a>
<a id='line_1782'>      authority of Constantine proceeded not so much from the powers of</a>
<a id='line_1783'>      government, or the spirit of the people, as from the private zeal</a>
<a id='line_1784'>      and interest of the family of Theodosius. Four brothers 98 had</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      obtained, by the favor of their kinsman, the deceased emperor, an</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      honorable rank and ample possessions in their native country; and</a>
<a id='line_1787'>      the grateful youths resolved to risk those advantages in the</a>
<a id='line_1788'>      service of his son. After an unsuccessful effort to maintain</a>
<a id='line_1789'>      their ground at the head of the stationary troops of Lusitania,</a>
<a id='line_1790'>      they retired to their estates; where they armed and levied, at</a>
<a id='line_1791'>      their own expense, a considerable body of slaves and dependants,</a>
<a id='line_1792'>      and boldly marched to occupy the strong posts of the Pyrenean</a>
<a id='line_1793'>      Mountains. This domestic insurrection alarmed and perplexed the</a>
<a id='line_1794'>      sovereign of Gaul and Britain; and he was compelled to negotiate</a>
<a id='line_1795'>      with some troops of Barbarian auxiliaries, for the service of the</a>
<a id='line_1796'>      Spanish war. They were distinguished by the title of Honorians;</a>
<a id='line_1797'>      99 a name which might have reminded them of their fidelity to</a>

<a id='line_1800'>      prince, the Moors and the Marcomanni could be tempted only by the</a>
<a id='line_1801'>      profuse liberality of the usurper, who distributed among the</a>
<a id='line_1802'>      Barbarians the military, and even the civil, honors of Spain. The</a>
<a id='line_1803'>      nine bands of Honorians, which may be easily traced on the</a>
<a id='line_1804'>      establishment of the Western empire, could not exceed the number</a>
<a id='line_1805'>      of five thousand men: yet this inconsiderable force was</a>
<a id='line_1806'>      sufficient to terminate a war, which had threatened the power and</a>
<a id='line_1807'>      safety of Constantine. The rustic army of the Theodosian family</a>
<a id='line_1808'>      was surrounded and destroyed in the Pyrenees: two of the brothers</a>
<a id='line_1809'>      had the good fortune to escape by sea to Italy, or the East; the</a>
<a id='line_1810'>      other two, after an interval of suspense, were executed at Arles;</a>
<a id='line_1811'>      and if Honorius could remain insensible of the public disgrace,</a>
<a id='line_1812'>      he might perhaps be affected by the personal misfortunes of his</a>

<a id='line_1845'>      exercised and displayed the genius of Alaric; and the fame of his</a>

<a id='line_1852'>      declared master-general of the Roman armies throughout the</a>
<a id='line_1853'>      præfecture of Illyricum; as it was claimed, according to the</a>

<a id='line_1855'>      execution of the ambitious design, which was either stipulated,</a>
<a id='line_1856'>      or implied, in the articles of the treaty, appears to have been</a>
<a id='line_1857'>      suspended by the formidable irruption of Radagaisus; and the</a>

<a id='line_1859'>      indifference of Caesar, who, in the conspiracy of Catiline,</a>
<a id='line_1860'>      refused either to assist, or to oppose, the enemy of the</a>
<a id='line_1861'>      republic. After the defeat of the Vandals, Stilicho resumed his</a>
<a id='line_1862'>      pretensions to the provinces of the East; appointed civil</a>
<a id='line_1863'>      magistrates for the administration of justice, and of the</a>
<a id='line_1864'>      finances; and declared his impatience to lead to the gates of</a>
<a id='line_1865'>      Constantinople the united armies of the Romans and of the Goths.</a>
<a id='line_1866'>      The prudence, however, of Stilicho, his aversion to civil war,</a>
<a id='line_1867'>      and his perfect knowledge of the weakness of the state, may</a>
<a id='line_1868'>      countenance the suspicion, that domestic peace, rather than</a>
<a id='line_1869'>      foreign conquest, was the object of his policy; and that his</a>
<a id='line_1870'>      principal care was to employ the forces of Alaric at a distance</a>
<a id='line_1871'>      from Italy. This design could not long escape the penetration of</a>
<a id='line_1872'>      the Gothic king, who continued to hold a doubtful, and perhaps a</a>
<a id='line_1873'>      treacherous, correspondence with the rival courts; who</a>
<a id='line_1874'>      protracted, like a dissatisfied mercenary, his languid operations</a>

<a id='line_1920'>      they had been suddenly awakened from a dream of four hundred</a>
<a id='line_1921'>      years, appeared, on this important occasion, to be inspired by</a>
<a id='line_1922'>      the courage, rather than by the wisdom, of their predecessors.</a>
<a id='line_1923'>      They loudly declared, in regular speeches, or in tumultuary</a>
<a id='line_1924'>      acclamations, that it was unworthy of the majesty of Rome to</a>
<a id='line_1925'>      purchase a precarious and disgraceful truce from a Barbarian</a>

<a id='line_1928'>      dishonor. The minister, whose pacific intentions were seconded</a>
<a id='line_1929'>      only by the voice of a few servile and venal followers, attempted</a>
<a id='line_1930'>      to allay the general ferment, by an apology for his own conduct,</a>
<a id='line_1931'>      and even for the demands of the Gothic prince. “The payment of a</a>
<a id='line_1932'>      subsidy, which had excited the indignation of the Romans, ought</a>
<a id='line_1933'>      not (such was the language of Stilicho) to be considered in the</a>
<a id='line_1934'>      odious light, either of a tribute, or of a ransom, extorted by</a>
<a id='line_1935'>      the menaces of a Barbarian enemy. Alaric had faithfully asserted</a>
<a id='line_1936'>      the just pretensions of the republic to the provinces which were</a>
<a id='line_1937'>      usurped by the Greeks of Constantinople: he modestly required the</a>
<a id='line_1938'>      fair and stipulated recompense of his services; and if he had</a>
<a id='line_1939'>      desisted from the prosecution of his enterprise, he had obeyed,</a>
<a id='line_1940'>      in his retreat, the peremptory, though private, letters of the</a>
<a id='line_1941'>      emperor himself. These contradictory orders (he would not</a>
<a id='line_1942'>      dissemble the errors of his own family) had been procured by the</a>
<a id='line_1943'>      intercession of Serena. The tender piety of his wife had been too</a>
<a id='line_1944'>      deeply affected by the discord of the royal brothers, the sons of</a>
<a id='line_1945'>      her adopted father; and the sentiments of nature had too easily</a>

<a id='line_1947'>      ostensible reasons, which faintly disguise the obscure intrigues</a>

<a id='line_1985'>      attained the twenty-fifth year of his age, that he was without</a>

<a id='line_2036'>      soldiers, whom the charitable visits, and artful discourses, of</a>
<a id='line_2037'>      Olympius had prepared to execute a dark and bloody conspiracy. At</a>
<a id='line_2038'>      the first signal, they massacred the friends of Stilicho, the</a>

<a id='line_2041'>      cavalry and infantry; the master of the offices; the quaestor,</a>
<a id='line_2042'>      the treasurer, and the count of the domestics. Many lives were</a>
<a id='line_2043'>      lost; many houses were plundered; the furious sedition continued</a>
<a id='line_2044'>      to rage till the close of the evening; and the trembling emperor,</a>
<a id='line_2045'>      who was seen in the streets of Pavia without his robes or diadem,</a>
<a id='line_2046'>      yielded to the persuasions of his favorite; condemned the memory</a>
<a id='line_2047'>      of the slain; and solemnly approved the innocence and fidelity of</a>
<a id='line_2048'>      their assassins. The intelligence of the massacre of Pavia filled</a>
<a id='line_2049'>      the mind of Stilicho with just and gloomy apprehensions; and he</a>
<a id='line_2050'>      instantly summoned, in the camp of Bologna, a council of the</a>
<a id='line_2051'>      confederate leaders, who were attached to his service, and would</a>
<a id='line_2052'>      be involved in his ruin. The impetuous voice of the assembly</a>
<a id='line_2053'>      called aloud for arms, and for revenge; to march, without a</a>
<a id='line_2054'>      moment’s delay, under the banners of a hero, whom they had so</a>
<a id='line_2055'>      often followed to victory; to surprise, to oppress, to extirpate</a>
<a id='line_2056'>      the guilty Olympius, and his degenerate Romans; and perhaps to</a>
<a id='line_2057'>      fix the diadem on the head of their injured general. Instead of</a>
<a id='line_2058'>      executing a resolution, which might have been justified by</a>
<a id='line_2059'>      success, Stilicho hesitated till he was irrecoverably lost. He</a>
<a id='line_2060'>      was still ignorant of the fate of the emperor; he distrusted the</a>
<a id='line_2061'>      fidelity of his own party; and he viewed with horror the fatal</a>
<a id='line_2062'>      consequences of arming a crowd of licentious Barbarians against</a>
<a id='line_2063'>      the soldiers and people of Italy. The confederates, impatient of</a>
<a id='line_2064'>      his timorous and doubtful delay, hastily retired, with fear and</a>
<a id='line_2065'>      indignation. At the hour of midnight, Sarus, a Gothic warrior,</a>
<a id='line_2066'>      renowned among the Barbarians themselves for his strength and</a>
<a id='line_2067'>      valor, suddenly invaded the camp of his benefactor, plundered the</a>
<a id='line_2068'>      baggage, cut in pieces the faithful Huns, who guarded his person,</a>
<a id='line_2069'>      and penetrated to the tent, where the minister, pensive and</a>
<a id='line_2070'>      sleepless, meditated on the dangers of his situation. Stilicho</a>
<a id='line_2071'>      escaped with difficulty from the sword of the Goths and, after</a>

<a id='line_2074'>      despair, urged him to throw himself into Ravenna, which was</a>
<a id='line_2075'>      already in the absolute possession of his enemies. Olympius, who</a>
<a id='line_2076'>      had assumed the dominion of Honorius, was speedily informed, that</a>
<a id='line_2077'>      his rival had embraced, as a suppliant the altar of the Christian</a>
<a id='line_2078'>      church. The base and cruel disposition of the hypocrite was</a>
<a id='line_2079'>      incapable of pity or remorse; but he piously affected to elude,</a>
<a id='line_2080'>      rather than to violate, the privilege of the sanctuary. Count</a>
<a id='line_2081'>      Heraclian, with a troop of soldiers, appeared, at the dawn of</a>

<a id='line_2083'>      satisfied by a solemn oath, that the Imperial mandate only</a>
<a id='line_2084'>      directed them to secure the person of Stilicho: but as soon as</a>
<a id='line_2085'>      the unfortunate minister had been tempted beyond the holy</a>
<a id='line_2086'>      threshold, he produced the warrant for his instant execution.</a>
<a id='line_2087'>      Stilicho supported, with calm resignation, the injurious names of</a>
<a id='line_2088'>      traitor and parricide; repressed the unseasonable zeal of his</a>
<a id='line_2089'>      followers, who were ready to attempt an ineffectual rescue; and,</a>
<a id='line_2090'>      with a firmness not unworthy of the last of the Roman generals,</a>

<a id='line_2123'>      110 The minister, whose fame and fortune depended on the</a>
<a id='line_2124'>      prosperity of the state, was accused of betraying Italy to the</a>
<a id='line_2125'>      Barbarians; whom he repeatedly vanquished at Pollentia, at</a>
<a id='line_2126'>      Verona, and before the walls of Florence. His pretended design of</a>
<a id='line_2127'>      placing the diadem on the head of his son Eucherius, could not</a>
<a id='line_2128'>      have been conducted without preparations or accomplices; and the</a>
<a id='line_2129'>      ambitious father would not surely have left the future emperor,</a>
<a id='line_2130'>      till the twentieth year of his age, in the humble station of</a>
<a id='line_2131'>      tribune of the notaries. Even the religion of Stilicho was</a>
<a id='line_2132'>      arraigned by the malice of his rival. The seasonable, and almost</a>
<a id='line_2133'>      miraculous, deliverance was devoutly celebrated by the applause</a>
<a id='line_2134'>      of the clergy; who asserted, that the restoration of idols, and</a>
<a id='line_2135'>      the persecution of the church, would have been the first measure</a>
<a id='line_2136'>      of the reign of Eucherius. The son of Stilicho, however, was</a>
<a id='line_2137'>      educated in the bosom of Christianity, which his father had</a>
<a id='line_2138'>      uniformly professed, and zealously supported. 111 1111 Serena had</a>
<a id='line_2139'>      borrowed her magnificent necklace from the statue of Vesta; 112</a>

<a id='line_2142'>      committed to the flames. 113 The pride and power of Stilicho</a>

<a id='line_2144'>      blood of his countrymen appears to have contributed to the</a>

<a id='line_2241'>      defenceless and contemptible foe, already humbled by disgrace and</a>
<a id='line_2242'>      poverty, and deeply wounded by the exile, the tortures, and the</a>
<a id='line_2243'>      death of his dearest friends. 117 Whatever might be the success</a>
<a id='line_2244'>      of his prayer, or the accidents of his future life, the period of</a>
<a id='line_2245'>      a few years levelled in the grave the minister and the poet: but</a>
<a id='line_2246'>      the name of Hadrian is almost sunk in oblivion, while Claudian is</a>
<a id='line_2247'>      read with pleasure in every country which has retained, or</a>
<a id='line_2248'>      acquired, the knowledge of the Latin language. If we fairly</a>
<a id='line_2249'>      balance his merits and his defects, we shall acknowledge that</a>
<a id='line_2250'>      Claudian does not either satisfy, or silence, our reason. It</a>
<a id='line_2251'>      would not be easy to produce a passage that deserves the epithet</a>
<a id='line_2252'>      of sublime or pathetic; to select a verse that melts the heart or</a>
<a id='line_2253'>      enlarges the imagination. We should vainly seek, in the poems of</a>
<a id='line_2254'>      Claudian, the happy invention, and artificial conduct, of an</a>
<a id='line_2255'>      interesting fable; or the just and lively representation of the</a>
<a id='line_2256'>      characters and situations of real life. For the service of his</a>
<a id='line_2257'>      patron, he published occasional panegyrics and invectives: and</a>
<a id='line_2258'>      the design of these slavish compositions encouraged his</a>
<a id='line_2259'>      propensity to exceed the limits of truth and nature. These</a>
<a id='line_2260'>      imperfections, however, are compensated in some degree by the</a>
<a id='line_2261'>      poetical virtues of Claudian. He was endowed with the rare and</a>
<a id='line_2262'>      precious talent of raising the meanest, of adorning the most</a>
<a id='line_2263'>      barren, and of diversifying the most similar, topics: his</a>
<a id='line_2264'>      coloring, more especially in descriptive poetry, is soft and</a>
<a id='line_2265'>      splendid; and he seldom fails to display, and even to abuse, the</a>
<a id='line_2266'>      advantages of a cultivated understanding, a copious fancy, an</a>
<a id='line_2267'>      easy, and sometimes forcible, expression; and a perpetual flow of</a>
<a id='line_2268'>      harmonious versification. To these commendations, independent of</a>
<a id='line_2269'>      any accidents of time and place, we must add the peculiar merit</a>
<a id='line_2270'>      which Claudian derived from the unfavorable circumstances of his</a>
<a id='line_2271'>      birth. In the decline of arts, and of empire, a native of Egypt,</a>
