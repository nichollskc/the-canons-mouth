<a id='line_2'>     The Character, Conquests, And Court Of Attila, King Of The</a>
<a id='line_3'>     Huns.—Death Of Theodosius The Younger.—Elevation Of Marcian To The</a>
<a id='line_4'>     Empire Of The East.</a>
<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'>      The Western world was oppressed by the Goths and Vandals, who</a>
<a id='line_7'>      fled before the Huns; but the achievements of the Huns themselves</a>
<a id='line_8'>      were not adequate to their power and prosperity. Their victorious</a>
<a id='line_9'>      hordes had spread from the Volga to the Danube; but the public</a>
<a id='line_10'>      force was exhausted by the discord of independent chieftains;</a>
<a id='line_11'>      their valor was idly consumed in obscure and predatory</a>
<a id='line_12'>      excursions; and they often degraded their national dignity, by</a>
<a id='line_13'>      condescending, for the hopes of spoil, to enlist under the</a>
<a id='line_14'>      banners of their fugitive enemies. In the reign of Attila, 1 the</a>
<a id='line_15'>      Huns again became the terror of the world; and I shall now</a>
<a id='line_16'>      describe the character and actions of that formidable Barbarian;</a>
<a id='line_17'>      who alternately insulted and invaded the East and the West, and</a>
<a id='line_18'>      urged the rapid downfall of the Roman empire.</a>

<a id='line_20'>      1 (return) [ The authentic materials for the history of Attila,</a>
<a id='line_21'>      may be found in Jornandes (de Rebus Geticis, c. 34-50, p.</a>

<a id='line_23'>      33-76, Paris, 1648.) I have not seen the Lives of Attila,</a>
<a id='line_24'>      composed by Juvencus Caelius Calanus Dalmatinus, in the twelfth</a>
<a id='line_25'>      century, or by Nicholas Olahus, archbishop of Gran, in the</a>

<a id='line_27'>      Osservazioni Litterarie, tom. i. p. 88, 89. Whatever the modern</a>
<a id='line_28'>      Hungarians have added must be fabulous; and they do not seem to</a>
<a id='line_29'>      have excelled in the art of fiction. They suppose, that when</a>
<a id='line_30'>      Attila invaded Gaul and Italy, married innumerable wives, &c., he</a>
<a id='line_31'>      was one hundred and twenty years of age. Thewrocz Chron. c. i. p.</a>

<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'>      In the tide of emigration which impetuously rolled from the</a>
<a id='line_35'>      confines of China to those of Germany, the most powerful and</a>
<a id='line_36'>      populous tribes may commonly be found on the verge of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_37'>      provinces. The accumulated weight was sustained for a while by</a>
<a id='line_38'>      artificial barriers; and the easy condescension of the emperors</a>
<a id='line_39'>      invited, without satisfying, the insolent demands of the</a>
<a id='line_40'>      Barbarians, who had acquired an eager appetite for the luxuries</a>
<a id='line_41'>      of civilized life. The Hungarians, who ambitiously insert the</a>
<a id='line_42'>      name of Attila among their native kings, may affirm with truth</a>
<a id='line_43'>      that the hordes, which were subject to his uncle Roas, or</a>
<a id='line_44'>      Rugilas, had formed their encampments within the limits of modern</a>
<a id='line_45'>      Hungary, 2 in a fertile country, which liberally supplied the</a>
<a id='line_46'>      wants of a nation of hunters and shepherds. In this advantageous</a>
<a id='line_47'>      situation, Rugilas, and his valiant brothers, who continually</a>
<a id='line_48'>      added to their power and reputation, commanded the alternative of</a>
<a id='line_49'>      peace or war with the two empires. His alliance with the Romans</a>
<a id='line_50'>      of the West was cemented by his personal friendship for the great</a>
<a id='line_51'>      Ætius; who was always secure of finding, in the Barbarian camp,</a>
<a id='line_52'>      a hospitable reception and a powerful support. At his</a>
<a id='line_53'>      solicitation, and in the name of John the usurper, sixty thousand</a>
<a id='line_54'>      Huns advanced to the confines of Italy; their march and their</a>
<a id='line_55'>      retreat were alike expensive to the state; and the grateful</a>
<a id='line_56'>      policy of Ætius abandoned the possession of Pannonia to his</a>
<a id='line_57'>      faithful confederates. The Romans of the East were not less</a>
<a id='line_58'>      apprehensive of the arms of Rugilas, which threatened the</a>
<a id='line_59'>      provinces, or even the capital. Some ecclesiastical historians</a>
<a id='line_60'>      have destroyed the Barbarians with lightning and pestilence; 3</a>
<a id='line_61'>      but Theodosius was reduced to the more humble expedient of</a>
<a id='line_62'>      stipulating an annual payment of three hundred and fifty pounds</a>
<a id='line_63'>      of gold, and of disguising this dishonorable tribute by the title</a>
<a id='line_64'>      of general, which the king of the Huns condescended to accept.</a>
<a id='line_65'>      The public tranquillity was frequently interrupted by the fierce</a>
<a id='line_66'>      impatience of the Barbarians, and the perfidious intrigues of the</a>
<a id='line_67'>      Byzantine court. Four dependent nations, among whom we may</a>
<a id='line_68'>      distinguish the Barbarians, disclaimed the sovereignty of the</a>
<a id='line_69'>      Huns; and their revolt was encouraged and protected by a Roman</a>
<a id='line_70'>      alliance; till the just claims, and formidable power, of Rugilas,</a>
<a id='line_71'>      were effectually urged by the voice of Eslaw his ambassador.</a>
<a id='line_72'>      Peace was the unanimous wish of the senate: their decree was</a>
<a id='line_73'>      ratified by the emperor; and two ambassadors were named,</a>
<a id='line_74'>      Plinthas, a general of Scythian extraction, but of consular rank;</a>
<a id='line_75'>      and the quaestor Epigenes, a wise and experienced statesman, who</a>
<a id='line_76'>      was recommended to that office by his ambitious colleague.</a>

<a id='line_78'>      2 (return) [ Hungary has been successively occupied by three</a>
<a id='line_79'>      Scythian colonies. 1. The Huns of Attila; 2. The Abares, in the</a>
<a id='line_80'>      sixth century; and, 3. The Turks or Magiars, A.D. 889; the</a>
<a id='line_81'>      immediate and genuine ancestors of the modern Hungarians, whose</a>
<a id='line_82'>      connection with the two former is extremely faint and remote. The</a>
<a id='line_83'>      Prodromus and Notitia of Matthew Belius appear to contain a rich</a>
<a id='line_84'>      fund of information concerning ancient and modern Hungary. I have</a>
<a id='line_85'>      seen the extracts in Bibliothèque Ancienne et Moderne, tom.</a>
<a id='line_86'>      xxii. p. 1-51, and Bibliothèque Raisonnée, tom. xvi. p. 127-175.</a>
<a id='line_87'>      * Note: Mailath (in his Geschichte der Magyaren) considers the</a>
<a id='line_88'>      question of the origin of the Magyars as still undecided. The old</a>
<a id='line_89'>      Hungarian chronicles unanimously derived them from the Huns of</a>
<a id='line_90'>      Attila See note, vol. iv. pp. 341, 342. The later opinion,</a>
<a id='line_91'>      adopted by Schlozer, Belnay, and Dankowsky, ascribes them, from</a>
<a id='line_92'>      their language, to the Finnish race. Fessler, in his history of</a>
<a id='line_93'>      Hungary, agrees with Gibbon in supposing them Turks. Mailath has</a>
<a id='line_94'>      inserted an ingenious dissertation of Fejer, which attempts to</a>
<a id='line_95'>      connect them with the Parthians. Vol. i. Ammerkungen p. 50—M.]</a>

<a id='line_99'>      authors, strenuously contends (Hist. des Emp. tom. vi. p. 136,</a>
<a id='line_100'>      607) that the wars and personages were not the same.]</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>      The death of Rugilas suspended the progress of the treaty. His</a>
<a id='line_103'>      two nephews, Attila and Bleda, who succeeded to the throne of</a>
<a id='line_104'>      their uncle, consented to a personal interview with the</a>
<a id='line_105'>      ambassadors of Constantinople; but as they proudly refused to</a>
<a id='line_106'>      dismount, the business was transacted on horseback, in a spacious</a>
<a id='line_107'>      plain near the city of Margus, in the Upper Maesia. The kings of</a>
<a id='line_108'>      the Huns assumed the solid benefits, as well as the vain honors,</a>
<a id='line_109'>      of the negotiation. They dictated the conditions of peace, and</a>
<a id='line_110'>      each condition was an insult on the majesty of the empire.</a>
<a id='line_111'>      Besides the freedom of a safe and plentiful market on the banks</a>
<a id='line_112'>      of the Danube, they required that the annual contribution should</a>
<a id='line_113'>      be augmented from three hundred and fifty to seven hundred pounds</a>
<a id='line_114'>      of gold; that a fine or ransom of eight pieces of gold should be</a>
<a id='line_115'>      paid for every Roman captive who had escaped from his Barbarian</a>
<a id='line_116'>      master; that the emperor should renounce all treaties and</a>
<a id='line_117'>      engagements with the enemies of the Huns; and that all the</a>
<a id='line_118'>      fugitives who had taken refuge in the court or provinces of</a>
<a id='line_119'>      Theodosius, should be delivered to the justice of their offended</a>
<a id='line_120'>      sovereign. This justice was rigorously inflicted on some</a>
<a id='line_121'>      unfortunate youths of a royal race. They were crucified on the</a>
<a id='line_122'>      territories of the empire, by the command of Attila: and as soon</a>
<a id='line_123'>      as the king of the Huns had impressed the Romans with the terror</a>
<a id='line_124'>      of his name, he indulged them in a short and arbitrary respite,</a>
<a id='line_125'>      whilst he subdued the rebellious or independent nations of</a>
<a id='line_126'>      Scythia and Germany. 4</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>      4 (return) [ See Priscus, p. 47, 48, and Hist. de Peuples de</a>
<a id='line_129'>      l’Europe, tom. v. i. c. xii, xiii, xiv, xv.]</a>
<a id='line_130'></a>
<a id='line_131'>      Attila, the son of Mundzuk, deduced his noble, perhaps his regal,</a>
<a id='line_132'>      descent 5 from the ancient Huns, who had formerly contended with</a>
<a id='line_133'>      the monarchs of China. His features, according to the observation</a>
<a id='line_134'>      of a Gothic historian, bore the stamp of his national origin; and</a>
<a id='line_135'>      the portrait of Attila exhibits the genuine deformity of a modern</a>
<a id='line_136'>      Calmuk; 6 a large head, a swarthy complexion, small, deep-seated</a>
<a id='line_137'>      eyes, a flat nose, a few hairs in the place of a beard, broad</a>
<a id='line_138'>      shoulders, and a short square body, of nervous strength, though</a>
<a id='line_139'>      of a disproportioned form. The haughty step and demeanor of the</a>
<a id='line_140'>      king of the Huns expressed the consciousness of his superiority</a>
<a id='line_141'>      above the rest of mankind; and he had a custom of fiercely</a>
<a id='line_142'>      rolling his eyes, as if he wished to enjoy the terror which he</a>
<a id='line_143'>      inspired. Yet this savage hero was not inaccessible to pity; his</a>
<a id='line_144'>      suppliant enemies might confide in the assurance of peace or</a>
<a id='line_145'>      pardon; and Attila was considered by his subjects as a just and</a>
<a id='line_146'>      indulgent master. He delighted in war; but, after he had ascended</a>
<a id='line_147'>      the throne in a mature age, his head, rather than his hand,</a>
<a id='line_148'>      achieved the conquest of the North; and the fame of an</a>
<a id='line_149'>      adventurous soldier was usefully exchanged for that of a prudent</a>
<a id='line_150'>      and successful general. The effects of personal valor are so</a>
<a id='line_151'>      inconsiderable, except in poetry or romance, that victory, even</a>
<a id='line_152'>      among Barbarians, must depend on the degree of skill with which</a>
<a id='line_153'>      the passions of the multitude are combined and guided for the</a>
<a id='line_154'>      service of a single man. The Scythian conquerors, Attila and</a>
<a id='line_155'>      Zingis, surpassed their rude countrymen in art rather than in</a>
<a id='line_156'>      courage; and it may be observed that the monarchies, both of the</a>
<a id='line_157'>      Huns and of the Moguls, were erected by their founders on the</a>
<a id='line_158'>      basis of popular superstition. The miraculous conception, which</a>
<a id='line_159'>      fraud and credulity ascribed to the virgin-mother of Zingis,</a>
<a id='line_160'>      raised him above the level of human nature; and the naked</a>
<a id='line_161'>      prophet, who in the name of the Deity invested him with the</a>
<a id='line_162'>      empire of the earth, pointed the valor of the Moguls with</a>
<a id='line_163'>      irresistible enthusiasm. 7 The religious arts of Attila were not</a>
<a id='line_164'>      less skillfully adapted to the character of his age and country.</a>
<a id='line_165'>      It was natural enough that the Scythians should adore, with</a>
<a id='line_166'>      peculiar devotion, the god of war; but as they were incapable of</a>
<a id='line_167'>      forming either an abstract idea, or a corporeal representation,</a>
<a id='line_168'>      they worshipped their tutelar deity under the symbol of an iron</a>
<a id='line_169'>      cimeter. 8 One of the shepherds of the Huns perceived, that a</a>
<a id='line_170'>      heifer, who was grazing, had wounded herself in the foot, and</a>
<a id='line_171'>      curiously followed the track of the blood, till he discovered,</a>
<a id='line_172'>      among the long grass, the point of an ancient sword, which he dug</a>
<a id='line_173'>      out of the ground and presented to Attila. That magnanimous, or</a>
<a id='line_174'>      rather that artful, prince accepted, with pious gratitude, this</a>
<a id='line_175'>      celestial favor; and, as the rightful possessor of the sword of</a>
<a id='line_176'>      Mars, asserted his divine and indefeasible claim to the dominion</a>
<a id='line_177'>      of the earth. 9 If the rites of Scythia were practised on this</a>
<a id='line_178'>      solemn occasion, a lofty altar, or rather pile of fagots, three</a>
<a id='line_179'>      hundred yards in length and in breadth, was raised in a spacious</a>
<a id='line_180'>      plain; and the sword of Mars was placed erect on the summit of</a>
<a id='line_181'>      this rustic altar, which was annually consecrated by the blood of</a>
<a id='line_182'>      sheep, horses, and of the hundredth captive. 10 Whether human</a>
<a id='line_183'>      sacrifices formed any part of the worship of Attila, or whether</a>
<a id='line_184'>      he propitiated the god of war with the victims which he</a>
<a id='line_185'>      continually offered in the field of battle, the favorite of Mars</a>
<a id='line_186'>      soon acquired a sacred character, which rendered his conquests more</a>
<a id='line_187'>      easy and more permanent; and the Barbarian princes confessed, in</a>
<a id='line_188'>      the language of devotion or flattery, that they could not presume</a>
<a id='line_189'>      to gaze, with a steady eye, on the divine majesty of the king of</a>
<a id='line_190'>      the Huns. 11 His brother Bleda, who reigned over a considerable</a>
<a id='line_191'>      part of the nation, was compelled to resign his sceptre and his</a>
<a id='line_192'>      life. Yet even this cruel act was attributed to a supernatural</a>
<a id='line_193'>      impulse; and the vigor with which Attila wielded the sword of</a>
<a id='line_194'>      Mars, convinced the world that it had been reserved alone for his</a>
<a id='line_195'>      invincible arm. 12 But the extent of his empire affords the only</a>
<a id='line_196'>      remaining evidence of the number and importance of his victories;</a>
<a id='line_197'>      and the Scythian monarch, however ignorant of the value of</a>
<a id='line_198'>      science and philosophy, might perhaps lament that his illiterate</a>
<a id='line_199'>      subjects were destitute of the art which could perpetuate the</a>

<a id='line_266'>      has been protected from all other conquerors by the severity of</a>
<a id='line_267'>      the climate, and the courage of the natives. Towards the East, it</a>
<a id='line_268'>      is difficult to circumscribe the dominion of Attila over the</a>
<a id='line_269'>      Scythian deserts; yet we may be assured, that he reigned on the</a>
<a id='line_270'>      banks of the Volga; that the king of the Huns was dreaded, not</a>
<a id='line_271'>      only as a warrior, but as a magician; 14 that he insulted and</a>
<a id='line_272'>      vanquished the khan of the formidable Geougen; and that he sent</a>
<a id='line_273'>      ambassadors to negotiate an equal alliance with the empire of</a>

<a id='line_277'>      were distinguished by their numbers, their bravery, and the</a>

<a id='line_280'>      monarch, who esteemed his intrepid genius, whilst he loved the</a>
<a id='line_281'>      mild and discreet virtues of the noble Walamir, king of the</a>

<a id='line_284'>      ranged in the submissive order of guards and domestics round the</a>

<a id='line_322'>      reached, with the other, as far as the Tanais. In the reign of</a>
<a id='line_323'>      his father Arcadius, a band of adventurous Huns had ravaged the</a>
<a id='line_324'>      provinces of the East; from whence they brought away rich spoils</a>
<a id='line_325'>      and innumerable captives. 16 They advanced, by a secret path,</a>
<a id='line_326'>      along the shores of the Caspian Sea; traversed the snowy</a>
<a id='line_327'>      mountains of Armenia; passed the Tigris, the Euphrates, and the</a>
<a id='line_328'>      Halys; recruited their weary cavalry with the generous breed of</a>
<a id='line_329'>      Cappadocian horses; occupied the hilly country of Cilicia, and</a>
<a id='line_330'>      disturbed the festal songs and dances of the citizens of Antioch.</a>
<a id='line_331'>      Egypt trembled at their approach; and the monks and pilgrims of</a>
<a id='line_332'>      the Holy Land prepared to escape their fury by a speedy</a>
<a id='line_333'>      embarkation. The memory of this invasion was still recent in the</a>
<a id='line_334'>      minds of the Orientals. The subjects of Attila might execute,</a>
<a id='line_335'>      with superior forces, the design which these adventurers had so</a>
<a id='line_336'>      boldly attempted; and it soon became the subject of anxious</a>
<a id='line_337'>      conjecture, whether the tempest would fall on the dominions of</a>
<a id='line_338'>      Rome, or of Persia. Some of the great vassals of the king of the</a>
<a id='line_339'>      Huns, who were themselves in the rank of powerful princes, had</a>
<a id='line_340'>      been sent to ratify an alliance and society of arms with the</a>
<a id='line_341'>      emperor, or rather with the general of the West. They related,</a>
<a id='line_342'>      during their residence at Rome, the circumstances of an</a>
<a id='line_343'>      expedition, which they had lately made into the East. After</a>
<a id='line_344'>      passing a desert and a morass, supposed by the Romans to be the</a>
<a id='line_345'>      Lake Maeotis, they penetrated through the mountains, and arrived,</a>
<a id='line_346'>      at the end of fifteen days’ march, on the confines of Media;</a>
<a id='line_347'>      where they advanced as far as the unknown cities of Basic and</a>
<a id='line_348'>      Cursic. 1611 They encountered the Persian army in the plains of</a>
<a id='line_349'>      Media and the air, according to their own expression, was</a>
<a id='line_350'>      darkened by a cloud of arrows. But the Huns were obliged to</a>
<a id='line_351'>      retire before the numbers of the enemy. Their laborious retreat</a>
<a id='line_352'>      was effected by a different road; they lost the greatest part of</a>
<a id='line_353'>      their booty; and at length returned to the royal camp, with some</a>

<a id='line_358'>      hope, that his strength might be diverted and employed in a long</a>
<a id='line_359'>      and doubtful contest with the princes of the house of Sassan. The</a>
<a id='line_360'>      more sagacious Italians admonished their Eastern brethren of the</a>

<a id='line_363'>      Huns; and that the easy and important acquisition would exalt the</a>

<a id='line_365'>      himself with a moderate contribution, and a military title, which</a>

<a id='line_392'>      While the powers of Europe and Asia were solicitous to avert the</a>
<a id='line_393'>      impending danger, the alliance of Attila maintained the Vandals</a>
<a id='line_394'>      in the possession of Africa. An enterprise had been concerted</a>
<a id='line_395'>      between the courts of Ravenna and Constantinople, for the</a>
<a id='line_396'>      recovery of that valuable province; and the ports of Sicily were</a>
<a id='line_397'>      already filled with the military and naval forces of Theodosius.</a>
<a id='line_398'>      But the subtle Genseric, who spread his negotiations round the</a>
<a id='line_399'>      world, prevented their designs, by exciting the king of the Huns</a>
<a id='line_400'>      to invade the Eastern empire; and a trifling incident soon became</a>
<a id='line_401'>      the motive, or pretence, of a destructive war. 18 Under the faith</a>
<a id='line_402'>      of the treaty of Margus, a free market was held on the Northern</a>
<a id='line_403'>      side of the Danube, which was protected by a Roman fortress</a>
<a id='line_404'>      surnamed Constantia. A troop of Barbarians violated the</a>
<a id='line_405'>      commercial security; killed, or dispersed, the unsuspecting</a>
<a id='line_406'>      traders; and levelled the fortress with the ground. The Huns</a>
<a id='line_407'>      justified this outrage as an act of reprisal; alleged, that the</a>
<a id='line_408'>      bishop of Margus had entered their territories, to discover and</a>
<a id='line_409'>      steal a secret treasure of their kings; and sternly demanded the</a>
<a id='line_410'>      guilty prelate, the sacrilegious spoil, and the fugitive</a>
<a id='line_411'>      subjects, who had escaped from the justice of Attila. The refusal</a>
<a id='line_412'>      of the Byzantine court was the signal of war; and the Maesians at</a>
<a id='line_413'>      first applauded the generous firmness of their sovereign. But</a>
<a id='line_414'>      they were soon intimidated by the destruction of Viminiacum and</a>
<a id='line_415'>      the adjacent towns; and the people was persuaded to adopt the</a>
<a id='line_416'>      convenient maxim, that a private citizen, however innocent or</a>
<a id='line_417'>      respectable, may be justly sacrificed to the safety of his</a>
<a id='line_418'>      country. The bishop of Margus, who did not possess the spirit of</a>
<a id='line_419'>      a martyr, resolved to prevent the designs which he suspected. He</a>
<a id='line_420'>      boldly treated with the princes of the Huns: secured, by solemn</a>
<a id='line_421'>      oaths, his pardon and reward; posted a numerous detachment of</a>
<a id='line_422'>      Barbarians, in silent ambush, on the banks of the Danube; and, at</a>
<a id='line_423'>      the appointed hour, opened, with his own hand, the gates of his</a>
<a id='line_424'>      episcopal city. This advantage, which had been obtained by</a>
<a id='line_425'>      treachery, served as a prelude to more honorable and decisive</a>
<a id='line_426'>      victories. The Illyrian frontier was covered by a line of castles</a>
<a id='line_427'>      and fortresses; and though the greatest part of them consisted</a>
<a id='line_428'>      only of a single tower, with a small garrison, they were commonly</a>
<a id='line_429'>      sufficient to repel, or to intercept, the inroads of an enemy,</a>
<a id='line_430'>      who was ignorant of the art, and impatient of the delay, of a</a>
<a id='line_431'>      regular siege. But these slight obstacles were instantly swept</a>
<a id='line_432'>      away by the inundation of the Huns. 19 They destroyed, with fire</a>
<a id='line_433'>      and sword, the populous cities of Sirmium and Singidunum, of</a>
<a id='line_434'>      Ratiaria and Marcianopolis, of Naissus and Sardica; where every</a>
<a id='line_435'>      circumstance of the discipline of the people, and the</a>
<a id='line_436'>      construction of the buildings, had been gradually adapted to the</a>
<a id='line_437'>      sole purpose of defence. The whole breadth of Europe, as it</a>
<a id='line_438'>      extends above five hundred miles from the Euxine to the</a>
<a id='line_439'>      Hadriatic, was at once invaded, and occupied, and desolated, by</a>
<a id='line_440'>      the myriads of Barbarians whom Attila led into the field. The</a>
<a id='line_441'>      public danger and distress could not, however, provoke Theodosius</a>
<a id='line_442'>      to interrupt his amusements and devotion, or to appear in person</a>
<a id='line_443'>      at the head of the Roman legions. But the troops, which had been</a>
<a id='line_444'>      sent against Genseric, were hastily recalled from Sicily; the</a>
<a id='line_445'>      garrisons, on the side of Persia, were exhausted; and a military</a>
<a id='line_446'>      force was collected in Europe, formidable by their arms and</a>
<a id='line_447'>      numbers, if the generals had understood the science of command,</a>
<a id='line_448'>      and the soldiers the duty of obedience. The armies of the Eastern</a>
<a id='line_449'>      empire were vanquished in three successive engagements; and the</a>
<a id='line_450'>      progress of Attila may be traced by the fields of battle.</a>
<a id='line_451'></a>
<a id='line_452'>      The two former, on the banks of the Utus, and under the walls of</a>
<a id='line_453'>      Marcianopolis, were fought in the extensive plains between the</a>
<a id='line_454'>      Danube and Mount Haemus. As the Romans were pressed by a</a>
<a id='line_455'>      victorious enemy, they gradually, and unskilfully, retired</a>
<a id='line_456'>      towards the Chersonesus of Thrace; and that narrow peninsula, the</a>
<a id='line_457'>      last extremity of the land, was marked by their third, and</a>
<a id='line_458'>      irreparable, defeat. By the destruction of this army, Attila</a>
<a id='line_459'>      acquired the indisputable possession of the field. From the</a>
<a id='line_460'>      Hellespont to Thermopylae, and the suburbs of Constantinople, he</a>
<a id='line_461'>      ravaged, without resistance, and without mercy, the provinces of</a>
<a id='line_462'>      Thrace and Macedonia. Heraclea and Hadrianople might, perhaps,</a>
<a id='line_463'>      escape this dreadful irruption of the Huns; but the words, the</a>

<a id='line_468'>      walls had been shaken by a recent earthquake, and the fall of</a>
<a id='line_469'>      fifty-eight towers had opened a large and tremendous breach. The</a>
<a id='line_470'>      damage indeed was speedily repaired; but this accident was</a>

<a id='line_504'></a>
<a id='line_505'>      In all their invasions of the civilized empires of the South, the</a>
<a id='line_506'>      Scythian shepherds have been uniformly actuated by a savage and</a>
<a id='line_507'>      destructive spirit. The laws of war, that restrain the exercise</a>
<a id='line_508'>      of national rapine and murder, are founded on two principles of</a>
<a id='line_509'>      substantial interest: the knowledge of the permanent benefits</a>
<a id='line_510'>      which may be obtained by a moderate use of conquest; and a just</a>
<a id='line_511'>      apprehension, lest the desolation which we inflict on the enemy’s</a>
<a id='line_512'>      country may be retaliated on our own. But these considerations of</a>
<a id='line_513'>      hope and fear are almost unknown in the pastoral state of</a>
<a id='line_514'>      nations. The Huns of Attila may, without injustice, be compared</a>
<a id='line_515'>      to the Moguls and Tartars, before their primitive manners were</a>
<a id='line_516'>      changed by religion and luxury; and the evidence of Oriental</a>
<a id='line_517'>      history may reflect some light on the short and imperfect annals</a>
<a id='line_518'>      of Rome. After the Moguls had subdued the northern provinces of</a>
<a id='line_519'>      China, it was seriously proposed, not in the hour of victory and</a>
<a id='line_520'>      passion, but in calm deliberate council, to exterminate all the</a>
<a id='line_521'>      inhabitants of that populous country, that the vacant land might</a>
<a id='line_522'>      be converted to the pasture of cattle. The firmness of a Chinese</a>
<a id='line_523'>      mandarin, 22 who insinuated some principles of rational policy</a>
<a id='line_524'>      into the mind of Zingis, diverted him from the execution of this</a>
<a id='line_525'>      horrid design. But in the cities of Asia, which yielded to the</a>
<a id='line_526'>      Moguls, the inhuman abuse of the rights of war was exercised with</a>
<a id='line_527'>      a regular form of discipline, which may, with equal reason,</a>
<a id='line_528'>      though not with equal authority, be imputed to the victorious</a>
<a id='line_529'>      Huns. The inhabitants, who had submitted to their discretion,</a>
<a id='line_530'>      were ordered to evacuate their houses, and to assemble in some</a>
<a id='line_531'>      plain adjacent to the city; where a division was made of the</a>
<a id='line_532'>      vanquished into three parts. The first class consisted of the</a>
<a id='line_533'>      soldiers of the garrison, and of the young men capable of bearing</a>
<a id='line_534'>      arms; and their fate was instantly decided: they were either</a>
<a id='line_535'>      enlisted among the Moguls, or they were massacred on the spot by</a>
<a id='line_536'>      the troops, who, with pointed spears and bended bows, had formed</a>
<a id='line_537'>      a circle round the captive multitude. The second class, composed</a>
<a id='line_538'>      of the young and beautiful women, of the artificers of every rank</a>
<a id='line_539'>      and profession, and of the more wealthy or honorable citizens,</a>
<a id='line_540'>      from whom a private ransom might be expected, was distributed in</a>
<a id='line_541'>      equal or proportionable lots. The remainder, whose life or death</a>
<a id='line_542'>      was alike useless to the conquerors, were permitted to return to</a>
<a id='line_543'>      the city; which, in the mean while, had been stripped of its</a>
<a id='line_544'>      valuable furniture; and a tax was imposed on those wretched</a>
<a id='line_545'>      inhabitants for the indulgence of breathing their native air.</a>
<a id='line_546'>      Such was the behavior of the Moguls, when they were not conscious</a>
<a id='line_547'>      of any extraordinary rigor. 23 But the most casual provocation,</a>
<a id='line_548'>      the slightest motive of caprice or convenience, often provoked</a>
<a id='line_549'>      them to involve a whole people in an indiscriminate massacre; and</a>
<a id='line_550'>      the ruin of some flourishing cities was executed with such</a>
<a id='line_551'>      unrelenting perseverance, that, according to their own</a>
<a id='line_552'>      expression, horses might run, without stumbling, over the ground</a>
<a id='line_553'>      where they had once stood. The three great capitals of Khorasan,</a>

<a id='line_607'>      It may be affirmed, with bolder assurance, that the Huns</a>
<a id='line_608'>      depopulated the provinces of the empire, by the number of Roman</a>
<a id='line_609'>      subjects whom they led away into captivity. In the hands of a</a>
<a id='line_610'>      wise legislator, such an industrious colony might have</a>
<a id='line_611'>      contributed to diffuse through the deserts of Scythia the</a>
<a id='line_612'>      rudiments of the useful and ornamental arts; but these captives,</a>
<a id='line_613'>      who had been taken in war, were accidentally dispersed among the</a>
<a id='line_614'>      hordes that obeyed the empire of Attila. The estimate of their</a>
<a id='line_615'>      respective value was formed by the simple judgment of</a>
<a id='line_616'>      unenlightened and unprejudiced Barbarians. Perhaps they might not</a>
<a id='line_617'>      understand the merit of a theologian, profoundly skilled in the</a>
<a id='line_618'>      controversies of the Trinity and the Incarnation; yet they</a>
<a id='line_619'>      respected the ministers of every religion; and the active zeal of</a>
<a id='line_620'>      the Christian missionaries, without approaching the person or the</a>
<a id='line_621'>      palace of the monarch, successfully labored in the propagation of</a>
<a id='line_622'>      the gospel. 27 The pastoral tribes, who were ignorant of the</a>
<a id='line_623'>      distinction of landed property, must have disregarded the use, as</a>
<a id='line_624'>      well as the abuse, of civil jurisprudence; and the skill of an</a>
<a id='line_625'>      eloquent lawyer could excite only their contempt or their</a>
<a id='line_626'>      abhorrence. 28 The perpetual intercourse of the Huns and the</a>
<a id='line_627'>      Goths had communicated the familiar knowledge of the two national</a>
<a id='line_628'>      dialects; and the Barbarians were ambitious of conversing in</a>
<a id='line_629'>      Latin, the military idiom even of the Eastern empire. 29 But they</a>
<a id='line_630'>      disdained the language and the sciences of the Greeks; and the</a>
<a id='line_631'>      vain sophist, or grave philosopher, who had enjoyed the</a>
<a id='line_632'>      flattering applause of the schools, was mortified to find that</a>
<a id='line_633'>      his robust servant was a captive of more value and importance</a>
<a id='line_634'>      than himself. The mechanic arts were encouraged and esteemed, as</a>
<a id='line_635'>      they tended to satisfy the wants of the Huns. An architect in the</a>
<a id='line_636'>      service of Onegesius, one of the favorites of Attila, was</a>
<a id='line_637'>      employed to construct a bath; but this work was a rare example of</a>
<a id='line_638'>      private luxury; and the trades of the smith, the carpenter, the</a>
<a id='line_639'>      armorer, were much more adapted to supply a wandering people with</a>
<a id='line_640'>      the useful instruments of peace and war. But the merit of the</a>
<a id='line_641'>      physician was received with universal favor and respect: the</a>
<a id='line_642'>      Barbarians, who despised death, might be apprehensive of disease;</a>
<a id='line_643'>      and the haughty conqueror trembled in the presence of a captive,</a>
<a id='line_644'>      to whom he ascribed, perhaps, an imaginary power of prolonging or</a>
<a id='line_645'>      preserving his life. 30 The Huns might be provoked to insult the</a>
<a id='line_646'>      misery of their slaves, over whom they exercised a despotic</a>
<a id='line_647'>      command; 31 but their manners were not susceptible of a refined</a>
<a id='line_648'>      system of oppression; and the efforts of courage and diligence</a>
<a id='line_649'>      were often recompensed by the gift of freedom. The historian</a>
<a id='line_650'>      Priscus, whose embassy is a source of curious instruction, was</a>
<a id='line_651'>      accosted in the camp of Attila by a stranger, who saluted him in</a>
<a id='line_652'>      the Greek language, but whose dress and figure displayed the</a>
<a id='line_653'>      appearance of a wealthy Scythian. In the siege of Viminiacum, he</a>
<a id='line_654'>      had lost, according to his own account, his fortune and liberty;</a>
<a id='line_655'>      he became the slave of Onegesius; but his faithful services,</a>
<a id='line_656'>      against the Romans and the Acatzires, had gradually raised him to</a>
<a id='line_657'>      the rank of the native Huns; to whom he was attached by the</a>
<a id='line_658'>      domestic pledges of a new wife and several children. The spoils</a>
<a id='line_659'>      of war had restored and improved his private property; he was</a>
<a id='line_660'>      admitted to the table of his former lord; and the apostate Greek</a>
<a id='line_661'>      blessed the hour of his captivity, since it had been the</a>
<a id='line_662'>      introduction to a happy and independent state; which he held by</a>
<a id='line_663'>      the honorable tenure of military service. This reflection</a>
<a id='line_664'>      naturally produced a dispute on the advantages and defects of the</a>
<a id='line_665'>      Roman government, which was severely arraigned by the apostate,</a>
<a id='line_666'>      and defended by Priscus in a prolix and feeble declamation. The</a>
<a id='line_667'>      freedman of Onegesius exposed, in true and lively colors, the</a>
<a id='line_668'>      vices of a declining empire, of which he had so long been the</a>
<a id='line_669'>      victim; the cruel absurdity of the Roman princes, unable to</a>
<a id='line_670'>      protect their subjects against the public enemy, unwilling to</a>
<a id='line_671'>      trust them with arms for their own defence; the intolerable</a>

<a id='line_759'>      concluded, and the conclusions of Attila were irrevocable laws,</a>
<a id='line_760'>      that the Huns, who had been taken prisoner in war, should be</a>
<a id='line_761'>      released without delay, and without ransom; that every Roman</a>

<a id='line_879'>      daughter of Count Saturninus was chosen to discharge the</a>

<a id='line_881'>      domestic troubles, and the unjust confiscation of her fortune,</a>
<a id='line_882'>      cooled the ardor of her interested lover; but he still demanded,</a>

<a id='line_886'>      whose birth, opulence, and beauty, placed her in the most</a>

<a id='line_951'>      to exercise the duties of hospitality. They provided, with the</a>
<a id='line_952'>      assistance of the provincials, a sufficient number of sheep and</a>
<a id='line_953'>      oxen, and invited the Huns to a splendid, or at least, a</a>
<a id='line_954'>      plentiful supper. But the harmony of the entertainment was soon</a>
<a id='line_955'>      disturbed by mutual prejudice and indiscretion. The greatness of</a>
<a id='line_956'>      the emperor and the empire was warmly maintained by their</a>
<a id='line_957'>      ministers; the Huns, with equal ardor, asserted the superiority</a>

<a id='line_959'>      and unseasonable flattery of Vigilius, who passionately rejected</a>
<a id='line_960'>      the comparison of a mere mortal with the divine Theodosius; and</a>
<a id='line_961'>      it was with extreme difficulty that Maximin and Priscus were able</a>
<a id='line_962'>      to divert the conversation, or to soothe the angry minds, of the</a>
<a id='line_963'>      Barbarians. When they rose from table, the Imperial ambassador</a>
<a id='line_964'>      presented Edecon and Orestes with rich gifts of silk robes and</a>
<a id='line_965'>      Indian pearls, which they thankfully accepted. Yet Orestes could</a>
<a id='line_966'>      not forbear insinuating that he had not always been treated with</a>
<a id='line_967'>      such respect and liberality: and the offensive distinction which</a>
<a id='line_968'>      was implied, between his civil office and the hereditary rank of</a>
<a id='line_969'>      his colleague seems to have made Edecon a doubtful friend, and</a>
<a id='line_970'>      Orestes an irreconcilable enemy. After this entertainment, they</a>
<a id='line_971'>      travelled about one hundred miles from Sardica to Naissus. That</a>
<a id='line_972'>      flourishing city, which has given birth to the great Constantine,</a>
<a id='line_973'>      was levelled with the ground: the inhabitants were destroyed or</a>
<a id='line_974'>      dispersed; and the appearance of some sick persons, who were</a>
<a id='line_975'>      still permitted to exist among the ruins of the churches, served</a>
<a id='line_976'>      only to increase the horror of the prospect. The surface of the</a>
<a id='line_977'>      country was covered with the bones of the slain; and the</a>
<a id='line_978'>      ambassadors, who directed their course to the north-west, were</a>
<a id='line_979'>      obliged to pass the hills of modern Servia, before they descended</a>
<a id='line_980'>      into the flat and marshy grounds which are terminated by the</a>
<a id='line_981'>      Danube. The Huns were masters of the great river: their</a>
<a id='line_982'>      navigation was performed in large canoes, hollowed out of the</a>
<a id='line_983'>      trunk of a single tree; the ministers of Theodosius were safely</a>
<a id='line_984'>      landed on the opposite bank; and their Barbarian associates</a>
<a id='line_985'>      immediately hastened to the camp of Attila, which was equally</a>
<a id='line_986'>      prepared for the amusements of hunting or of war. No sooner had</a>
<a id='line_987'>      Maximin advanced about two miles 4111 from the Danube, than he</a>
<a id='line_988'>      began to experience the fastidious insolence of the conqueror. He</a>
<a id='line_989'>      was sternly forbid to pitch his tents in a pleasant valley, lest</a>
<a id='line_990'>      he should infringe the distant awe that was due to the royal</a>
<a id='line_991'>      mansion. 4112 The ministers of Attila pressed them to communicate</a>
<a id='line_992'>      the business, and the instructions, which he reserved for the ear</a>
<a id='line_993'>      of their sovereign. When Maximin temperately urged the contrary</a>
<a id='line_994'>      practice of nations, he was still more confounded to find that</a>
<a id='line_995'>      the resolutions of the Sacred Consistory, those secrets (says</a>
<a id='line_996'>      Priscus) which should not be revealed to the gods themselves, had</a>
<a id='line_997'>      been treacherously disclosed to the public enemy. On his refusal</a>
<a id='line_998'>      to comply with such ignominious terms, the Imperial envoy was</a>
<a id='line_999'>      commanded instantly to depart; the order was recalled; it was</a>
<a id='line_1000'>      again repeated; and the Huns renewed their ineffectual attempts</a>
<a id='line_1001'>      to subdue the patient firmness of Maximin. At length, by the</a>
<a id='line_1002'>      intercession of Scotta, the brother of Onegesius, whose</a>
<a id='line_1003'>      friendship had been purchased by a liberal gift, he was admitted</a>
<a id='line_1004'>      to the royal presence; but, instead of obtaining a decisive</a>
<a id='line_1005'>      answer, he was compelled to undertake a remote journey towards</a>

<a id='line_1007'>      receiving, in the same camp, the ambassadors of the Eastern and</a>
<a id='line_1008'>      Western empires. His journey was regulated by the guides, who</a>
<a id='line_1009'>      obliged him to halt, to hasten his march, or to deviate from the</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      common road, as it best suited the convenience of the king. The</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      Romans, who traversed the plains of Hungary, suppose that they</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      passed several navigable rivers, either in canoes or portable</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      boats; but there is reason to suspect that the winding stream of</a>
<a id='line_1014'>      the Teyss, or Tibiscus, might present itself in different places</a>
<a id='line_1015'>      under different names. From the contiguous villages they received</a>
<a id='line_1016'>      a plentiful and regular supply of provisions; mead instead of</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      wine, millet in the place of bread, and a certain liquor named</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      camus, which according to the report of Priscus, was distilled</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      from barley. 42 Such fare might appear coarse and indelicate to</a>
<a id='line_1020'>      men who had tasted the luxury of Constantinople; but, in their</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      accidental distress, they were relieved by the gentleness and</a>
<a id='line_1022'>      hospitality of the same Barbarians, so terrible and so merciless</a>
<a id='line_1023'>      in war. The ambassadors had encamped on the edge of a large</a>
<a id='line_1024'>      morass. A violent tempest of wind and rain, of thunder and</a>
<a id='line_1025'>      lightning, overturned their tents, immersed their baggage and</a>
<a id='line_1026'>      furniture in the water, and scattered their retinue, who wandered</a>
<a id='line_1027'>      in the darkness of the night, uncertain of their road, and</a>
<a id='line_1028'>      apprehensive of some unknown danger, till they awakened by their</a>
<a id='line_1029'>      cries the inhabitants of a neighboring village, the property of</a>
<a id='line_1030'>      the widow of Bleda. A bright illumination, and, in a few moments,</a>
<a id='line_1031'>      a comfortable fire of reeds, was kindled by their officious</a>
<a id='line_1032'>      benevolence; the wants, and even the desires, of the Romans were</a>
<a id='line_1033'>      liberally satisfied; and they seem to have been embarrassed by</a>
<a id='line_1034'>      the singular politeness of Bleda’s widow, who added to her other</a>
<a id='line_1035'>      favors the gift, or at least the loan, of a sufficient number of</a>
<a id='line_1036'>      beautiful and obsequious damsels. The sunshine of the succeeding</a>
<a id='line_1037'>      day was dedicated to repose, to collect and dry the baggage, and</a>
<a id='line_1038'>      to the refreshment of the men and horses: but, in the evening,</a>
<a id='line_1039'>      before they pursued their journey, the ambassadors expressed</a>
<a id='line_1040'>      their gratitude to the bounteous lady of the village, by a very</a>
<a id='line_1041'>      acceptable present of silver cups, red fleeces, dried fruits, and</a>
<a id='line_1042'>      Indian pepper. Soon after this adventure, they rejoined the march</a>
<a id='line_1043'>      of Attila, from whom they had been separated about six days, and</a>
<a id='line_1044'>      slowly proceeded to the capital of an empire, which did not</a>
<a id='line_1045'>      contain, in the space of several thousand miles, a single city.</a>

<a id='line_1061'>      As far as we may ascertain the vague and obscure geography of</a>
<a id='line_1062'>      Priscus, this capital appears to have been seated between the</a>
<a id='line_1063'>      Danube, the Teyss, and the Carpathian hills, in the plains of</a>
<a id='line_1064'>      Upper Hungary, and most probably in the neighborhood of Jezberin,</a>
<a id='line_1065'>      Agria, or Tokay. 43 In its origin it could be no more than an</a>
<a id='line_1066'>      accidental camp, which, by the long and frequent residence of</a>
<a id='line_1067'>      Attila, had insensibly swelled into a huge village, for the</a>
<a id='line_1068'>      reception of his court, of the troops who followed his person,</a>
<a id='line_1069'>      and of the various multitude of idle or industrious slaves and</a>
<a id='line_1070'>      retainers. 44 The baths, constructed by Onegesius, were the only</a>
<a id='line_1071'>      edifice of stone; the materials had been transported from</a>
<a id='line_1072'>      Pannonia; and since the adjacent country was destitute even of</a>
<a id='line_1073'>      large timber, it may be presumed, that the meaner habitations of</a>
<a id='line_1074'>      the royal village consisted of straw, or mud, or of canvass. The</a>
<a id='line_1075'>      wooden houses of the more illustrious Huns were built and adorned</a>
<a id='line_1076'>      with rude magnificence, according to the rank, the fortune, or</a>
<a id='line_1077'>      the taste of the proprietors. They seem to have been distributed</a>
<a id='line_1078'>      with some degree of order and symmetry; and each spot became more</a>
<a id='line_1079'>      honorable as it approached the person of the sovereign. The</a>
<a id='line_1080'>      palace of Attila, which surpassed all other houses in his</a>
<a id='line_1081'>      dominions, was built entirely of wood, and covered an ample space</a>
<a id='line_1082'>      of ground. The outward enclosure was a lofty wall, or palisade,</a>
<a id='line_1083'>      of smooth square timber, intersected with high towers, but</a>
<a id='line_1084'>      intended rather for ornament than defence. This wall, which seems</a>
<a id='line_1085'>      to have encircled the declivity of a hill, comprehended a great</a>
<a id='line_1086'>      variety of wooden edifices, adapted to the uses of royalty.</a>
<a id='line_1087'></a>
<a id='line_1088'>      A separate house was assigned to each of the numerous wives of</a>
<a id='line_1089'>      Attila; and, instead of the rigid and illiberal confinement</a>
<a id='line_1090'>      imposed by Asiatic jealousy they politely admitted the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1091'>      ambassadors to their presence, their table, and even to the</a>
<a id='line_1092'>      freedom of an innocent embrace. When Maximin offered his presents</a>
<a id='line_1093'>      to Cerca, 4411 the principal queen, he admired the singular</a>
<a id='line_1094'>      architecture on her mansion, the height of the round columns, the</a>
<a id='line_1095'>      size and beauty of the wood, which was curiously shaped or turned</a>
<a id='line_1096'>      or polished or carved; and his attentive eye was able to discover</a>
<a id='line_1097'>      some taste in the ornaments and some regularity in the</a>
<a id='line_1098'>      proportions. After passing through the guards, who watched before</a>
<a id='line_1099'>      the gate, the ambassadors were introduced into the private</a>
<a id='line_1100'>      apartment of Cerca. The wife of Attila received their visit</a>
<a id='line_1101'>      sitting, or rather lying, on a soft couch; the floor was covered</a>
<a id='line_1102'>      with a carpet; the domestics formed a circle round the queen; and</a>
<a id='line_1103'>      her damsels, seated on the ground, were employed in working the</a>
<a id='line_1104'>      variegated embroidery which adorned the dress of the Barbaric</a>
<a id='line_1105'>      warriors. The Huns were ambitious of displaying those riches</a>
<a id='line_1106'>      which were the fruit and evidence of their victories: the</a>
<a id='line_1107'>      trappings of their horses, their swords, and even their shoes,</a>
<a id='line_1108'>      were studded with gold and precious stones; and their tables were</a>
<a id='line_1109'>      profusely spread with plates, and goblets, and vases of gold and</a>
<a id='line_1110'>      silver, which had been fashioned by the labor of Grecian artists.</a>
<a id='line_1111'></a>
<a id='line_1112'>      The monarch alone assumed the superior pride of still adhering to</a>
<a id='line_1113'>      the simplicity of his Scythian ancestors. 45 The dress of Attila,</a>
<a id='line_1114'>      his arms, and the furniture of his horse, were plain, without</a>
<a id='line_1115'>      ornament, and of a single color. The royal table was served in</a>
<a id='line_1116'>      wooden cups and platters; flesh was his only food; and the</a>
<a id='line_1117'>      conqueror of the North never tasted the luxury of bread.</a>

<a id='line_1119'>      43 (return) [ It is evident that Priscus passed the Danube and</a>
<a id='line_1120'>      the Teyss, and that he did not reach the foot of the Carpathian</a>

<a id='line_1130'>      precisely on the left branch of the Danube, where Attila’s</a>

<a id='line_1178'>      and impregnable, if it is our pleasure that it should be erased</a>

<a id='line_1180'>      returned to Constantinople with his peremptory demand of more</a>
<a id='line_1181'>      complete restitution, and a more splendid embassy.</a>

<a id='line_1184'>      marriage which he celebrated on the road with the daughter of</a>
<a id='line_1185'>      Eslam, 4511 might perhaps contribute to mollify the native</a>
<a id='line_1186'>      fierceness of his temper. The entrance of Attila into the royal</a>
<a id='line_1187'>      village was marked by a very singular ceremony. A numerous troop</a>
<a id='line_1188'>      of women came out to meet their hero and their king. They marched</a>
<a id='line_1189'>      before him, distributed into long and regular files; the</a>
<a id='line_1190'>      intervals between the files were filled by white veils of thin</a>
<a id='line_1191'>      linen, which the women on either side bore aloft in their hands,</a>
<a id='line_1192'>      and which formed a canopy for a chorus of young virgins, who</a>
<a id='line_1193'>      chanted hymns and songs in the Scythian language. The wife of his</a>
<a id='line_1194'>      favorite Onegesius, with a train of female attendants, saluted</a>
<a id='line_1195'>      Attila at the door of her own house, on his way to the palace;</a>
<a id='line_1196'>      and offered, according to the custom of the country, her</a>
<a id='line_1197'>      respectful homage, by entreating him to taste the wine and meat</a>
<a id='line_1198'>      which she had prepared for his reception. As soon as the monarch</a>
<a id='line_1199'>      had graciously accepted her hospitable gift, his domestics lifted</a>
<a id='line_1200'>      a small silver table to a convenient height, as he sat on</a>
<a id='line_1201'>      horseback; and Attila, when he had touched the goblet with his</a>
<a id='line_1202'>      lips, again saluted the wife of Onegesius, and continued his</a>
<a id='line_1203'>      march. During his residence at the seat of empire, his hours were</a>
<a id='line_1204'>      not wasted in the recluse idleness of a seraglio; and the king of</a>
<a id='line_1205'>      the Huns could maintain his superior dignity, without concealing</a>
<a id='line_1206'>      his person from the public view. He frequently assembled his</a>
<a id='line_1207'>      council, and gave audience to the ambassadors of the nations; and</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      his people might appeal to the supreme tribunal, which he held at</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      stated times, and, according to the Eastern custom, before the</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      principal gate of his wooden palace. The Romans, both of the East</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      and of the West, were twice invited to the banquets, where Attila</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      feasted with the princes and nobles of Scythia. Maximin and his</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      colleagues were stopped on the threshold, till they had made a</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      devout libation to the health and prosperity of the king of the</a>
<a id='line_1215'>      Huns; and were conducted, after this ceremony, to their</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      respective seats in a spacious hall. The royal table and couch,</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      covered with carpets and fine linen, was raised by several steps</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      in the midst of the hall; and a son, an uncle, or perhaps a</a>
<a id='line_1219'>      favorite king, were admitted to share the simple and homely</a>
<a id='line_1220'>      repast of Attila. Two lines of small tables, each of which</a>
<a id='line_1221'>      contained three or four guests, were ranged in order on either</a>
<a id='line_1222'>      hand; the right was esteemed the most honorable, but the Romans</a>
<a id='line_1223'>      ingenuously confess, that they were placed on the left; and that</a>
<a id='line_1224'>      Beric, an unknown chieftain, most probably of the Gothic race,</a>
<a id='line_1225'>      preceded the representatives of Theodosius and Valentinian. The</a>
<a id='line_1226'>      Barbarian monarch received from his cup-bearer a goblet filled</a>
<a id='line_1227'>      with wine, and courteously drank to the health of the most</a>
<a id='line_1228'>      distinguished guest; who rose from his seat, and expressed, in</a>
<a id='line_1229'>      the same manner, his loyal and respectful vows. This ceremony was</a>
<a id='line_1230'>      successively performed for all, or at least for the illustrious</a>
<a id='line_1231'>      persons of the assembly; and a considerable time must have been</a>
<a id='line_1232'>      consumed, since it was thrice repeated as each course or service</a>
<a id='line_1233'>      was placed on the table. But the wine still remained after the</a>
<a id='line_1234'>      meat had been removed; and the Huns continued to indulge their</a>
<a id='line_1235'>      intemperance long after the sober and decent ambassadors of the</a>
<a id='line_1236'>      two empires had withdrawn themselves from the nocturnal banquet.</a>
<a id='line_1237'>      Yet before they retired, they enjoyed a singular opportunity of</a>
<a id='line_1238'>      observing the manners of the nation in their convivial</a>
<a id='line_1239'>      amusements. Two Scythians stood before the couch of Attila, and</a>
<a id='line_1240'>      recited the verses which they had composed, to celebrate his</a>
<a id='line_1241'>      valor and his victories. 4512 A profound silence prevailed in the</a>
<a id='line_1242'>      hall; and the attention of the guests was captivated by the vocal</a>
<a id='line_1243'>      harmony, which revived and perpetuated the memory of their own</a>
<a id='line_1244'>      exploits; a martial ardor flashed from the eyes of the warriors,</a>
<a id='line_1245'>      who were impatient for battle; and the tears of the old men</a>
<a id='line_1246'>      expressed their generous despair, that they could no longer</a>
<a id='line_1247'>      partake the danger and glory of the field. 46 This entertainment,</a>
<a id='line_1248'>      which might be considered as a school of military virtue, was</a>

<a id='line_1254'>      the hall resounded with loud and licentious peals of laughter. In</a>
<a id='line_1255'>      the midst of this intemperate riot, Attila alone, without a</a>
<a id='line_1256'>      change of countenance, maintained his steadfast and inflexible</a>

<a id='line_1313'>      Franks, of the Burgundians, and of Aquitaine, submit themselves,</a>

<a id='line_1316'>      of Burgundy, his daughter Heldgund; the king of Aquitaine, his</a>
<a id='line_1317'>      son Walther. The main subject of the poem is the escape of</a>

<a id='line_1319'>      between Walther and Gunthar, king of the Franks. with his twelve</a>

<a id='line_1322'>      for his ferry over the Rhine with some strange fish, which he had</a>
<a id='line_1323'>      caught during his flight, and which were unknown in the waters of</a>

<a id='line_1405'>      some previous conversation, and a mutual oath of secrecy, the</a>
<a id='line_1406'>      eunuch, who had not, from his own feelings or experience, imbibed</a>

<a id='line_1412'>      readiness, to execute the bloody deed; the design was</a>

<a id='line_1416'>      dissimulation, or the repentance, of Edecon; and though he might</a>
<a id='line_1417'>      exaggerate his inward abhorrence for the treason, which he seemed</a>
<a id='line_1418'>      to approve, he dexterously assumed the merit of an early and</a>
<a id='line_1419'>      voluntary confession. If we now review the embassy of Maximin,</a>
<a id='line_1420'>      and the behavior of Attila, we must applaud the Barbarian, who</a>
<a id='line_1421'>      respected the laws of hospitality, and generously entertained and</a>
<a id='line_1422'>      dismissed the minister of a prince who had conspired against his</a>
<a id='line_1423'>      life. But the rashness of Vigilius will appear still more</a>
<a id='line_1424'>      extraordinary, since he returned, conscious of his guilt and</a>
<a id='line_1425'>      danger, to the royal camp, accompanied by his son, and carrying</a>
<a id='line_1426'>      with him a weighty purse of gold, which the favorite eunuch had</a>
<a id='line_1427'>      furnished, to satisfy the demands of Edecon, and to corrupt the</a>
<a id='line_1428'>      fidelity of the guards. The interpreter was instantly seized, and</a>
<a id='line_1429'>      dragged before the tribunal of Attila, where he asserted his</a>
<a id='line_1430'>      innocence with specious firmness, till the threat of inflicting</a>
<a id='line_1431'>      instant death on his son extorted from him a sincere discovery of</a>
<a id='line_1432'>      the criminal transaction. Under the name of ransom, or</a>
<a id='line_1433'>      confiscation, the rapacious king of the Huns accepted two hundred</a>
<a id='line_1434'>      pounds of gold for the life of a traitor, whom he disdained to</a>
<a id='line_1435'>      punish. He pointed his just indignation against a nobler object.</a>

<a id='line_1437'>      to Constantinople, with a peremptory instruction, which it was</a>

<a id='line_1439'>      entered the Imperial presence, with the fatal purse hanging down</a>
<a id='line_1440'>      from the neck of Orestes; who interrogated the eunuch</a>
<a id='line_1441'>      Chrysaphius, as he stood beside the throne, whether he recognized</a>
<a id='line_1442'>      the evidence of his guilt. But the office of reproof was reserved</a>
<a id='line_1443'>      for the superior dignity of his colleague Eslaw, who gravely</a>
<a id='line_1444'>      addressed the emperor of the East in the following words:</a>
<a id='line_1445'>      “Theodosius is the son of an illustrious and respectable parent:</a>
<a id='line_1446'>      Attila likewise is descended from a noble race; and he has</a>
<a id='line_1447'>      supported, by his actions, the dignity which he inherited from</a>
<a id='line_1448'>      his father Mundzuk. But Theodosius has forfeited his paternal</a>
<a id='line_1449'>      honors, and, by consenting to pay tribute has degraded himself to</a>
<a id='line_1450'>      the condition of a slave. It is therefore just, that he should</a>
<a id='line_1451'>      reverence the man whom fortune and merit have placed above him;</a>
<a id='line_1452'>      instead of attempting, like a wicked slave, clandestinely to</a>
<a id='line_1453'>      conspire against his master.” The son of Arcadius, who was</a>
<a id='line_1454'>      accustomed only to the voice of flattery, heard with astonishment</a>
<a id='line_1455'>      the severe language of truth: he blushed and trembled; nor did he</a>
<a id='line_1456'>      presume directly to refuse the head of Chrysaphius, which Eslaw</a>
<a id='line_1457'>      and Orestes were instructed to demand. A solemn embassy, armed</a>
<a id='line_1458'>      with full powers and magnificent gifts, was hastily sent to</a>

<a id='line_1501'>      ecclesiastical affairs by the pernicious influence of the</a>
<a id='line_1502'>      eunuchs, was unanimously proclaimed Empress of the East; and the</a>
<a id='line_1503'>      Romans, for the first time, submitted to a female reign. No</a>
<a id='line_1504'>      sooner had Pulcheria ascended the throne, than she indulged her</a>
<a id='line_1505'>      own and the public resentment, by an act of popular justice.</a>
<a id='line_1506'>      Without any legal trial, the eunuch Chrysaphius was executed</a>
<a id='line_1507'>      before the gates of the city; and the immense riches which had</a>
<a id='line_1508'>      been accumulated by the rapacious favorite, served only to hasten</a>
<a id='line_1509'>      and to justify his punishment. 51 Amidst the general acclamations</a>
<a id='line_1510'>      of the clergy and people, the empress did not forget the</a>
<a id='line_1511'>      prejudice and disadvantage to which her sex was exposed; and she</a>
<a id='line_1512'>      wisely resolved to prevent their murmurs by the choice of a</a>
<a id='line_1513'>      colleague, who would always respect the superior rank and virgin</a>
<a id='line_1514'>      chastity of his wife. She gave her hand to Marcian, a senator,</a>
<a id='line_1515'>      about sixty years of age; and the nominal husband of Pulcheria</a>
<a id='line_1516'>      was solemnly invested with the Imperial purple. The zeal which he</a>
<a id='line_1517'>      displayed for the orthodox creed, as it was established by the</a>
<a id='line_1518'>      council of Chalcedon, would alone have inspired the grateful</a>
<a id='line_1519'>      eloquence of the Catholics. But the behavior of Marcian in a</a>
<a id='line_1520'>      private life, and afterwards on the throne, may support a more</a>
<a id='line_1521'>      rational belief, that he was qualified to restore and invigorate</a>
<a id='line_1522'>      an empire, which had been almost dissolved by the successive</a>
<a id='line_1523'>      weakness of two hereditary monarchs. He was born in Thrace, and</a>
<a id='line_1524'>      educated to the profession of arms; but Marcian’s youth had been</a>
<a id='line_1525'>      severely exercised by poverty and misfortune, since his only</a>
<a id='line_1526'>      resource, when he first arrived at Constantinople, consisted in</a>
<a id='line_1527'>      two hundred pieces of gold, which he had borrowed of a friend. He</a>
<a id='line_1528'>      passed nineteen years in the domestic and military service of</a>
<a id='line_1529'>      Aspar, and his son Ardaburius; followed those powerful generals</a>
<a id='line_1530'>      to the Persian and African wars; and obtained, by their</a>
<a id='line_1531'>      influence, the honorable rank of tribune and senator. His mild</a>
<a id='line_1532'>      disposition, and useful talents, without alarming the jealousy,</a>
<a id='line_1533'>      recommended Marcian to the esteem and favor of his patrons; he</a>
<a id='line_1534'>      had seen, perhaps he had felt, the abuses of a venal and</a>
<a id='line_1535'>      oppressive administration; and his own example gave weight and</a>
<a id='line_1536'>      energy to the laws, which he promulgated for the reformation of</a>
<a id='line_1537'>      manners. 52</a>
