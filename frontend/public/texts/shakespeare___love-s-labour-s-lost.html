<a id='line_32'>  KING. Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,</a>
<a id='line_33'>    Live regist'red upon our brazen tombs,</a>
<a id='line_34'>    And then grace us in the disgrace of death;</a>
<a id='line_35'>    When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,</a>
<a id='line_36'>    Th' endeavour of this present breath may buy</a>
<a id='line_37'>    That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge,</a>
<a id='line_38'>    And make us heirs of all eternity.</a>
<a id='line_39'>    Therefore, brave conquerors- for so you are</a>
<a id='line_40'>    That war against your own affections</a>
<a id='line_41'>    And the huge army of the world's desires-</a>
<a id='line_42'>    Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:</a>
<a id='line_43'>    Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;</a>
<a id='line_44'>    Our court shall be a little Academe,</a>
<a id='line_45'>    Still and contemplative in living art.</a>
<a id='line_46'>    You three, Berowne, Dumain, and Longaville,</a>
<a id='line_47'>    Have sworn for three years' term to live with me</a>
<a id='line_48'>    My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes</a>
<a id='line_49'>    That are recorded in this schedule here.</a>
<a id='line_50'>    Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,</a>
<a id='line_51'>    That his own hand may strike his honour down</a>
<a id='line_52'>    That violates the smallest branch herein.</a>
<a id='line_53'>    If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,</a>
<a id='line_54'>    Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.</a>
<a id='line_55'>  LONGAVILLE. I am resolv'd; 'tis but a three years' fast.</a>
<a id='line_56'>    The mind shall banquet, though the body pine.</a>
<a id='line_57'>    Fat paunches have lean pates; and dainty bits</a>
<a id='line_58'>    Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.</a>
<a id='line_59'>  DUMAIN. My loving lord, Dumain is mortified.</a>
<a id='line_60'>    The grosser manner of these world's delights</a>
<a id='line_61'>    He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves;</a>
<a id='line_62'>    To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die,</a>
<a id='line_63'>    With all these living in philosophy.</a>
<a id='line_64'>  BEROWNE. I can but say their protestation over;</a>
<a id='line_65'>    So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,</a>
<a id='line_66'>    That is, to live and study here three years.</a>
<a id='line_67'>    But there are other strict observances,</a>
<a id='line_68'>    As: not to see a woman in that term,</a>
<a id='line_69'>    Which I hope well is not enrolled there;</a>
<a id='line_70'>    And one day in a week to touch no food,</a>
<a id='line_71'>    And but one meal on every day beside,</a>
<a id='line_72'>    The which I hope is not enrolled there;</a>
<a id='line_73'>    And then to sleep but three hours in the night</a>
<a id='line_74'>    And not be seen to wink of all the day-</a>
<a id='line_75'>    When I was wont to think no harm all night,</a>
<a id='line_76'>    And make a dark night too of half the day-</a>
<a id='line_77'>    Which I hope well is not enrolled there.</a>
<a id='line_78'>    O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,</a>
<a id='line_79'>    Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!</a>
<a id='line_80'>  KING. Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.</a>
<a id='line_81'>  BEROWNE. Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:</a>
<a id='line_82'>    I only swore to study with your Grace,</a>
<a id='line_83'>    And stay here in your court for three years' space.</a>
<a id='line_84'>  LONGAVILLE. You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.</a>
<a id='line_85'>  BEROWNE. By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.</a>
<a id='line_86'>    What is the end of study, let me know.</a>
<a id='line_87'>  KING. Why, that to know which else we should not know.</a>
<a id='line_88'>  BEROWNE. Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?</a>
<a id='line_89'>  KING. Ay, that is study's god-like recompense.</a>
<a id='line_90'>  BEROWNE. Come on, then; I will swear to study so,</a>
<a id='line_91'>    To know the thing I am forbid to know,</a>
<a id='line_92'>    As thus: to study where I well may dine,</a>
<a id='line_93'>    When I to feast expressly am forbid;</a>
<a id='line_94'>    Or study where to meet some mistress fine,</a>
<a id='line_95'>    When mistresses from common sense are hid;</a>
<a id='line_96'>    Or, having sworn too hard-a-keeping oath,</a>
<a id='line_97'>    Study to break it, and not break my troth.</a>
<a id='line_98'>    If study's gain be thus, and this be so,</a>
<a id='line_99'>    Study knows that which yet it doth not know.</a>
<a id='line_100'>    Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.</a>
<a id='line_101'>  KING. These be the stops that hinder study quite,</a>
<a id='line_102'>    And train our intellects to vain delight.</a>
<a id='line_103'>  BEROWNE. Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain</a>
<a id='line_104'>    Which, with pain purchas'd, doth inherit pain,</a>
<a id='line_105'>    As painfully to pore upon a book</a>
<a id='line_106'>    To seek the light of truth; while truth the while</a>
<a id='line_107'>    Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look.</a>
<a id='line_108'>    Light, seeking light, doth light of light beguile;</a>
<a id='line_109'>    So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,</a>
<a id='line_110'>    Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.</a>
<a id='line_111'>    Study me how to please the eye indeed,</a>
<a id='line_112'>    By fixing it upon a fairer eye;</a>
<a id='line_113'>    Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed,</a>
<a id='line_114'>    And give him light that it was blinded by.</a>
<a id='line_115'>    Study is like the heaven's glorious sun,</a>
<a id='line_116'>    That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks;</a>
<a id='line_117'>    Small have continual plodders ever won,</a>
<a id='line_118'>    Save base authority from others' books.</a>
<a id='line_119'>    These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights</a>
<a id='line_120'>    That give a name to every fixed star</a>
<a id='line_121'>    Have no more profit of their shining nights</a>
<a id='line_122'>    Than those that walk and wot not what they are.</a>
<a id='line_123'>    Too much to know is to know nought but fame;</a>
<a id='line_124'>    And every godfather can give a name.</a>
<a id='line_125'>  KING. How well he's read, to reason against reading!</a>
<a id='line_126'>  DUMAIN. Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!</a>
<a id='line_127'>  LONGAVILLE. He weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding.</a>
<a id='line_128'>  BEROWNE. The spring is near, when green geese are a-breeding.</a>
<a id='line_129'>  DUMAIN. How follows that?</a>
<a id='line_130'>  BEROWNE. Fit in his place and time.</a>
<a id='line_131'>  DUMAIN. In reason nothing.</a>
<a id='line_132'>  BEROWNE. Something then in rhyme.</a>
<a id='line_133'>  LONGAVILLE. Berowne is like an envious sneaping frost</a>
<a id='line_134'>    That bites the first-born infants of the spring.</a>
<a id='line_135'>  BEROWNE. Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast</a>
<a id='line_136'>    Before the birds have any cause to sing?</a>
<a id='line_137'>    Why should I joy in any abortive birth?</a>
<a id='line_138'>    At Christmas I no more desire a rose</a>
<a id='line_139'>    Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled shows;</a>
<a id='line_140'>    But like of each thing that in season grows;</a>
<a id='line_141'>    So you, to study now it is too late,</a>
<a id='line_142'>    Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.</a>
<a id='line_143'>  KING. Well, sit out; go home, Berowne; adieu.</a>
<a id='line_144'>  BEROWNE. No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you;</a>
<a id='line_145'>    And though I have for barbarism spoke more</a>
<a id='line_146'>    Than for that angel knowledge you can say,</a>
<a id='line_147'>    Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore,</a>
<a id='line_148'>    And bide the penance of each three years' day.</a>
<a id='line_149'>    Give me the paper; let me read the same;</a>
<a id='line_150'>    And to the strictest decrees I'll write my name.</a>
<a id='line_151'>  KING. How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!</a>
<a id='line_152'>  BEROWNE. [Reads] 'Item. That no woman shall come within a mile of</a>
<a id='line_153'>    my court'- Hath this been proclaimed?</a>
<a id='line_154'>  LONGAVILLE. Four days ago.</a>
<a id='line_155'>  BEROWNE. Let's see the penalty. [Reads] '-on pain of losing her</a>
<a id='line_156'>    tongue.' Who devis'd this penalty?</a>
<a id='line_157'>  LONGAVILLE. Marry, that did I.</a>
<a id='line_158'>  BEROWNE. Sweet lord, and why?</a>
<a id='line_159'>  LONGAVILLE. To fright them hence with that dread penalty.</a>
<a id='line_160'>  BEROWNE. A dangerous law against gentility.</a>
<a id='line_161'>    [Reads] 'Item. If any man be seen to talk with a woman within</a>
<a id='line_162'>    the term of three years, he shall endure such public shame as the</a>
<a id='line_163'>    rest of the court can possibly devise.'</a>
<a id='line_164'>    This article, my liege, yourself must break;</a>
<a id='line_165'>    For well you know here comes in embassy</a>
<a id='line_166'>    The French king's daughter, with yourself to speak-</a>
<a id='line_167'>    A mild of grace and complete majesty-</a>
<a id='line_168'>    About surrender up of Aquitaine</a>
<a id='line_169'>    To her decrepit, sick, and bedrid father;</a>
<a id='line_170'>    Therefore this article is made in vain,</a>
<a id='line_171'>    Or vainly comes th' admired princess hither.</a>
<a id='line_172'>  KING. What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.</a>
<a id='line_173'>  BEROWNE. So study evermore is over-shot.</a>
<a id='line_174'>    While it doth study to have what it would,</a>
<a id='line_175'>    It doth forget to do the thing it should;</a>
<a id='line_176'>    And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,</a>
<a id='line_177'>    'Tis won as towns with fire- so won, so lost.</a>
<a id='line_178'>  KING. We must of force dispense with this decree;</a>
<a id='line_179'>    She must lie here on mere necessity.</a>
<a id='line_180'>  BEROWNE. Necessity will make us all forsworn</a>
<a id='line_181'>    Three thousand times within this three years' space;</a>
<a id='line_182'>    For every man with his affects is born,</a>
<a id='line_183'>    Not by might mast'red, but by special grace.</a>
<a id='line_184'>    If I break faith, this word shall speak for me:</a>
<a id='line_185'>    I am forsworn on mere necessity.</a>
<a id='line_186'>    So to the laws at large I write my name;        [Subscribes]</a>
<a id='line_187'>    And he that breaks them in the least degree</a>
<a id='line_188'>    Stands in attainder of eternal shame.</a>
<a id='line_189'>    Suggestions are to other as to me;</a>
<a id='line_190'>    But I believe, although I seem so loath,</a>
<a id='line_191'>    I am the last that will last keep his oath.</a>
<a id='line_192'>    But is there no quick recreation granted?</a>
<a id='line_193'>  KING. Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted</a>
<a id='line_194'>    With a refined traveller of Spain,</a>
<a id='line_195'>    A man in all the world's new fashion planted,</a>
<a id='line_196'>    That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;</a>
<a id='line_197'>    One who the music of his own vain tongue</a>
<a id='line_198'>    Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;</a>
<a id='line_199'>    A man of complements, whom right and wrong</a>
<a id='line_200'>    Have chose as umpire of their mutiny.</a>
<a id='line_201'>    This child of fancy, that Armado hight,</a>
<a id='line_202'>    For interim to our studies shall relate,</a>
<a id='line_203'>    In high-born words, the worth of many a knight</a>
<a id='line_204'>    From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.</a>
<a id='line_205'>    How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;</a>
<a id='line_206'>    But I protest I love to hear him lie,</a>
<a id='line_207'>    And I will use him for my minstrelsy.</a>
<a id='line_208'>  BEROWNE. Armado is a most illustrious wight,</a>
<a id='line_209'>    A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.</a>
<a id='line_210'>  LONGAVILLE. Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;</a>
<a id='line_211'>    And so to study three years is but short.</a>
<a id='line_212'></a>
<a id='line_213'>      Enter DULL, a constable, with a letter, and COSTARD</a>
<a id='line_214'></a>
<a id='line_215'>  DULL. Which is the Duke's own person?</a>
<a id='line_216'>  BEROWNE. This, fellow. What wouldst?</a>
<a id='line_217'>  DULL. I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his Grace's</a>
<a id='line_218'>    farborough; but I would see his own person in flesh and blood.</a>
<a id='line_219'>  BEROWNE. This is he.</a>
<a id='line_220'>  DULL. Signior Arme- Arme- commends you. There's villainy abroad;</a>
<a id='line_221'>    this letter will tell you more.</a>
<a id='line_222'>  COSTARD. Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.</a>
<a id='line_223'>  KING. A letter from the magnificent Armado.</a>
<a id='line_224'>  BEROWNE. How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.</a>
<a id='line_225'>  LONGAVILLE. A high hope for a low heaven. God grant us patience!</a>
<a id='line_226'>  BEROWNE. To hear, or forbear hearing?</a>
<a id='line_227'>  LONGAVILLE. To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or, to</a>
<a id='line_228'>    forbear both.</a>
<a id='line_229'>  BEROWNE. Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to climb</a>
<a id='line_230'>    in the merriness.</a>
<a id='line_231'>  COSTARD. The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.</a>
<a id='line_232'>    The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.</a>
<a id='line_233'>  BEROWNE. In what manner?</a>
<a id='line_234'>  COSTARD. In manner and form following, sir; all those three: I was</a>
<a id='line_235'>    seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with her upon the form,</a>
<a id='line_236'>    and taken following her into the park; which, put together, is in</a>
<a id='line_237'>    manner and form following. Now, sir, for the manner- it is the</a>
<a id='line_238'>    manner of a man to speak to a woman. For the form- in some form.</a>
<a id='line_239'>  BEROWNE. For the following, sir?</a>
<a id='line_240'>  COSTARD. As it shall follow in my correction; and God defend the</a>
<a id='line_241'>    right!</a>
<a id='line_242'>  KING. Will you hear this letter with attention?</a>
<a id='line_243'>  BEROWNE. As we would hear an oracle.</a>
<a id='line_244'>  COSTARD. Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.</a>
<a id='line_245'>  KING. [Reads] 'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and sole</a>

<a id='line_252'>  KING. Peace!</a>
<a id='line_253'>  COSTARD. Be to me, and every man that dares not fight!</a>
<a id='line_254'>  KING. No words!</a>

<a id='line_294'>  BEROWNE. This is not so well as I look'd for, but the best that</a>
<a id='line_295'>    ever I heard.</a>
<a id='line_296'>  KING. Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say you to</a>
<a id='line_297'>    this?</a>
<a id='line_298'>  COSTARD. Sir, I confess the wench.</a>
<a id='line_299'>  KING. Did you hear the proclamation?</a>
<a id='line_300'>  COSTARD. I do confess much of the hearing it, but little of the</a>
<a id='line_301'>    marking of it.</a>
<a id='line_302'>  KING. It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken with a</a>
<a id='line_303'>    wench.</a>
<a id='line_304'>  COSTARD. I was taken with none, sir; I was taken with a damsel.</a>
<a id='line_305'>  KING. Well, it was proclaimed damsel.</a>
<a id='line_306'>  COSTARD. This was no damsel neither, sir; she was a virgin.</a>
<a id='line_307'>  KING. It is so varied too, for it was proclaimed virgin.</a>
<a id='line_308'>  COSTARD. If it were, I deny her virginity; I was taken with a maid.</a>
<a id='line_309'>  KING. This 'maid' not serve your turn, sir.</a>
<a id='line_310'>  COSTARD. This maid will serve my turn, sir.</a>
<a id='line_311'>  KING. Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast a week</a>
<a id='line_312'>    with bran and water.</a>
<a id='line_313'>  COSTARD. I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.</a>
<a id='line_314'>  KING. And Don Armado shall be your keeper.</a>
<a id='line_315'>    My Lord Berowne, see him delivered o'er;</a>
<a id='line_316'>    And go we, lords, to put in practice that</a>
<a id='line_317'>    Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.</a>
<a id='line_318'>                             Exeunt KING, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN</a>
<a id='line_319'>  BEROWNE. I'll lay my head to any good man's hat</a>
<a id='line_320'>    These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.</a>
<a id='line_321'>    Sirrah, come on.</a>
<a id='line_322'>  COSTARD. I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is I was taken</a>
<a id='line_323'>    with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true girl; and therefore</a>
<a id='line_324'>    welcome the sour cup of prosperity! Affliction may one day smile</a>
<a id='line_325'>    again; and till then, sit thee down, sorrow.</a>

<a id='line_330'>Enter ARMADO and MOTH, his page</a>
<a id='line_331'></a>
<a id='line_332'>  ARMADO. Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows</a>
<a id='line_333'>    melancholy?</a>
<a id='line_334'>  MOTH. A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.</a>
<a id='line_335'>  ARMADO. Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.</a>
<a id='line_336'>  MOTH. No, no; O Lord, sir, no!</a>
<a id='line_337'>  ARMADO. How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my tender</a>
<a id='line_338'>    juvenal?</a>
<a id='line_339'>  MOTH. By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough signior.</a>
<a id='line_340'>  ARMADO. Why tough signior? Why tough signior?</a>
<a id='line_341'>  MOTH. Why tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal?</a>
<a id='line_342'>  ARMADO. I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton</a>
<a id='line_343'>    appertaining to thy young days, which we may nominate tender.</a>
<a id='line_344'>  MOTH. And I, tough signior, as an appertinent title to your old</a>
<a id='line_345'>    time, which we may name tough.</a>
<a id='line_346'>  ARMADO. Pretty and apt.</a>
<a id='line_347'>  MOTH. How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or I apt, and</a>
<a id='line_348'>    my saying pretty?</a>
<a id='line_349'>  ARMADO. Thou pretty, because little.</a>
<a id='line_350'>  MOTH. Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?</a>
<a id='line_351'>  ARMADO. And therefore apt, because quick.</a>
<a id='line_352'>  MOTH. Speak you this in my praise, master?</a>
<a id='line_353'>  ARMADO. In thy condign praise.</a>
<a id='line_354'>  MOTH. I will praise an eel with the same praise.</a>
<a id='line_355'>  ARMADO. that an eel is ingenious?</a>
<a id='line_356'>  MOTH. That an eel is quick.</a>
<a id='line_357'>  ARMADO. I do say thou art quick in answers; thou heat'st my blood.</a>
<a id='line_358'>  MOTH. I am answer'd, sir.</a>
<a id='line_359'>  ARMADO. I love not to be cross'd.</a>
<a id='line_360'>  MOTH. [Aside] He speaks the mere contrary: crosses love not him.</a>
<a id='line_361'>  ARMADO. I have promised to study three years with the Duke.</a>
<a id='line_362'>  MOTH. You may do it in an hour, sir.</a>
<a id='line_363'>  ARMADO. Impossible.</a>
<a id='line_364'>  MOTH. How many is one thrice told?</a>
<a id='line_365'>  ARMADO. I am ill at reck'ning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.</a>
<a id='line_366'>  MOTH. You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.</a>
<a id='line_367'>  ARMADO. I confess both; they are both the varnish of a complete</a>
<a id='line_368'>    man.</a>
<a id='line_369'>  MOTH. Then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace</a>
<a id='line_370'>    amounts to.</a>
<a id='line_371'>  ARMADO. It doth amount to one more than two.</a>
<a id='line_372'>  MOTH. Which the base vulgar do call three.</a>
<a id='line_373'>  ARMADO. True.</a>
<a id='line_374'>  MOTH. Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here is three</a>
<a id='line_375'>    studied ere ye'll thrice wink; and how easy it is to put 'years'</a>
<a id='line_376'>    to the word 'three,' and study three years in two words, the</a>
<a id='line_377'>    dancing horse will tell you.</a>
<a id='line_378'>  ARMADO. A most fine figure!</a>
<a id='line_379'>  MOTH. [Aside] To prove you a cipher.</a>
<a id='line_380'>  ARMADO. I will hereupon confess I am in love. And as it is base for</a>
<a id='line_381'>    a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing</a>
<a id='line_382'>    my sword against the humour of affection would deliver me from</a>
<a id='line_383'>    the reprobate thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and</a>
<a id='line_384'>    ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devis'd curtsy. I</a>
<a id='line_385'>    think scorn to sigh; methinks I should out-swear Cupid. Comfort</a>
<a id='line_386'>    me, boy; what great men have been in love?</a>
<a id='line_387'>  MOTH. Hercules, master.</a>
<a id='line_388'>  ARMADO. Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more;</a>
<a id='line_389'>    and, sweet my child, let them be men of good repute and carriage.</a>
<a id='line_390'>  MOTH. Samson, master; he was a man of good carriage, great</a>
<a id='line_391'>    carriage, for he carried the town gates on his back like a</a>
<a id='line_392'>    porter; and he was in love.</a>
<a id='line_393'>  ARMADO. O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee</a>
<a id='line_394'>    in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates. I am in</a>
<a id='line_395'>    love too. Who was Samson's love, my dear Moth?</a>
<a id='line_396'>  MOTH. A woman, master.</a>
<a id='line_397'>  ARMADO. Of what complexion?</a>
<a id='line_398'>  MOTH. Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the</a>
<a id='line_399'>    four.</a>
<a id='line_400'>  ARMADO. Tell me precisely of what complexion.</a>
<a id='line_401'>  MOTH. Of the sea-water green, sir.</a>
<a id='line_402'>  ARMADO. Is that one of the four complexions?</a>
<a id='line_403'>  MOTH. As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.</a>
<a id='line_404'>  ARMADO. Green, indeed, is the colour of lovers; but to have a love</a>
<a id='line_405'>    of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason for it. He</a>
<a id='line_406'>    surely affected her for her wit.</a>
<a id='line_407'>  MOTH. It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.</a>
<a id='line_408'>  ARMADO. My love is most immaculate white and red.</a>
<a id='line_409'>  MOTH. Most maculate thoughts, master, are mask'd under such</a>
<a id='line_410'>    colours.</a>
<a id='line_411'>  ARMADO. Define, define, well-educated infant.</a>
<a id='line_412'>  MOTH. My father's wit my mother's tongue assist me!</a>
<a id='line_413'>  ARMADO. Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty, and pathetical!</a>
<a id='line_414'>  MOTH.      If she be made of white and red,</a>
<a id='line_415'>               Her faults will ne'er be known;</a>
<a id='line_416'>             For blushing cheeks by faults are bred,</a>
<a id='line_417'>               And fears by pale white shown.</a>
<a id='line_418'>             Then if she fear, or be to blame,</a>
<a id='line_419'>               By this you shall not know;</a>
<a id='line_420'>             For still her cheeks possess the same</a>
<a id='line_421'>               Which native she doth owe.</a>
<a id='line_422'>    A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.</a>
<a id='line_423'>  ARMADO. Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?</a>
<a id='line_424'>  MOTH. The world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages</a>
<a id='line_425'>    since; but I think now 'tis not to be found; or if it were, it</a>
<a id='line_426'>    would neither serve for the writing nor the tune.</a>
<a id='line_427'>  ARMADO. I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may</a>
<a id='line_428'>    example my digression by some mighty precedent. Boy, I do love</a>
<a id='line_429'>    that country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind</a>
<a id='line_430'>    Costard; she deserves well.</a>
<a id='line_431'>  MOTH. [Aside] To be whipt; and yet a better love than my master.</a>
<a id='line_432'>  ARMADO. Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.</a>
<a id='line_433'>  MOTH. And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.</a>
<a id='line_434'>  ARMADO. I say, sing.</a>
<a id='line_435'>  MOTH. Forbear till this company be past.</a>
<a id='line_436'></a>
<a id='line_437'>                Enter DULL, COSTARD, and JAQUENETTA</a>
<a id='line_438'></a>
<a id='line_439'>  DULL. Sir, the Duke's pleasure is that you keep Costard safe; and</a>
<a id='line_440'>    you must suffer him to take no delight nor no penance; but 'a</a>
<a id='line_441'>    must fast three days a week. For this damsel, I must keep her at</a>
<a id='line_442'>    the park; she is allow'd for the day-woman. Fare you well.</a>
<a id='line_443'>  ARMADO. I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!</a>
<a id='line_444'>  JAQUENETTA. Man!</a>
<a id='line_445'>  ARMADO. I will visit thee at the lodge.</a>
<a id='line_446'>  JAQUENETTA. That's hereby.</a>
<a id='line_447'>  ARMADO. I know where it is situate.</a>
<a id='line_448'>  JAQUENETTA. Lord, how wise you are!</a>
<a id='line_449'>  ARMADO. I will tell thee wonders.</a>
<a id='line_450'>  JAQUENETTA. With that face?</a>
<a id='line_451'>  ARMADO. I love thee.</a>
<a id='line_452'>  JAQUENETTA. So I heard you say.</a>
<a id='line_453'>  ARMADO. And so, farewell.</a>
<a id='line_454'>  JAQUENETTA. Fair weather after you!</a>
<a id='line_455'>  DULL. Come, Jaquenetta, away.             Exit with JAQUENETTA</a>
<a id='line_456'>  ARMADO. Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be</a>
<a id='line_457'>    pardoned.</a>
<a id='line_458'>  COSTARD. Well, sir, I hope when I do it I shall do it on a full</a>
<a id='line_459'>    stomach.</a>
<a id='line_460'>  ARMADO. Thou shalt be heavily punished.</a>
<a id='line_461'>  COSTARD. I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they are but</a>
<a id='line_462'>    lightly rewarded.</a>
<a id='line_463'>  ARMADO. Take away this villain; shut him up.</a>
<a id='line_464'>  MOTH. Come, you transgressing slave, away.</a>
<a id='line_465'>  COSTARD. Let me not be pent up, sir; I will fast, being loose.</a>
<a id='line_466'>  MOTH. No, sir; that were fast, and loose. Thou shalt to prison.</a>
<a id='line_467'>  COSTARD. Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I</a>
<a id='line_468'>    have seen, some shall see.</a>
<a id='line_469'>  MOTH. What shall some see?</a>
<a id='line_470'>  COSTARD. Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon. It is</a>
<a id='line_471'>    not for prisoners to be too silent in their words, and therefore</a>
<a id='line_472'>    I will say nothing. I thank God I have as little patience as</a>
<a id='line_473'>    another man, and therefore I can be quiet.</a>
<a id='line_474'>                                         Exeunt MOTH and COSTARD</a>
<a id='line_475'>  ARMADO. I do affect the very ground, which is base, where her shoe,</a>
<a id='line_476'>    which is baser, guided by her foot, which is basest, doth tread.</a>
<a id='line_477'>    I shall be forsworn- which is a great argument of falsehood- if I</a>
<a id='line_478'>    love. And how can that be true love which is falsely attempted?</a>
<a id='line_479'>    Love is a familiar; Love is a devil. There is no evil angel but</a>
<a id='line_480'>    Love. Yet was Samson so tempted, and he had an excellent</a>
<a id='line_481'>    strength; yet was Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.</a>
<a id='line_482'>    Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club, and therefore</a>
<a id='line_483'>    too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier. The first and second cause</a>
<a id='line_484'>    will not serve my turn; the passado he respects not, the duello</a>
<a id='line_485'>    he regards not; his disgrace is to be called boy, but his glory</a>
<a id='line_486'>    is to subdue men. Adieu, valour; rust, rapier; be still, drum;</a>
<a id='line_487'>    for your manager is in love; yea, he loveth. Assist me, some</a>

<a id='line_498'>    Consider who the King your father sends,</a>

<a id='line_509'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,</a>

<a id='line_550'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?</a>
<a id='line_551'>  MARIA. They say so most that most his humours know.</a>
<a id='line_552'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Such short-liv'd wits do wither as they grow.</a>

<a id='line_989'>  BOYET. I know not; but I think it was not he.</a>

<a id='line_996'>    A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.</a>

<a id='line_999'>  FORESTER. Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.</a>
<a id='line_1000'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. What, what? First praise me, and again say no?</a>

<a id='line_1162'>    a good conscience.</a>
<a id='line_1163'>  HOLOFERNES. The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe as</a>

<a id='line_1168'>    varied, like a scholar at the least; but, sir, I assure ye it was</a>
<a id='line_1169'>    a buck of the first head.</a>
<a id='line_1170'>  HOLOFERNES. Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.</a>
<a id='line_1171'>  DULL. 'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.</a>
<a id='line_1172'>  HOLOFERNES. Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of insinuation,</a>
<a id='line_1173'>    as it were, in via, in way, of explication; facere, as it were,</a>

<a id='line_1183'>    He hath not eat paper, as it were; he hath not drunk ink; his</a>

<a id='line_1198'>  DULL. What is Dictynna?</a>
<a id='line_1199'>  NATHANIEL. A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.</a>
<a id='line_1200'>  HOLOFERNES. The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,</a>

<a id='line_1205'>    the exchange.</a>
<a id='line_1206'>  DULL. And I say the polusion holds in the exchange; for the moon is</a>
<a id='line_1207'>    never but a month old; and I say, beside, that 'twas a pricket</a>
<a id='line_1208'>    that the Princess kill'd.</a>
<a id='line_1209'>  HOLOFERNES. Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph on</a>
<a id='line_1210'>    the death of the deer? And, to humour the ignorant, call the deer</a>
<a id='line_1211'>    the Princess kill'd a pricket.</a>

<a id='line_1213'>    you to abrogate scurrility.</a>
<a id='line_1214'>  HOLOFERNES. I Will something affect the letter, for it argues</a>

<a id='line_1216'></a>
<a id='line_1217'>    The preyful Princess pierc'd and prick'd a pretty pleasing</a>

<a id='line_1225'>  NATHANIEL. A rare talent!</a>
<a id='line_1226'>  DULL. [Aside] If a talent be a claw, look how he claws him with a</a>
<a id='line_1227'>    talent.</a>
<a id='line_1228'>  HOLOFERNES. This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a foolish</a>
<a id='line_1229'>    extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures, shapes, objects,</a>
<a id='line_1230'>    ideas, apprehensions, motions, revolutions. These are begot in</a>

<a id='line_1232'>    delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the gift is good in</a>
<a id='line_1233'>    those in whom it is acute, and I am thankful for it.</a>
<a id='line_1234'>  NATHANIEL. Sir, I praise the Lord for you, and so may my</a>

<a id='line_1663'>    As motion and long-during action tires</a>
<a id='line_1664'>    The sinewy vigour of the traveller.</a>
<a id='line_1665'>    Now, for not looking on a woman's face,</a>
<a id='line_1666'>    You have in that forsworn the use of eyes,</a>

<a id='line_1675'>    O, we have made a vow to study, lords,</a>

<a id='line_1689'>    Above their functions and their offices.</a>
<a id='line_1690'>    It adds a precious seeing to the eye:</a>
<a id='line_1691'>    A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind.</a>
<a id='line_1692'>    A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,</a>
<a id='line_1693'>    When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd.</a>
<a id='line_1694'>    Love's feeling is more soft and sensible</a>
<a id='line_1695'>    Than are the tender horns of cockled snails:</a>
<a id='line_1696'>    Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste.</a>
<a id='line_1697'>    For valour, is not Love a Hercules,</a>
<a id='line_1698'>    Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?</a>
<a id='line_1699'>    Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical</a>
<a id='line_1700'>    As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair.</a>
<a id='line_1701'>    And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods</a>

<a id='line_1704'>    Until his ink were temp'red with Love's sighs;</a>
<a id='line_1705'>    O, then his lines would ravish savage ears,</a>

<a id='line_1748'></a>
<a id='line_1749'>  HOLOFERNES. Satis quod sufficit.</a>
<a id='line_1750'>  NATHANIEL. I praise God for you, sir. Your reasons at dinner have</a>
<a id='line_1751'>    been sharp and sententious; pleasant without scurrility, witty</a>
<a id='line_1752'>    without affection, audacious without impudency, learned without</a>

<a id='line_1755'>    or called, Don Adriano de Armado.</a>
<a id='line_1756'>  HOLOFERNES. Novi hominem tanquam te. His humour is lofty, his</a>

<a id='line_1758'>    gait majestical and his general behaviour vain, ridiculous, and</a>
<a id='line_1759'>    thrasonical. He is too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd,</a>
<a id='line_1760'>    as it were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.</a>
<a id='line_1761'>  NATHANIEL. A most singular and choice epithet.</a>

<a id='line_1763'>  HOLOFERNES. He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than</a>
<a id='line_1764'>    the staple of his argument. I abhor such fanatical phantasimes,</a>
<a id='line_1765'>    such insociable and point-devise companions; such rackers of</a>
<a id='line_1766'>    orthography, as to speak 'dout' fine, when he should say 'doubt';</a>

<a id='line_1768'>    He clepeth a calf 'cauf,' half 'hauf'; neighbour vocatur</a>
<a id='line_1769'>    'nebour'; 'neigh' abbreviated 'ne.' This is abhominable- which he</a>
<a id='line_1770'>    would call 'abbominable.' It insinuateth me of insanie: ne</a>

<a id='line_1794'>  HOLOFERNES. Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.</a>
<a id='line_1795'>  MOTH. Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.</a>
<a id='line_1796'>  HOLOFERNES. Quis, quis, thou consonant?</a>
<a id='line_1797'>  MOTH. The third of the five vowels, if You repeat them; or the</a>

<a id='line_1807'>  HOLOFERNES. Thou disputes like an infant; go whip thy gig.</a>
<a id='line_1808'>  MOTH. Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about your</a>

<a id='line_1810'>  COSTARD. An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst have it</a>

<a id='line_1815'>    thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers' ends, as they say.</a>
<a id='line_1816'>  HOLOFERNES. O, I smell false Latin; 'dunghill' for unguem.</a>
<a id='line_1817'>  ARMADO. Arts-man, preambulate; we will be singuled from the</a>

<a id='line_1819'>    top of the mountain?</a>
<a id='line_1820'>  HOLOFERNES. Or mons, the hill.</a>
<a id='line_1821'>  ARMADO. At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.</a>
<a id='line_1822'>  HOLOFERNES. I do, sans question.</a>
<a id='line_1823'>  ARMADO. Sir, it is the King's most sweet pleasure and affection to</a>
<a id='line_1824'>    congratulate the Princess at her pavilion, in the posteriors of</a>
<a id='line_1825'>    this day; which the rude multitude call the afternoon.</a>
<a id='line_1826'>  HOLOFERNES. The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is liable,</a>
<a id='line_1827'>    congruent, and measurable, for the afternoon. The word is well</a>
<a id='line_1828'>    cull'd, chose, sweet, and apt, I do assure you, sir, I do assure.</a>
<a id='line_1829'>  ARMADO. Sir, the King is a noble gentleman, and my familiar, I do</a>
<a id='line_1830'>    assure ye, very good friend. For what is inward between us, let</a>
<a id='line_1831'>    it pass. I do beseech thee, remember thy courtesy. I beseech</a>
<a id='line_1832'>    thee, apparel thy head. And among other importunate and most</a>
<a id='line_1833'>    serious designs, and of great import indeed, too- but let that</a>
<a id='line_1834'>    pass; for I must tell thee it will please his Grace, by the</a>
<a id='line_1835'>    world, sometime to lean upon my poor shoulder, and with his royal</a>
<a id='line_1836'>    finger thus dally with my excrement, with my mustachio; but,</a>
<a id='line_1837'>    sweet heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no fable:</a>
<a id='line_1838'>    some certain special honours it pleaseth his greatness to impart</a>
<a id='line_1839'>    to Armado, a soldier, a man of travel, that hath seen the world;</a>
<a id='line_1840'>    but let that pass. The very all of all is- but, sweet heart, I do</a>
<a id='line_1841'>    implore secrecy- that the King would have me present the</a>
<a id='line_1842'>    Princess, sweet chuck, with some delightful ostentation, or show,</a>
<a id='line_1843'>    or pageant, or antic, or firework. Now, understanding that the</a>
<a id='line_1844'>    curate and your sweet self are good at such eruptions and sudden</a>
<a id='line_1845'>    breaking-out of mirth, as it were, I have acquainted you withal,</a>
<a id='line_1846'>    to the end to crave your assistance.</a>
<a id='line_1847'>  HOLOFERNES. Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.</a>
<a id='line_1848'>    Sir Nathaniel, as concerning some entertainment of time, some</a>
<a id='line_1849'>    show in the posterior of this day, to be rend'red by our</a>
<a id='line_1850'>    assistance, the King's command, and this most gallant,</a>
<a id='line_1851'>    illustrate, and learned gentleman, before the Princess- I say</a>
<a id='line_1852'>    none so fit as to present the Nine Worthies.</a>
<a id='line_1853'>  NATHANIEL. Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?</a>
<a id='line_1854'>  HOLOFERNES. Joshua, yourself; myself, Alexander; this gallant</a>
<a id='line_1855'>    gentleman, Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great</a>
<a id='line_1856'>    limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the page, Hercules.</a>
<a id='line_1857'>  ARMADO. Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for that</a>
<a id='line_1858'>    Worthy's thumb; he is not so big as the end of his club.</a>
<a id='line_1859'>  HOLOFERNES. Shall I have audience? He shall present Hercules in</a>
<a id='line_1860'>    minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a snake; and I</a>
<a id='line_1861'>    will have an apology for that purpose.</a>
<a id='line_1862'>  MOTH. An excellent device! So, if any of the audience hiss, you may</a>
<a id='line_1863'>    cry 'Well done, Hercules; now thou crushest the snake!' That is</a>
<a id='line_1864'>    the way to make an offence gracious, though few have the grace to</a>
<a id='line_1865'>    do it.</a>
<a id='line_1866'>  ARMADO. For the rest of the Worthies?</a>
<a id='line_1867'>  HOLOFERNES. I will play three myself.</a>
<a id='line_1868'>  MOTH. Thrice-worthy gentleman!</a>
<a id='line_1869'>  ARMADO. Shall I tell you a thing?</a>
<a id='line_1870'>  HOLOFERNES. We attend.</a>
<a id='line_1871'>  ARMADO. We will have, if this fadge not, an antic. I beseech you,</a>
<a id='line_1872'>    follow.</a>

<a id='line_1895'>  ROSALINE. That was the way to make his godhead wax;</a>
<a id='line_1896'>    For he hath been five thousand year a boy.</a>
<a id='line_1897'>  KATHARINE. Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.</a>
<a id='line_1898'>  ROSALINE. You'll ne'er be friends with him: 'a kill'd your sister.</a>
<a id='line_1899'>  KATHARINE. He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;</a>

<a id='line_1904'>  ROSALINE. What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?</a>
<a id='line_1905'>  KATHARINE. A light condition in a beauty dark.</a>
<a id='line_1906'>  ROSALINE. We need more light to find your meaning out.</a>
<a id='line_1907'>  KATHARINE. You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;</a>

<a id='line_2000'>    With that all laugh'd, and clapp'd him on the shoulder,</a>
<a id='line_2001'>    Making the bold wag by their praises bolder.</a>
<a id='line_2002'>    One rubb'd his elbow, thus, and fleer'd, and swore</a>

<a id='line_2010'>    That in this spleen ridiculous appears,</a>
<a id='line_2011'>    To check their folly, passion's solemn tears.</a>
<a id='line_2012'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. But what, but what, come they to visit us?</a>
<a id='line_2013'>  BOYET. They do, they do, and are apparell'd thus,</a>

<a id='line_2023'>    Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,</a>
<a id='line_2024'>    And then the King will court thee for his dear;</a>
<a id='line_2025'>    Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,</a>

<a id='line_2030'>  KATHARINE. But, in this changing, what is your intent?</a>

<a id='line_2038'>  ROSALINE. But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?</a>
<a id='line_2039'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. No, to the death, we will not move a foot,</a>

<a id='line_2041'>    But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.</a>
<a id='line_2042'>  BOYET. Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,</a>

<a id='line_2044'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt</a>

<a id='line_2283'>    Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure</a>

<a id='line_2290'>    Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.</a>
<a id='line_2291'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;</a>
<a id='line_2292'>    We have had pastimes here, and pleasant game;</a>
<a id='line_2293'>    A mess of Russians left us but of late.</a>
<a id='line_2294'>  KING. How, madam! Russians!</a>
<a id='line_2295'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Ay, in truth, my lord;</a>
<a id='line_2296'>    Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.</a>
<a id='line_2297'>  ROSALINE. Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2298'>    My lady, to the manner of the days,</a>

<a id='line_2300'>    We four indeed confronted were with four</a>
<a id='line_2301'>    In Russian habit; here they stayed an hour</a>
<a id='line_2302'>    And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_2303'>    They did not bless us with one happy word.</a>
<a id='line_2304'>    I dare not call them fools; but this I think,</a>
<a id='line_2305'>    When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.</a>
<a id='line_2306'>  BEROWNE. This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,</a>
<a id='line_2307'>    Your wit makes wise things foolish; when we greet,</a>
<a id='line_2308'>    With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,</a>
<a id='line_2309'>    By light we lose light; your capacity</a>
<a id='line_2310'>    Is of that nature that to your huge store</a>
<a id='line_2311'>    Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.</a>
<a id='line_2312'>  ROSALINE. This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye-</a>
<a id='line_2313'>  BEROWNE. I am a fool, and full of poverty.</a>
<a id='line_2314'>  ROSALINE. But that you take what doth to you belong,</a>
<a id='line_2315'>    It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.</a>
<a id='line_2316'>  BEROWNE. O, I am yours, and all that I possess.</a>
<a id='line_2317'>  ROSALINE. All the fool mine?</a>
<a id='line_2318'>  BEROWNE. I cannot give you less.</a>
<a id='line_2319'>  ROSALINE. Which of the vizards was it that you wore?</a>
<a id='line_2320'>  BEROWNE. Where? when? what vizard? Why demand you this?</a>
<a id='line_2321'>  ROSALINE. There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case</a>
<a id='line_2322'>    That hid the worse and show'd the better face.</a>
<a id='line_2323'>  KING. We were descried; they'll mock us now downright.</a>
<a id='line_2324'>  DUMAIN. Let us confess, and turn it to a jest.</a>
<a id='line_2325'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Amaz'd, my lord? Why looks your Highness sad?</a>
<a id='line_2326'>  ROSALINE. Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?</a>
<a id='line_2327'>    Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.</a>
<a id='line_2328'>  BEROWNE. Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.</a>
<a id='line_2329'>    Can any face of brass hold longer out?</a>
<a id='line_2330'>    Here stand I, lady- dart thy skill at me,</a>
<a id='line_2331'>    Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout,</a>
<a id='line_2332'>    Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance,</a>
<a id='line_2333'>    Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;</a>
<a id='line_2334'>    And I will wish thee never more to dance,</a>
<a id='line_2335'>    Nor never more in Russian habit wait.</a>
<a id='line_2336'>    O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,</a>
<a id='line_2337'>    Nor to the motion of a school-boy's tongue,</a>
<a id='line_2338'>    Nor never come in vizard to my friend,</a>
<a id='line_2339'>    Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song.</a>
<a id='line_2340'>    Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,</a>
<a id='line_2341'>    Three-pil'd hyperboles, spruce affectation,</a>
<a id='line_2342'>    Figures pedantical- these summer-flies</a>
<a id='line_2343'>    Have blown me full of maggot ostentation.</a>
<a id='line_2344'>    I do forswear them; and I here protest,</a>
<a id='line_2345'>    By this white glove- how white the hand, God knows!-</a>
<a id='line_2346'>    Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd</a>
<a id='line_2347'>    In russet yeas, and honest kersey noes.</a>
<a id='line_2348'>    And, to begin, wench- so God help me, law!-</a>
<a id='line_2349'>    My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.</a>
<a id='line_2350'>  ROSALINE. Sans 'sans,' I pray you.</a>
<a id='line_2351'>  BEROWNE. Yet I have a trick</a>
<a id='line_2352'>    Of the old rage; bear with me, I am sick;</a>
<a id='line_2353'>    I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see-</a>
<a id='line_2354'>    Write 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;</a>
<a id='line_2355'>    They are infected; in their hearts it lies;</a>
<a id='line_2356'>    They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes.</a>
<a id='line_2357'>    These lords are visited; you are not free,</a>
<a id='line_2358'>    For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.</a>
<a id='line_2359'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.</a>
<a id='line_2360'>  BEROWNE. Our states are forfeit; seek not to undo us.</a>
<a id='line_2361'>  ROSALINE. It is not so; for how can this be true,</a>
<a id='line_2362'>    That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?</a>
<a id='line_2363'>  BEROWNE. Peace; for I will not have to do with you.</a>
<a id='line_2364'>  ROSALINE. Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.</a>
<a id='line_2365'>  BEROWNE. Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.</a>
<a id='line_2366'>  KING. Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression</a>
<a id='line_2367'>    Some fair excuse.</a>
<a id='line_2368'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. The fairest is confession.</a>
<a id='line_2369'>    Were not you here but even now, disguis'd?</a>
<a id='line_2370'>  KING. Madam, I was.</a>
<a id='line_2371'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. And were you well advis'd?</a>
<a id='line_2372'>  KING. I was, fair madam.</a>
<a id='line_2373'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. When you then were here,</a>
<a id='line_2374'>    What did you whisper in your lady's ear?</a>
<a id='line_2375'>  KING. That more than all the world I did respect her.</a>
<a id='line_2376'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. When she shall challenge this, you will reject</a>
<a id='line_2377'>    her.</a>
<a id='line_2378'>  KING. Upon mine honour, no.</a>
<a id='line_2379'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Peace, peace, forbear;</a>
<a id='line_2380'>    Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.</a>
<a id='line_2381'>  KING. Despise me when I break this oath of mine.</a>
<a id='line_2382'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. I will; and therefore keep it. Rosaline,</a>
<a id='line_2383'>    What did the Russian whisper in your ear?</a>
<a id='line_2384'>  ROSALINE. Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear</a>
<a id='line_2385'>    As precious eyesight, and did value me</a>
<a id='line_2386'>    Above this world; adding thereto, moreover,</a>
<a id='line_2387'>    That he would wed me, or else die my lover.</a>
<a id='line_2388'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. God give thee joy of him! The noble lord</a>
<a id='line_2389'>     Most honourably doth uphold his word.</a>
<a id='line_2390'>  KING. What mean you, madam? By my life, my troth,</a>
<a id='line_2391'>    I never swore this lady such an oath.</a>
<a id='line_2392'>  ROSALINE. By heaven, you did; and, to confirm it plain,</a>
<a id='line_2393'>    You gave me this; but take it, sir, again.</a>
<a id='line_2394'>  KING. My faith and this the Princess I did give;</a>
<a id='line_2395'>    I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.</a>
<a id='line_2396'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;</a>
<a id='line_2397'>    And Lord Berowne, I thank him, is my dear.</a>
<a id='line_2398'>    What, will you have me, or your pearl again?</a>
<a id='line_2399'> BEROWNE. Neither of either; I remit both twain.</a>
<a id='line_2400'>    I see the trick on't: here was a consent,</a>
<a id='line_2401'>    Knowing aforehand of our merriment,</a>
<a id='line_2402'>    To dash it like a Christmas comedy.</a>
<a id='line_2403'>    Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,</a>
<a id='line_2404'>    Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,</a>

<a id='line_2406'>    To make my lady laugh when she's dispos'd,</a>
<a id='line_2407'>    Told our intents before; which once disclos'd,</a>
<a id='line_2408'>    The ladies did change favours; and then we,</a>
<a id='line_2409'>    Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.</a>
<a id='line_2410'>    Now, to our perjury to add more terror,</a>
<a id='line_2411'>    We are again forsworn in will and error.</a>

<a id='line_2414'>    Do not you know my lady's foot by th' squier,</a>
<a id='line_2415'>    And laugh upon the apple of her eye?</a>
<a id='line_2416'>    And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,</a>

<a id='line_2753'>    No, no, my lord, your Grace is perjur'd much,</a>
<a id='line_2754'>    Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this,</a>
<a id='line_2755'>    If for my love, as there is no such cause,</a>
<a id='line_2756'>    You will do aught- this shall you do for me:</a>
<a id='line_2757'>    Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed</a>
<a id='line_2758'>    To some forlorn and naked hermitage,</a>
<a id='line_2759'>    Remote from all the pleasures of the world;</a>
<a id='line_2760'>    There stay until the twelve celestial signs</a>
<a id='line_2761'>    Have brought about the annual reckoning.</a>
<a id='line_2762'>    If this austere insociable life</a>
<a id='line_2763'>    Change not your offer made in heat of blood,</a>
<a id='line_2764'>    If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds,</a>
<a id='line_2765'>    Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,</a>
<a id='line_2766'>    But that it bear this trial, and last love,</a>
<a id='line_2767'>    Then, at the expiration of the year,</a>
<a id='line_2768'>    Come, challenge me, challenge me by these deserts;</a>
<a id='line_2769'>    And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine,</a>
<a id='line_2770'>    I will be thine; and, till that instant, shut</a>
<a id='line_2771'>    My woeful self up in a mournful house,</a>
<a id='line_2772'>    Raining the tears of lamentation</a>
<a id='line_2773'>    For the remembrance of my father's death.</a>
<a id='line_2774'>    If this thou do deny, let our hands part,</a>
<a id='line_2775'>    Neither intitled in the other's heart.</a>
<a id='line_2776'>  KING. If this, or more than this, I would deny,</a>
<a id='line_2777'>    To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,</a>
<a id='line_2778'>    The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!</a>
<a id='line_2779'>    Hence hermit then, my heart is in thy breast.</a>
<a id='line_2780'>  BEROWNE. And what to me, my love? and what to me?</a>
<a id='line_2781'>  ROSALINE. You must he purged too, your sins are rack'd;</a>
<a id='line_2782'>    You are attaint with faults and perjury;</a>
<a id='line_2783'>    Therefore, if you my favour mean to get,</a>
<a id='line_2784'>    A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,</a>
<a id='line_2785'>    But seek the weary beds of people sick.</a>
<a id='line_2786'>  DUMAIN. But what to me, my love? but what to me?</a>
<a id='line_2787'>    A wife?</a>
<a id='line_2788'>  KATHARINE. A beard, fair health, and honesty;</a>
<a id='line_2789'>    With threefold love I wish you all these three.</a>
<a id='line_2790'>  DUMAIN. O, shall I say I thank you, gentle wife?</a>
<a id='line_2791'>  KATHARINE. No so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day</a>
<a id='line_2792'>    I'll mark no words that smooth-fac'd wooers say.</a>
<a id='line_2793'>    Come when the King doth to my lady come;</a>
<a id='line_2794'>    Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.</a>
<a id='line_2795'>  DUMAIN. I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.</a>
<a id='line_2796'>  KATHARINE. Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.</a>
<a id='line_2797'>  LONGAVILLE. What says Maria?</a>
<a id='line_2798'>  MARIA. At the twelvemonth's end</a>
<a id='line_2799'>    I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.</a>
<a id='line_2800'>  LONGAVILLE. I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.</a>
<a id='line_2801'>  MARIA. The liker you; few taller are so young.</a>
<a id='line_2802'>  BEROWNE. Studies my lady? Mistress, look on me;</a>
<a id='line_2803'>    Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,</a>
<a id='line_2804'>    What humble suit attends thy answer there.</a>
<a id='line_2805'>    Impose some service on me for thy love.</a>
<a id='line_2806'>  ROSALINE. Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Berowne,</a>
<a id='line_2807'>    Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue</a>
<a id='line_2808'>    Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,</a>
<a id='line_2809'>    Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,</a>
<a id='line_2810'>    Which you on all estates will execute</a>
<a id='line_2811'>    That lie within the mercy of your wit.</a>
<a id='line_2812'>    To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,</a>
<a id='line_2813'>    And therewithal to win me, if you please,</a>
<a id='line_2814'>    Without the which I am not to be won,</a>
<a id='line_2815'>    You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day</a>
<a id='line_2816'>    Visit the speechless sick, and still converse</a>
<a id='line_2817'>    With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,</a>
<a id='line_2818'>    With all the fierce endeavour of your wit,</a>
<a id='line_2819'>    To enforce the pained impotent to smile.</a>
<a id='line_2820'>  BEROWNE. To move wild laughter in the throat of death?</a>
<a id='line_2821'>    It cannot be; it is impossible;</a>
<a id='line_2822'>    Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.</a>
<a id='line_2823'>  ROSALINE. Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,</a>
<a id='line_2824'>    Whose influence is begot of that loose grace</a>
<a id='line_2825'>    Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools.</a>
<a id='line_2826'>    A jest's prosperity lies in the ear</a>
<a id='line_2827'>    Of him that hears it, never in the tongue</a>
<a id='line_2828'>    Of him that makes it; then, if sickly ears,</a>
<a id='line_2829'>    Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,</a>
<a id='line_2830'>    Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,</a>
<a id='line_2831'>    And I will have you and that fault withal.</a>
<a id='line_2832'>    But if they will not, throw away that spirit,</a>
<a id='line_2833'>    And I shall find you empty of that fault,</a>
<a id='line_2834'>    Right joyful of your reformation.</a>
<a id='line_2835'>  BEROWNE. A twelvemonth? Well, befall what will befall,</a>
<a id='line_2836'>    I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.</a>
<a id='line_2837'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. [ To the King] Ay, sweet my lord, and so I take</a>
<a id='line_2838'>    my leave.</a>
<a id='line_2839'>  KING. No, madam; we will bring you on your way.</a>
<a id='line_2840'>  BEROWNE. Our wooing doth not end like an old play:</a>
<a id='line_2841'>    Jack hath not Jill. These ladies' courtesy</a>
<a id='line_2842'>    Might well have made our sport a comedy.</a>
<a id='line_2843'>  KING. Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth an' a day,</a>
<a id='line_2844'>    And then 'twill end.</a>
<a id='line_2845'>  BEROWNE. That's too long for a play.</a>

<a id='line_2849'>  ARMADO. Sweet Majesty, vouchsafe me-</a>
<a id='line_2850'>  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Was not that not Hector?</a>
<a id='line_2851'>  DUMAIN. The worthy knight of Troy.</a>
<a id='line_2852'>  ARMADO. I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am a</a>
<a id='line_2853'>    votary: I have vow'd to Jaquenetta to hold the plough for her</a>
<a id='line_2854'>    sweet love three year. But, most esteemed greatness, will you</a>
<a id='line_2855'>    hear the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in</a>
<a id='line_2856'>    praise of the Owl and the Cuckoo? It should have followed in the</a>
<a id='line_2857'>    end of our show.</a>
<a id='line_2858'>  KING. Call them forth quickly; we will do so.</a>
<a id='line_2859'>  ARMADO. Holla! approach.</a>

<a id='line_2877'>         When shepherds pipe on oaten straws,</a>
<a id='line_2878'>         And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks;</a>
