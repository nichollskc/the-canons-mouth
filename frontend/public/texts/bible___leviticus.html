<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the</a>
<a id='line_4'>tabernacle of the congregation, saying, 1:2 Speak unto the children of</a>
<a id='line_5'>Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto</a>
<a id='line_6'>the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the</a>
<a id='line_7'>herd, and of the flock.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>1:3 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a</a>
<a id='line_10'>male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at</a>
<a id='line_11'>the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_12'></a>
<a id='line_13'>1:4 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and</a>
<a id='line_14'>it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.</a>
<a id='line_15'></a>
<a id='line_16'>1:5 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests,</a>
<a id='line_17'>Aaron’s sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round</a>
<a id='line_18'>about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_19'>congregation.</a>
<a id='line_20'></a>
<a id='line_21'>1:6 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.</a>
<a id='line_22'></a>
<a id='line_23'>1:7 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar,</a>
<a id='line_24'>and lay the wood in order upon the fire: 1:8 And the priests, Aaron’s</a>
<a id='line_25'>sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the</a>
<a id='line_26'>wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: 1:9 But his inwards</a>
<a id='line_27'>and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on</a>
<a id='line_28'>the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a</a>
<a id='line_29'>sweet savour unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_30'></a>
<a id='line_31'>1:10 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of</a>
<a id='line_32'>the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without</a>
<a id='line_33'>blemish.</a>
<a id='line_34'></a>
<a id='line_35'>1:11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before</a>
<a id='line_36'>the LORD: and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall sprinkle his blood</a>
<a id='line_37'>round about upon the altar.</a>
<a id='line_38'></a>
<a id='line_39'>1:12 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat:</a>
<a id='line_40'>and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire</a>
<a id='line_41'>which is upon the altar: 1:13 But he shall wash the inwards and the</a>
<a id='line_42'>legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon</a>
<a id='line_43'>the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a</a>
<a id='line_44'>sweet savour unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_45'></a>
<a id='line_46'>1:14 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of</a>
<a id='line_47'>fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young</a>
<a id='line_48'>pigeons.</a>
<a id='line_49'></a>
<a id='line_50'>1:15 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his</a>
<a id='line_51'>head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung</a>
<a id='line_52'>out at the side of the altar: 1:16 And he shall pluck away his crop</a>
<a id='line_53'>with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by</a>
<a id='line_54'>the place of the ashes: 1:17 And he shall cleave it with the wings</a>
<a id='line_55'>thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it</a>
<a id='line_56'>upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt</a>
<a id='line_57'>sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_58'></a>
<a id='line_59'>2:1 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his</a>
<a id='line_60'>offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and</a>
<a id='line_61'>put frankincense thereon: 2:2 And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons</a>
<a id='line_62'>the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour</a>
<a id='line_63'>thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof;</a>
<a id='line_64'>and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an</a>
<a id='line_65'>offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: 2:3 And the</a>
<a id='line_66'>remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’: it is a</a>
<a id='line_67'>thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>2:4 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the</a>
<a id='line_70'>oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or</a>
<a id='line_71'>unleavened wafers anointed with oil.</a>
<a id='line_72'></a>
<a id='line_73'>2:5 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be</a>
<a id='line_74'>of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>2:6 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat</a>
<a id='line_77'>offering.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>2:7 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it</a>
<a id='line_80'>shall be made of fine flour with oil.</a>
<a id='line_81'></a>
<a id='line_82'>2:8 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these</a>
<a id='line_83'>things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he</a>
<a id='line_84'>shall bring it unto the altar.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>2:9 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial</a>
<a id='line_87'>thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by</a>
<a id='line_88'>fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>2:10 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron’s and</a>
<a id='line_91'>his sons’: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made</a>
<a id='line_92'>by fire.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>2:11 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be</a>
<a id='line_95'>made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any</a>
<a id='line_96'>offering of the LORD made by fire.</a>
<a id='line_97'></a>
<a id='line_98'>2:12 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto</a>
<a id='line_99'>the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>2:13 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with</a>
<a id='line_102'>salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to</a>
<a id='line_103'>be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_104'>offer salt.</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>2:14 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the</a>
<a id='line_107'>LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green</a>
<a id='line_108'>ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>
<a id='line_110'>2:15 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it</a>
<a id='line_111'>is a meat offering.</a>
<a id='line_112'></a>
<a id='line_113'>2:16 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten</a>
<a id='line_114'>corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense</a>
<a id='line_115'>thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_116'></a>
<a id='line_117'>3:1 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer</a>
<a id='line_118'>it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it</a>
<a id='line_119'>without blemish before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>3:2 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill</a>
<a id='line_122'>it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron’s sons</a>
<a id='line_123'>the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.</a>
<a id='line_124'></a>
<a id='line_125'>3:3 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an</a>
<a id='line_126'>offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the</a>
<a id='line_127'>inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 3:4 And the two</a>
<a id='line_128'>kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the</a>
<a id='line_129'>caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.</a>
<a id='line_130'></a>
<a id='line_131'>3:5 And Aaron’s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt</a>
<a id='line_132'>sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an</a>
<a id='line_133'>offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_134'></a>
<a id='line_135'>3:6 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the</a>
<a id='line_136'>LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without</a>
<a id='line_137'>blemish.</a>
<a id='line_138'></a>
<a id='line_139'>3:7 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before</a>
<a id='line_140'>the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_141'></a>
<a id='line_142'>3:8 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill</a>
<a id='line_143'>it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron’s sons shall</a>
<a id='line_144'>sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar.</a>
<a id='line_145'></a>
<a id='line_146'>3:9 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an</a>
<a id='line_147'>offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the whole</a>
<a id='line_148'>rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that</a>
<a id='line_149'>covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 3:10</a>
<a id='line_150'>And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the</a>
<a id='line_151'>flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he</a>
<a id='line_152'>take away.</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>3:11 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of</a>
<a id='line_155'>the offering made by fire unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>3:12 And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the</a>
<a id='line_158'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_159'></a>
<a id='line_160'>3:13 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before</a>
<a id='line_161'>the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall</a>
<a id='line_162'>sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>3:14 And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by</a>
<a id='line_165'>fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat</a>
<a id='line_166'>that is upon the inwards, 3:15 And the two kidneys, and the fat that</a>
<a id='line_167'>is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver,</a>
<a id='line_168'>with the kidneys, it shall he take away.</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>3:16 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of</a>
<a id='line_171'>the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is the</a>
<a id='line_172'>LORD’s.</a>
<a id='line_173'></a>
<a id='line_174'>3:17 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout</a>
<a id='line_175'>all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>4:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 4:2 Speak unto the children</a>
<a id='line_178'>of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any</a>
<a id='line_179'>of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to</a>
<a id='line_180'>be done, and shall do against any of them: 4:3 If the priest that is</a>
<a id='line_181'>anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring</a>
<a id='line_182'>for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish</a>
<a id='line_183'>unto the LORD for a sin offering.</a>
<a id='line_184'></a>
<a id='line_185'>4:4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of</a>
<a id='line_186'>the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the</a>
<a id='line_187'>bullock’s head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>4:5 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock’s blood,</a>
<a id='line_190'>and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:6 And the priest</a>
<a id='line_191'>shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven</a>
<a id='line_192'>times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.</a>
<a id='line_193'></a>
<a id='line_194'>4:7 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the</a>
<a id='line_195'>altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of</a>
<a id='line_196'>the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the</a>
<a id='line_197'>bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the</a>
<a id='line_198'>tabernacle of the congregation.</a>
<a id='line_199'></a>
<a id='line_200'>4:8 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the</a>
<a id='line_201'>sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that</a>
<a id='line_202'>is upon the inwards, 4:9 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon</a>
<a id='line_203'>them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the</a>
<a id='line_204'>kidneys, it shall he take away, 4:10 As it was taken off from the</a>
<a id='line_205'>bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn</a>
<a id='line_206'>them upon the altar of the burnt offering.</a>
<a id='line_207'></a>
<a id='line_208'>4:11 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head,</a>
<a id='line_209'>and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, 4:12 Even the whole</a>
<a id='line_210'>bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place,</a>
<a id='line_211'>where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire:</a>
<a id='line_212'>where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.</a>
<a id='line_213'></a>
<a id='line_214'>4:13 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,</a>
<a id='line_215'>and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done</a>
<a id='line_216'>somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things</a>
<a id='line_217'>which should not be done, and are guilty; 4:14 When the sin, which</a>
<a id='line_218'>they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall</a>
<a id='line_219'>offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle</a>
<a id='line_220'>of the congregation.</a>
<a id='line_221'></a>
<a id='line_222'>4:15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the</a>
<a id='line_223'>head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed</a>
<a id='line_224'>before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_225'></a>
<a id='line_226'>4:16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock’s</a>
<a id='line_227'>blood to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:17 And the priest shall</a>
<a id='line_228'>dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times</a>
<a id='line_229'>before the LORD, even before the vail.</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>4:18 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar</a>
<a id='line_232'>which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_233'>congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the</a>
<a id='line_234'>altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of</a>
<a id='line_235'>the congregation.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>4:19 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the</a>
<a id='line_238'>altar.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>4:20 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a</a>
<a id='line_241'>sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an</a>
<a id='line_242'>atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.</a>
<a id='line_243'></a>
<a id='line_244'>4:21 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn</a>
<a id='line_245'>him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the</a>
<a id='line_246'>congregation.</a>
<a id='line_247'></a>
<a id='line_248'>4:22 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance</a>
<a id='line_249'>against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things</a>
<a id='line_250'>which should not be done, and is guilty; 4:23 Or if his sin, wherein</a>
<a id='line_251'>he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a</a>
<a id='line_252'>kid of the goats, a male without blemish: 4:24 And he shall lay his</a>
<a id='line_253'>hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they</a>
<a id='line_254'>kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.</a>
<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'>4:25 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with</a>
<a id='line_257'>his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,</a>
<a id='line_258'>and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt</a>
<a id='line_259'>offering.</a>
<a id='line_260'></a>
<a id='line_261'>4:26 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the</a>

<a id='line_268'>if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall</a>
<a id='line_269'>bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for</a>
<a id='line_270'>his sin which he hath sinned.</a>
<a id='line_271'></a>
<a id='line_272'>4:29 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and</a>
<a id='line_273'>slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.</a>
<a id='line_274'></a>
<a id='line_275'>4:30 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger,</a>

<a id='line_278'></a>
<a id='line_279'>4:31 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken</a>

<a id='line_628'>clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded</a>
<a id='line_629'>him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him</a>
<a id='line_630'>therewith.</a>
<a id='line_631'></a>
<a id='line_632'>8:8 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the</a>
<a id='line_633'>breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.</a>
<a id='line_634'></a>
<a id='line_635'>8:9 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon</a>
<a id='line_636'>his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the</a>
<a id='line_637'>LORD commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_638'></a>
<a id='line_639'>8:10 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and</a>
<a id='line_640'>all that was therein, and sanctified them.</a>
<a id='line_641'></a>
<a id='line_642'>8:11 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed</a>
<a id='line_643'>the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to</a>
<a id='line_644'>sanctify them.</a>
<a id='line_645'></a>
<a id='line_646'>8:12 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and</a>
<a id='line_647'>anointed him, to sanctify him.</a>
<a id='line_648'></a>
<a id='line_649'>8:13 And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and put coats upon them, and</a>
<a id='line_650'>girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD</a>
<a id='line_651'>commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_652'></a>
<a id='line_653'>8:14 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and</a>
<a id='line_654'>his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin</a>
<a id='line_655'>offering.</a>
<a id='line_656'></a>
<a id='line_657'>8:15 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the</a>
<a id='line_658'>horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the</a>
<a id='line_659'>altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified</a>
<a id='line_660'>it, to make reconciliation upon it.</a>
<a id='line_661'></a>
<a id='line_662'>8:16 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul</a>
<a id='line_663'>above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned</a>
<a id='line_664'>it upon the altar.</a>
<a id='line_665'></a>
<a id='line_666'>8:17 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt</a>
<a id='line_667'>with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_668'></a>
<a id='line_669'>8:18 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his</a>
<a id='line_670'>sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.</a>
<a id='line_671'></a>
<a id='line_672'>8:19 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar</a>
<a id='line_673'>round about.</a>
<a id='line_674'></a>
<a id='line_675'>8:20 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the</a>
<a id='line_676'>pieces, and the fat.</a>
<a id='line_677'></a>
<a id='line_678'>8:21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt</a>
<a id='line_679'>the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet</a>
<a id='line_680'>savour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD</a>
<a id='line_681'>commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_682'></a>
<a id='line_683'>8:22 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron</a>
<a id='line_684'>and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.</a>
<a id='line_685'></a>
<a id='line_686'>8:23 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it</a>
<a id='line_687'>upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right</a>
<a id='line_688'>hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.</a>
<a id='line_689'></a>
<a id='line_690'>8:24 And he brought Aaron’s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the</a>
<a id='line_691'>tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and</a>
<a id='line_692'>upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood</a>
<a id='line_693'>upon the altar round about.</a>
<a id='line_694'></a>
<a id='line_695'>8:25 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon</a>
<a id='line_696'>the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and</a>
<a id='line_697'>their fat, and the right shoulder: 8:26 And out of the basket of</a>
<a id='line_698'>unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened</a>
<a id='line_699'>cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the</a>
<a id='line_700'>fat, and upon the right shoulder: 8:27 And he put all upon Aaron’s</a>
<a id='line_701'>hands, and upon his sons’ hands, and waved them for a wave offering</a>
<a id='line_702'>before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_703'></a>
<a id='line_704'>8:28 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the</a>
<a id='line_705'>altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet</a>
<a id='line_706'>savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_707'></a>
<a id='line_708'>8:29 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering</a>
<a id='line_709'>before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses’ part; as</a>
<a id='line_710'>the LORD commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_711'></a>
<a id='line_712'>8:30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was</a>
<a id='line_713'>upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments,</a>
<a id='line_714'>and upon his sons, and upon his sons’ garments with him; and</a>
<a id='line_715'>sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons’</a>
<a id='line_716'>garments with him.</a>
<a id='line_717'></a>
<a id='line_718'>8:31 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the</a>
<a id='line_719'>door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the</a>
<a id='line_720'>bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying,</a>
<a id='line_721'>Aaron and his sons shall eat it.</a>
<a id='line_722'></a>
<a id='line_723'>8:32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye</a>
<a id='line_724'>burn with fire.</a>
<a id='line_725'></a>
<a id='line_726'>8:33 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_727'>congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at</a>
<a id='line_728'>an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.</a>
<a id='line_729'></a>
<a id='line_730'>8:34 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to</a>
<a id='line_731'>make an atonement for you.</a>
<a id='line_732'></a>
<a id='line_733'>8:35 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_734'>congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the</a>
<a id='line_735'>LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.</a>
<a id='line_736'></a>
<a id='line_737'>8:36 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by</a>
<a id='line_738'>the hand of Moses.</a>
<a id='line_739'></a>
<a id='line_740'>9:1 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and</a>
<a id='line_741'>his sons, and the elders of Israel; 9:2 And he said unto Aaron, Take</a>
<a id='line_742'>thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering,</a>
<a id='line_743'>without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_744'></a>
<a id='line_745'>9:3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye</a>
<a id='line_746'>a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of</a>
<a id='line_747'>the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; 9:4 Also a</a>
<a id='line_748'>bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD;</a>
<a id='line_749'>and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear</a>
<a id='line_750'>unto you.</a>
<a id='line_751'></a>
<a id='line_752'>9:5 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle</a>
<a id='line_753'>of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood</a>
<a id='line_754'>before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_755'></a>
<a id='line_756'>9:6 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye</a>
<a id='line_757'>should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.</a>
<a id='line_758'></a>
<a id='line_759'>9:7 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin</a>
<a id='line_760'>offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself,</a>
<a id='line_761'>and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an</a>
<a id='line_762'>atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.</a>
<a id='line_763'></a>
<a id='line_764'>9:8 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin</a>
<a id='line_765'>offering, which was for himself.</a>
<a id='line_766'></a>
<a id='line_767'>9:9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped</a>
<a id='line_768'>his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and</a>
<a id='line_769'>poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: 9:10 But the fat, and</a>
<a id='line_770'>the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he</a>
<a id='line_771'>burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_772'></a>
<a id='line_773'>9:11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.</a>
<a id='line_774'></a>
<a id='line_775'>9:12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented unto</a>
<a id='line_776'>him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.</a>
<a id='line_777'></a>
<a id='line_778'>9:13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces</a>
<a id='line_779'>thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.</a>
<a id='line_780'></a>
<a id='line_781'>9:14 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the</a>
<a id='line_782'>burnt offering on the altar.</a>
<a id='line_783'></a>
<a id='line_784'>9:15 And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which</a>
<a id='line_785'>was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for</a>
<a id='line_786'>sin, as the first.</a>
<a id='line_787'></a>
<a id='line_788'>9:16 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to</a>
<a id='line_789'>the manner.</a>
<a id='line_790'></a>
<a id='line_791'>9:17 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,</a>
<a id='line_792'>and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the</a>
<a id='line_793'>morning.</a>
<a id='line_794'></a>
<a id='line_795'>9:18 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace</a>
<a id='line_796'>offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron’s sons presented unto</a>
<a id='line_797'>him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, 9:19 And</a>
<a id='line_798'>the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which</a>
<a id='line_799'>covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:</a>
<a id='line_800'>9:20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon</a>
<a id='line_801'>the altar: 9:21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for</a>
<a id='line_802'>a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.</a>
<a id='line_803'></a>
<a id='line_804'>9:22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them,</a>
<a id='line_805'>and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt</a>
<a id='line_806'>offering, and peace offerings.</a>
<a id='line_807'></a>
<a id='line_808'>9:23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation,</a>
<a id='line_809'>and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_810'>appeared unto all the people.</a>
<a id='line_811'></a>
<a id='line_812'>9:24 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon</a>
<a id='line_813'>the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people</a>
<a id='line_814'>saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</a>
<a id='line_815'></a>
<a id='line_816'>10:1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his</a>
<a id='line_817'>censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered</a>
<a id='line_818'>strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.</a>
<a id='line_819'></a>
<a id='line_820'>10:2 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and</a>
<a id='line_821'>they died before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_822'></a>
<a id='line_823'>10:3 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,</a>
<a id='line_824'>saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all</a>
<a id='line_825'>the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.</a>
<a id='line_826'></a>
<a id='line_827'>10:4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the</a>
<a id='line_828'>uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren</a>
<a id='line_829'>from before the sanctuary out of the camp.</a>
<a id='line_830'></a>
<a id='line_831'>10:5 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the</a>
<a id='line_832'>camp; as Moses had said.</a>
<a id='line_833'></a>
<a id='line_834'>10:6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his</a>
<a id='line_835'>sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die,</a>
<a id='line_836'>and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the</a>
<a id='line_837'>whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.</a>
<a id='line_838'></a>
<a id='line_839'>10:7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_840'>congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon</a>
<a id='line_841'>you. And they did according to the word of Moses.</a>
<a id='line_842'></a>
<a id='line_843'>10:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, 10:9 Do not drink wine nor</a>
<a id='line_844'>strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the</a>
<a id='line_845'>tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for</a>
<a id='line_846'>ever throughout your generations: 10:10 And that ye may put difference</a>
<a id='line_847'>between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean; 10:11 And that</a>
<a id='line_848'>ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD</a>
<a id='line_849'>hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.</a>
<a id='line_850'></a>
<a id='line_851'>10:12 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,</a>
<a id='line_852'>his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the</a>
<a id='line_853'>offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside</a>
<a id='line_854'>the altar: for it is most holy: 10:13 And ye shall eat it in the holy</a>
<a id='line_855'>place, because it is thy due, and thy sons’ due, of the sacrifices of</a>
<a id='line_856'>the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.</a>
<a id='line_857'></a>
<a id='line_858'>10:14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean</a>
<a id='line_859'>place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be</a>
<a id='line_860'>thy due, and thy sons’ due, which are given out of the sacrifices of</a>
<a id='line_861'>peace offerings of the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_862'></a>
<a id='line_863'>10:15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the</a>
<a id='line_864'>offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering</a>
<a id='line_865'>before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons’ with thee, by a</a>
<a id='line_866'>statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.</a>
<a id='line_867'></a>
<a id='line_868'>10:16 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,</a>
<a id='line_869'>behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the</a>
<a id='line_870'>sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying, 10:17 Wherefore have ye</a>
<a id='line_871'>not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy,</a>
<a id='line_872'>and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to</a>
<a id='line_873'>make atonement for them before the LORD?  10:18 Behold, the blood of</a>
<a id='line_874'>it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have</a>
<a id='line_875'>eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.</a>
<a id='line_876'></a>
<a id='line_877'>10:19 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered</a>
<a id='line_878'>their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such</a>
<a id='line_879'>things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day,</a>
<a id='line_880'>should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?  10:20 And when</a>
<a id='line_881'>Moses heard that, he was content.</a>
<a id='line_882'></a>
<a id='line_883'>11:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,</a>
<a id='line_884'>11:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts</a>
<a id='line_885'>which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.</a>
<a id='line_886'></a>
<a id='line_887'>11:3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the</a>
<a id='line_888'>cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.</a>
<a id='line_889'></a>
<a id='line_890'>11:4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or</a>
<a id='line_891'>of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the</a>
<a id='line_892'>cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.</a>
<a id='line_893'></a>
<a id='line_894'>11:5 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the</a>
<a id='line_895'>hoof; he is unclean unto you.</a>
<a id='line_896'></a>
<a id='line_897'>11:6 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the</a>
<a id='line_898'>hoof; he is unclean unto you.</a>
<a id='line_899'></a>
<a id='line_900'>11:7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,</a>
<a id='line_901'>yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.</a>
<a id='line_902'></a>
<a id='line_903'>11:8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not</a>
<a id='line_904'>touch; they are unclean to you.</a>
<a id='line_905'></a>
<a id='line_906'>11:9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath</a>
<a id='line_907'>fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them</a>
<a id='line_908'>shall ye eat.</a>
<a id='line_909'></a>
<a id='line_910'>11:10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the</a>
<a id='line_911'>rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which</a>

<a id='line_913'>shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their</a>
<a id='line_914'>flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.</a>
<a id='line_915'></a>
<a id='line_916'>11:12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be</a>
<a id='line_917'>an abomination unto you.</a>

<a id='line_922'>after his kind; 11:15 Every raven after his kind; 11:16 And the owl,</a>
<a id='line_923'>and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, 11:17</a>
<a id='line_924'>And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, 11:18 And</a>

<a id='line_1520'>16:3 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock</a>

<a id='line_1523'>16:4 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen</a>

<a id='line_2446'>25:10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty</a>

<a id='line_2450'></a>
<a id='line_2451'>25:11 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow,</a>

<a id='line_2454'></a>
<a id='line_2455'>25:12 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat</a>

<a id='line_2466'>shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of</a>
<a id='line_2467'>years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number</a>

<a id='line_2469'></a>
<a id='line_2470'>25:17 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear</a>

<a id='line_2474'>them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.</a>
<a id='line_2475'></a>
<a id='line_2476'>25:19 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill,</a>

<a id='line_2478'></a>
<a id='line_2479'>25:20 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold,</a>
<a id='line_2480'>we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: 25:21 Then I will</a>
<a id='line_2481'>command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring</a>
<a id='line_2482'>forth fruit for three years.</a>
<a id='line_2483'></a>
<a id='line_2484'>25:22 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until</a>

<a id='line_2487'></a>
<a id='line_2488'>25:23 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for</a>
<a id='line_2489'>ye are strangers and sojourners with me.</a>
<a id='line_2490'></a>
<a id='line_2491'>25:24 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a</a>
<a id='line_2492'>redemption for the land.</a>
<a id='line_2493'></a>
<a id='line_2494'>25:25 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his</a>
<a id='line_2495'>possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he</a>
<a id='line_2496'>redeem that which his brother sold.</a>
<a id='line_2497'></a>
<a id='line_2498'>25:26 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to</a>
<a id='line_2499'>redeem it; 25:27 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and</a>
<a id='line_2500'>restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may</a>
<a id='line_2501'>return unto his possession.</a>
<a id='line_2502'></a>
<a id='line_2503'>25:28 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is</a>
<a id='line_2504'>sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the</a>
<a id='line_2505'>year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return</a>
<a id='line_2506'>unto his possession.</a>
<a id='line_2507'></a>
<a id='line_2508'>25:29 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may</a>
<a id='line_2509'>redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may</a>

<a id='line_2511'></a>
<a id='line_2512'>25:30 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then</a>
<a id='line_2513'>the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to</a>
<a id='line_2514'>him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in</a>
<a id='line_2515'>the jubile.</a>
<a id='line_2516'></a>
<a id='line_2517'>25:31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about</a>
<a id='line_2518'>them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be</a>
<a id='line_2519'>redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.</a>
<a id='line_2520'></a>
<a id='line_2521'>25:32 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the</a>
<a id='line_2522'>cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.</a>
<a id='line_2523'></a>
<a id='line_2524'>25:33 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was</a>
<a id='line_2525'>sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of</a>
<a id='line_2526'>jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their</a>
<a id='line_2527'>possession among the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2528'></a>
<a id='line_2529'>25:34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;</a>
<a id='line_2530'>for it is their perpetual possession.</a>
<a id='line_2531'></a>
<a id='line_2532'>25:35 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee;</a>
<a id='line_2533'>then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a</a>

<a id='line_2535'></a>
<a id='line_2536'>25:36 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that</a>
<a id='line_2537'>thy brother may live with thee.</a>

<a id='line_2541'></a>
<a id='line_2542'>25:38 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land</a>
<a id='line_2543'>of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.</a>
<a id='line_2544'></a>
<a id='line_2545'>25:39 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be</a>
<a id='line_2546'>sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:</a>
<a id='line_2547'>25:40 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with</a>
<a id='line_2548'>thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.</a>
<a id='line_2549'></a>
<a id='line_2550'>25:41 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children</a>
<a id='line_2551'>with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the</a>
<a id='line_2552'>possession of his fathers shall he return.</a>
<a id='line_2553'></a>
<a id='line_2554'>25:42 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land</a>
<a id='line_2555'>of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.</a>
<a id='line_2556'></a>
<a id='line_2557'>25:43 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy</a>
<a id='line_2558'>God.</a>
<a id='line_2559'></a>
<a id='line_2560'>25:44 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,</a>
<a id='line_2561'>shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy</a>
<a id='line_2562'>bondmen and bondmaids.</a>
<a id='line_2563'></a>
<a id='line_2564'>25:45 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among</a>
<a id='line_2565'>you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you,</a>
<a id='line_2566'>which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.</a>
<a id='line_2567'></a>
<a id='line_2568'>25:46 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after</a>
<a id='line_2569'>you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for</a>
<a id='line_2570'>ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule</a>
<a id='line_2571'>one over another with rigour.</a>
<a id='line_2572'></a>
<a id='line_2573'>25:47 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother</a>
<a id='line_2574'>that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or</a>
<a id='line_2575'>sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger’s family: 25:48</a>
<a id='line_2576'>After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren</a>
<a id='line_2577'>may redeem him: 25:49 Either his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem</a>
<a id='line_2578'>him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him;</a>
<a id='line_2579'>or if he be able, he may redeem himself.</a>
<a id='line_2580'></a>
<a id='line_2581'>25:50 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that</a>
<a id='line_2582'>he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale</a>
<a id='line_2583'>shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of</a>
<a id='line_2584'>an hired servant shall it be with him.</a>
<a id='line_2585'></a>
<a id='line_2586'>25:51 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall</a>
<a id='line_2587'>give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was</a>
<a id='line_2588'>bought for.</a>
<a id='line_2589'></a>
<a id='line_2590'>25:52 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then</a>
<a id='line_2591'>he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give</a>
<a id='line_2592'>him again the price of his redemption.</a>
<a id='line_2593'></a>
<a id='line_2594'>25:53 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the</a>
<a id='line_2595'>other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.</a>
<a id='line_2596'></a>
<a id='line_2597'>25:54 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out</a>
<a id='line_2598'>in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.</a>
<a id='line_2599'></a>
<a id='line_2600'>25:55 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my</a>
<a id='line_2601'>servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2602'>your God.</a>
<a id='line_2603'></a>
<a id='line_2604'>26:1 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up</a>
<a id='line_2605'>a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your</a>
<a id='line_2606'>land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.</a>
<a id='line_2607'></a>
<a id='line_2608'>26:2 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the</a>
<a id='line_2609'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2610'></a>
<a id='line_2611'>26:3 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;</a>
<a id='line_2612'>26:4 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield</a>
<a id='line_2613'>her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.</a>
<a id='line_2614'></a>
<a id='line_2615'>26:5 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage</a>
<a id='line_2616'>shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the</a>
<a id='line_2617'>full, and dwell in your land safely.</a>
<a id='line_2618'></a>
<a id='line_2619'>26:6 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and</a>
<a id='line_2620'>none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the</a>
<a id='line_2621'>land, neither shall the sword go through your land.</a>
<a id='line_2622'></a>
<a id='line_2623'>26:7 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you</a>
<a id='line_2624'>by the sword.</a>
<a id='line_2625'></a>
<a id='line_2626'>26:8 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you</a>
<a id='line_2627'>shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before</a>
<a id='line_2628'>you by the sword.</a>
<a id='line_2629'></a>
<a id='line_2630'>26:9 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and</a>
<a id='line_2631'>multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.</a>
<a id='line_2632'></a>
<a id='line_2633'>26:10 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of</a>
<a id='line_2634'>the new.</a>
<a id='line_2635'></a>
<a id='line_2636'>26:11 And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor</a>
<a id='line_2637'>you.</a>
<a id='line_2638'></a>
<a id='line_2639'>26:12 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be</a>
<a id='line_2640'>my people.</a>
<a id='line_2641'></a>
<a id='line_2642'>26:13 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land</a>
<a id='line_2643'>of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the</a>
<a id='line_2644'>bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.</a>
<a id='line_2645'></a>
<a id='line_2646'>26:14 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these</a>
<a id='line_2647'>commandments; 26:15 And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your</a>
<a id='line_2648'>soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments,</a>
<a id='line_2649'>but that ye break my covenant: 26:16 I also will do this unto you; I</a>
<a id='line_2650'>will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague,</a>
<a id='line_2651'>that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall</a>
<a id='line_2652'>sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</a>
<a id='line_2653'></a>
<a id='line_2654'>26:17 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before</a>
<a id='line_2655'>your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall</a>

<a id='line_2657'></a>
<a id='line_2658'>26:18 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will</a>
<a id='line_2659'>punish you seven times more for your sins.</a>
<a id='line_2660'></a>
<a id='line_2661'>26:19 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your</a>
<a id='line_2662'>heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: 26:20 And your strength shall</a>
<a id='line_2663'>be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither</a>
<a id='line_2664'>shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.</a>
<a id='line_2665'></a>
<a id='line_2666'>26:21 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I</a>
<a id='line_2667'>will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.</a>
<a id='line_2668'></a>
<a id='line_2669'>26:22 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of</a>

<a id='line_2671'>and your high ways shall be desolate.</a>
<a id='line_2672'></a>
<a id='line_2673'>26:23 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will</a>
<a id='line_2674'>walk contrary unto me; 26:24 Then will I also walk contrary unto you,</a>
<a id='line_2675'>and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.</a>
<a id='line_2676'></a>
<a id='line_2677'>26:25 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel</a>
<a id='line_2678'>of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities,</a>
<a id='line_2679'>I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into</a>
<a id='line_2680'>the hand of the enemy.</a>
<a id='line_2681'></a>
<a id='line_2682'>26:26 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall</a>

<a id='line_2684'>again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.</a>
<a id='line_2685'></a>
<a id='line_2686'>26:27 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk</a>
<a id='line_2687'>contrary unto me; 26:28 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in</a>
<a id='line_2688'>fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.</a>
<a id='line_2689'></a>
<a id='line_2690'>26:29 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your</a>

<a id='line_2692'></a>
<a id='line_2693'>26:30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,</a>
<a id='line_2694'>and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul</a>
<a id='line_2695'>shall abhor you.</a>
<a id='line_2696'></a>
<a id='line_2697'>26:31 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries</a>

<a id='line_2699'></a>
<a id='line_2700'>26:32 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies</a>

<a id='line_2702'></a>
<a id='line_2703'>26:33 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a</a>

<a id='line_2705'>waste.</a>
<a id='line_2706'></a>
<a id='line_2707'>26:34 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth</a>

<a id='line_2710'></a>
<a id='line_2711'>26:35 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not</a>

<a id='line_2713'></a>
<a id='line_2714'>26:36 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness</a>

<a id='line_2717'>sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.</a>
<a id='line_2718'></a>
<a id='line_2719'>26:37 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword,</a>
<a id='line_2720'>when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your</a>

<a id='line_2722'></a>
<a id='line_2723'>26:38 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your</a>

<a id='line_2729'></a>
<a id='line_2730'>26:40 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their</a>

<a id='line_2734'>their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they</a>
<a id='line_2735'>then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: 26:42 Then will I</a>
<a id='line_2736'>remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and</a>
<a id='line_2737'>also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the</a>

<a id='line_2739'></a>
<a id='line_2740'>26:43 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her</a>
<a id='line_2741'>sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept</a>
<a id='line_2742'>of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they</a>
<a id='line_2743'>despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.</a>
<a id='line_2744'></a>
<a id='line_2745'>26:44 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies,</a>
<a id='line_2746'>I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them</a>
<a id='line_2747'>utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their</a>
<a id='line_2748'>God.</a>
<a id='line_2749'></a>
<a id='line_2750'>26:45 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their</a>
<a id='line_2751'>ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight</a>
<a id='line_2752'>of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2753'></a>
<a id='line_2754'>26:46 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2755'>made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand</a>
<a id='line_2756'>of Moses.</a>
<a id='line_2757'></a>
<a id='line_2758'>27:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 27:2 Speak unto the</a>
<a id='line_2759'>children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a</a>
<a id='line_2760'>singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation.</a>
<a id='line_2761'></a>
<a id='line_2762'>27:3 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old</a>
<a id='line_2763'>even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels</a>
<a id='line_2764'>of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</a>
<a id='line_2765'></a>
<a id='line_2766'>27:4 And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty</a>
<a id='line_2767'>shekels.</a>
<a id='line_2768'></a>
<a id='line_2769'>27:5 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then</a>
<a id='line_2770'>thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female</a>
<a id='line_2771'>ten shekels.</a>
<a id='line_2772'></a>
<a id='line_2773'>27:6 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy</a>
<a id='line_2774'>estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the</a>
<a id='line_2775'>female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.</a>
<a id='line_2776'></a>
<a id='line_2777'>27:7 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male,</a>
<a id='line_2778'>then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten</a>
<a id='line_2779'>shekels.</a>
<a id='line_2780'></a>
<a id='line_2781'>27:8 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present</a>
<a id='line_2782'>himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according</a>
<a id='line_2783'>to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.</a>
<a id='line_2784'></a>
<a id='line_2785'>27:9 And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the</a>
<a id='line_2786'>LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.</a>
<a id='line_2787'></a>
<a id='line_2788'>27:10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad</a>
<a id='line_2789'>for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and</a>
<a id='line_2790'>the exchange thereof shall be holy.</a>
<a id='line_2791'></a>
<a id='line_2792'>27:11 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a</a>
<a id='line_2793'>sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the</a>
<a id='line_2794'>priest: 27:12 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or</a>
<a id='line_2795'>bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.</a>
<a id='line_2796'></a>
<a id='line_2797'>27:13 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part</a>
<a id='line_2798'>thereof unto thy estimation.</a>
<a id='line_2799'></a>
<a id='line_2800'>27:14 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the</a>
<a id='line_2801'>LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as</a>
<a id='line_2802'>the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.</a>
<a id='line_2803'></a>
<a id='line_2804'>27:15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he</a>
<a id='line_2805'>shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and</a>
<a id='line_2806'>it shall be his.</a>
<a id='line_2807'></a>
<a id='line_2808'>27:16 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field</a>
<a id='line_2809'>of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed</a>
<a id='line_2810'>thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of</a>
<a id='line_2811'>silver.</a>
<a id='line_2812'></a>
<a id='line_2813'>27:17 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to</a>
<a id='line_2814'>thy estimation it shall stand.</a>
<a id='line_2815'></a>
<a id='line_2816'>27:18 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest</a>
<a id='line_2817'>shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain,</a>
<a id='line_2818'>even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy</a>
<a id='line_2819'>estimation.</a>
<a id='line_2820'></a>
<a id='line_2821'>27:19 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it,</a>
<a id='line_2822'>then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto</a>
<a id='line_2823'>it, and it shall be assured to him.</a>
<a id='line_2824'></a>
<a id='line_2825'>27:20 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the</a>
<a id='line_2826'>field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.</a>
<a id='line_2827'></a>
<a id='line_2828'>27:21 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy</a>
<a id='line_2829'>unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the</a>
<a id='line_2830'>priest’s.</a>
<a id='line_2831'></a>
<a id='line_2832'>27:22 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath</a>
<a id='line_2833'>bought, which is not of the fields of his possession; 27:23 Then the</a>
<a id='line_2834'>priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto</a>
<a id='line_2835'>the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that</a>
<a id='line_2836'>day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2837'></a>
<a id='line_2838'>27:24 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of</a>
<a id='line_2839'>whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did</a>
<a id='line_2840'>belong.</a>
<a id='line_2841'></a>
<a id='line_2842'>27:25 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the</a>
<a id='line_2843'>sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</a>
<a id='line_2844'></a>
<a id='line_2845'>27:26 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD’s</a>
<a id='line_2846'>firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is</a>
<a id='line_2847'>the LORD’s.</a>
<a id='line_2848'></a>
<a id='line_2849'>27:27 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it</a>
<a id='line_2850'>according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it</a>
<a id='line_2851'>thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to</a>
<a id='line_2852'>thy estimation.</a>
<a id='line_2853'></a>
<a id='line_2854'>27:28 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto</a>
<a id='line_2855'>the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field</a>
<a id='line_2856'>of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is</a>
<a id='line_2857'>most holy unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2858'></a>
<a id='line_2859'>27:29 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed;</a>
<a id='line_2860'>but shall surely be put to death.</a>
<a id='line_2861'></a>
<a id='line_2862'>27:30 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land,</a>
<a id='line_2863'>or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD’s: it is holy unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2864'></a>
<a id='line_2865'>27:31 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall</a>
<a id='line_2866'>add thereto the fifth part thereof.</a>
<a id='line_2867'></a>
<a id='line_2868'>27:32 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of</a>
<a id='line_2869'>whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the</a>
<a id='line_2870'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2871'></a>
<a id='line_2872'>27:33 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he</a>
<a id='line_2873'>change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change</a>
<a id='line_2874'>thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</a>
<a id='line_2875'></a>
<a id='line_2876'>27:34 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for</a>
<a id='line_2877'>the children of Israel in mount Sinai.</a>
