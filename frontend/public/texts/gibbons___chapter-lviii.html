<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>      About twenty years after the conquest of Jerusalem by the Turks,</a>
<a id='line_10'>      the holy sepulchre was visited by a hermit of the name of Peter,</a>
<a id='line_11'>      a native of Amiens, in the province of Picardy 1 in France. His</a>
<a id='line_12'>      resentment and sympathy were excited by his own injuries and the</a>
<a id='line_13'>      oppression of the Christian name; he mingled his tears with those</a>
<a id='line_14'>      of the patriarch, and earnestly inquired, if no hopes of relief</a>
<a id='line_15'>      could be entertained from the Greek emperors of the East. The</a>
<a id='line_16'>      patriarch exposed the vices and weakness of the successors of</a>
<a id='line_17'>      Constantine. “I will rouse,” exclaimed the hermit, “the martial</a>
<a id='line_18'>      nations of Europe in your cause;” and Europe was obedient to the</a>
<a id='line_19'>      call of the hermit. The astonished patriarch dismissed him with</a>
<a id='line_20'>      epistles of credit and complaint; and no sooner did he land at</a>
<a id='line_21'>      Bari, than Peter hastened to kiss the feet of the Roman pontiff.</a>
<a id='line_22'>      His stature was small, his appearance contemptible; but his eye</a>
<a id='line_23'>      was keen and lively; and he possessed that vehemence of speech,</a>
<a id='line_24'>      which seldom fails to impart the persuasion of the soul. 2 He was</a>
<a id='line_25'>      born of a gentleman’s family, (for we must now adopt a modern</a>
<a id='line_26'>      idiom,) and his military service was under the neighboring counts</a>
<a id='line_27'>      of Boulogne, the heroes of the first crusade. But he soon</a>
<a id='line_28'>      relinquished the sword and the world; and if it be true, that his</a>
<a id='line_29'>      wife, however noble, was aged and ugly, he might withdraw, with</a>
<a id='line_30'>      the less reluctance, from her bed to a convent, and at length to</a>
<a id='line_31'>      a hermitage. 211 In this austere solitude, his body was</a>
<a id='line_32'>      emaciated, his fancy was inflamed; whatever he wished, he</a>
<a id='line_33'>      believed; whatever he believed, he saw in dreams and revelations.</a>
<a id='line_34'>      From Jerusalem the pilgrim returned an accomplished fanatic; but</a>
<a id='line_35'>      as he excelled in the popular madness of the times, Pope Urban</a>
<a id='line_36'>      the Second received him as a prophet, applauded his glorious</a>
<a id='line_37'>      design, promised to support it in a general council, and</a>
<a id='line_38'>      encouraged him to proclaim the deliverance of the Holy Land.</a>
<a id='line_39'>      Invigorated by the approbation of the pontiff, his zealous</a>
<a id='line_40'>      missionary traversed. with speed and success, the provinces of</a>
<a id='line_41'>      Italy and France. His diet was abstemious, his prayers long and</a>
<a id='line_42'>      fervent, and the alms which he received with one hand, he</a>
<a id='line_43'>      distributed with the other: his head was bare, his feet naked,</a>
<a id='line_44'>      his meagre body was wrapped in a coarse garment; he bore and</a>
<a id='line_45'>      displayed a weighty crucifix; and the ass on which he rode was</a>
<a id='line_46'>      sanctified, in the public eye, by the service of the man of God.</a>
<a id='line_47'>      He preached to innumerable crowds in the churches, the streets,</a>
<a id='line_48'>      and the highways: the hermit entered with equal confidence the</a>
<a id='line_49'>      palace and the cottage; and the people (for all was people) was</a>
<a id='line_50'>      impetuously moved by his call to repentance and arms. When he</a>
<a id='line_51'>      painted the sufferings of the natives and pilgrims of Palestine,</a>
<a id='line_52'>      every heart was melted to compassion; every breast glowed with</a>
<a id='line_53'>      indignation, when he challenged the warriors of the age to defend</a>
<a id='line_54'>      their brethren, and rescue their Savior: his ignorance of art and</a>
<a id='line_55'>      language was compensated by sighs, and tears, and ejaculations;</a>
<a id='line_56'>      and Peter supplied the deficiency of reason by loud and frequent</a>
<a id='line_57'>      appeals to Christ and his mother, to the saints and angels of</a>
<a id='line_58'>      paradise, with whom he had personally conversed. 212 The most</a>
<a id='line_59'>      perfect orator of Athens might have envied the success of his</a>
<a id='line_60'>      eloquence; the rustic enthusiast inspired the passions which he</a>
<a id='line_61'>      felt, and Christendom expected with impatience the counsels and</a>
<a id='line_62'>      decrees of the supreme pontiff.</a>

<a id='line_85'>      The magnanimous spirit of Gregory the Seventh had already</a>
<a id='line_86'>      embraced the design of arming Europe against Asia; the ardor of</a>
<a id='line_87'>      his zeal and ambition still breathes in his epistles: from either</a>
<a id='line_88'>      side of the Alps, fifty thousand Catholics had enlisted under the</a>
<a id='line_89'>      banner of St. Peter; 3 and his successor reveals his intention of</a>
<a id='line_90'>      marching at their head against the impious sectaries of Mahomet.</a>
<a id='line_91'>      But the glory or reproach of executing, though not in person,</a>
<a id='line_92'>      this holy enterprise, was reserved for Urban the Second, 4 the</a>
<a id='line_93'>      most faithful of his disciples. He undertook the conquest of the</a>
<a id='line_94'>      East, whilst the larger portion of Rome was possessed and</a>
<a id='line_95'>      fortified by his rival Guibert of Ravenna, who contended with</a>
<a id='line_96'>      Urban for the name and honors of the pontificate. He attempted to</a>
<a id='line_97'>      unite the powers of the West, at a time when the princes were</a>
<a id='line_98'>      separated from the church, and the people from their princes, by</a>
<a id='line_99'>      the excommunication which himself and his predecessors had</a>
<a id='line_100'>      thundered against the emperor and the king of France. Philip the</a>
<a id='line_101'>      First, of France, supported with patience the censures which he</a>
<a id='line_102'>      had provoked by his scandalous life and adulterous marriage.</a>
<a id='line_103'>      Henry the Fourth, of Germany, asserted the right of investitures,</a>
<a id='line_104'>      the prerogative of confirming his bishops by the delivery of the</a>
<a id='line_105'>      ring and crosier. But the emperor’s party was crushed in Italy by</a>
<a id='line_106'>      the arms of the Normans and the Countess Mathilda; and the long</a>
<a id='line_107'>      quarrel had been recently envenomed by the revolt of his son</a>
<a id='line_108'>      Conrad and the shame of his wife, 5 who, in the synods of</a>
<a id='line_109'>      Constance and Placentia, confessed the manifold prostitutions to</a>
<a id='line_110'>      which she had been exposed by a husband regardless of her honor</a>
<a id='line_111'>      and his own. 6 So popular was the cause of Urban, so weighty was</a>
<a id='line_112'>      his influence, that the council which he summoned at Placentia 7</a>
<a id='line_113'>      was composed of two hundred bishops of Italy, France, Burgandy,</a>
<a id='line_114'>      Swabia, and Bavaria. Four thousand of the clergy, and thirty</a>
<a id='line_115'>      thousand of the laity, attended this important meeting; and, as</a>
<a id='line_116'>      the most spacious cathedral would have been inadequate to the</a>
<a id='line_117'>      multitude, the session of seven days was held in a plain adjacent</a>
<a id='line_118'>      to the city. The ambassadors of the Greek emperor, Alexius</a>
<a id='line_119'>      Comnenus, were introduced to plead the distress of their</a>
<a id='line_120'>      sovereign, and the danger of Constantinople, which was divided</a>
<a id='line_121'>      only by a narrow sea from the victorious Turks, the common</a>
<a id='line_122'>      enemies of the Christian name. In their suppliant address they</a>
<a id='line_123'>      flattered the pride of the Latin princes; and, appealing at once</a>
<a id='line_124'>      to their policy and religion, exhorted them to repel the</a>
<a id='line_125'>      Barbarians on the confines of Asia, rather than to expect them in</a>
<a id='line_126'>      the heart of Europe. At the sad tale of the misery and perils of</a>
<a id='line_127'>      their Eastern brethren, the assembly burst into tears; the most</a>
<a id='line_128'>      eager champions declared their readiness to march; and the Greek</a>
<a id='line_129'>      ambassadors were dismissed with the assurance of a speedy and</a>
<a id='line_130'>      powerful succor. The relief of Constantinople was included in the</a>
<a id='line_131'>      larger and most distant project of the deliverance of Jerusalem;</a>
<a id='line_132'>      but the prudent Urban adjourned the final decision to a second</a>
<a id='line_133'>      synod, which he proposed to celebrate in some city of France in</a>
<a id='line_134'>      the autumn of the same year. The short delay would propagate the</a>
<a id='line_135'>      flame of enthusiasm; and his firmest hope was in a nation of</a>
<a id='line_136'>      soldiers 8 still proud of the preeminence of their name, and</a>
<a id='line_137'>      ambitious to emulate their hero Charlemagne, 9 who, in the</a>
<a id='line_138'>      popular romance of Turpin, 10 had achieved the conquest of the</a>
<a id='line_139'>      Holy Land. A latent motive of affection or vanity might influence</a>
<a id='line_140'>      the choice of Urban: he was himself a native of France, a monk of</a>
<a id='line_141'>      Clugny, and the first of his countrymen who ascended the throne</a>
<a id='line_142'>      of St. Peter. The pope had illustrated his family and province;</a>
<a id='line_143'>      nor is there perhaps a more exquisite gratification than to</a>
<a id='line_144'>      revisit, in a conspicuous dignity, the humble and laborious</a>

<a id='line_207'>      soon as we form a just estimate of a king of France of the</a>
<a id='line_208'>      eleventh century. 11 Philip the First was the great-grandson of</a>
<a id='line_209'>      Hugh Capet, the founder of the present race, who, in the decline</a>
<a id='line_210'>      of Charlemagne’s posterity, added the regal title to his</a>
<a id='line_211'>      patrimonial estates of Paris and Orleans. In this narrow compass,</a>
<a id='line_212'>      he was possessed of wealth and jurisdiction; but in the rest of</a>
<a id='line_213'>      France, Hugh and his first descendants were no more than the</a>
<a id='line_214'>      feudal lords of about sixty dukes and counts, of independent and</a>
<a id='line_215'>      hereditary power, 12 who disdained the control of laws and legal</a>
<a id='line_216'>      assemblies, and whose disregard of their sovereign was revenged</a>
<a id='line_217'>      by the disobedience of their inferior vassals. At Clermont, in</a>
<a id='line_218'>      the territories of the count of Auvergne, 13 the pope might brave</a>
<a id='line_219'>      with impunity the resentment of Philip; and the council which he</a>
<a id='line_220'>      convened in that city was not less numerous or respectable than</a>
<a id='line_221'>      the synod of Placentia. 14 Besides his court and council of Roman</a>
<a id='line_222'>      cardinals, he was supported by thirteen archbishops and two</a>
<a id='line_223'>      hundred and twenty-five bishops: the number of mitred prelates</a>
<a id='line_224'>      was computed at four hundred; and the fathers of the church were</a>
<a id='line_225'>      blessed by the saints and enlightened by the doctors of the age.</a>
<a id='line_226'>      From the adjacent kingdoms, a martial train of lords and knights</a>
<a id='line_227'>      of power and renown attended the council, 15 in high expectation</a>
<a id='line_228'>      of its resolves; and such was the ardor of zeal and curiosity,</a>
<a id='line_229'>      that the city was filled, and many thousands, in the month of</a>
<a id='line_230'>      November, erected their tents or huts in the open field. A</a>
<a id='line_231'>      session of eight days produced some useful or edifying canons for</a>
<a id='line_232'>      the reformation of manners; a severe censure was pronounced</a>
<a id='line_233'>      against the license of private war; the Truce of God 16 was</a>
<a id='line_234'>      confirmed, a suspension of hostilities during four days of the</a>
<a id='line_235'>      week; women and priests were placed under the safeguard of the</a>
<a id='line_236'>      church; and a protection of three years was extended to</a>
<a id='line_237'>      husbandmen and merchants, the defenceless victims of military</a>
<a id='line_238'>      rapine. But a law, however venerable be the sanction, cannot</a>
<a id='line_239'>      suddenly transform the temper of the times; and the benevolent</a>
<a id='line_240'>      efforts of Urban deserve the less praise, since he labored to</a>
<a id='line_241'>      appease some domestic quarrels that he might spread the flames of</a>
<a id='line_242'>      war from the Atlantic to the Euphrates. From the synod of</a>
<a id='line_243'>      Placentia, the rumor of his great design had gone forth among the</a>
<a id='line_244'>      nations: the clergy on their return had preached in every diocese</a>

<a id='line_246'>      the pope ascended a lofty scaffold in the market-place of</a>

<a id='line_248'>      impatient audience. His topics were obvious, his exhortation was</a>
<a id='line_249'>      vehement, his success inevitable. The orator was interrupted by</a>
<a id='line_250'>      the shout of thousands, who with one voice, and in their rustic</a>
<a id='line_251'>      idiom, exclaimed aloud, “God wills it, God wills it.” 17 “It is</a>
<a id='line_252'>      indeed the will of God,” replied the pope; “and let this</a>
<a id='line_253'>      memorable word, the inspiration surely of the Holy Spirit, be</a>
<a id='line_254'>      forever adopted as your cry of battle, to animate the devotion</a>

<a id='line_257'>      mark, on your breasts or shoulders, as a pledge of your sacred</a>
<a id='line_258'>      and irrevocable engagement.” The proposal was joyfully accepted;</a>
<a id='line_259'>      great numbers, both of the clergy and laity, impressed on their</a>
<a id='line_260'>      garments the sign of the cross, 18 and solicited the pope to</a>
<a id='line_261'>      march at their head. This dangerous honor was declined by the</a>
<a id='line_262'>      more prudent successor of Gregory, who alleged the schism of the</a>

<a id='line_365'>      unless the motive were pure, the quarrel legitimate, and the</a>

<a id='line_368'>      conscience should be satisfied of the justice and propriety of</a>
<a id='line_369'>      our enterprise. In the age of the crusades, the Christians, both</a>
<a id='line_370'>      of the East and West, were persuaded of their lawfulness and</a>
<a id='line_371'>      merit; their arguments are clouded by the perpetual abuse of</a>
<a id='line_372'>      Scripture and rhetoric; but they seem to insist on the right of</a>
<a id='line_373'>      natural and religious defence, their peculiar title to the Holy</a>
<a id='line_374'>      Land, and the impiety of their Pagan and Mahometan foes. 20</a>
<a id='line_375'></a>
<a id='line_376'>      I. The right of a just defence may fairly include our civil and</a>
<a id='line_377'>      spiritual allies: it depends on the existence of danger; and that</a>
<a id='line_378'>      danger must be estimated by the twofold consideration of the</a>
<a id='line_379'>      malice, and the power, of our enemies. A pernicious tenet has</a>
<a id='line_380'>      been imputed to the Mahometans, the duty of extirpating all other</a>
<a id='line_381'>      religions by the sword. This charge of ignorance and bigotry is</a>
<a id='line_382'>      refuted by the Koran, by the history of the Mussulman conquerors,</a>
<a id='line_383'>      and by their public and legal toleration of the Christian</a>
<a id='line_384'>      worship. But it cannot be denied, that the Oriental churches are</a>
<a id='line_385'>      depressed under their iron yoke; that, in peace and war, they</a>
<a id='line_386'>      assert a divine and indefeasible claim of universal empire; and</a>
<a id='line_387'>      that, in their orthodox creed, the unbelieving nations are</a>
<a id='line_388'>      continually threatened with the loss of religion or liberty. In</a>
<a id='line_389'>      the eleventh century, the victorious arms of the Turks presented</a>
<a id='line_390'>      a real and urgent apprehension of these losses. They had subdued,</a>
<a id='line_391'>      in less than thirty years, the kingdoms of Asia, as far as</a>
<a id='line_392'>      Jerusalem and the Hellespont; and the Greek empire tottered on</a>
<a id='line_393'>      the verge of destruction. Besides an honest sympathy for their</a>
<a id='line_394'>      brethren, the Latins had a right and interest in the support of</a>
<a id='line_395'>      Constantinople, the most important barrier of the West; and the</a>
<a id='line_396'>      privilege of defence must reach to prevent, as well as to repel,</a>
<a id='line_397'>      an impending assault. But this salutary purpose might have been</a>
<a id='line_398'>      accomplished by a moderate succor; and our calmer reason must</a>
<a id='line_399'>      disclaim the innumerable hosts, and remote operations, which</a>

<a id='line_498'>      During this term of mortification, the patient was healed, the</a>
<a id='line_499'>      criminal was absolved, by a salutary regimen of fasts and</a>
<a id='line_500'>      prayers: the disorder of his dress was expressive of grief and</a>
<a id='line_501'>      remorse; and he humbly abstained from all the business and</a>
<a id='line_502'>      pleasure of social life. But the rigid execution of these laws</a>
<a id='line_503'>      would have depopulated the palace, the camp, and the city; the</a>
<a id='line_504'>      Barbarians of the West believed and trembled; but nature often</a>
<a id='line_505'>      rebelled against principle; and the magistrate labored without</a>
<a id='line_506'>      effect to enforce the jurisdiction of the priest. A literal</a>
<a id='line_507'>      accomplishment of penance was indeed impracticable: the guilt of</a>
<a id='line_508'>      adultery was multiplied by daily repetition; that of homicide</a>
<a id='line_509'>      might involve the massacre of a whole people; each act was</a>
<a id='line_510'>      separately numbered; and, in those times of anarchy and vice, a</a>
<a id='line_511'>      modest sinner might easily incur a debt of three hundred years.</a>
<a id='line_512'>      His insolvency was relieved by a commutation, or indulgence: a</a>
<a id='line_513'>      year of penance was appreciated at twenty-six solidi 24 of</a>
<a id='line_514'>      silver, about four pounds sterling, for the rich; at three</a>
<a id='line_515'>      solidi, or nine shillings, for the indigent: and these alms were</a>
<a id='line_516'>      soon appropriated to the use of the church, which derived, from</a>
<a id='line_517'>      the redemption of sins, an inexhaustible source of opulence and</a>
<a id='line_518'>      dominion. A debt of three hundred years, or twelve hundred</a>
<a id='line_519'>      pounds, was enough to impoverish a plentiful fortune; the</a>
<a id='line_520'>      scarcity of gold and silver was supplied by the alienation of</a>
<a id='line_521'>      land; and the princely donations of Pepin and Charlemagne are</a>
<a id='line_522'>      expressly given for the remedy of their soul. It is a maxim of</a>
<a id='line_523'>      the civil law, that whosoever cannot pay with his purse, must pay</a>
<a id='line_524'>      with his body; and the practice of flagellation was adopted by</a>
<a id='line_525'>      the monks, a cheap, though painful equivalent. By a fantastic</a>
<a id='line_526'>      arithmetic, a year of penance was taxed at three thousand lashes;</a>
<a id='line_527'>      25 and such was the skill and patience of a famous hermit, St.</a>
<a id='line_528'>      Dominic of the iron Cuirass, 26 that in six days he could</a>
<a id='line_529'>      discharge an entire century, by a whipping of three hundred</a>
<a id='line_530'>      thousand stripes. His example was followed by many penitents of</a>
<a id='line_531'>      both sexes; and, as a vicarious sacrifice was accepted, a sturdy</a>
<a id='line_532'>      disciplinarian might expiate on his own back the sins of his</a>
<a id='line_533'>      benefactors. 27 These compensations of the purse and the person</a>
<a id='line_534'>      introduced, in the eleventh century, a more honorable mode of</a>
<a id='line_535'>      satisfaction. The merit of military service against the Saracens</a>
<a id='line_536'>      of Africa and Spain had been allowed by the predecessors of Urban</a>
<a id='line_537'>      the Second. In the council of Clermont, that pope proclaimed a</a>
<a id='line_538'>      plenary indulgence to those who should enlist under the banner of</a>
<a id='line_539'>      the cross; the absolution of all their sins, and a full receipt</a>
<a id='line_540'>      for all that might be due of canonical penance. 28 The cold</a>
<a id='line_541'>      philosophy of modern times is incapable of feeling the impression</a>
<a id='line_542'>      that was made on a sinful and fanatic world. At the voice of</a>
<a id='line_543'>      their pastor, the robber, the incendiary, the homicide, arose by</a>
<a id='line_544'>      thousands to redeem their souls, by repeating on the infidels the</a>
<a id='line_545'>      same deeds which they had exercised against their Christian</a>
<a id='line_546'>      brethren; and the terms of atonement were eagerly embraced by</a>
<a id='line_547'>      offenders of every rank and denomination. None were pure; none</a>
<a id='line_548'>      were exempt from the guilt and penalty of sin; and those who were</a>
<a id='line_549'>      the least amenable to the justice of God and the church were the</a>
<a id='line_550'>      best entitled to the temporal and eternal recompense of their</a>
<a id='line_551'>      pious courage. If they fell, the spirit of the Latin clergy did</a>
<a id='line_552'>      not hesitate to adorn their tomb with the crown of martyrdom; 29</a>
<a id='line_553'>      and should they survive, they could expect without impatience the</a>
<a id='line_554'>      delay and increase of their heavenly reward. They offered their</a>
<a id='line_555'>      blood to the Son of God, who had laid down his life for their</a>
<a id='line_556'>      salvation: they took up the cross, and entered with confidence</a>
<a id='line_557'>      into the way of the Lord. His providence would watch over their</a>
<a id='line_558'>      safety; perhaps his visible and miraculous power would smooth the</a>
<a id='line_559'>      difficulties of their holy enterprise. The cloud and pillar of</a>

<a id='line_628'>      their bloody tournaments, licentious love, and judicial duels,</a>
<a id='line_629'>      the popes and synods might ineffectually thunder. It is a more</a>

<a id='line_633'>      merit of the humanity and benevolence of modern Christians. War</a>
<a id='line_634'>      and exercise were the reigning passions of the Franks or Latins;</a>
<a id='line_635'>      they were enjoined, as a penance, to gratify those passions, to</a>
<a id='line_636'>      visit distant lands, and to draw their swords against the nation</a>

<a id='line_638'>      immortalize the names of the intrepid heroes of the cross; and</a>
<a id='line_639'>      the purest piety could not be insensible to the most splendid</a>
<a id='line_640'>      prospect of military glory. In the petty quarrels of Europe, they</a>
<a id='line_641'>      shed the blood of their friends and countrymen, for the</a>

<a id='line_649'>      their natural and artificial wealth had been magnified by the</a>
<a id='line_650'>      tales of pilgrims, and the gifts of an imperfect commerce. The</a>

<a id='line_752'>      sepulchre. The hermit, assuming the character, without the</a>
<a id='line_753'>      talents or authority, of a general, impelled or obeyed the</a>
<a id='line_754'>      forward impulse of his votaries along the banks of the Rhine and</a>
<a id='line_755'>      Danube. Their wants and numbers soon compelled them to separate,</a>
<a id='line_756'>      and his lieutenant, Walter the Penniless, a valiant though needy</a>
<a id='line_757'>      soldier, conducted a van guard of pilgrims, whose condition may</a>
<a id='line_758'>      be determined from the proportion of eight horsemen to fifteen</a>
<a id='line_759'>      thousand foot. The example and footsteps of Peter were closely</a>
<a id='line_760'>      pursued by another fanatic, the monk Godescal, whose sermons had</a>
<a id='line_761'>      swept away fifteen or twenty thousand peasants from the villages</a>
<a id='line_762'>      of Germany. Their rear was again pressed by a herd of two hundred</a>
<a id='line_763'>      thousand, the most stupid and savage refuse of the people, who</a>
<a id='line_764'>      mingled with their devotion a brutal license of rapine,</a>
<a id='line_765'>      prostitution, and drunkenness. Some counts and gentlemen, at the</a>
<a id='line_766'>      head of three thousand horse, attended the motions of the</a>
<a id='line_767'>      multitude to partake in the spoil; but their genuine leaders (may</a>
<a id='line_768'>      we credit such folly?) were a goose and a goat, who were carried</a>
<a id='line_769'>      in the front, and to whom these worthy Christians ascribed an</a>
<a id='line_770'>      infusion of the divine spirit. 35 Of these, and of other bands of</a>
<a id='line_771'>      enthusiasts, the first and most easy warfare was against the</a>
<a id='line_772'>      Jews, the murderers of the Son of God. In the trading cities of</a>
<a id='line_773'>      the Moselle and the Rhine, their colonies were numerous and rich;</a>
<a id='line_774'>      and they enjoyed, under the protection of the emperor and the</a>
<a id='line_775'>      bishops, the free exercise of their religion. 36 At Verdun,</a>
<a id='line_776'>      Treves, Mentz, Spires, Worms, many thousands of that unhappy</a>
<a id='line_777'>      people were pillaged and massacred: 37 nor had they felt a more</a>
<a id='line_778'>      bloody stroke since the persecution of Hadrian. A remnant was</a>
<a id='line_779'>      saved by the firmness of their bishops, who accepted a feigned</a>
<a id='line_780'>      and transient conversion; but the more obstinate Jews opposed</a>
<a id='line_781'>      their fanaticism to the fanaticism of the Christians, barricadoed</a>

<a id='line_852'>      (and the hermit Peter was of the number) escaped to the Thracian</a>

<a id='line_928'>      to obey the summons of the pope: Philip the First of France was</a>
<a id='line_929'>      occupied by his pleasures; William Rufus of England by a recent</a>

<a id='line_932'>      Denmark, 42 Sweden, and Poland, were yet strangers to the</a>
<a id='line_933'>      passions and interests of the South. The religious ardor was more</a>
<a id='line_934'>      strongly felt by the princes of the second order, who held an</a>

<a id='line_938'>      by observing at once, that courage and the exercise of arms are</a>
<a id='line_939'>      the common attribute of these Christian adventurers. I. The first</a>
<a id='line_940'>      rank both in war and council is justly due to Godfrey of</a>
<a id='line_941'>      Bouillon; and happy would it have been for the crusaders, if they</a>
<a id='line_942'>      had trusted themselves to the sole conduct of that accomplished</a>
<a id='line_943'>      hero, a worthy representative of Charlemagne, from whom he was</a>
<a id='line_944'>      descended in the female line. His father was of the noble race of</a>
<a id='line_945'>      the counts of Boulogne: Brabant, the lower province of Lorraine,</a>
<a id='line_946'>      43 was the inheritance of his mother; and by the emperor’s bounty</a>
<a id='line_947'>      he was himself invested with that ducal title, which has been</a>
<a id='line_948'>      improperly transferred to his lordship of Bouillon in the</a>
<a id='line_949'>      Ardennes. 44 In the service of Henry the Fourth, he bore the</a>
<a id='line_950'>      great standard of the empire, and pierced with his lance the</a>
<a id='line_951'>      breast of Rodolph, the rebel king: Godfrey was the first who</a>
<a id='line_952'>      ascended the walls of Rome; and his sickness, his vow, perhaps</a>
<a id='line_953'>      his remorse for bearing arms against the pope, confirmed an early</a>
<a id='line_954'>      resolution of visiting the holy sepulchre, not as a pilgrim, but</a>
<a id='line_955'>      a deliverer. His valor was matured by prudence and moderation;</a>
<a id='line_956'>      his piety, though blind, was sincere; and, in the tumult of a</a>
<a id='line_957'>      camp, he practised the real and fictitious virtues of a convent.</a>
<a id='line_958'>      Superior to the private factions of the chiefs, he reserved his</a>
<a id='line_959'>      enmity for the enemies of Christ; and though he gained a kingdom</a>
<a id='line_960'>      by the attempt, his pure and disinterested zeal was acknowledged</a>
<a id='line_961'>      by his rivals. Godfrey of Bouillon 45 was accompanied by his two</a>
<a id='line_962'>      brothers, by Eustace the elder, who had succeeded to the county</a>
<a id='line_963'>      of Boulogne, and by the younger, Baldwin, a character of more</a>
<a id='line_964'>      ambiguous virtue. The duke of Lorraine, was alike celebrated on</a>
<a id='line_965'>      either side of the Rhine: from his birth and education, he was</a>
<a id='line_966'>      equally conversant with the French and Teutonic languages: the</a>
<a id='line_967'>      barons of France, Germany, and Lorraine, assembled their vassals;</a>
<a id='line_968'>      and the confederate force that marched under his banner was</a>
<a id='line_969'>      composed of fourscore thousand foot and about ten thousand horse.</a>
<a id='line_970'>      II. In the parliament that was held at Paris, in the king’s</a>
<a id='line_971'>      presence, about two months after the council of Clermont, Hugh,</a>
<a id='line_972'>      count of Vermandois, was the most conspicuous of the princes who</a>
<a id='line_973'>      assumed the cross. But the appellation of the Great was applied,</a>
<a id='line_974'>      not so much to his merit or possessions, (though neither were</a>
<a id='line_975'>      contemptible,) as to the royal birth of the brother of the king</a>
<a id='line_976'>      of France. 46 Robert, duke of Normandy, was the eldest son of</a>
<a id='line_977'>      William the Conqueror; but on his father’s death he was deprived</a>
<a id='line_978'>      of the kingdom of England, by his own indolence and the activity</a>
<a id='line_979'>      of his brother Rufus. The worth of Robert was degraded by an</a>
<a id='line_980'>      excessive levity and easiness of temper: his cheerfulness seduced</a>
<a id='line_981'>      him to the indulgence of pleasure; his profuse liberality</a>
<a id='line_982'>      impoverished the prince and people; his indiscriminate clemency</a>
<a id='line_983'>      multiplied the number of offenders; and the amiable qualities of</a>
<a id='line_984'>      a private man became the essential defects of a sovereign. For</a>
<a id='line_985'>      the trifling sum of ten thousand marks, he mortgaged Normandy</a>
<a id='line_986'>      during his absence to the English usurper; 47 but his engagement</a>
<a id='line_987'>      and behavior in the holy war announced in Robert a reformation of</a>
<a id='line_988'>      manners, and restored him in some degree to the public esteem.</a>
<a id='line_989'>      Another Robert was count of Flanders, a royal province, which, in</a>
<a id='line_990'>      this century, gave three queens to the thrones of France,</a>
<a id='line_991'>      England, and Denmark: he was surnamed the Sword and Lance of the</a>
<a id='line_992'>      Christians; but in the exploits of a soldier he sometimes forgot</a>
<a id='line_993'>      the duties of a general. Stephen, count of Chartres, of Blois,</a>
<a id='line_994'>      and of Troyes, was one of the richest princes of the age; and the</a>
<a id='line_995'>      number of his castles has been compared to the three hundred and</a>
<a id='line_996'>      sixty-five days of the year. His mind was improved by literature;</a>
<a id='line_997'>      and, in the council of the chiefs, the eloquent Stephen 48 was</a>

<a id='line_1003'>      south of France, the command was assumed by Adhemar bishop of</a>
<a id='line_1004'>      Puy, the pope egate, and by Raymond count of St. Giles and</a>
<a id='line_1005'>      Thoulouse who added the prouder titles of duke of Narbonne and</a>
<a id='line_1006'>      marquis of Provence. The former was a respectable prelate, alike</a>
<a id='line_1007'>      qualified for this world and the next. The latter was a veteran</a>
<a id='line_1008'>      warrior, who had fought against the Saracens of Spain, and who</a>
<a id='line_1009'>      consecrated his declining age, not only to the deliverance, but</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      to the perpetual service, of the holy sepulchre. His experience</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      and riches gave him a strong ascendant in the Christian camp,</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      whose distress he was often able, and sometimes willing, to</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      relieve. But it was easier for him to extort the praise of the</a>
<a id='line_1014'>      Infidels, than to preserve the love of his subjects and</a>
<a id='line_1015'>      associates. His eminent qualities were clouded by a temper</a>
<a id='line_1016'>      haughty, envious, and obstinate; and, though he resigned an ample</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      patrimony for the cause of God, his piety, in the public opinion,</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      was not exempt from avarice and ambition. 50 A mercantile, rather</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      than a martial, spirit prevailed among his provincials, 51 a</a>
<a id='line_1020'>      common name, which included the natives of Auvergne and</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      Languedoc, 52 the vassals of the kingdom of Burgundy or Arles.</a>
<a id='line_1022'>      From the adjacent frontier of Spain he drew a band of hardy</a>
<a id='line_1023'>      adventurers; as he marched through Lombardy, a crowd of Italians</a>
<a id='line_1024'>      flocked to his standard, and his united force consisted of one</a>
<a id='line_1025'>      hundred thousand horse and foot. If Raymond was the first to</a>
<a id='line_1026'>      enlist and the last to depart, the delay may be excused by the</a>
<a id='line_1027'>      greatness of his preparation and the promise of an everlasting</a>

<a id='line_1029'>      was already famous by his double victory over the Greek emperor;</a>

<a id='line_1147'>      The dukes and counts, who had usurped the rights of sovereignty,</a>

<a id='line_1160'>      the warlike sovereigns of Europe derived more glory from this</a>

<a id='line_1167'>      him to endure. But superstition mingled in every public and</a>
<a id='line_1168'>      private action of life: in the holy wars, it sanctified the</a>
<a id='line_1169'>      profession of arms; and the order of chivalry was assimilated in</a>
<a id='line_1170'>      its rights and privileges to the sacred orders of priesthood. The</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      bath and white garment of the novice were an indecent copy of the</a>
<a id='line_1172'>      regeneration of baptism: his sword, which he offered on the</a>
<a id='line_1173'>      altar, was blessed by the ministers of religion: his solemn</a>
<a id='line_1174'>      reception was preceded by fasts and vigils; and he was created a</a>
<a id='line_1175'>      knight in the name of God, of St. George, and of St. Michael the</a>
<a id='line_1176'>      archangel. He swore to accomplish the duties of his profession;</a>
<a id='line_1177'>      and education, example, and the public opinion, were the</a>
<a id='line_1178'>      inviolable guardians of his oath. As the champion of God and the</a>
<a id='line_1179'>      ladies, (I blush to unite such discordant names,) he devoted</a>
<a id='line_1180'>      himself to speak the truth; to maintain the right; to protect the</a>
<a id='line_1181'>      distressed; to practise courtesy, a virtue less familiar to the</a>
<a id='line_1182'>      ancients; to pursue the infidels; to despise the allurements of</a>
<a id='line_1183'>      ease and safety; and to vindicate in every perilous adventure the</a>
<a id='line_1184'>      honor of his character. The abuse of the same spirit provoked the</a>
<a id='line_1185'>      illiterate knight to disdain the arts of industry and peace; to</a>
<a id='line_1186'>      esteem himself the sole judge and avenger of his own injuries;</a>
<a id='line_1187'>      and proudly to neglect the laws of civil society and military</a>
<a id='line_1188'>      discipline. Yet the benefits of this institution, to refine the</a>
<a id='line_1189'>      temper of Barbarians, and to infuse some principles of faith,</a>
<a id='line_1190'>      justice, and humanity, were strongly felt, and have been often</a>
<a id='line_1191'>      observed. The asperity of national prejudice was softened; and</a>
<a id='line_1192'>      the community of religion and arms spread a similar color and</a>
<a id='line_1193'>      generous emulation over the face of Christendom. Abroad in</a>
<a id='line_1194'>      enterprise and pilgrimage, at home in martial exercise, the</a>
<a id='line_1195'>      warriors of every country were perpetually associated; and</a>
<a id='line_1196'>      impartial taste must prefer a Gothic tournament to the Olympic</a>
<a id='line_1197'>      games of classic antiquity. 57 Instead of the naked spectacles</a>
<a id='line_1198'>      which corrupted the manners of the Greeks, and banished from the</a>
<a id='line_1199'>      stadium the virgins and matrons, the pompous decoration of the</a>
<a id='line_1200'>      lists was crowned with the presence of chaste and high-born</a>
<a id='line_1201'>      beauty, from whose hands the conqueror received the prize of his</a>
<a id='line_1202'>      dexterity and courage. The skill and strength that were exerted</a>
<a id='line_1203'>      in wrestling and boxing bear a distant and doubtful relation to</a>
<a id='line_1204'>      the merit of a soldier; but the tournaments, as they were</a>
<a id='line_1205'>      invented in France, and eagerly adopted both in the East and</a>
<a id='line_1206'>      West, presented a lively image of the business of the field. The</a>
<a id='line_1207'>      single combats, the general skirmish, the defence of a pass, or</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      castle, were rehearsed as in actual service; and the contest,</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      both in real and mimic war, was decided by the superior</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      management of the horse and lance. The lance was the proper and</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      peculiar weapon of the knight: his horse was of a large and heavy</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      breed; but this charger, till he was roused by the approaching</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      danger, was usually led by an attendant, and he quietly rode a</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      pad or palfrey of a more easy pace. His helmet and sword, his</a>
<a id='line_1215'>      greaves and buckler, it would be superfluous to describe; but I</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      may remark, that, at the period of the crusades, the armor was</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      less ponderous than in later times; and that, instead of a massy</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      cuirass, his breast was defended by a hauberk or coat of mail.</a>
<a id='line_1219'>      When their long lances were fixed in the rest, the warriors</a>
<a id='line_1220'>      furiously spurred their horses against the foe; and the light</a>
<a id='line_1221'>      cavalry of the Turks and Arabs could seldom stand against the</a>
<a id='line_1222'>      direct and impetuous weight of their charge. Each knight was</a>
<a id='line_1223'>      attended to the field by his faithful squire, a youth of equal</a>
<a id='line_1224'>      birth and similar hopes; he was followed by his archers and men</a>
<a id='line_1225'>      at arms, and four, or five, or six soldiers were computed as the</a>
<a id='line_1226'>      furniture of a complete lance. In the expeditions to the</a>
<a id='line_1227'>      neighboring kingdoms or the Holy Land, the duties of the feudal</a>
<a id='line_1228'>      tenure no longer subsisted; the voluntary service of the knights</a>
<a id='line_1229'>      and their followers were either prompted by zeal or attachment,</a>
<a id='line_1230'>      or purchased with rewards and promises; and the numbers of each</a>
<a id='line_1231'>      squadron were measured by the power, the wealth, and the fame, of</a>
<a id='line_1232'>      each independent chieftain. They were distinguished by his</a>
<a id='line_1233'>      banner, his armorial coat, and his cry of war; and the most</a>
<a id='line_1234'>      ancient families of Europe must seek in these achievements the</a>

<a id='line_1289'>      severe revenge from a hero of the same nation, and who was</a>
<a id='line_1290'>      engaged in the same cause. But, after weighing the motives and</a>

<a id='line_1296'>      581 king of Hungary, who treated them with a simple but</a>
<a id='line_1297'>      hospitable entertainment: the treaty was sanctified by their</a>
<a id='line_1298'>      common gospel; and a proclamation, under pain of death,</a>
<a id='line_1299'>      restrained the animosity and license of the Latin soldiers. From</a>
<a id='line_1300'>      Austria to Belgrade, they traversed the plains of Hungary,</a>

<a id='line_1302'>      Carloman, who hovered on their flanks with his numerous cavalry,</a>
<a id='line_1303'>      was a precaution not less useful for their safety than for his</a>
<a id='line_1304'>      own. They reached the banks of the Save; and no sooner had they</a>
<a id='line_1305'>      passed the river, than the king of Hungary restored the hostages,</a>
<a id='line_1306'>      and saluted their departure with the fairest wishes for the</a>

<a id='line_1321'>      treaty with the prince of Scodra. 60 His march between Durazzo</a>
<a id='line_1322'>      and Constantinople was harassed, without being stopped, by the</a>

<a id='line_1326'>      arms and vessels, and foresight and discipline; and his name was</a>

<a id='line_1328'>      obstacles he encountered were surmounted by his military conduct</a>
<a id='line_1329'>      and the valor of Tancred; and if the Norman prince affected to</a>
<a id='line_1330'>      spare the Greeks, he gorged his soldiers with the full plunder of</a>
<a id='line_1331'>      an heretical castle. 61 The nobles of France pressed forwards</a>

<a id='line_1413'>      the Greek emperor. Their motives might be pure and pious: but he</a>
<a id='line_1414'>      was equally alarmed by his knowledge of the ambitious Bohemond,</a>
<a id='line_1415'>      651 and his ignorance of the Transalpine chiefs: the courage of</a>
<a id='line_1416'>      the French was blind and headstrong; they might be tempted by the</a>

<a id='line_1418'>      of their invincible strength: and Jerusalem might be forgotten in</a>

<a id='line_1420'>      abstinence, the troops of Godfrey encamped in the plains of</a>
<a id='line_1421'>      Thrace; they heard with indignation, that their brother, the</a>

<a id='line_1427'>      were assigned among the gardens and palaces on the shores of that</a>
<a id='line_1428'>      narrow sea. But an incurable jealousy still rankled in the minds</a>
<a id='line_1429'>      of the two nations, who despised each other as slaves and</a>
<a id='line_1430'>      Barbarians. Ignorance is the ground of suspicion, and suspicion</a>
<a id='line_1431'>      was inflamed into daily provocations: prejudice is blind, hunger</a>
<a id='line_1432'>      is deaf; and Alexius is accused of a design to starve or assault</a>
<a id='line_1433'>      the Latins in a dangerous post, on all sides encompassed with the</a>
<a id='line_1434'>      waters. 66 Godfrey sounded his trumpets, burst the net,</a>
<a id='line_1435'>      overspread the plain, and insulted the suburbs; but the gates of</a>
<a id='line_1436'>      Constantinople were strongly fortified; the ramparts were lined</a>
<a id='line_1437'>      with archers; and, after a doubtful conflict, both parties</a>
<a id='line_1438'>      listened to the voice of peace and religion. The gifts and</a>
<a id='line_1439'>      promises of the emperor insensibly soothed the fierce spirit of</a>

<a id='line_1441'>      zeal for the prosecution of their holy enterprise, which he</a>

<a id='line_1494'>      recent patrimony of the Roman emperor; and his ancient and</a>
<a id='line_1495'>      perpetual claim still embraced the kingdoms of Syria and Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1496'>      In his enthusiasm, Alexius indulged, or affected, the ambitious</a>
<a id='line_1497'>      hope of leading his new allies to subvert the thrones of the</a>
<a id='line_1498'>      East; but the calmer dictates of reason and temper dissuaded him</a>
<a id='line_1499'>      from exposing his royal person to the faith of unknown and</a>
<a id='line_1500'>      lawless Barbarians. His prudence, or his pride, was content with</a>
<a id='line_1501'>      extorting from the French princes an oath of homage and fidelity,</a>
<a id='line_1502'>      and a solemn promise, that they</a>
<a id='line_1503'></a>
<a id='line_1504'>      would either restore, or hold, their Asiatic conquests as the</a>
<a id='line_1505'>      humble and loyal vassals of the Roman empire. Their independent</a>
<a id='line_1506'>      spirit was fired at the mention of this foreign and voluntary</a>
<a id='line_1507'>      servitude: they successively yielded to the dexterous application</a>
<a id='line_1508'>      of gifts and flattery; and the first proselytes became the most</a>
<a id='line_1509'>      eloquent and effectual missionaries to multiply the companions of</a>
<a id='line_1510'>      their shame. The pride of Hugh of Vermandois was soothed by the</a>
<a id='line_1511'>      honors of his captivity; and in the brother of the French king,</a>
<a id='line_1512'>      the example of submission was prevalent and weighty. In the mind</a>
<a id='line_1513'>      of Godfrey of Bouillon every human consideration was subordinate</a>
<a id='line_1514'>      to the glory of God and the success of the crusade. He had firmly</a>
<a id='line_1515'>      resisted the temptations of Bohemond and Raymond, who urged the</a>
<a id='line_1516'>      attack and conquest of Constantinople. Alexius esteemed his</a>
<a id='line_1517'>      virtues, deservedly named him the champion of the empire, and</a>
<a id='line_1518'>      dignified his homage with the filial name and the rights of</a>
<a id='line_1519'>      adoption. 67 The hateful Bohemond was received as a true and</a>
<a id='line_1520'>      ancient ally; and if the emperor reminded him of former</a>
<a id='line_1521'>      hostilities, it was only to praise the valor that he had</a>
<a id='line_1522'>      displayed, and the glory that he had acquired, in the fields of</a>
<a id='line_1523'>      Durazzo and Larissa. The son of Guiscard was lodged and</a>
<a id='line_1524'>      entertained, and served with Imperial pomp: one day, as he passed</a>
<a id='line_1525'>      through the gallery of the palace, a door was carelessly left</a>
<a id='line_1526'>      open to expose a pile of gold and silver, of silk and gems, of</a>
<a id='line_1527'>      curious and costly furniture, that was heaped, in seeming</a>
<a id='line_1528'>      disorder, from the floor to the roof of the chamber. “What</a>
<a id='line_1529'>      conquests,” exclaimed the ambitious miser, “might not be achieved</a>
<a id='line_1530'>      by the possession of such a treasure!”—“It is your own,” replied</a>
<a id='line_1531'>      a Greek attendant, who watched the motions of his soul; and</a>
<a id='line_1532'>      Bohemond, after some hesitation, condescended to accept this</a>
<a id='line_1533'>      magnificent present. The Norman was flattered by the assurance of</a>
<a id='line_1534'>      an independent principality; and Alexius eluded, rather than</a>
<a id='line_1535'>      denied, his daring demand of the office of great domestic, or</a>
<a id='line_1536'>      general of the East. The two Roberts, the son of the conqueror of</a>
<a id='line_1537'>      England, and the kinsmen of three queens, 68 bowed in their turn</a>
<a id='line_1538'>      before the Byzantine throne. A private letter of Stephen of</a>
<a id='line_1539'>      Chartres attests his admiration of the emperor, the most</a>
<a id='line_1540'>      excellent and liberal of men, who taught him to believe that he</a>
<a id='line_1541'>      was a favorite, and promised to educate and establish his</a>
<a id='line_1542'>      youngest son. In his southern province, the count of St. Giles</a>
<a id='line_1543'>      and Thoulouse faintly recognized the supremacy of the king of</a>
<a id='line_1544'>      France, a prince of a foreign nation and language. At the head of</a>
<a id='line_1545'>      a hundred thousand men, he declared that he was the soldier and</a>
<a id='line_1546'>      servant of Christ alone, and that the Greek might be satisfied</a>
<a id='line_1547'>      with an equal treaty of alliance and friendship. His obstinate</a>
<a id='line_1548'>      resistance enhanced the value and the price of his submission;</a>
<a id='line_1549'>      and he shone, says the princess Anne, among the Barbarians, as</a>
<a id='line_1550'>      the sun amidst the stars of heaven. His disgust of the noise and</a>
<a id='line_1551'>      insolence of the French, his suspicions of the designs of</a>

<a id='line_1553'>      aged statesman might clearly discern, that however false in</a>
<a id='line_1554'>      friendship, he was sincere in his enmity. 69 The spirit of</a>
<a id='line_1555'>      chivalry was last subdued in the person of Tancred; and none</a>
<a id='line_1556'>      could deem themselves dishonored by the imitation of that gallant</a>
<a id='line_1557'>      knight. He disdained the gold and flattery of the Greek monarch;</a>
<a id='line_1558'>      assaulted in his presence an insolent patrician; escaped to Asia</a>
<a id='line_1559'>      in the habit of a private soldier; and yielded with a sigh to the</a>
<a id='line_1560'>      authority of Bohemond, and the interest of the Christian cause.</a>
<a id='line_1561'>      The best and most ostensible reason was the impossibility of</a>

<a id='line_1565'>      would obliterate their shame, and dissolve the engagement, which</a>

<a id='line_1658'>      regions (in the geography of a Frenchman) were sufficient to</a>

<a id='line_1666'>      countries of Hungary and Bulgaria were whitened with their bones:</a>

<a id='line_1673'>      language sinks under the efforts of the princess Anne: 76 the</a>
<a id='line_1674'>      images of locusts, of leaves and flowers, of the sands of the</a>
<a id='line_1675'>      sea, or the stars of heaven, imperfectly represent what she had</a>
<a id='line_1676'>      seen and heard; and the daughter of Alexius exclaims, that Europe</a>
<a id='line_1677'>      was loosened from its foundations, and hurled against Asia. The</a>
<a id='line_1678'>      ancient hosts of Darius and Xerxes labor under the same doubt of</a>
<a id='line_1679'>      a vague and indefinite magnitude; but I am inclined to believe,</a>
<a id='line_1680'>      that a larger number has never been contained within the lines of</a>
<a id='line_1681'>      a single camp, than at the siege of Nice, the first operation of</a>
<a id='line_1682'>      the Latin princes. Their motives, their characters, and their</a>
<a id='line_1683'>      arms, have been already displayed. Of their troops the most</a>
<a id='line_1684'>      numerous portion were natives of France: the Low Countries, the</a>
<a id='line_1685'>      banks of the Rhine, and Apulia, sent a powerful reenforcement:</a>
<a id='line_1686'>      some bands of adventurers were drawn from Spain, Lombardy, and</a>
<a id='line_1687'>      England; 77 and from the distant bogs and mountains of Ireland or</a>
<a id='line_1688'>      Scotland 78 issued some naked and savage fanatics, ferocious at</a>
<a id='line_1689'>      home but unwarlike abroad. Had not superstition condemned the</a>
<a id='line_1690'>      sacrilegious prudence of depriving the poorest or weakest</a>
<a id='line_1691'>      Christian of the merit of the pilgrimage, the useless crowd, with</a>

<a id='line_1694'>      the Lord. A small remnant of the pilgrims, who passed the</a>
<a id='line_1695'>      Bosphorus, was permitted to visit the holy sepulchre. Their</a>
<a id='line_1696'>      northern constitution was scorched by the rays, and infected by</a>
<a id='line_1697'>      the vapors, of a Syrian sun. They consumed, with heedless</a>
<a id='line_1698'>      prodigality, their stores of water and provision: their numbers</a>
<a id='line_1699'>      exhausted the inland country: the sea was remote, the Greeks were</a>
<a id='line_1700'>      unfriendly, and the Christians of every sect fled before the</a>

<a id='line_1768'>      Nicomedia, they advanced in successive divisions; passed the</a>
<a id='line_1769'>      contracted limit of the Greek empire; opened a road through the</a>
<a id='line_1770'>      hills, and commenced, by the siege of his capital, their pious</a>
<a id='line_1771'>      warfare against the Turkish sultan. His kingdom of Roum extended</a>
<a id='line_1772'>      from the Hellespont to the confines of Syria, and barred the</a>
<a id='line_1773'>      pilgrimage of Jerusalem, his name was Kilidge-Arslan, or Soliman,</a>
<a id='line_1774'>      80 of the race of Seljuk, and son of the first conqueror; and in</a>
<a id='line_1775'>      the defence of a land which the Turks considered as their own, he</a>
<a id='line_1776'>      deserved the praise of his enemies, by whom alone he is known to</a>
<a id='line_1777'>      posterity. Yielding to the first impulse of the torrent, he</a>
<a id='line_1778'>      deposited his family and treasure in Nice; retired to the</a>
<a id='line_1779'>      mountains with fifty thousand horse; and twice descended to</a>
<a id='line_1780'>      assault the camps or quarters of the Christian besiegers, which</a>
<a id='line_1781'>      formed an imperfect circle of above six miles. The lofty and</a>
<a id='line_1782'>      solid walls of Nice were covered by a deep ditch, and flanked by</a>
<a id='line_1783'>      three hundred and seventy towers; and on the verge of</a>
<a id='line_1784'>      Christendom, the Moslems were trained in arms, and inflamed by</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      religion. Before this city, the French princes occupied their</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      stations, and prosecuted their attacks without correspondence or</a>
<a id='line_1787'>      subordination: emulation prompted their valor; but their valor</a>
<a id='line_1788'>      was sullied by cruelty, and their emulation degenerated into envy</a>
<a id='line_1789'>      and civil discord. In the siege of Nice, the arts and engines of</a>
<a id='line_1790'>      antiquity were employed by the Latins; the mine and the</a>
<a id='line_1791'>      battering-ram, the tortoise, and the belfrey or movable turret,</a>
<a id='line_1792'>      artificial fire, and the catapult and balist, the sling, and the</a>
<a id='line_1793'>      crossbow for the casting of stones and darts. 81 In the space of</a>
<a id='line_1794'>      seven weeks much labor and blood were expended, and some</a>
<a id='line_1795'>      progress, especially by Count Raymond, was made on the side of</a>
<a id='line_1796'>      the besiegers. But the Turks could protract their resistance and</a>
<a id='line_1797'>      secure their escape, as long as they were masters of the Lake 82</a>
<a id='line_1798'>      Ascanius, which stretches several miles to the westward of the</a>
<a id='line_1799'>      city. The means of conquest were supplied by the prudence and</a>
<a id='line_1800'>      industry of Alexius; a great number of boats was transported on</a>
<a id='line_1801'>      sledges from the sea to the lake; they were filled with the most</a>
<a id='line_1802'>      dexterous of his archers; the flight of the sultana was</a>
<a id='line_1803'>      intercepted; Nice was invested by land and water; and a Greek</a>
<a id='line_1804'>      emissary persuaded the inhabitants to accept his master’s</a>
<a id='line_1805'>      protection, and to save themselves, by a timely surrender, from</a>
<a id='line_1806'>      the rage of the savages of Europe. In the moment of victory, or</a>
<a id='line_1807'>      at least of hope, the crusaders, thirsting for blood and plunder,</a>
<a id='line_1808'>      were awed by the Imperial banner that streamed from the citadel;</a>
<a id='line_1809'>      821 and Alexius guarded with jealous vigilance this important</a>

<a id='line_1861'>      personal valor, rather than by the military conduct, of Bohemond,</a>
<a id='line_1862'>      Tancred, and Robert of Normandy. They were revived by the welcome</a>

<a id='line_1864'>      of Vermandois, and sixty thousand horse; and was followed by</a>
<a id='line_1865'>      Raymond of Tholouse, the bishop of Puy, and the remainder of the</a>
<a id='line_1866'>      sacred army. Without a moment’s pause, they formed in new order,</a>
<a id='line_1867'>      and advanced to a second battle. They were received with equal</a>
<a id='line_1868'>      resolution; and, in their common disdain for the unwarlike people</a>
<a id='line_1869'>      of Greece and Asia, it was confessed on both sides, that the</a>
<a id='line_1870'>      Turks and the Franks were the only nations entitled to the</a>
<a id='line_1871'>      appellation of soldiers. 85 Their encounter was varied, and</a>
<a id='line_1872'>      balanced by the contrast of arms and discipline; of the direct</a>
<a id='line_1873'>      charge, and wheeling evolutions; of the couched lance, and the</a>
<a id='line_1874'>      brandished javelin; of a weighty broadsword, and a crooked sabre;</a>
<a id='line_1875'>      of cumbrous armor, and thin flowing robes; and of the long Tartar</a>
<a id='line_1876'>      bow, and the arbalist or crossbow, a deadly weapon, yet unknown</a>
<a id='line_1877'>      to the Orientals. 86 As long as the horses were fresh, and the</a>
<a id='line_1878'>      quivers full, Soliman maintained the advantage of the day; and</a>
<a id='line_1879'>      four thousand Christians were pierced by the Turkish arrows. In</a>
<a id='line_1880'>      the evening, swiftness yielded to strength: on either side, the</a>
<a id='line_1881'>      numbers were equal or at least as great as any ground could hold,</a>
<a id='line_1882'>      or any generals could manage; but in turning the hills, the last</a>
<a id='line_1883'>      division of Raymond and his provincials was led, perhaps without</a>
<a id='line_1884'>      design on the rear of an exhausted enemy; and the long contest</a>
<a id='line_1885'>      was determined. Besides a nameless and unaccounted multitude,</a>
<a id='line_1886'>      three thousand Pagan knights were slain in the battle and</a>
<a id='line_1887'>      pursuit; the camp of Soliman was pillaged; and in the variety of</a>
<a id='line_1888'>      precious spoil, the curiosity of the Latins was amused with</a>
<a id='line_1889'>      foreign arms and apparel, and the new aspect of dromedaries and</a>
<a id='line_1890'>      camels. The importance of the victory was proved by the hasty</a>
<a id='line_1891'>      retreat of the sultan: reserving ten thousand guards of the</a>
<a id='line_1892'>      relics of his army, Soliman evacuated the kingdom of Roum, and</a>
<a id='line_1893'>      hastened to implore the aid, and kindle the resentment, of his</a>
<a id='line_1894'>      Eastern brethren. In a march of five hundred miles, the crusaders</a>
<a id='line_1895'>      traversed the Lesser Asia, through a wasted land and deserted</a>

<a id='line_1975'>      Before the Franks could enter Syria, the summer, and even the</a>
<a id='line_1976'>      autumn, were completely wasted: the siege of Antioch, or the</a>
<a id='line_1977'>      separation and repose of the army during the winter season, was</a>
<a id='line_1978'>      strongly debated in their council: the love of arms and the holy</a>
<a id='line_1979'>      sepulchre urged them to advance; and reason perhaps was on the</a>
<a id='line_1980'>      side of resolution, since every hour of delay abates the fame and</a>
<a id='line_1981'>      force of the invader, and multiplies the resources of defensive</a>
<a id='line_1982'>      war. The capital of Syria was protected by the River Orontes; and</a>
<a id='line_1983'>      the iron bridge, 891 of nine arches, derives its name from the</a>
<a id='line_1984'>      massy gates of the two towers which are constructed at either</a>
<a id='line_1985'>      end. They were opened by the sword of the duke of Normandy: his</a>
<a id='line_1986'>      victory gave entrance to three hundred thousand crusaders, an</a>
<a id='line_1987'>      account which may allow some scope for losses and desertion, but</a>
<a id='line_1988'>      which clearly detects much exaggeration in the review of Nice. In</a>
<a id='line_1989'>      the description of Antioch, 90 it is not easy to define a middle</a>
<a id='line_1990'>      term between her ancient magnificence, under the successors of</a>
<a id='line_1991'>      Alexander and Augustus, and the modern aspect of Turkish</a>
<a id='line_1992'>      desolation. The Tetrapolis, or four cities, if they retained</a>
<a id='line_1993'>      their name and position, must have left a large vacuity in a</a>
<a id='line_1994'>      circumference of twelve miles; and that measure, as well as the</a>
<a id='line_1995'>      number of four hundred towers, are not perfectly consistent with</a>
<a id='line_1996'>      the five gates, so often mentioned in the history of the siege.</a>
<a id='line_1997'>      Yet Antioch must have still flourished as a great and populous</a>
<a id='line_1998'>      capital. At the head of the Turkish emirs, Baghisian, a veteran</a>
<a id='line_1999'>      chief, commanded in the place: his garrison was composed of six</a>
<a id='line_2000'>      or seven thousand horse, and fifteen or twenty thousand foot: one</a>
<a id='line_2001'>      hundred thousand Moslems are said to have fallen by the sword;</a>
<a id='line_2002'>      and their numbers were probably inferior to the Greeks,</a>
<a id='line_2003'>      Armenians, and Syrians, who had been no more than fourteen years</a>
<a id='line_2004'>      the slaves of the house of Seljuk. From the remains of a solid</a>
<a id='line_2005'>      and stately wall, it appears to have arisen to the height of</a>
<a id='line_2006'>      threescore feet in the valleys; and wherever less art and labor</a>
<a id='line_2007'>      had been applied, the ground was supposed to be defended by the</a>
<a id='line_2008'>      river, the morass, and the mountains. Notwithstanding these</a>
<a id='line_2009'>      fortifications, the city had been repeatedly taken by the</a>
<a id='line_2010'>      Persians, the Arabs, the Greeks, and the Turks; so large a</a>
<a id='line_2011'>      circuit must have yielded many pervious points of attack; and in</a>
<a id='line_2012'>      a siege that was formed about the middle of October, the vigor of</a>
<a id='line_2013'>      the execution could alone justify the boldness of the attempt.</a>
<a id='line_2014'>      Whatever strength and valor could perform in the field was</a>
<a id='line_2015'>      abundantly discharged by the champions of the cross: in the</a>
<a id='line_2016'>      frequent occasions of sallies, of forage, of the attack and</a>
<a id='line_2017'>      defence of convoys, they were often victorious; and we can only</a>
<a id='line_2018'>      complain, that their exploits are sometimes enlarged beyond the</a>
<a id='line_2019'>      scale of probability and truth. The sword of Godfrey 91 divided a</a>
<a id='line_2020'>      Turk from the shoulder to the haunch; and one half of the infidel</a>
<a id='line_2021'>      fell to the ground, while the other was transported by his horse</a>
<a id='line_2022'>      to the city gate. As Robert of Normandy rode against his</a>
<a id='line_2023'>      antagonist, “I devote thy head,” he piously exclaimed, “to the</a>
<a id='line_2024'>      daemons of hell;” and that head was instantly cloven to the</a>
<a id='line_2025'>      breast by the resistless stroke of his descending falchion. But</a>
<a id='line_2026'>      the reality or the report of such gigantic prowess 92 must have</a>
<a id='line_2027'>      taught the Moslems to keep within their walls: and against those</a>
<a id='line_2028'>      walls of earth or stone, the sword and the lance were unavailing</a>
<a id='line_2029'>      weapons. In the slow and successive labors of a siege, the</a>
<a id='line_2030'>      crusaders were supine and ignorant, without skill to contrive, or</a>
<a id='line_2031'>      money to purchase, or industry to use, the artificial engines and</a>
<a id='line_2032'>      implements of assault. In the conquest of Nice, they had been</a>
<a id='line_2033'>      powerfully assisted by the wealth and knowledge of the Greek</a>
<a id='line_2034'>      emperor: his absence was poorly supplied by some Genoese and</a>
<a id='line_2035'>      Pisan vessels, that were attracted by religion or trade to the</a>
<a id='line_2036'>      coast of Syria: the stores were scanty, the return precarious,</a>
<a id='line_2037'>      and the communication difficult and dangerous. Indolence or</a>
<a id='line_2038'>      weakness had prevented the Franks from investing the entire</a>
<a id='line_2039'>      circuit; and the perpetual freedom of two gates relieved the</a>
<a id='line_2040'>      wants and recruited the garrison of the city. At the end of seven</a>
<a id='line_2041'>      months, after the ruin of their cavalry, and an enormous loss by</a>
<a id='line_2042'>      famine, desertion and fatigue, the progress of the crusaders was</a>
<a id='line_2043'>      imperceptible, and their success remote, if the Latin Ulysses,</a>
<a id='line_2044'>      the artful and ambitious Bohemond, had not employed the arms of</a>
<a id='line_2045'>      cunning and deceit. The Christians of Antioch were numerous and</a>
<a id='line_2046'>      discontented: Phirouz, a Syrian renegado, had acquired the favor</a>
<a id='line_2047'>      of the emir and the command of three towers; and the merit of his</a>
<a id='line_2048'>      repentance disguised to the Latins, and perhaps to himself, the</a>
<a id='line_2049'>      foul design of perfidy and treason. A secret correspondence, for</a>
<a id='line_2050'>      their mutual interest, was soon established between Phirouz and</a>
<a id='line_2051'>      the prince of Tarento; and Bohemond declared in the council of</a>
<a id='line_2052'>      the chiefs, that he could deliver the city into their hands. 921</a>
<a id='line_2053'>      But he claimed the sovereignty of Antioch as the reward of his</a>
<a id='line_2054'>      service; and the proposal which had been rejected by the envy,</a>
<a id='line_2055'>      was at length extorted from the distress, of his equals. The</a>
<a id='line_2056'>      nocturnal surprise was executed by the French and Norman princes,</a>
<a id='line_2057'>      who ascended in person the scaling-ladders that were thrown from</a>
<a id='line_2058'>      the walls: their new proselyte, after the murder of his too</a>
<a id='line_2059'>      scrupulous brother, embraced and introduced the servants of</a>
<a id='line_2060'>      Christ; the army rushed through the gates; and the Moslems soon</a>
<a id='line_2061'>      found, that although mercy was hopeless, resistance was impotent.</a>
<a id='line_2062'></a>
<a id='line_2063'>      But the citadel still refused to surrender; and the victims</a>
<a id='line_2064'>      themselves were speedily encompassed and besieged by the</a>
<a id='line_2065'>      innumerable forces of Kerboga, prince of Mosul, who, with</a>
<a id='line_2066'>      twenty-eight Turkish emirs, advanced to the deliverance of</a>
<a id='line_2067'>      Antioch. Five-and-twenty days the Christians spent on the verge</a>
<a id='line_2068'>      of destruction; and the proud lieutenant of the caliph and the</a>
<a id='line_2069'>      sultan left them only the choice of servitude or death. 93 In</a>
<a id='line_2070'>      this extremity they collected the relics of their strength,</a>
<a id='line_2071'>      sallied from the town, and in a single memorable day, annihilated</a>
<a id='line_2072'>      or dispersed the host of Turks and Arabians, which they might</a>
<a id='line_2073'>      safely report to have consisted of six hundred thousand men. 94</a>
<a id='line_2074'>      Their supernatural allies I shall proceed to consider: the human</a>
<a id='line_2075'>      causes of the victory of Antioch were the fearless despair of the</a>
<a id='line_2076'>      Franks; and the surprise, the discord, perhaps the errors, of</a>
<a id='line_2077'>      their unskilful and presumptuous adversaries. The battle is</a>

<a id='line_2142'>      illusion; and seldom does the history of profane war display such</a>
<a id='line_2143'>      scenes of intemperance and prostitution as were exhibited under</a>
<a id='line_2144'>      the walls of Antioch. The grove of Daphne no longer flourished;</a>
<a id='line_2145'>      but the Syrian air was still impregnated with the same vices; the</a>
<a id='line_2146'>      Christians were seduced by every temptation 95 that nature either</a>
<a id='line_2147'>      prompts or reprobates; the authority of the chiefs was despised;</a>
<a id='line_2148'>      and sermons and edicts were alike fruitless against those</a>
<a id='line_2149'>      scandalous disorders, not less pernicious to military discipline,</a>
<a id='line_2150'>      than repugnant to evangelic purity. In the first days of the</a>
<a id='line_2151'>      siege and the possession of Antioch, the Franks consumed with</a>
<a id='line_2152'>      wanton and thoughtless prodigality the frugal subsistence of</a>
<a id='line_2153'>      weeks and months: the desolate country no longer yielded a</a>
<a id='line_2154'>      supply; and from that country they were at length excluded by the</a>
<a id='line_2155'>      arms of the besieging Turks. Disease, the faithful companion of</a>
<a id='line_2156'>      want, was envenomed by the rains of the winter, the summer heats,</a>
<a id='line_2157'>      unwholesome food, and the close imprisonment of multitudes. The</a>
<a id='line_2158'>      pictures of famine and pestilence are always the same, and always</a>
<a id='line_2159'>      disgustful; and our imagination may suggest the nature of their</a>
<a id='line_2160'>      sufferings and their resources. The remains of treasure or spoil</a>
<a id='line_2161'>      were eagerly lavished in the purchase of the vilest nourishment;</a>
<a id='line_2162'>      and dreadful must have been the calamities of the poor, since,</a>
<a id='line_2163'>      after paying three marks of silver for a goat and fifteen for a</a>
<a id='line_2164'>      lean camel, 96 the count of Flanders was reduced to beg a dinner,</a>
<a id='line_2165'>      and Duke Godfrey to borrow a horse. Sixty thousand horse had been</a>
<a id='line_2166'>      reviewed in the camp: before the end of the siege they were</a>
<a id='line_2167'>      diminished to two thousand, and scarcely two hundred fit for</a>
<a id='line_2168'>      service could be mustered on the day of battle. Weakness of body</a>
<a id='line_2169'>      and terror of mind extinguished the ardent enthusiasm of the</a>
<a id='line_2170'>      pilgrims; and every motive of honor and religion was subdued by</a>
<a id='line_2171'>      the desire of life. 97 Among the chiefs, three heroes may be</a>
<a id='line_2172'>      found without fear or reproach: Godfrey of Bouillon was supported</a>
<a id='line_2173'>      by his magnanimous piety; Bohemond by ambition and interest; and</a>
<a id='line_2174'>      Tancred declared, in the true spirit of chivalry, that as long as</a>
<a id='line_2175'>      he was at the head of forty knights, he would never relinquish</a>
<a id='line_2176'>      the enterprise of Palestine. But the count of Tholouse and</a>
<a id='line_2177'>      Provence was suspected of a voluntary indisposition; the duke of</a>
<a id='line_2178'>      Normandy was recalled from the sea-shore by the censures of the</a>
<a id='line_2179'>      church: Hugh the Great, though he led the vanguard of the battle,</a>
<a id='line_2180'>      embraced an ambiguous opportunity of returning to France and</a>
<a id='line_2181'>      Stephen, count of Chartres, basely deserted the standard which he</a>
<a id='line_2182'>      bore, and the council in which he presided. The soldiers were</a>
<a id='line_2183'>      discouraged by the flight of William, viscount of Melun, surnamed</a>
<a id='line_2184'>      the Carpenter, from the weighty strokes of his axe; and the</a>

<a id='line_2226'>      cause, and in such an army, visions, prophecies, and miracles,</a>
<a id='line_2227'>      were frequent and familiar. In the distress of Antioch, they were</a>
<a id='line_2228'>      repeated with unusual energy and success: St. Ambrose had assured</a>
<a id='line_2229'>      a pious ecclesiastic, that two years of trial must precede the</a>
<a id='line_2230'>      season of deliverance and grace; the deserters were stopped by</a>
<a id='line_2231'>      the presence and reproaches of Christ himself; the dead had</a>
<a id='line_2232'>      promised to arise and combat with their brethren; the Virgin had</a>
<a id='line_2233'>      obtained the pardon of their sins; and their confidence was</a>
<a id='line_2234'>      revived by a visible sign, the seasonable and splendid discovery</a>
<a id='line_2235'>      of the Holy Lance. The policy of their chiefs has on this</a>
<a id='line_2236'>      occasion been admired, and might surely be excused; but a pious</a>
<a id='line_2237'>      fraud is seldom produced by the cool conspiracy of many persons;</a>
<a id='line_2238'>      and a voluntary impostor might depend on the support of the wise</a>
<a id='line_2239'>      and the credulity of the people. Of the diocese of Marseilles,</a>
<a id='line_2240'>      there was a priest of low cunning and loose manners, and his name</a>
<a id='line_2241'>      was Peter Bartholemy. He presented himself at the door of the</a>
<a id='line_2242'>      council-chamber, to disclose an apparition of St. Andrew, which</a>
<a id='line_2243'>      had been thrice reiterated in his sleep with a dreadful menace,</a>
<a id='line_2244'>      if he presumed to suppress the commands of Heaven. “At Antioch,”</a>
<a id='line_2245'>      said the apostle, “in the church of my brother St. Peter, near</a>
<a id='line_2246'>      the high altar, is concealed the steel head of the lance that</a>
<a id='line_2247'>      pierced the side of our Redeemer. In three days that instrument</a>
<a id='line_2248'>      of eternal, and now of temporal, salvation, will be manifested to</a>
<a id='line_2249'>      his disciples. Search, and ye shall find: bear it aloft in</a>
<a id='line_2250'>      battle; and that mystic weapon shall penetrate the souls of the</a>
<a id='line_2251'>      miscreants.” The pope’s legate, the bishop of Puy, affected to</a>
<a id='line_2252'>      listen with coldness and distrust; but the revelation was eagerly</a>
<a id='line_2253'>      accepted by Count Raymond, whom his faithful subject, in the name</a>
<a id='line_2254'>      of the apostle, had chosen for the guardian of the holy lance.</a>
<a id='line_2255'>      The experiment was resolved; and on the third day after a due</a>
<a id='line_2256'>      preparation of prayer and fasting, the priest of Marseilles</a>
<a id='line_2257'>      introduced twelve trusty spectators, among whom were the count</a>
<a id='line_2258'>      and his chaplain; and the church doors were barred against the</a>
<a id='line_2259'>      impetuous multitude. The ground was opened in the appointed</a>
<a id='line_2260'>      place; but the workmen, who relieved each other, dug to the depth</a>
<a id='line_2261'>      of twelve feet without discovering the object of their search. In</a>
<a id='line_2262'>      the evening, when Count Raymond had withdrawn to his post, and</a>
<a id='line_2263'>      the weary assistants began to murmur, Bartholemy, in his shirt,</a>
<a id='line_2264'>      and without his shoes, boldly descended into the pit; the</a>
<a id='line_2265'>      darkness of the hour and of the place enabled him to secrete and</a>
<a id='line_2266'>      deposit the head of a Saracen lance; and the first sound, the</a>
<a id='line_2267'>      first gleam, of the steel was saluted with a devout rapture. The</a>
<a id='line_2268'>      holy lance was drawn from its recess, wrapped in a veil of silk</a>
<a id='line_2269'>      and gold, and exposed to the veneration of the crusaders; their</a>
<a id='line_2270'>      anxious suspense burst forth in a general shout of joy and hope,</a>
<a id='line_2271'>      and the desponding troops were again inflamed with the enthusiasm</a>
<a id='line_2272'>      of valor. Whatever had been the arts, and whatever might be the</a>
<a id='line_2273'>      sentiments of the chiefs, they skilfully improved this fortunate</a>
<a id='line_2274'>      revolution by every aid that discipline and devotion could</a>
<a id='line_2275'>      afford. The soldiers were dismissed to their quarters with an</a>
<a id='line_2276'>      injunction to fortify their minds and bodies for the approaching</a>
<a id='line_2277'>      conflict, freely to bestow their last pittance on themselves and</a>
<a id='line_2278'>      their horses, and to expect with the dawn of day the signal of</a>
<a id='line_2279'>      victory. On the festival of St. Peter and St. Paul, the gates of</a>
<a id='line_2280'>      Antioch were thrown open: a martial psalm, “Let the Lord arise,</a>
<a id='line_2281'>      and let his enemies be scattered!” was chanted by a procession of</a>
<a id='line_2282'>      priests and monks; the battle array was marshalled in twelve</a>
<a id='line_2283'>      divisions, in honor of the twelve apostles; and the holy lance,</a>
<a id='line_2284'>      in the absence of Raymond, was intrusted to the hands of his</a>
<a id='line_2285'>      chaplain. The influence of his relic or trophy, was felt by the</a>
<a id='line_2286'>      servants, and perhaps by the enemies, of Christ; 99 and its</a>
<a id='line_2287'>      potent energy was heightened by an accident, a stratagem, or a</a>
<a id='line_2288'>      rumor, of a miraculous complexion. Three knights, in white</a>
<a id='line_2289'>      garments and resplendent arms, either issued, or seemed to issue,</a>
<a id='line_2290'>      from the hills: the voice of Adhemar, the pope’s legate,</a>
<a id='line_2291'>      proclaimed them as the martyrs St. George, St. Theodore, and St.</a>
<a id='line_2292'>      Maurice: the tumult of battle allowed no time for doubt or</a>
<a id='line_2293'>      scrutiny; and the welcome apparition dazzled the eyes or the</a>
<a id='line_2294'>      imagination of a fanatic army. 991 In the season of danger and</a>
<a id='line_2295'>      triumph, the revelation of Bartholemy of Marseilles was</a>
<a id='line_2296'>      unanimously asserted; but as soon as the temporary service was</a>
<a id='line_2297'>      accomplished, the personal dignity and liberal arms which the</a>
<a id='line_2298'>      count of Tholouse derived from the custody of the holy lance,</a>
<a id='line_2299'>      provoked the envy, and awakened the reason, of his rivals. A</a>
<a id='line_2300'>      Norman clerk presumed to sift, with a philosophic spirit, the</a>
<a id='line_2301'>      truth of the legend, the circumstances of the discovery, and the</a>
<a id='line_2302'>      character of the prophet; and the pious Bohemond ascribed their</a>
<a id='line_2303'>      deliverance to the merits and intercession of Christ alone. For a</a>
<a id='line_2304'>      while, the Provincials defended their national palladium with</a>
<a id='line_2305'>      clamors and arms and new visions condemned to death and hell the</a>
<a id='line_2306'>      profane sceptics who presumed to scrutinize the truth and merit</a>
<a id='line_2307'>      of the discovery. The prevalence of incredulity compelled the</a>
<a id='line_2308'>      author to submit his life and veracity to the judgment of God. A</a>
<a id='line_2309'>      pile of dry fagots, four feet high and fourteen long, was erected</a>
<a id='line_2310'>      in the midst of the camp; the flames burnt fiercely to the</a>
<a id='line_2311'>      elevation of thirty cubits; and a narrow path of twelve inches</a>
<a id='line_2312'>      was left for the perilous trial. The unfortunate priest of</a>
<a id='line_2313'>      Marseilles traversed the fire with dexterity and speed; but the</a>
<a id='line_2314'>      thighs and belly were scorched by the intense heat; he expired</a>
<a id='line_2315'>      the next day; 992 and the logic of believing minds will pay some</a>
<a id='line_2316'>      regard to his dying protestations of innocence and truth. Some</a>
<a id='line_2317'>      efforts were made by the Provincials to substitute a cross, a</a>
<a id='line_2318'>      ring, or a tabernacle, in the place of the holy lance, which soon</a>
<a id='line_2319'>      vanished in contempt and oblivion. 100 Yet the revelation of</a>
<a id='line_2320'>      Antioch is gravely asserted by succeeding historians: and such is</a>
<a id='line_2321'>      the progress of credulity, that miracles most doubtful on the</a>
<a id='line_2322'>      spot, and at the moment, will be received with implicit faith at</a>

<a id='line_2468'></a>
<a id='line_2469'>      Jerusalem has derived some reputation from the number and</a>
<a id='line_2470'>      importance of her memorable sieges. It was not till after a long</a>
<a id='line_2471'>      and obstinate contest that Babylon and Rome could prevail against</a>
<a id='line_2472'>      the obstinacy of the people, the craggy ground that might</a>
<a id='line_2473'>      supersede the necessity of fortifications, and the walls and</a>
<a id='line_2474'>      towers that would have fortified the most accessible plain. 105</a>
<a id='line_2475'>      These obstacles were diminished in the age of the crusades. The</a>
<a id='line_2476'>      bulwarks had been completely destroyed and imperfectly restored:</a>
<a id='line_2477'>      the Jews, their nation, and worship, were forever banished; but</a>
<a id='line_2478'>      nature is less changeable than man, and the site of Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_2479'>      though somewhat softened and somewhat removed, was still strong</a>
<a id='line_2480'>      against the assaults of an enemy. By the experience of a recent</a>
<a id='line_2481'>      siege, and a three years’ possession, the Saracens of Egypt had</a>
<a id='line_2482'>      been taught to discern, and in some degree to remedy, the defects</a>
<a id='line_2483'>      of a place, which religion as well as honor forbade them to</a>
<a id='line_2484'>      resign. Aladin, or Iftikhar, the caliph’s lieutenant, was</a>
<a id='line_2485'>      intrusted with the defence: his policy strove to restrain the</a>
<a id='line_2486'>      native Christians by the dread of their own ruin and that of the</a>
<a id='line_2487'>      holy sepulchre; to animate the Moslems by the assurance of</a>
<a id='line_2488'>      temporal and eternal rewards. His garrison is said to have</a>
<a id='line_2489'>      consisted of forty thousand Turks and Arabians; and if he could</a>
<a id='line_2490'>      muster twenty thousand of the inhabitants, it must be confessed</a>
<a id='line_2491'>      that the besieged were more numerous than the besieging army. 106</a>
<a id='line_2492'>      Had the diminished strength and numbers of the Latins allowed</a>
<a id='line_2493'>      them to grasp the whole circumference of four thousand yards,</a>
<a id='line_2494'>      (about two English miles and a half, 107 to what useful purpose</a>
<a id='line_2495'>      should they have descended into the valley of Ben Hinnom and</a>
<a id='line_2496'>      torrent of Cedron, 108 or approach the precipices of the south</a>
<a id='line_2497'>      and east, from whence they had nothing either to hope or fear?</a>
<a id='line_2498'>      Their siege was more reasonably directed against the northern and</a>
<a id='line_2499'>      western sides of the city. Godfrey of Bouillon erected his</a>
<a id='line_2500'>      standard on the first swell of Mount Calvary: to the left, as far</a>
<a id='line_2501'>      as St. Stephen’s gate, the line of attack was continued by</a>
<a id='line_2502'>      Tancred and the two Roberts; and Count Raymond established his</a>
<a id='line_2503'>      quarters from the citadel to the foot of Mount Sion, which was no</a>
<a id='line_2504'>      longer included within the precincts of the city. On the fifth</a>
<a id='line_2505'>      day, the crusaders made a general assault, in the fanatic hope of</a>
<a id='line_2506'>      battering down the walls without engines, and of scaling them</a>
<a id='line_2507'>      without ladders. By the dint of brutal force, they burst the</a>
<a id='line_2508'>      first barrier; but they were driven back with shame and slaughter</a>
<a id='line_2509'>      to the camp: the influence of vision and prophecy was deadened by</a>
<a id='line_2510'>      the too frequent abuse of those pious stratagems; and time and</a>
<a id='line_2511'>      labor were found to be the only means of victory. The time of the</a>
<a id='line_2512'>      siege was indeed fulfilled in forty days, but they were forty</a>
<a id='line_2513'>      days of calamity and anguish. A repetition of the old complaint</a>
<a id='line_2514'>      of famine may be imputed in some degree to the voracious or</a>
<a id='line_2515'>      disorderly appetite of the Franks; but the stony soil of</a>
<a id='line_2516'>      Jerusalem is almost destitute of water; the scanty springs and</a>
<a id='line_2517'>      hasty torrents were dry in the summer season; nor was the thirst</a>
<a id='line_2518'>      of the besiegers relieved, as in the city, by the artificial</a>
<a id='line_2519'>      supply of cisterns and aqueducts. The circumjacent country is</a>
<a id='line_2520'>      equally destitute of trees for the uses of shade or building, but</a>
<a id='line_2521'>      some large beams were discovered in a cave by the crusaders: a</a>
<a id='line_2522'>      wood near Sichem, the enchanted grove of Tasso, 109 was cut down:</a>
<a id='line_2523'>      the necessary timber was transported to the camp by the vigor and</a>
<a id='line_2524'>      dexterity of Tancred; and the engines were framed by some Genoese</a>
<a id='line_2525'>      artists, who had fortunately landed in the harbor of Jaffa. Two</a>
<a id='line_2526'>      movable turrets were constructed at the expense, and in the</a>
<a id='line_2527'>      stations, of the duke of Lorraine and the count of Tholouse, and</a>
<a id='line_2528'>      rolled forwards with devout labor, not to the most accessible,</a>
<a id='line_2529'>      but to the most neglected, parts of the fortification. Raymond’s</a>
<a id='line_2530'>      Tower was reduced to ashes by the fire of the besieged, but his</a>
<a id='line_2531'>      colleague was more vigilant and successful; 1091 the enemies were</a>
<a id='line_2532'>      driven by his archers from the rampart; the draw-bridge was let</a>
<a id='line_2533'>      down; and on a Friday, at three in the afternoon, the day and</a>
<a id='line_2534'>      hour of the passion, Godfrey of Bouillon stood victorious on the</a>
<a id='line_2535'>      walls of Jerusalem. His example was followed on every side by the</a>
<a id='line_2536'>      emulation of valor; and about four hundred and sixty years after</a>
<a id='line_2537'>      the conquest of Omar, the holy city was rescued from the</a>
<a id='line_2538'>      Mahometan yoke. In the pillage of public and private wealth, the</a>
<a id='line_2539'>      adventurers had agreed to respect the exclusive property of the</a>
<a id='line_2540'>      first occupant; and the spoils of the great mosque, seventy lamps</a>
<a id='line_2541'>      and massy vases of gold and silver, rewarded the diligence, and</a>
<a id='line_2542'>      displayed the generosity, of Tancred. A bloody sacrifice was</a>
<a id='line_2543'>      offered by his mistaken votaries to the God of the Christians:</a>
<a id='line_2544'>      resistance might provoke but neither age nor sex could mollify,</a>
<a id='line_2545'>      their implacable rage: they indulged themselves three days in a</a>
<a id='line_2546'>      promiscuous massacre; 110 and the infection of the dead bodies</a>
<a id='line_2547'>      produced an epidemical disease. After seventy thousand Moslems</a>
<a id='line_2548'>      had been put to the sword, and the harmless Jews had been burnt</a>
<a id='line_2549'>      in their synagogue, they could still reserve a multitude of</a>
<a id='line_2550'>      captives, whom interest or lassitude persuaded them to spare. Of</a>
<a id='line_2551'>      these savage heroes of the cross, Tancred alone betrayed some</a>
<a id='line_2552'>      sentiments of compassion; yet we may praise the more selfish</a>
<a id='line_2553'>      lenity of Raymond, who granted a capitulation and safe-conduct to</a>
<a id='line_2554'>      the garrison of the citadel. 111 The holy sepulchre was now free;</a>
<a id='line_2555'>      and the bloody victors prepared to accomplish their vow.</a>
<a id='line_2556'>      Bareheaded and barefoot, with contrite hearts, and in an humble</a>
<a id='line_2557'>      posture, they ascended the hill of Calvary, amidst the loud</a>
<a id='line_2558'>      anthems of the clergy; kissed the stone which had covered the</a>
<a id='line_2559'>      Savior of the world; and bedewed with tears of joy and penitence</a>
<a id='line_2560'>      the monument of their redemption. This union of the fiercest and</a>
<a id='line_2561'>      most tender passions has been variously considered by two</a>
<a id='line_2562'>      philosophers; by the one, 112 as easy and natural; by the other,</a>
<a id='line_2563'>      113 as absurd and incredible. Perhaps it is too rigorously</a>

<a id='line_2671'>      choice of a bishop should precede that of a king. The revenue and</a>
<a id='line_2672'>      jurisdiction of the lawful patriarch were usurped by the Latin</a>

<a id='line_2937'>      two tribunals of unequal dignity, which were instituted by</a>
<a id='line_2938'>      Godfrey of Bouillon after the conquest of Jerusalem. The king, in</a>
<a id='line_2939'>      person, presided in the upper court, the court of the barons. Of</a>
<a id='line_2940'>      these the four most conspicuous were the prince of Galilee, the</a>
<a id='line_2941'>      lord of Sidon and Caesarea, and the counts of Jaffa and Tripoli,</a>
<a id='line_2942'>      who, perhaps with the constable and marshal, 137 were in a</a>
<a id='line_2943'>      special manner the compeers and judges of each other. But all the</a>
<a id='line_2944'>      nobles, who held their lands immediately of the crown, were</a>
<a id='line_2945'>      entitled and bound to attend the king’s court; and each baron</a>
<a id='line_2946'>      exercised a similar jurisdiction on the subordinate assemblies of</a>
<a id='line_2947'>      his own feudatories. The connection of lord and vassal was</a>
<a id='line_2948'>      honorable and voluntary: reverence was due to the benefactor,</a>
<a id='line_2949'>      protection to the dependant; but they mutually pledged their</a>
<a id='line_2950'>      faith to each other; and the obligation on either side might be</a>
<a id='line_2951'>      suspended by neglect or dissolved by injury. The cognizance of</a>
<a id='line_2952'>      marriages and testaments was blended with religion, and usurped</a>
<a id='line_2953'>      by the clergy: but the civil and criminal causes of the nobles,</a>
<a id='line_2954'>      the inheritance and tenure of their fiefs, formed the proper</a>
<a id='line_2955'>      occupation of the supreme court. Each member was the judge and</a>
<a id='line_2956'>      guardian both of public and private rights. It was his duty to</a>
<a id='line_2957'>      assert with his tongue and sword the lawful claims of the lord;</a>
<a id='line_2958'>      but if an unjust superior presumed to violate the freedom or</a>

<a id='line_2961'>      innocence and his wrongs; demanded the restitution of his liberty</a>
<a id='line_2962'>      or his lands; suspended, after a fruitless demand, their own</a>

<a id='line_2966'>      their pleadings, replies, and rejoinders, the advocates of the</a>
<a id='line_2967'>      court were subtle and copious; but the use of argument and</a>

<a id='line_3011'>      in civil cases, the demandant was punished with infamy and the</a>
<a id='line_3012'>      loss of his suit, while his witness and champion suffered</a>
<a id='line_3013'>      ignominious death. In many cases it was in the option of the</a>
