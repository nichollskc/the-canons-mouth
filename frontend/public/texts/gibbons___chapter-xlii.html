<a id='line_8'>      Our estimate of personal merit, is relative to the common</a>
<a id='line_9'>      faculties of mankind. The aspiring efforts of genius, or virtue,</a>
<a id='line_10'>      either in active or speculative life, are measured, not so much</a>
<a id='line_11'>      by their real elevation, as by the height to which they ascend</a>
<a id='line_12'>      above the level of their age and country; and the same stature,</a>
<a id='line_13'>      which in a people of giants would pass unnoticed, must appear</a>
<a id='line_14'>      conspicuous in a race of pygmies. Leonidas, and his three hundred</a>
<a id='line_15'>      companions, devoted their lives at Thermopylae; but the education</a>
<a id='line_16'>      of the infant, the boy, and the man, had prepared, and almost</a>
<a id='line_17'>      insured, this memorable sacrifice; and each Spartan would</a>
<a id='line_18'>      approve, rather than admire, an act of duty, of which himself and</a>
<a id='line_19'>      eight thousand of his fellow-citizens were equally capable. 1 The</a>
<a id='line_20'>      great Pompey might inscribe on his trophies, that he had defeated</a>
<a id='line_21'>      in battle two millions of enemies, and reduced fifteen hundred</a>
<a id='line_22'>      cities from the Lake Maeotis to the Red Sea: 2 but the fortune of</a>
<a id='line_23'>      Rome flew before his eagles; the nations were oppressed by their</a>
<a id='line_24'>      own fears, and the invincible legions which he commanded, had</a>
<a id='line_25'>      been formed by the habits of conquest and the discipline of ages.</a>
<a id='line_26'>      In this view, the character of Belisarius may be deservedly</a>
<a id='line_27'>      placed above the heroes of the ancient republics. His</a>
<a id='line_28'>      imperfections flowed from the contagion of the times; his virtues</a>
<a id='line_29'>      were his own, the free gift of nature or reflection; he raised</a>
<a id='line_30'>      himself without a master or a rival; and so inadequate were the</a>
<a id='line_31'>      arms committed to his hand, that his sole advantage was derived</a>
<a id='line_32'>      from the pride and presumption of his adversaries. Under his</a>
<a id='line_33'>      command, the subjects of Justinian often deserved to be called</a>
<a id='line_34'>      Romans: but the unwarlike appellation of Greeks was imposed as a</a>
<a id='line_35'>      term of reproach by the haughty Goths; who affected to blush,</a>
<a id='line_36'>      that they must dispute the kingdom of Italy with a nation of</a>
<a id='line_37'>      tragedians pantomimes, and pirates. 3 The climate of Asia has</a>
<a id='line_38'>      indeed been found less congenial than that of Europe to military</a>
<a id='line_39'>      spirit: those populous countries were enervated by luxury,</a>
<a id='line_40'>      despotism, and superstition; and the monks were more expensive</a>
<a id='line_41'>      and more numerous than the soldiers of the East. The regular</a>
<a id='line_42'>      force of the empire had once amounted to six hundred and</a>
<a id='line_43'>      forty-five thousand men: it was reduced, in the time of</a>
<a id='line_44'>      Justinian, to one hundred and fifty thousand; and this number,</a>
<a id='line_45'>      large as it may seem, was thinly scattered over the sea and land;</a>
<a id='line_46'>      in Spain and Italy, in Africa and Egypt, on the banks of the</a>
<a id='line_47'>      Danube, the coast of the Euxine, and the frontiers of Persia. The</a>
<a id='line_48'>      citizen was exhausted, yet the soldier was unpaid; his poverty</a>
<a id='line_49'>      was mischievously soothed by the privilege of rapine and</a>
<a id='line_50'>      indolence; and the tardy payments were detained and intercepted</a>
<a id='line_51'>      by the fraud of those agents who usurp, without courage or</a>
<a id='line_52'>      danger, the emoluments of war. Public and private distress</a>
<a id='line_53'>      recruited the armies of the state; but in the field, and still</a>
<a id='line_54'>      more in the presence of the enemy, their numbers were always</a>
<a id='line_55'>      defective. The want of national spirit was supplied by the</a>
<a id='line_56'>      precarious faith and disorderly service of Barbarian mercenaries.</a>
<a id='line_57'></a>
<a id='line_58'>      Even military honor, which has often survived the loss of virtue</a>
<a id='line_59'>      and freedom, was almost totally extinct. The generals, who were</a>
<a id='line_60'>      multiplied beyond the example of former times, labored only to</a>
<a id='line_61'>      prevent the success, or to sully the reputation of their</a>
<a id='line_62'>      colleagues; and they had been taught by experience, that if merit</a>
<a id='line_63'>      sometimes provoked the jealousy, error, or even guilt, would</a>
<a id='line_64'>      obtain the indulgence, of a gracious emperor. 4 In such an age,</a>
<a id='line_65'>      the triumphs of Belisarius, and afterwards of Narses, shine with</a>
<a id='line_66'>      incomparable lustre; but they are encompassed with the darkest</a>
<a id='line_67'>      shades of disgrace and calamity. While the lieutenant of</a>
<a id='line_68'>      Justinian subdued the kingdoms of the Goths and Vandals, the</a>
<a id='line_69'>      emperor, 5 timid, though ambitious, balanced the forces of the</a>
<a id='line_70'>      Barbarians, fomented their divisions by flattery and falsehood,</a>
<a id='line_71'>      and invited by his patience and liberality the repetition of</a>
<a id='line_72'>      injuries. 6 The keys of Carthage, Rome, and Ravenna, were</a>
<a id='line_73'>      presented to their conqueror, while Antioch was destroyed by the</a>
<a id='line_74'>      Persians, and Justinian trembled for the safety of</a>
<a id='line_75'>      Constantinople.</a>

<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>      6 (return) [ This mischievous policy, which Procopius (Anecdot.</a>
<a id='line_103'>      c. 19) imputes to the emperor, is revealed in his epistle to a</a>
<a id='line_104'>      Scythian prince, who was capable of understanding it.]</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>      Even the Gothic victories of Belisarius were prejudicial to the</a>
<a id='line_107'>      state, since they abolished the important barrier of the Upper</a>
<a id='line_108'>      Danube, which had been so faithfully guarded by Theodoric and his</a>
<a id='line_109'>      daughter. For the defence of Italy, the Goths evacuated Pannonia</a>
<a id='line_110'>      and Noricum, which they left in a peaceful and flourishing</a>
<a id='line_111'>      condition: the sovereignty was claimed by the emperor of the</a>
<a id='line_112'>      Romans; the actual possession was abandoned to the boldness of</a>
<a id='line_113'>      the first invader. On the opposite banks of the Danube, the</a>
<a id='line_114'>      plains of Upper Hungary and the Transylvanian hills were</a>
<a id='line_115'>      possessed, since the death of Attila, by the tribes of the</a>
<a id='line_116'>      Gepidae, who respected the Gothic arms, and despised, not indeed</a>
<a id='line_117'>      the gold of the Romans, but the secret motive of their annual</a>
<a id='line_118'>      subsidies. The vacant fortifications of the river were instantly</a>
<a id='line_119'>      occupied by these Barbarians; their standards were planted on the</a>
<a id='line_120'>      walls of Sirmium and Belgrade; and the ironical tone of their</a>
<a id='line_121'>      apology aggravated this insult on the majesty of the empire. “So</a>
<a id='line_122'>      extensive, O Caesar, are your dominions, so numerous are your</a>
<a id='line_123'>      cities, that you are continually seeking for nations to whom,</a>
<a id='line_124'>      either in peace or in war, you may relinquish these useless</a>
<a id='line_125'>      possessions. The Gepidae are your brave and faithful allies; and</a>
<a id='line_126'>      if they have anticipated your gifts, they have shown a just</a>
<a id='line_127'>      confidence in your bounty.” Their presumption was excused by the</a>
<a id='line_128'>      mode of revenge which Justinian embraced. Instead of asserting</a>
<a id='line_129'>      the rights of a sovereign for the protection of his subjects, the</a>
<a id='line_130'>      emperor invited a strange people to invade and possess the Roman</a>
<a id='line_131'>      provinces between the Danube and the Alps and the ambition of the</a>
<a id='line_132'>      Gepidae was checked by the rising power and fame of the Lombards.</a>
<a id='line_133'>      7 This corrupt appellation has been diffused in the thirteenth</a>
<a id='line_134'>      century by the merchants and bankers, the Italian posterity of</a>
<a id='line_135'>      these savage warriors: but the original name of Langobards is</a>
<a id='line_136'>      expressive only of the peculiar length and fashion of their</a>
<a id='line_137'>      beards. I am not disposed either to question or to justify their</a>
<a id='line_138'>      Scandinavian origin; 8 nor to pursue the migrations of the</a>
<a id='line_139'>      Lombards through unknown regions and marvellous adventures. About</a>
<a id='line_140'>      the time of Augustus and Trajan, a ray of historic light breaks</a>
<a id='line_141'>      on the darkness of their antiquities, and they are discovered,</a>
<a id='line_142'>      for the first time, between the Elbe and the Oder. Fierce, beyond</a>
<a id='line_143'>      the example of the Germans, they delighted to propagate the</a>
<a id='line_144'>      tremendous belief, that their heads were formed like the heads of</a>
<a id='line_145'>      dogs, and that they drank the blood of their enemies, whom they</a>
<a id='line_146'>      vanquished in battle. The smallness of their numbers was</a>
<a id='line_147'>      recruited by the adoption of their bravest slaves; and alone,</a>
<a id='line_148'>      amidst their powerful neighbors, they defended by arms their</a>
<a id='line_149'>      high-spirited independence. In the tempests of the north, which</a>
<a id='line_150'>      overwhelmed so many names and nations, this little bark of the</a>
<a id='line_151'>      Lombards still floated on the surface: they gradually descended</a>
<a id='line_152'>      towards the south and the Danube, and, at the end of four hundred</a>
<a id='line_153'>      years, they again appear with their ancient valor and renown.</a>
<a id='line_154'>      Their manners were not less ferocious. The assassination of a</a>
<a id='line_155'>      royal guest was executed in the presence, and by the command, of</a>
<a id='line_156'>      the king’s daughter, who had been provoked by some words of</a>
<a id='line_157'>      insult, and disappointed by his diminutive stature; and a</a>
<a id='line_158'>      tribute, the price of blood, was imposed on the Lombards, by his</a>
<a id='line_159'>      brother the king of the Heruli. Adversity revived a sense of</a>
<a id='line_160'>      moderation and justice, and the insolence of conquest was</a>
<a id='line_161'>      chastised by the signal defeat and irreparable dispersion of the</a>
<a id='line_162'>      Heruli, who were seated in the southern provinces of Poland. 9</a>
<a id='line_163'>      The victories of the Lombards recommended them to the friendship</a>
<a id='line_164'>      of the emperors; and at the solicitations of Justinian, they</a>
<a id='line_165'>      passed the Danube, to reduce, according to their treaty, the</a>
<a id='line_166'>      cities of Noricum and the fortresses of Pannonia. But the spirit</a>
<a id='line_167'>      of rapine soon tempted them beyond these ample limits; they</a>
<a id='line_168'>      wandered along the coast of the Hadriatic as far as Dyrrachium,</a>
<a id='line_169'>      and presumed, with familiar rudeness to enter the towns and</a>
<a id='line_170'>      houses of their Roman allies, and to seize the captives who had</a>
<a id='line_171'>      escaped from their audacious hands. These acts of hostility, the</a>
<a id='line_172'>      sallies, as it might be pretended, of some loose adventurers,</a>
<a id='line_173'>      were disowned by the nation, and excused by the emperor; but the</a>
<a id='line_174'>      arms of the Lombards were more seriously engaged by a contest of</a>
<a id='line_175'>      thirty years, which was terminated only by the extirpation of the</a>
<a id='line_176'>      Gepidae. The hostile nations often pleaded their cause before the</a>
<a id='line_177'>      throne of Constantinople; and the crafty Justinian, to whom the</a>
<a id='line_178'>      Barbarians were almost equally odious, pronounced a partial and</a>
<a id='line_179'>      ambiguous sentence, and dexterously protracted the war by slow</a>
<a id='line_180'>      and ineffectual succors. Their strength was formidable, since the</a>
<a id='line_181'>      Lombards, who sent into the field several myriads of soldiers,</a>
<a id='line_182'>      still claimed, as the weaker side, the protection of the Romans.</a>
<a id='line_183'>      Their spirit was intrepid; yet such is the uncertainty of</a>
<a id='line_184'>      courage, that the two armies were suddenly struck with a panic;</a>
<a id='line_185'>      they fled from each other, and the rival kings remained with</a>
<a id='line_186'>      their guards in the midst of an empty plain. A short truce was</a>
<a id='line_187'>      obtained; but their mutual resentment again kindled; and the</a>
<a id='line_188'>      remembrance of their shame rendered the next encounter more</a>
<a id='line_189'>      desperate and bloody. Forty thousand of the Barbarians perished</a>
<a id='line_190'>      in the decisive battle, which broke the power of the Gepidae,</a>
<a id='line_191'>      transferred the fears and wishes of Justinian, and first</a>
<a id='line_192'>      displayed the character of Alboin, the youthful prince of the</a>
<a id='line_193'>      Lombards, and the future conqueror of Italy. 10</a>

<a id='line_232'>      touched the Euxine and the Lake Maeotis, derived from the Huns</a>
<a id='line_233'>      their name or descent; and it is needless to renew the simple and</a>
<a id='line_234'>      well-known picture of Tartar manners. They were bold and</a>

<a id='line_238'>      whose inroads no country was remote or impervious, and who were</a>
<a id='line_239'>      practised in flight, though incapable of fear. The nation was</a>
<a id='line_240'>      divided into two powerful and hostile tribes, who pursued each</a>
<a id='line_241'>      other with fraternal hatred. They eagerly disputed the</a>

<a id='line_243'>      distinctions which nature had fixed between the faithful dog and</a>

<a id='line_246'>      The Bulgarians, of whatsoever species, were equally attracted by</a>

<a id='line_250'>      race of Sclavonians appears to have maintained, in every age, the</a>
<a id='line_251'>      possession of the same countries. Their numerous tribes, however</a>
<a id='line_252'>      distant or adverse, used one common language, (it was harsh and</a>
<a id='line_253'>      irregular,) and where known by the resemblance of their form,</a>
<a id='line_254'>      which deviated from the swarthy Tartar, and approached without</a>
<a id='line_255'>      attaining the lofty stature and fair complexion of the German.</a>
<a id='line_256'>      Four thousand six hundred villages 13 were scattered over the</a>
<a id='line_257'>      provinces of Russia and Poland, and their huts were hastily built</a>
<a id='line_258'>      of rough timber, in a country deficient both in stone and iron.</a>
<a id='line_259'>      Erected, or rather concealed, in the depth of forests, on the</a>
<a id='line_260'>      banks of rivers, or the edges of morasses, we may not perhaps,</a>
<a id='line_261'>      without flattery, compare them to the architecture of the beaver;</a>
<a id='line_262'>      which they resembled in a double issue, to the land and water,</a>
<a id='line_263'>      for the escape of the savage inhabitant, an animal less cleanly,</a>
<a id='line_264'>      less diligent, and less social, than that marvellous quadruped.</a>
<a id='line_265'>      The fertility of the soil, rather than the labor of the natives,</a>
<a id='line_266'>      supplied the rustic plenty of the Sclavonians. Their sheep and</a>
<a id='line_267'>      horned cattle were large and numerous, and the fields which they</a>
<a id='line_268'>      sowed with millet or panic 14 afforded, in place of bread, a</a>
<a id='line_269'>      coarse and less nutritive food. The incessant rapine of their</a>
<a id='line_270'>      neighbors compelled them to bury this treasure in the earth; but</a>
<a id='line_271'>      on the appearance of a stranger, it was freely imparted by a</a>
<a id='line_272'>      people, whose unfavorable character is qualified by the epithets</a>
<a id='line_273'>      of chaste, patient, and hospitable. As their supreme god, they</a>
<a id='line_274'>      adored an invisible master of the thunder. The rivers and the</a>
<a id='line_275'>      nymphs obtained their subordinate honors, and the popular worship</a>
<a id='line_276'>      was expressed in vows and sacrifice. The Sclavonians disdained to</a>
<a id='line_277'>      obey a despot, a prince, or even a magistrate; but their</a>
<a id='line_278'>      experience was too narrow, their passions too headstrong, to</a>
<a id='line_279'>      compose a system of equal law or general defence. Some voluntary</a>
<a id='line_280'>      respect was yielded to age and valor; but each tribe or village</a>
<a id='line_281'>      existed as a separate republic, and all must be persuaded where</a>
<a id='line_282'>      none could be compelled. They fought on foot, almost naked, and</a>
<a id='line_283'>      except an unwieldy shield, without any defensive armor; their</a>
<a id='line_284'>      weapons of offence were a bow, a quiver of small poisoned arrows,</a>
<a id='line_285'>      and a long rope, which they dexterously threw from a distance,</a>
<a id='line_286'>      and entangled their enemy in a running noose. In the field, the</a>
<a id='line_287'>      Sclavonian infantry was dangerous by their speed, agility, and</a>
<a id='line_288'>      hardiness: they swam, they dived, they remained under water,</a>
<a id='line_289'>      drawing their breath through a hollow cane; and a river or lake</a>
<a id='line_290'>      was often the scene of their unsuspected ambuscade. But these</a>
<a id='line_291'>      were the achievements of spies or stragglers; the military art</a>
<a id='line_292'>      was unknown to the Sclavonians; their name was obscure, and their</a>
<a id='line_293'>      conquests were inglorious. 15</a>

<a id='line_390'>      their past inroads. They spread from the suburbs of</a>
<a id='line_391'>      Constantinople to the Ionian Gulf, destroyed thirty-two cities or</a>
<a id='line_392'>      castles, erased Potidaea, which Athens had built, and Philip had</a>

<a id='line_396'>      Thracian Chersonesus, extirpated the habitations and the</a>
<a id='line_397'>      inhabitants, boldly traversed the Hellespont, and returned to</a>
<a id='line_398'>      their companions, laden with the spoils of Asia. Another party,</a>

<a id='line_406'>      impregnable, were either deserted by the garrison, or scaled by</a>
<a id='line_407'>      the Barbarians. Three thousand Sclavonians, who insolently</a>
<a id='line_408'>      divided themselves into two bands, discovered the weakness and</a>
<a id='line_409'>      misery of a triumphant reign. They passed the Danube and the</a>

<a id='line_412'>      and Thrace, each of which had arms and numbers to overwhelm their</a>
<a id='line_413'>      contemptible assailants. Whatever praise the boldness of the</a>
<a id='line_414'>      Sclavonians may deserve, it is sullied by the wanton and</a>
<a id='line_415'>      deliberate cruelty which they are accused of exercising on their</a>
<a id='line_416'>      prisoners. Without distinction of rank, or age, or sex, the</a>

<a id='line_418'>      posts, and beaten with clubs till they expired, or enclosed in</a>
<a id='line_419'>      some spacious building, and left to perish in the flames with the</a>
<a id='line_420'>      spoil and cattle which might impede the march of these savage</a>
<a id='line_421'>      victors. 20 Perhaps a more impartial narrative would reduce the</a>
<a id='line_422'>      number, and qualify the nature, of these horrid acts; and they</a>
<a id='line_423'>      might sometimes be excused by the cruel laws of retaliation. In</a>
<a id='line_424'>      the siege of Topirus, 21 whose obstinate defence had enraged the</a>

<a id='line_494'>      the fire, and a smith’s hammer 2511 was successively handled by</a>
<a id='line_495'>      the prince and his nobles, recorded for ages the humble</a>
<a id='line_496'>      profession and rational pride of the Turkish nation. Bertezena,</a>
<a id='line_497'>      2512 their first leader, signalized their valor and his own in</a>
<a id='line_498'>      successful combats against the neighboring tribes; but when he</a>
<a id='line_499'>      presumed to ask in marriage the daughter of the great khan, the</a>
<a id='line_500'>      insolent demand of a slave and a mechanic was contemptuously</a>
<a id='line_501'>      rejected. The disgrace was expiated by a more noble alliance with</a>
<a id='line_502'>      a princess of China; and the decisive battle which almost</a>
<a id='line_503'>      extirpated the nation of the Geougen, established in Tartary the</a>
<a id='line_504'>      new and more powerful empire of the Turks. 2513 They reigned over</a>
<a id='line_505'>      the north; but they confessed the vanity of conquest, by their</a>
<a id='line_506'>      faithful attachment to the mountain of their fathers. The royal</a>
<a id='line_507'>      encampment seldom lost sight of Mount Altai, from whence the</a>
<a id='line_508'>      River Irtish descends to water the rich pastures of the Calmucks,</a>
<a id='line_509'>      26 which nourish the largest sheep and oxen in the world. The</a>
<a id='line_510'>      soil is fruitful, and the climate mild and temperate: the happy</a>
<a id='line_511'>      region was ignorant of earthquake and pestilence; the emperor’s</a>
<a id='line_512'>      throne was turned towards the East, and a golden wolf on the top</a>
<a id='line_513'>      of a spear seemed to guard the entrance of his tent. One of the</a>
<a id='line_514'>      successors of Bertezena was tempted by the luxury and</a>
<a id='line_515'>      superstition of China; but his design of building cities and</a>
<a id='line_516'>      temples was defeated by the simple wisdom of a Barbarian</a>
<a id='line_517'>      counsellor. “The Turks,” he said, “are not equal in number to one</a>
<a id='line_518'>      hundredth part of the inhabitants of China. If we balance their</a>
<a id='line_519'>      power, and elude their armies, it is because we wander without</a>
<a id='line_520'>      any fixed habitations in the exercise of war and hunting. Are we</a>
<a id='line_521'>      strong? we advance and conquer: are we feeble? we retire and are</a>
<a id='line_522'>      concealed. Should the Turks confine themselves within the walls</a>
<a id='line_523'>      of cities, the loss of a battle would be the destruction of their</a>
<a id='line_524'>      empire. The bonzes preach only patience, humility, and the</a>
<a id='line_525'>      renunciation of the world. Such, O king! is not the religion of</a>
<a id='line_526'>      heroes.” They entertained, with less reluctance, the doctrines of</a>
<a id='line_527'>      Zoroaster; but the greatest part of the nation acquiesced,</a>
<a id='line_528'>      without inquiry, in the opinions, or rather in the practice, of</a>
<a id='line_529'>      their ancestors. The honors of sacrifice were reserved for the</a>
<a id='line_530'>      supreme deity; they acknowledged, in rude hymns, their</a>
<a id='line_531'>      obligations to the air, the fire, the water, and the earth; and</a>
<a id='line_532'>      their priests derived some profit from the art of divination.</a>
<a id='line_533'>      Their unwritten laws were rigorous and impartial: theft was</a>
<a id='line_534'>      punished with a tenfold restitution; adultery, treason, and</a>
<a id='line_535'>      murder, with death; and no chastisement could be inflicted too</a>
<a id='line_536'>      severe for the rare and inexpiable guilt of cowardice. As the</a>
<a id='line_537'>      subject nations marched under the standard of the Turks, their</a>
<a id='line_538'>      cavalry, both men and horses, were proudly computed by millions;</a>
<a id='line_539'>      one of their effective armies consisted of four hundred thousand</a>
<a id='line_540'>      soldiers, and in less than fifty years they were connected in</a>
<a id='line_541'>      peace and war with the Romans, the Persians, and the Chinese. In</a>
<a id='line_542'>      their northern limits, some vestige may be discovered of the form</a>
<a id='line_543'>      and situation of Kamptchatka, of a people of hunters and</a>
<a id='line_544'>      fishermen, whose sledges were drawn by dogs, and whose</a>
<a id='line_545'>      habitations were buried in the earth. The Turks were ignorant of</a>
<a id='line_546'>      astronomy; but the observation taken by some learned Chinese,</a>
<a id='line_547'>      with a gnomon of eight feet, fixes the royal camp in the latitude</a>
<a id='line_548'>      of forty-nine degrees, and marks their extreme progress within</a>
<a id='line_549'>      three, or at least ten degrees, of the polar circle. 27 Among</a>
<a id='line_550'>      their southern conquests the most splendid was that of the</a>
<a id='line_551'>      Nephthalites, or white Huns, a polite and warlike people, who</a>
<a id='line_552'>      possessed the commercial cities of Bochara and Samarcand, who had</a>
<a id='line_553'>      vanquished the Persian monarch, and carried their victorious arms</a>
<a id='line_554'>      along the banks, and perhaps to the mouth, of the Indus. On the</a>
<a id='line_555'>      side of the West, the Turkish cavalry advanced to the Lake</a>
<a id='line_556'>      Maeotis. They passed that lake on the ice. The khan who dwelt at</a>
<a id='line_557'>      the foot of Mount Altai issued his commands for the siege of</a>
<a id='line_558'>      Bosphorus, 28 a city the voluntary subject of Rome, and whose</a>
<a id='line_559'>      princes had formerly been the friends of Athens. 29 To the east,</a>
<a id='line_560'>      the Turks invaded China, as often as the vigor of the government</a>
<a id='line_561'>      was relaxed: and I am taught to read in the history of the times,</a>
<a id='line_562'>      that they mowed down their patient enemies like hemp or grass;</a>
<a id='line_563'>      and that the mandarins applauded the wisdom of an emperor who</a>
<a id='line_564'>      repulsed these Barbarians with golden lances. This extent of</a>
<a id='line_565'>      savage empire compelled the Turkish monarch to establish three</a>
<a id='line_566'>      subordinate princes of his own blood, who soon forgot their</a>
<a id='line_567'>      gratitude and allegiance. The conquerors were enervated by</a>
<a id='line_568'>      luxury, which is always fatal except to an industrious people;</a>
<a id='line_569'>      the policy of China solicited the vanquished nations to resume</a>
<a id='line_570'>      their independence and the power of the Turks was limited to a</a>

<a id='line_686'>      their long hair, which hung in tresses down their backs, was</a>
<a id='line_687'>      gracefully bound with ribbons, but the rest of their habit</a>

<a id='line_689'>      admitted to the audience of Justinian, Candish, the first of the</a>

<a id='line_696'>      reward of our valor, precious gifts, annual subsidies, and</a>
<a id='line_697'>      fruitful possessions.” At the time of this embassy, Justinian had</a>
<a id='line_698'>      reigned above thirty, he had lived above seventy-five years: his</a>
<a id='line_699'>      mind, as well as his body, was feeble and languid; and the</a>
<a id='line_700'>      conqueror of Africa and Italy, careless of the permanent interest</a>
<a id='line_701'>      of his people, aspired only to end his days in the bosom even of</a>
<a id='line_702'>      inglorious peace. In a studied oration, he imparted to the senate</a>
<a id='line_703'>      his resolution to dissemble the insult, and to purchase the</a>
<a id='line_704'>      friendship of the Avars; and the whole senate, like the mandarins</a>
<a id='line_705'>      of China, applauded the incomparable wisdom and foresight of</a>
<a id='line_706'>      their sovereign. The instruments of luxury were immediately</a>
<a id='line_707'>      prepared to captivate the Barbarians; silken garments, soft and</a>

<a id='line_709'>      ambassadors, content with such liberal reception, departed from</a>
<a id='line_710'>      Constantinople, and Valentin, one of the emperor’s guards, was</a>
<a id='line_711'>      sent with a similar character to their camp at the foot of Mount</a>

<a id='line_821'>      has been preserved of the reception of the Roman ambassadors at</a>
<a id='line_822'>      the royal camp. After they had been purified with fire and</a>
<a id='line_823'>      incense, according to a rite still practised under the sons of</a>
<a id='line_824'>      Zingis, 3611 they were introduced to the presence of Disabul. In</a>
<a id='line_825'>      a valley of the Golden Mountain, they found the great khan in his</a>
<a id='line_826'>      tent, seated in a chair with wheels, to which a horse might be</a>
<a id='line_827'>      occasionally harnessed. As soon as they had delivered their</a>
<a id='line_828'>      presents, which were received by the proper officers, they</a>
<a id='line_829'>      exposed, in a florid oration, the wishes of the Roman emperor,</a>
<a id='line_830'>      that victory might attend the arms of the Turks, that their reign</a>
<a id='line_831'>      might be long and prosperous, and that a strict alliance, without</a>
<a id='line_832'>      envy or deceit, might forever be maintained between the two most</a>
<a id='line_833'>      powerful nations of the earth. The answer of Disabul corresponded</a>
<a id='line_834'>      with these friendly professions, and the ambassadors were seated</a>
<a id='line_835'>      by his side, at a banquet which lasted the greatest part of the</a>
<a id='line_836'>      day: the tent was surrounded with silk hangings, and a Tartar</a>
<a id='line_837'>      liquor was served on the table, which possessed at least the</a>
<a id='line_838'>      intoxicating qualities of wine. The entertainment of the</a>
<a id='line_839'>      succeeding day was more sumptuous; the silk hangings of the</a>
<a id='line_840'>      second tent were embroidered in various figures; and the royal</a>
<a id='line_841'>      seat, the cups, and the vases, were of gold. A third pavilion was</a>
<a id='line_842'>      supported by columns of gilt wood; a bed of pure and massy gold</a>
<a id='line_843'>      was raised on four peacocks of the same metal: and before the</a>
<a id='line_844'>      entrance of the tent, dishes, basins, and statues of solid</a>
<a id='line_845'>      silver, and admirable art, were ostentatiously piled in wagons,</a>
<a id='line_846'>      the monuments of valor rather than of industry. When Disabul led</a>
<a id='line_847'>      his armies against the frontiers of Persia, his Roman allies</a>
<a id='line_848'>      followed many days the march of the Turkish camp, nor were they</a>
<a id='line_849'>      dismissed till they had enjoyed their precedency over the envoy</a>
<a id='line_850'>      of the great king, whose loud and intemperate clamors interrupted</a>
<a id='line_851'>      the silence of the royal banquet. The power and ambition of</a>
<a id='line_852'>      Chosroes cemented the union of the Turks and Romans, who touched</a>
<a id='line_853'>      his dominions on either side: but those distant nations,</a>
<a id='line_854'>      regardless of each other, consulted the dictates of interest,</a>
<a id='line_855'>      without recollecting the obligations of oaths and treaties. While</a>
<a id='line_856'>      the successor of Disabul celebrated his father’s obsequies, he</a>
<a id='line_857'>      was saluted by the ambassadors of the emperor Tiberius, who</a>
<a id='line_858'>      proposed an invasion of Persia, and sustained, with firmness, the</a>
<a id='line_859'>      angry and perhaps the just reproaches of that haughty Barbarian.</a>
<a id='line_860'>      “You see my ten fingers,” said the great khan, and he applied</a>
<a id='line_861'>      them to his mouth. “You Romans speak with as many tongues, but</a>
<a id='line_862'>      they are tongues of deceit and perjury. To me you hold one</a>
<a id='line_863'>      language, to my subjects another; and the nations are</a>
<a id='line_864'>      successively deluded by your perfidious eloquence. You</a>
<a id='line_865'>      precipitate your allies into war and danger, you enjoy their</a>

<a id='line_867'>      inform your master that a Turk is incapable of uttering or</a>
<a id='line_868'>      forgiving falsehood, and that he shall speedily meet the</a>
<a id='line_869'>      punishment which he deserves. While he solicits my friendship</a>
<a id='line_870'>      with flattering and hollow words, he is sunk to a confederate of</a>
<a id='line_871'>      my fugitive Varchonites. If I condescend to march against those</a>
<a id='line_872'>      contemptible slaves, they will tremble at the sound of our whips;</a>
<a id='line_873'>      they will be trampled, like a nest of ants, under the feet of my</a>
<a id='line_874'>      innumerable cavalry. I am not ignorant of the road which they</a>
<a id='line_875'>      have followed to invade your empire; nor can I be deceived by the</a>

<a id='line_879'>      Turks; and from the rising to the setting sun, the earth is my</a>

<a id='line_881'>      advantage soon renewed the alliance of the Turks and Romans: but</a>

<a id='line_1079'>      of individuals; Nushirvan, or Chosroes, deserved the appellation</a>
<a id='line_1080'>      of just. His government was firm, rigorous, and impartial. It was</a>
<a id='line_1081'>      the first labor of his reign to abolish the dangerous theory of</a>
<a id='line_1082'>      common or equal possessions: the lands and women which the</a>
<a id='line_1083'>      sectaries of Mazdak has usurped were restored to their lawful</a>

<a id='line_1086'>      listening with blind confidence to a favorite minister, he</a>
<a id='line_1087'>      established four viziers over the four great provinces of his</a>
<a id='line_1088'>      empire, Assyria, Media, Persia, and Bactriana. In the choice of</a>
<a id='line_1089'>      judges, praefects, and counsellors, he strove to remove the mask</a>
<a id='line_1090'>      which is always worn in the presence of kings: he wished to</a>
<a id='line_1091'>      substitute the natural order of talents for the accidental</a>
<a id='line_1092'>      distinctions of birth and fortune; he professed, in specious</a>
<a id='line_1093'>      language, his intention to prefer those men who carried the poor</a>
<a id='line_1094'>      in their bosoms, and to banish corruption from the seat of</a>
<a id='line_1095'>      justice, as dogs were excluded from the temples of the Magi. The</a>
<a id='line_1096'>      code of laws of the first Artaxerxes was revived and published as</a>
<a id='line_1097'>      the rule of the magistrates; but the assurance of speedy</a>
<a id='line_1098'>      punishment was the best security of their virtue. Their behavior</a>
<a id='line_1099'>      was inspected by a thousand eyes, their words were overheard by a</a>
<a id='line_1100'>      thousand ears, the secret or public agents of the throne; and the</a>
<a id='line_1101'>      provinces, from the Indian to the Arabian confines, were</a>
<a id='line_1102'>      enlightened by the frequent visits of a sovereign, who affected</a>
<a id='line_1103'>      to emulate his celestial brother in his rapid and salutary</a>
<a id='line_1104'>      career. Education and agriculture he viewed as the two objects</a>
<a id='line_1105'>      most deserving of his care. In every city of Persia orphans, and</a>
<a id='line_1106'>      the children of the poor, were maintained and instructed at the</a>
<a id='line_1107'>      public expense; the daughters were given in marriage to the</a>
<a id='line_1108'>      richest citizens of their own rank, and the sons, according to</a>
<a id='line_1109'>      their different talents, were employed in mechanic trades, or</a>
<a id='line_1110'>      promoted to more honorable service. The deserted villages were</a>
<a id='line_1111'>      relieved by his bounty; to the peasants and farmers who were</a>

<a id='line_1198'>      indissolubly mingled with the grace and perfection of his Attic</a>
<a id='line_1199'>      style. In the search of universal knowledge, Nushirvan was</a>

<a id='line_1204'>      to procure, at any price, the communication of this valuable</a>

<a id='line_1208'>      Indian original, and the Persian copy, have long since</a>

<a id='line_1211'>      the Turkish, the Syriac, the Hebrew, and the Greek idioms, and</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      transfused through successive versions into the modern languages</a>

<a id='line_1328'>      Almondar. That prince of the Saracens, who resided at Hira, 59</a>
<a id='line_1329'>      had not been included in the general peace, and still waged an</a>
<a id='line_1330'>      obscure war against his rival Arethas, the chief of the tribe of</a>
<a id='line_1331'>      Gassan, and confederate of the empire. The subject of their</a>
<a id='line_1332'>      dispute was an extensive sheep-walk in the desert to the south of</a>
<a id='line_1333'>      Palmyra. An immemorial tribute for the license of pasture</a>
<a id='line_1334'>      appeared to attest the rights of Almondar, while the Gassanite</a>
<a id='line_1335'>      appealed to the Latin name of strata, a paved road, as an</a>
<a id='line_1336'>      unquestionable evidence of the sovereignty and labors of the</a>
<a id='line_1337'>      Romans. 60 The two monarchs supported the cause of their</a>
<a id='line_1338'>      respective vassals; and the Persian Arab, without expecting the</a>
<a id='line_1339'>      event of a slow and doubtful arbitration, enriched his flying</a>
<a id='line_1340'>      camp with the spoil and captives of Syria. Instead of repelling</a>
<a id='line_1341'>      the arms, Justinian attempted to seduce the fidelity of Almondar,</a>
<a id='line_1342'>      while he called from the extremities of the earth the nations of</a>
<a id='line_1343'>      Aethiopia and Scythia to invade the dominions of his rival. But</a>
<a id='line_1344'>      the aid of such allies was distant and precarious, and the</a>
<a id='line_1345'>      discovery of this hostile correspondence justified the complaints</a>
<a id='line_1346'>      of the Goths and Armenians, who implored, almost at the same</a>
<a id='line_1347'>      time, the protection of Chosroes. The descendants of Arsaces, who</a>
<a id='line_1348'>      were still numerous in Armenia, had been provoked to assert the</a>
<a id='line_1349'>      last relics of national freedom and hereditary rank; and the</a>
<a id='line_1350'>      ambassadors of Vitiges had secretly traversed the empire to</a>
<a id='line_1351'>      expose the instant, and almost inevitable, danger of the kingdom</a>
<a id='line_1352'>      of Italy. Their representations were uniform, weighty, and</a>

<a id='line_1364'>      the Goths, have been successively oppressed, and each nation has</a>
<a id='line_1365'>      calmly remained the spectator of their neighbor’s ruin. Embrace,</a>

<a id='line_1455'>      the ambassadors of Justinian, was descending from the mountain,</a>
<a id='line_1456'>      he affected, in a plaintive voice, to deplore the obstinacy and</a>
<a id='line_1457'>      ruin of that unhappy people; but the slaughter still raged with</a>
<a id='line_1458'>      unrelenting fury; and the city, at the command of a Barbarian,</a>
<a id='line_1459'>      was delivered to the flames. The cathedral of Antioch was indeed</a>
<a id='line_1460'>      preserved by the avarice, not the piety, of the conqueror: a more</a>
<a id='line_1461'>      honorable exemption was granted to the church of St. Julian, and</a>
<a id='line_1462'>      the quarter of the town where the ambassadors resided; some</a>
<a id='line_1463'>      distant streets were saved by the shifting of the wind, and the</a>
<a id='line_1464'>      walls still subsisted to protect, and soon to betray, their new</a>
<a id='line_1465'>      inhabitants. Fanaticism had defaced the ornaments of Daphne, but</a>
<a id='line_1466'>      Chosroes breathed a purer air amidst her groves and fountains;</a>
<a id='line_1467'>      and some idolaters in his train might sacrifice with impunity to</a>
<a id='line_1468'>      the nymphs of that elegant retreat. Eighteen miles below Antioch,</a>
<a id='line_1469'>      the River Orontes falls into the Mediterranean. The haughty</a>
<a id='line_1470'>      Persian visited the term of his conquests; and, after bathing</a>
<a id='line_1471'>      alone in the sea, he offered a solemn sacrifice of thanksgiving</a>
<a id='line_1472'>      to the sun, or rather to the Creator of the sun, whom the Magi</a>
<a id='line_1473'>      adored. If this act of superstition offended the prejudices of</a>
<a id='line_1474'>      the Syrians, they were pleased by the courteous and even eager</a>
<a id='line_1475'>      attention with which he assisted at the games of the circus; and</a>
<a id='line_1476'>      as Chosroes had heard that the blue faction was espoused by the</a>
<a id='line_1477'>      emperor, his peremptory command secured the victory of the green</a>
<a id='line_1478'>      charioteer. From the discipline of his camp the people derived</a>
<a id='line_1479'>      more solid consolation; and they interceded in vain for the life</a>
<a id='line_1480'>      of a soldier who had too faithfully copied the rapine of the just</a>
<a id='line_1481'>      Nushirvan. At length, fatigued, though unsatiated, with the spoil</a>
<a id='line_1482'>      of Syria, 6213 he slowly moved to the Euphrates, formed a</a>
<a id='line_1483'>      temporary bridge in the neighborhood of Barbalissus, and defined</a>
<a id='line_1484'>      the space of three days for the entire passage of his numerous</a>
<a id='line_1485'>      host. After his return, he founded, at the distance of one day’s</a>
<a id='line_1486'>      journey from the palace of Ctesiphon, a new city, which</a>
<a id='line_1487'>      perpetuated the joint names of Chosroes and of Antioch. The</a>
<a id='line_1488'>      Syrian captives recognized the form and situation of their native</a>
<a id='line_1489'>      abodes: baths and a stately circus were constructed for their</a>
<a id='line_1490'>      use; and a colony of musicians and charioteers revived in Assyria</a>
<a id='line_1491'>      the pleasures of a Greek capital. By the munificence of the royal</a>

<a id='line_1535'>      Assyria, a fruitful province, long exempt from the calamities of</a>
<a id='line_1536'>      war. But the plans of Belisarius were disconcerted by the</a>
<a id='line_1537'>      untractable spirit of Arethas, who neither returned to the camp,</a>
<a id='line_1538'>      nor sent any intelligence of his motions. The Roman general was</a>
<a id='line_1539'>      fixed in anxious expectation to the same spot; the time of action</a>
<a id='line_1540'>      elapsed, the ardent sun of Mesopotamia inflamed with fevors the</a>

<a id='line_1542'>      officers of Syria affected to tremble for the safety of their</a>
<a id='line_1543'>      defenceless cities. Yet this diversion had already succeeded in</a>
<a id='line_1544'>      forcing Chosroes to return with loss and precipitation; and if</a>
<a id='line_1545'>      the skill of Belisarius had been seconded by discipline and</a>
<a id='line_1546'>      valor, his success might have satisfied the sanguine wishes of</a>
<a id='line_1547'>      the public, who required at his hands the conquest of Ctesiphon,</a>
<a id='line_1548'>      and the deliverance of the captives of Antioch. At the end of the</a>
<a id='line_1549'>      campaign, he was recalled to Constantinople by an ungrateful</a>
<a id='line_1550'>      court, but the dangers of the ensuing spring restored his</a>
<a id='line_1551'>      confidence and command; and the hero, almost alone, was</a>
<a id='line_1552'>      despatched, with the speed of post-horses, to repel, by his name</a>

<a id='line_1555'>      in the fortifications of Hierapolis. But instead of listening to</a>
<a id='line_1556'>      their timid counsels, Belisarius commanded them to follow him to</a>
<a id='line_1557'>      Europus, where he had resolved to collect his forces, and to</a>
<a id='line_1558'>      execute whatever God should inspire him to achieve against the</a>
<a id='line_1559'>      enemy. His firm attitude on the banks of the Euphrates restrained</a>
<a id='line_1560'>      Chosroes from advancing towards Palestine; and he received with</a>
<a id='line_1561'>      art and dignity the ambassadors, or rather spies, of the Persian</a>
<a id='line_1562'>      monarch. The plain between Hierapolis and the river was covered</a>
<a id='line_1563'>      with the squadrons of cavalry, six thousand hunters, tall and</a>
<a id='line_1564'>      robust, who pursued their game without the apprehension of an</a>
<a id='line_1565'>      enemy. On the opposite bank the ambassadors descried a thousand</a>
<a id='line_1566'>      Armenian horse, who appeared to guard the passage of the</a>
<a id='line_1567'>      Euphrates. The tent of Belisarius was of the coarsest linen, the</a>
<a id='line_1568'>      simple equipage of a warrior who disdained the luxury of the</a>
<a id='line_1569'>      East. Around his tent, the nations who marched under his standard</a>
<a id='line_1570'>      were arranged with skilful confusion. The Thracians and Illyrians</a>
<a id='line_1571'>      were posted in the front, the Heruli and Goths in the centre; the</a>
<a id='line_1572'>      prospect was closed by the Moors and Vandals, and their loose</a>
<a id='line_1573'>      array seemed to multiply their numbers. Their dress was light and</a>
<a id='line_1574'>      active; one soldier carried a whip, another a sword, a third a</a>
<a id='line_1575'>      bow, a fourth, perhaps, a battle axe, and the whole picture</a>
<a id='line_1576'>      exhibited the intrepidity of the troops and the vigilance of the</a>
<a id='line_1577'>      general. Chosroes was deluded by the address, and awed by the</a>
<a id='line_1578'>      genius, of the lieutenant of Justinian. Conscious of the merit,</a>
<a id='line_1579'>      and ignorant of the force, of his antagonist, he dreaded a</a>
<a id='line_1580'>      decisive battle in a distant country, from whence not a Persian</a>
<a id='line_1581'>      might return to relate the melancholy tale. The great king</a>
<a id='line_1582'>      hastened to repass the Euphrates; and Belisarius pressed his</a>
<a id='line_1583'>      retreat, by affecting to oppose a measure so salutary to the</a>
<a id='line_1584'>      empire, and which could scarcely have been prevented by an army</a>
<a id='line_1585'>      of a hundred thousand men. Envy might suggest to ignorance and</a>
<a id='line_1586'>      pride, that the public enemy had been suffered to escape: but the</a>
<a id='line_1587'>      African and Gothic triumphs are less glorious than this safe and</a>
<a id='line_1588'>      bloodless victory, in which neither fortune, nor the valor of the</a>

<a id='line_1591'>      revealed the extent of his personal merit, which had corrected or</a>
<a id='line_1592'>      supplied the want of discipline and courage. Fifteen generals,</a>
<a id='line_1593'>      without concert or skill, led through the mountains of Armenia an</a>

<a id='line_1782'>      dissolute of mankind; and their children, who, in a tender age,</a>
<a id='line_1783'>      are sold into foreign slavery, have already learned to imitate</a>
<a id='line_1784'>      the rapine of the father and the prostitution of the mother. Yet,</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      amidst the rudest ignorance, the untaught natives discover a</a>

<a id='line_1787'>      of union and discipline exposes them to their more powerful</a>
<a id='line_1788'>      neighbors, a bold and intrepid spirit has animated the Colchians</a>

<a id='line_1790'>      their arms were a dagger or a javelin, a wooden casque, and a</a>
<a id='line_1791'>      buckler of raw hides. But in their own country the use of cavalry</a>

<a id='line_1843'>      of Aethiopia: the Colchians were not subject to the dominion of a</a>
<a id='line_1844'>      satrap, and they continued to enjoy the name as well as substance</a>
<a id='line_1845'>      of national independence. 77 After the fall of the Persian</a>
<a id='line_1846'>      empire, Mithridates, king of Pontus, added Colchos to the wide</a>
<a id='line_1847'>      circle of his dominions on the Euxine; and when the natives</a>
<a id='line_1848'>      presumed to request that his son might reign over them, he bound</a>
<a id='line_1849'>      the ambitious youth in chains of gold, and delegated a servant in</a>
<a id='line_1850'>      his place. In pursuit of Mithridates, the Romans advanced to the</a>
<a id='line_1851'>      banks of the Phasis, and their galleys ascended the river till</a>
<a id='line_1852'>      they reached the camp of Pompey and his legions. 78 But the</a>
<a id='line_1853'>      senate, and afterwards the emperors, disdained to reduce that</a>
<a id='line_1854'>      distant and useless conquest into the form of a province. The</a>
<a id='line_1855'>      family of a Greek rhetorician was permitted to reign in Colchos</a>
<a id='line_1856'>      and the adjacent kingdoms from the time of Mark Antony to that of</a>
<a id='line_1857'>      Nero; and after the race of Polemo 79 was extinct, the eastern</a>
<a id='line_1858'>      Pontus, which preserved his name, extended no farther than the</a>
<a id='line_1859'>      neighborhood of Trebizond. Beyond these limits the fortifications</a>

<a id='line_1861'>      Sebastopolis, and of Pityus, were guarded by sufficient</a>
<a id='line_1862'>      detachments of horse and foot; and six princes of Colchos</a>
<a id='line_1863'>      received their diadems from the lieutenants of Caesar. One of</a>
<a id='line_1864'>      these lieutenants, the eloquent and philosophic Arrian, surveyed,</a>
<a id='line_1865'>      and has described, the Euxine coast, under the reign of Hadrian.</a>
<a id='line_1866'>      The garrison which he reviewed at the mouth of the Phasis</a>
<a id='line_1867'>      consisted of four hundred chosen legionaries; the brick walls and</a>
<a id='line_1868'>      towers, the double ditch, and the military engines on the</a>
<a id='line_1869'>      rampart, rendered this place inaccessible to the Barbarians: but</a>
<a id='line_1870'>      the new suburbs which had been built by the merchants and</a>
<a id='line_1871'>      veterans, required, in the opinion of Arrian, some external</a>
<a id='line_1872'>      defence. 80 As the strength of the empire was gradually impaired,</a>
<a id='line_1873'>      the Romans stationed on the Phasis were neither withdrawn nor</a>
<a id='line_1874'>      expelled; and the tribe of the Lazi, 81 whose posterity speak a</a>
<a id='line_1875'>      foreign dialect, and inhabit the sea coast of Trebizond, imposed</a>
<a id='line_1876'>      their name and dominion on the ancient kingdom of Colchos. Their</a>
<a id='line_1877'>      independence was soon invaded by a formidable neighbor, who had</a>
<a id='line_1878'>      acquired, by arms and treaties, the sovereignty of Iberia. The</a>
<a id='line_1879'>      dependent king of Lazica received his sceptre at the hands of the</a>
<a id='line_1880'>      Persian monarch, and the successors of Constantine acquiesced in</a>
<a id='line_1881'>      this injurious claim, which was proudly urged as a right of</a>
<a id='line_1882'>      immemorial prescription. In the beginning of the sixth century,</a>
<a id='line_1883'>      their influence was restored by the introduction of Christianity,</a>
<a id='line_1884'>      which the Mingrelians still profess with becoming zeal, without</a>
<a id='line_1885'>      understanding the doctrines, or observing the precepts, of their</a>
<a id='line_1886'>      religion. After the decease of his father, Zathus was exalted to</a>
<a id='line_1887'>      the regal dignity by the favor of the great king; but the pious</a>
<a id='line_1888'>      youth abhorred the ceremonies of the Magi, and sought, in the</a>
<a id='line_1889'>      palace of Constantinople, an orthodox baptism, a noble wife, and</a>
<a id='line_1890'>      the alliance of the emperor Justin. The king of Lazica was</a>

<a id='line_1987'>      had humbled before the footstool of his throne. The adoration of</a>
<a id='line_1988'>      fire was introduced into Colchos by the zeal of the Magi: their</a>
<a id='line_1989'>      intolerant spirit provoked the fervor of a Christian people; and</a>

<a id='line_2028'>      The siege of Petra, which the Roman general, with the aid of the</a>
<a id='line_2029'>      Lazi, immediately undertook, is one of the most remarkable</a>
<a id='line_2030'>      actions of the age. The city was seated on a craggy rock, which</a>
<a id='line_2031'>      hung over the sea, and communicated by a steep and narrow path</a>
<a id='line_2032'>      with the land. Since the approach was difficult, the attack might</a>
<a id='line_2033'>      be deemed impossible: the Persian conqueror had strengthened the</a>
<a id='line_2034'>      fortifications of Justinian; and the places least inaccessible</a>
<a id='line_2035'>      were covered by additional bulwarks. In this important fortress,</a>
<a id='line_2036'>      the vigilance of Chosroes had deposited a magazine of offensive</a>
<a id='line_2037'>      and defensive arms, sufficient for five times the number, not</a>
<a id='line_2038'>      only of the garrison, but of the besiegers themselves. The stock</a>
<a id='line_2039'>      of flour and salt provisions was adequate to the consumption of</a>
<a id='line_2040'>      five years; the want of wine was supplied by vinegar; and of</a>
<a id='line_2041'>      grain from whence a strong liquor was extracted, and a triple</a>
<a id='line_2042'>      aqueduct eluded the diligence, and even the suspicions, of the</a>
<a id='line_2043'>      enemy. But the firmest defence of Petra was placed in the valor</a>
<a id='line_2044'>      of fifteen hundred Persians, who resisted the assaults of the</a>
<a id='line_2045'>      Romans, whilst, in a softer vein of earth, a mine was secretly</a>
<a id='line_2046'>      perforated. The wall, supported by slender and temporary props,</a>
<a id='line_2047'>      hung tottering in the air; but Dagisteus delayed the attack till</a>
<a id='line_2048'>      he had secured a specific recompense; and the town was relieved</a>
<a id='line_2049'>      before the return of his messenger from Constantinople. The</a>
<a id='line_2050'>      Persian garrison was reduced to four hundred men, of whom no more</a>
<a id='line_2051'>      than fifty were exempt from sickness or wounds; yet such had been</a>
<a id='line_2052'>      their inflexible perseverance, that they concealed their losses</a>
<a id='line_2053'>      from the enemy, by enduring, without a murmur, the sight and</a>
<a id='line_2054'>      putrefying stench of the dead bodies of their eleven hundred</a>
<a id='line_2055'>      companions. After their deliverance, the breaches were hastily</a>
<a id='line_2056'>      stopped with sand-bags; the mine was replenished with earth; a</a>
<a id='line_2057'>      new wall was erected on a frame of substantial timber; and a</a>
<a id='line_2058'>      fresh garrison of three thousand men was stationed at Petra to</a>
<a id='line_2059'>      sustain the labors of a second siege. The operations, both of the</a>
<a id='line_2060'>      attack and defence, were conducted with skilful obstinacy; and</a>
<a id='line_2061'>      each party derived useful lessons from the experience of their</a>
<a id='line_2062'>      past faults. A battering-ram was invented, of light construction</a>
<a id='line_2063'>      and powerful effect: it was transported and worked by the hands</a>
<a id='line_2064'>      of forty soldiers; and as the stones were loosened by its</a>
<a id='line_2065'>      repeated strokes, they were torn with long iron hooks from the</a>
<a id='line_2066'>      wall. From those walls, a shower of darts was incessantly poured</a>
<a id='line_2067'>      on the heads of the assailants; but they were most dangerously</a>
<a id='line_2068'>      annoyed by a fiery composition of sulphur and bitumen, which in</a>
<a id='line_2069'>      Colchos might with some propriety be named the oil of Medea. Of</a>
<a id='line_2070'>      six thousand Romans who mounted the scaling-ladders, their</a>
<a id='line_2071'>      general Bessas was the first, a gallant veteran of seventy years</a>
<a id='line_2072'>      of age: the courage of their leader, his fall, and extreme</a>
<a id='line_2073'>      danger, animated the irresistible effort of his troops; and their</a>
<a id='line_2074'>      prevailing numbers oppressed the strength, without subduing the</a>
<a id='line_2075'>      spirit, of the Persian garrison. The fate of these valiant men</a>
<a id='line_2076'>      deserves to be more distinctly noticed. Seven hundred had</a>
<a id='line_2077'>      perished in the siege, two thousand three hundred survived to</a>
<a id='line_2078'>      defend the breach. One thousand and seventy were destroyed with</a>
<a id='line_2079'>      fire and sword in the last assault; and if seven hundred and</a>
<a id='line_2080'>      thirty were made prisoners, only eighteen among them were found</a>
<a id='line_2081'>      without the marks of honorable wounds. The remaining five hundred</a>
<a id='line_2082'>      escaped into the citadel, which they maintained without any hopes</a>
<a id='line_2083'>      of relief, rejecting the fairest terms of capitulation and</a>
<a id='line_2084'>      service, till they were lost in the flames. They died in</a>
<a id='line_2085'>      obedience to the commands of their prince; and such examples of</a>
<a id='line_2086'>      loyalty and valor might excite their countrymen to deeds of equal</a>
<a id='line_2087'>      despair and more prosperous event. The instant demolition of the</a>
<a id='line_2088'>      works of Petra confessed the astonishment and apprehension of the</a>
<a id='line_2089'>      conqueror. A Spartan would have praised and pitied the virtue of</a>
<a id='line_2090'>      these heroic slaves; but the tedious warfare and alternate</a>
<a id='line_2091'>      success of the Roman and Persian arms cannot detain the attention</a>
<a id='line_2092'>      of posterity at the foot of Mount Caucasus. The advantages</a>
<a id='line_2093'>      obtained by the troops of Justinian were more frequent and</a>
<a id='line_2094'>      splendid; but the forces of the great king were continually</a>
<a id='line_2095'>      supplied, till they amounted to eight elephants and seventy</a>
<a id='line_2096'>      thousand men, including twelve thousand Scythian allies, and</a>
<a id='line_2097'>      above three thousand Dilemites, who descended by their free</a>
<a id='line_2098'>      choice from the hills of Hyrcania, and were equally formidable in</a>
<a id='line_2099'>      close or in distant combat. The siege of Archaeopolis, a name</a>
<a id='line_2100'>      imposed or corrupted by the Greeks, was raised with some loss and</a>
<a id='line_2101'>      precipitation; but the Persians occupied the passes of Iberia:</a>
<a id='line_2102'>      Colchos was enslaved by their forts and garrisons; they devoured</a>
<a id='line_2103'>      the scanty sustenance of the people; and the prince of the Lazi</a>
<a id='line_2104'>      fled into the mountains. In the Roman camp, faith and discipline</a>
<a id='line_2105'>      were unknown; and the independent leaders, who were invested with</a>
<a id='line_2106'>      equal power, disputed with each other the preeminence of vice and</a>
<a id='line_2107'>      corruption. The Persians followed, without a murmur, the commands</a>
<a id='line_2108'>      of a single chief, who implicitly obeyed the instructions of</a>
<a id='line_2109'>      their supreme lord. Their general was distinguished among the</a>
<a id='line_2110'>      heroes of the East by his wisdom in council, and his valor in the</a>
<a id='line_2111'>      field. The advanced age of Mermeroes, and the lameness of both</a>
<a id='line_2112'>      his feet, could not diminish the activity of his mind, or even of</a>
<a id='line_2113'>      his body; and, whilst he was carried in a litter in the front of</a>
<a id='line_2114'>      battle, he inspired terror to the enemy, and a just confidence to</a>
<a id='line_2115'>      the troops, who, under his banners, were always successful. After</a>
<a id='line_2116'>      his death, the command devolved to Nacoragan, a proud satrap,</a>
<a id='line_2117'>      who, in a conference with the Imperial chiefs, had presumed to</a>
<a id='line_2118'>      declare that he disposed of victory as absolutely as of the ring</a>
<a id='line_2119'>      on his finger. Such presumption was the natural cause and</a>
<a id='line_2120'>      forerunner of a shameful defeat. The Romans had been gradually</a>
<a id='line_2121'>      repulsed to the edge of the sea-shore; and their last camp, on</a>
<a id='line_2122'>      the ruins of the Grecian colony of Phasis, was defended on all</a>
<a id='line_2123'>      sides by strong intrenchments, the river, the Euxine, and a fleet</a>
<a id='line_2124'>      of galleys. Despair united their counsels and invigorated their</a>
<a id='line_2125'>      arms: they withstood the assault of the Persians and the flight</a>
<a id='line_2126'>      of Nacoragan preceded or followed the slaughter of ten thousand</a>
<a id='line_2127'>      of his bravest soldiers. He escaped from the Romans to fall into</a>
<a id='line_2128'>      the hands of an unforgiving master who severely chastised the</a>
<a id='line_2129'>      error of his own choice: the unfortunate general was flayed</a>
<a id='line_2130'>      alive, and his skin, stuffed into the human form, was exposed on</a>
<a id='line_2131'>      a mountain; a dreadful warning to those who might hereafter be</a>
<a id='line_2132'>      intrusted with the fame and fortune of Persia. 86 Yet the</a>
<a id='line_2133'>      prudence of Chosroes insensibly relinquished the prosecution of</a>
<a id='line_2134'>      the Colchian war, in the just persuasion, that it is impossible</a>
<a id='line_2135'>      to reduce, or, at least, to hold a distant country against the</a>
<a id='line_2136'>      wishes and efforts of its inhabitants. The fidelity of Gubazes</a>
<a id='line_2137'>      sustained the most rigorous trials. He patiently endured the</a>
<a id='line_2138'>      hardships of a savage life, and rejected with disdain, the</a>
<a id='line_2139'>      specious temptations of the Persian court. 8611 The king of the</a>
<a id='line_2140'>      Lazi had been educated in the Christian religion; his mother was</a>
<a id='line_2141'>      the daughter of a senator; during his youth he had served ten</a>
<a id='line_2142'>      years a silentiary of the Byzantine palace, 87 and the arrears of</a>
<a id='line_2143'>      an unpaid salary were a motive of attachment as well as of</a>
<a id='line_2144'>      complaint. But the long continuance of his sufferings extorted</a>
<a id='line_2145'>      from him a naked representation of the truth; and truth was an</a>
<a id='line_2146'>      unpardonable libel on the lieutenants of Justinian, who, amidst</a>
<a id='line_2147'>      the delays of a ruinous war, had spared his enemies and trampled</a>
<a id='line_2148'>      on his allies. Their malicious information persuaded the emperor</a>
<a id='line_2149'>      that his faithless vassal already meditated a second defection:</a>
<a id='line_2150'>      an order was surprised to send him prisoner to Constantinople; a</a>
<a id='line_2151'>      treacherous clause was inserted, that he might be lawfully killed</a>
<a id='line_2152'>      in case of resistance; and Gubazes, without arms, or suspicion of</a>
<a id='line_2153'>      danger, was stabbed in the security of a friendly interview. In</a>
<a id='line_2154'>      the first moments of rage and despair, the Colchians would have</a>
<a id='line_2155'>      sacrificed their country and religion to the gratification of</a>
<a id='line_2156'>      revenge. But the authority and eloquence of the wiser few</a>
<a id='line_2157'>      obtained a salutary pause: the victory of the Phasis restored the</a>

<a id='line_2233'>      diligently composed in the Greek and Persian languages, and</a>
<a id='line_2234'>      attested by the seals of twelve interpreters. The liberty of</a>

<a id='line_2307'>      sanctified by religious zeal. The Jews, powerful and active in</a>

<a id='line_2312'>      honored with the crown of martyrdom. 98 The churches of Arabia</a>
<a id='line_2313'>      implored the protection of the Abyssinian monarch. The Negus</a>
<a id='line_2314'>      passed the Red Sea with a fleet and army, deprived the Jewish</a>
<a id='line_2315'>      proselyte of his kingdom and life, and extinguished a race of</a>
<a id='line_2316'>      princes, who had ruled above two thousand years the sequestered</a>
<a id='line_2317'>      region of myrrh and frankincense. The conqueror immediately</a>
<a id='line_2318'>      announced the victory of the gospel, requested an orthodox</a>
<a id='line_2319'>      patriarch, and so warmly professed his friendship to the Roman</a>

<a id='line_2321'>      silk trade through the channel of Abyssinia, and of exciting the</a>
<a id='line_2322'>      forces of Arabia against the Persian king. Nonnosus, descended</a>
<a id='line_2323'>      from a family of ambassadors, was named by the emperor to execute</a>
<a id='line_2324'>      this important commission. He wisely declined the shorter, but</a>

<a id='line_2326'>      ascended the Nile, embarked on the Red Sea, and safely landed at</a>

<a id='line_2328'>      Axume is no more than fifty leagues, in a direct line; but the</a>
<a id='line_2329'>      winding passes of the mountains detained the ambassador fifteen</a>
<a id='line_2330'>      days; and as he traversed the forests, he saw, and vaguely</a>
<a id='line_2331'>      computed, about five thousand wild elephants. The capital,</a>
<a id='line_2332'>      according to his report, was large and populous; and the village</a>
<a id='line_2333'>      of Axume is still conspicuous by the regal coronations, by the</a>
<a id='line_2334'>      ruins of a Christian temple, and by sixteen or seventeen obelisks</a>
<a id='line_2335'>      inscribed with Grecian characters. 99 But the Negus 9911 gave</a>
<a id='line_2336'>      audience in the open field, seated on a lofty chariot, which was</a>
<a id='line_2337'>      drawn by four elephants, superbly caparisoned, and surrounded by</a>
<a id='line_2338'>      his nobles and musicians. He was clad in a linen garment and cap,</a>
<a id='line_2339'>      holding in his hand two javelins and a light shield; and,</a>
<a id='line_2340'>      although his nakedness was imperfectly covered, he displayed the</a>
<a id='line_2341'>      Barbaric pomp of gold chains, collars, and bracelets, richly</a>
<a id='line_2342'>      adorned with pearls and precious stones. The ambassador of</a>
<a id='line_2343'>      Justinian knelt; the Negus raised him from the ground, embraced</a>
<a id='line_2344'>      Nonnosus, kissed the seal, perused the letter, accepted the Roman</a>
<a id='line_2345'>      alliance, and, brandishing his weapons, denounced implacable war</a>
<a id='line_2346'>      against the worshipers of fire. But the proposal of the silk</a>
<a id='line_2347'>      trade was eluded; and notwithstanding the assurances, and perhaps</a>
<a id='line_2348'>      the wishes, of the Abyssinians, these hostile menaces evaporated</a>
<a id='line_2349'>      without effect. The Homerites were unwilling to abandon their</a>
<a id='line_2350'>      aromatic groves, to explore a sandy desert, and to encounter,</a>
<a id='line_2351'>      after all their fatigues, a formidable nation from whom they had</a>
<a id='line_2352'>      never received any personal injuries. Instead of enlarging his</a>
<a id='line_2353'>      conquests, the king of Aethiopia was incapable of defending his</a>
<a id='line_2354'>      possessions. Abrahah, 9912 the slave of a Roman merchant of</a>
<a id='line_2355'>      Adulis, assumed the sceptre of the Homerites,; the troops of</a>
<a id='line_2356'>      Africa were seduced by the luxury of the climate; and Justinian</a>
<a id='line_2357'>      solicited the friendship of the usurper, who honored with a</a>
<a id='line_2358'>      slight tribute the supremacy of his prince. After a long series</a>
<a id='line_2359'>      of prosperity, the power of Abrahah was overthrown before the</a>
<a id='line_2360'>      gates of Mecca; and his children were despoiled by the Persian</a>
<a id='line_2361'>      conqueror; and the Aethiopians were finally expelled from the</a>
