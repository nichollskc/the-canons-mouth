<a id='line_10'>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE</a>
<a id='line_11'>HENRY WRIOTHESLEY,  EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON,</a>
<a id='line_12'>and Baron of Titchfield.</a>
<a id='line_13'></a>
<a id='line_14'>Right Honourable, I know not how I shall offend in dedicating my</a>
<a id='line_15'>unpolished lines to your lordship, nor how the world will censure me</a>
<a id='line_16'>for choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a burthen: only, if</a>
<a id='line_17'>your honour seem but pleased, I account myself highly praised, and vow</a>
<a id='line_18'>to take advantage of all idle hours, till I have honoured you with some</a>
<a id='line_19'>graver labour. But if the first heir of my invention prove deformed, I</a>
<a id='line_20'>shall be sorry it had so noble a godfather, and never after ear so</a>
<a id='line_21'>barren a land, for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest. I leave it</a>
<a id='line_22'>to your honourable survey, and your honour to your heart’s content;</a>
<a id='line_23'>which I wish may always answer your own wish and the world’s hopeful</a>
<a id='line_24'>expectation.</a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'>Your honour’s in all duty,</a>

<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'> VENUS AND ADONIS</a>
<a id='line_35'></a>
<a id='line_36'>Even as the sun with purple-colour’d face</a>
<a id='line_37'>Had ta’en his last leave of the weeping morn,</a>
<a id='line_38'>Rose-cheek’d Adonis tried him to the chase;</a>
<a id='line_39'>Hunting he lov’d, but love he laugh’d to scorn;        4</a>
<a id='line_40'>  Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,</a>
<a id='line_41'>  And like a bold-fac’d suitor ’gins to woo him.</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>“Thrice fairer than myself,” thus she began,</a>
<a id='line_44'>“The field’s chief flower, sweet above compare,        8</a>
<a id='line_45'>Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,</a>
<a id='line_46'>More white and red than doves or roses are:</a>
<a id='line_47'>  Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,</a>
<a id='line_48'>  Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.     12</a>
<a id='line_49'></a>
<a id='line_50'>“Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed,</a>
<a id='line_51'>And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;</a>
<a id='line_52'>If thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed</a>
<a id='line_53'>A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know:             16</a>
<a id='line_54'>  Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses,</a>
<a id='line_55'>  And being set, I’ll smother thee with kisses.</a>
<a id='line_56'></a>
<a id='line_57'>“And yet not cloy thy lips with loath’d satiety,</a>
<a id='line_58'>But rather famish them amid their plenty,             20</a>
<a id='line_59'>Making them red, and pale, with fresh variety:</a>
<a id='line_60'>Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty:</a>
<a id='line_61'>  A summer’s day will seem an hour but short,</a>
<a id='line_62'>  Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.”         24</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>With this she seizeth on his sweating palm,</a>
<a id='line_65'>The precedent of pith and livelihood,</a>
<a id='line_66'>And trembling in her passion, calls it balm,</a>
<a id='line_67'>Earth’s sovereign salve to do a goddess good:         28</a>
<a id='line_68'>  Being so enrag’d, desire doth lend her force</a>
<a id='line_69'>  Courageously to pluck him from his horse.</a>
<a id='line_70'></a>
<a id='line_71'>Over one arm the lusty courser’s rein,</a>
<a id='line_72'>Under her other was the tender boy,                   32</a>
<a id='line_73'>Who blush’d and pouted in a dull disdain,</a>
<a id='line_74'>With leaden appetite, unapt to toy;</a>
<a id='line_75'>  She red and hot as coals of glowing fire,</a>
<a id='line_76'>  He red for shame, but frosty in desire.             36</a>
<a id='line_77'></a>
<a id='line_78'>The studded bridle on a ragged bough</a>
<a id='line_79'>Nimbly she fastens;—O! how quick is love!—</a>
<a id='line_80'>The steed is stalled up, and even now</a>
<a id='line_81'>To tie the rider she begins to prove:                 40</a>
<a id='line_82'>  Backward she push’d him, as she would be thrust,</a>
<a id='line_83'>  And govern’d him in strength, though not in lust.</a>
<a id='line_84'></a>
<a id='line_85'>So soon was she along, as he was down,</a>
<a id='line_86'>Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:          44</a>
<a id='line_87'>Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,</a>
<a id='line_88'>And ’gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips,</a>
<a id='line_89'>  And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,</a>
<a id='line_90'>  “If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.”    48</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>He burns with bashful shame, she with her tears</a>
<a id='line_93'>Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks;</a>
<a id='line_94'>Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs</a>
<a id='line_95'>To fan and blow them dry again she seeks.             52</a>
<a id='line_96'>  He saith she is immodest, blames her miss;</a>
<a id='line_97'>  What follows more, she murders with a kiss.</a>
<a id='line_98'></a>
<a id='line_99'>Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,</a>
<a id='line_100'>Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone,      56</a>
<a id='line_101'>Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,</a>
<a id='line_102'>Till either gorge be stuff’d or prey be gone:</a>
<a id='line_103'>  Even so she kiss’d his brow, his cheek, his chin,</a>
<a id='line_104'>  And where she ends she doth anew begin.             60</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>Forc’d to content, but never to obey,</a>
<a id='line_107'>Panting he lies, and breatheth in her face.</a>
<a id='line_108'>She feedeth on the steam, as on a prey,</a>
<a id='line_109'>And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace,         64</a>
<a id='line_110'>  Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers</a>
<a id='line_111'>  So they were dew’d with such distilling showers.</a>
<a id='line_112'></a>
<a id='line_113'>Look how a bird lies tangled in a net,</a>
<a id='line_114'>So fasten’d in her arms Adonis lies;                  68</a>
<a id='line_115'>Pure shame and aw’d resistance made him fret,</a>
<a id='line_116'>Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes:</a>
<a id='line_117'>  Rain added to a river that is rank</a>
<a id='line_118'>  Perforce will force it overflow the bank.           72</a>
<a id='line_119'></a>
<a id='line_120'>Still she entreats, and prettily entreats,</a>
<a id='line_121'>For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale.</a>
<a id='line_122'>Still is he sullen, still he lours and frets,</a>
<a id='line_123'>’Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy pale;             76</a>
<a id='line_124'>  Being red she loves him best, and being white,</a>
<a id='line_125'>  Her best is better’d with a more delight.</a>
<a id='line_126'></a>
<a id='line_127'>Look how he can, she cannot choose but love;</a>
<a id='line_128'>And by her fair immortal hand she swears,             80</a>
<a id='line_129'>From his soft bosom never to remove,</a>
<a id='line_130'>Till he take truce with her contending tears,</a>
<a id='line_131'>  Which long have rain’d, making her cheeks all wet;</a>
<a id='line_132'>  And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt.</a>
<a id='line_133'></a>
<a id='line_134'>Upon this promise did he raise his chin,               85</a>
<a id='line_135'>Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave,</a>
<a id='line_136'>Who, being look’d on, ducks as quickly in;</a>
<a id='line_137'>So offers he to give what she did crave,               88</a>
<a id='line_138'>  But when her lips were ready for his pay,</a>
<a id='line_139'>  He winks, and turns his lips another way.</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>Never did passenger in summer’s heat</a>
<a id='line_142'>More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.    92</a>
<a id='line_143'>Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;</a>
<a id='line_144'>She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn:</a>
<a id='line_145'>  “O! pity,” ’gan she cry, “flint-hearted boy,</a>
<a id='line_146'>  ’Tis but a kiss I beg; why art thou coy?            96</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>“I have been woo’d as I entreat thee now,</a>
<a id='line_149'>Even by the stern and direful god of war,</a>
<a id='line_150'>Whose sinewy neck in battle ne’er did bow,</a>
<a id='line_151'>Who conquers where he comes in every jar;             100</a>
<a id='line_152'>  Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,</a>
<a id='line_153'>  And begg’d for that which thou unask’d shalt have.</a>
<a id='line_154'></a>
<a id='line_155'>“Over my altars hath he hung his lance,</a>
<a id='line_156'>His batter’d shield, his uncontrolled crest,          104</a>
<a id='line_157'>And for my sake hath learn’d to sport and dance,</a>
<a id='line_158'>To toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and jest;</a>
<a id='line_159'>  Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red</a>
<a id='line_160'>  Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.         108</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>“Thus he that overrul’d I oversway’d,</a>
<a id='line_163'>Leading him prisoner in a red rose chain:</a>
<a id='line_164'>Strong-temper’d steel his stronger strength obey’d,</a>
<a id='line_165'>Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.                112</a>
<a id='line_166'>  Oh be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,</a>
<a id='line_167'>  For mast’ring her that foil’d the god of fight.</a>
<a id='line_168'></a>
<a id='line_169'>“Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine,</a>
<a id='line_170'>Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red,        116</a>
<a id='line_171'>The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine:</a>
<a id='line_172'>What see’st thou in the ground? hold up thy head,</a>
<a id='line_173'>  Look in mine eyeballs, there thy beauty lies;</a>
<a id='line_174'>  Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?     120</a>
<a id='line_175'></a>
<a id='line_176'>“Art thou asham’d to kiss? then wink again,</a>
<a id='line_177'>And I will wink; so shall the day seem night.</a>
<a id='line_178'>Love keeps his revels where there are but twain;</a>
<a id='line_179'>Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight,          124</a>
<a id='line_180'>  These blue-vein’d violets whereon we lean</a>
<a id='line_181'>  Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.</a>
<a id='line_182'></a>
<a id='line_183'>“The tender spring upon thy tempting lip             127</a>
<a id='line_184'>Shows thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted,</a>
<a id='line_185'>Make use of time, let not advantage slip;</a>
<a id='line_186'>Beauty within itself should not be wasted,</a>
<a id='line_187'>  Fair flowers that are not gather’d in their prime</a>
<a id='line_188'>  Rot, and consume themselves in little time.         132</a>
<a id='line_189'></a>
<a id='line_190'>“Were I hard-favour’d, foul, or wrinkled old,</a>
<a id='line_191'>Ill-nurtur’d, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,</a>
<a id='line_192'>O’erworn, despised, rheumatic, and cold,</a>
<a id='line_193'>Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice,      136</a>
<a id='line_194'>  Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee;</a>
<a id='line_195'>  But having no defects, why dost abhor me?</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>“Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow,           139</a>
<a id='line_198'>Mine eyes are grey and bright, and quick in turning;</a>
<a id='line_199'>My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow,</a>
<a id='line_200'>My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning,</a>
<a id='line_201'>  My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,</a>
<a id='line_202'>  Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.       144</a>
<a id='line_203'></a>
<a id='line_204'>“Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,</a>
<a id='line_205'>Or like a fairy, trip upon the green,</a>
<a id='line_206'>Or like a nymph, with long dishevell’d hair,</a>
<a id='line_207'>Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen.         148</a>
<a id='line_208'>  Love is a spirit all compact of fire,</a>
<a id='line_209'>  Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.</a>
<a id='line_210'></a>
<a id='line_211'>“Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie:           151</a>
<a id='line_212'>These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;</a>
<a id='line_213'>Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,</a>
<a id='line_214'>From morn till night, even where I list to sport me.</a>
<a id='line_215'>  Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be</a>
<a id='line_216'>  That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee?       156</a>
<a id='line_217'></a>
<a id='line_218'>“Is thine own heart to thine own face affected?</a>
<a id='line_219'>Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?</a>
<a id='line_220'>Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected,</a>
<a id='line_221'>Steal thine own freedom, and complain on theft.      160</a>
<a id='line_222'>  Narcissus so himself himself forsook,</a>
<a id='line_223'>  And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.</a>
<a id='line_224'></a>
<a id='line_225'>“Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,</a>
<a id='line_226'>Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,         164</a>
<a id='line_227'>Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear;</a>
<a id='line_228'>Things growing to themselves are growth’s abuse,</a>
<a id='line_229'>  Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty breedeth beauty;</a>
<a id='line_230'>  Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty.            168</a>
<a id='line_231'></a>
<a id='line_232'>“Upon the earth’s increase why shouldst thou feed,</a>
<a id='line_233'>Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?</a>
<a id='line_234'>By law of nature thou art bound to breed,</a>
<a id='line_235'>That thine may live when thou thyself art dead;      172</a>
<a id='line_236'>  And so in spite of death thou dost survive,</a>
<a id='line_237'>  In that thy likeness still is left alive.”</a>
<a id='line_238'></a>
<a id='line_239'>By this the love-sick queen began to sweat,</a>
<a id='line_240'>For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,      176</a>
<a id='line_241'>And Titan, tired in the midday heat,</a>
<a id='line_242'>With burning eye did hotly overlook them,</a>
<a id='line_243'>  Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,</a>
<a id='line_244'>  So he were like him and by Venus’ side.            180</a>
<a id='line_245'></a>
<a id='line_246'>And now Adonis with a lazy spright,</a>
<a id='line_247'>And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,</a>
<a id='line_248'>His louring brows o’erwhelming his fair sight,</a>
<a id='line_249'>Like misty vapours when they blot the sky,           184</a>
<a id='line_250'>  Souring his cheeks, cries, “Fie, no more of love:</a>
<a id='line_251'>  The sun doth burn my face; I must remove.”</a>
<a id='line_252'></a>
<a id='line_253'>“Ay me,” quoth Venus, “young, and so unkind!</a>
<a id='line_254'>What bare excuses mak’st thou to be gone!            188</a>
<a id='line_255'>I’ll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind</a>
<a id='line_256'>Shall cool the heat of this descending sun:</a>
<a id='line_257'>  I’ll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;</a>
<a id='line_258'>  If they burn too, I’ll quench them with my tears.  192</a>
<a id='line_259'></a>
<a id='line_260'>“The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,</a>
<a id='line_261'>And lo I lie between that sun and thee:</a>
<a id='line_262'>The heat I have from thence doth little harm,</a>
<a id='line_263'>Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me;      196</a>
<a id='line_264'>  And were I not immortal, life were done,</a>
<a id='line_265'>  Between this heavenly and earthly sun.</a>
<a id='line_266'></a>
<a id='line_267'>“Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel?</a>
<a id='line_268'>Nay more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth:    200</a>
<a id='line_269'>Art thou a woman’s son and canst not feel</a>
<a id='line_270'>What ’tis to love, how want of love tormenteth?</a>
<a id='line_271'>  O had thy mother borne so hard a mind,</a>
<a id='line_272'>  She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.   204</a>
<a id='line_273'></a>
<a id='line_274'>“What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this?</a>
<a id='line_275'>Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?</a>
<a id='line_276'>What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?</a>
<a id='line_277'>Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:  208</a>
<a id='line_278'>  Give me one kiss, I’ll give it thee again,</a>
<a id='line_279'>  And one for int’rest, if thou wilt have twain.</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>“Fie, lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone,</a>
<a id='line_282'>Well-painted idol, image dull and dead,              212</a>
<a id='line_283'>Statue contenting but the eye alone,</a>
<a id='line_284'>Thing like a man, but of no woman bred:</a>
<a id='line_285'>  Thou art no man, though of a man’s complexion,</a>
<a id='line_286'>  For men will kiss even by their own direction.”    216</a>
<a id='line_287'></a>
<a id='line_288'>This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,</a>
<a id='line_289'>And swelling passion doth provoke a pause;</a>
<a id='line_290'>Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong;</a>
<a id='line_291'>Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause.     220</a>
<a id='line_292'>  And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,</a>
<a id='line_293'>  And now her sobs do her intendments break.</a>
<a id='line_294'></a>
<a id='line_295'>Sometimes she shakes her head, and then his hand,</a>
<a id='line_296'>Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground;            224</a>
<a id='line_297'>Sometimes her arms infold him like a band:</a>
<a id='line_298'>She would, he will not in her arms be bound;</a>
<a id='line_299'>  And when from thence he struggles to be gone,</a>
<a id='line_300'>  She locks her lily fingers one in one.             228</a>
<a id='line_301'></a>
<a id='line_302'>“Fondling,” she saith, “since I have hemm’d thee here</a>
<a id='line_303'>Within the circuit of this ivory pale,</a>
<a id='line_304'>I’ll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer;</a>
<a id='line_305'>Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale:        232</a>
<a id='line_306'>  Graze on my lips, and if those hills be dry,</a>
<a id='line_307'>  Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.</a>
<a id='line_308'></a>
<a id='line_309'>“Within this limit is relief enough,</a>
<a id='line_310'>Sweet bottom grass and high delightful plain,        236</a>
<a id='line_311'>Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,</a>
<a id='line_312'>To shelter thee from tempest and from rain:</a>
<a id='line_313'>  Then be my deer, since I am such a park,           239</a>
<a id='line_314'>  No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.”</a>
<a id='line_315'></a>
<a id='line_316'>At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,</a>
<a id='line_317'>That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple;</a>
<a id='line_318'>Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,</a>
<a id='line_319'>He might be buried in a tomb so simple;              244</a>
<a id='line_320'>  Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,</a>
<a id='line_321'>  Why there love liv’d, and there he could not die.</a>
<a id='line_322'></a>
<a id='line_323'>These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,</a>
<a id='line_324'>Open’d their mouths to swallow Venus’ liking.        248</a>
<a id='line_325'>Being mad before, how doth she now for wits?</a>
<a id='line_326'>Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking?</a>
<a id='line_327'>  Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,</a>
<a id='line_328'>  To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!      252</a>
<a id='line_329'></a>
<a id='line_330'>Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?</a>
<a id='line_331'>Her words are done, her woes the more increasing;</a>
<a id='line_332'>The time is spent, her object will away,</a>
<a id='line_333'>And from her twining arms doth urge releasing:       256</a>
<a id='line_334'>  “Pity,” she cries; “some favour, some remorse!”</a>
<a id='line_335'>  Away he springs, and hasteth to his horse.</a>
<a id='line_336'></a>
<a id='line_337'>But lo from forth a copse that neighbours by,</a>
<a id='line_338'>A breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud,          260</a>
<a id='line_339'>Adonis’ tramping courser doth espy,</a>
<a id='line_340'>And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud:</a>
<a id='line_341'>  The strong-neck’d steed, being tied unto a tree,</a>
<a id='line_342'>  Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.    264</a>
<a id='line_343'></a>
<a id='line_344'>Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,</a>
<a id='line_345'>And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;</a>
<a id='line_346'>The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,</a>
<a id='line_347'>Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven’s thunder;</a>
<a id='line_348'>  The iron bit he crusheth ’tween his teeth,         269</a>
<a id='line_349'>  Controlling what he was controlled with.</a>
<a id='line_350'></a>
<a id='line_351'>His ears up-prick’d; his braided hanging mane</a>
<a id='line_352'>Upon his compass’d crest now stand on end;           272</a>
<a id='line_353'>His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,</a>
<a id='line_354'>As from a furnace, vapours doth he send:</a>
<a id='line_355'>  His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,</a>
<a id='line_356'>  Shows his hot courage and his high desire.         276</a>
<a id='line_357'></a>
<a id='line_358'>Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps,</a>
<a id='line_359'>With gentle majesty and modest pride;</a>
<a id='line_360'>Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,</a>
<a id='line_361'>As who should say, “Lo thus my strength is tried;</a>
<a id='line_362'>  And this I do to captivate the eye                 281</a>
<a id='line_363'>  Of the fair breeder that is standing by.”</a>
<a id='line_364'></a>
<a id='line_365'>What recketh he his rider’s angry stir,</a>
<a id='line_366'>His flattering “Holla”, or his “Stand, I say”?       284</a>
<a id='line_367'>What cares he now for curb or pricking spur?</a>
<a id='line_368'>For rich caparisons or trappings gay?</a>
<a id='line_369'>  He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,</a>
<a id='line_370'>  Nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees.      288</a>
<a id='line_371'></a>
<a id='line_372'>Look when a painter would surpass the life,</a>
<a id='line_373'>In limning out a well-proportion’d steed,</a>
<a id='line_374'>His art with nature’s workmanship at strife,</a>
<a id='line_375'>As if the dead the living should exceed:             292</a>
<a id='line_376'>  So did this horse excel a common one,</a>
<a id='line_377'>  In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone.</a>
<a id='line_378'></a>
<a id='line_379'>Round-hoof’d, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,</a>
<a id='line_380'>Broad breast, full eye, small head, and nostril wide,</a>
<a id='line_381'>High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,</a>
<a id='line_382'>Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:</a>
<a id='line_383'>  Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,</a>
<a id='line_384'>  Save a proud rider on so proud a back.             300</a>
<a id='line_385'></a>
<a id='line_386'>Sometimes he scuds far off, and there he stares;</a>
<a id='line_387'>Anon he starts at stirring of a feather:</a>
<a id='line_388'>To bid the wind a base he now prepares,</a>
<a id='line_389'>And where he run or fly they know not whether;       304</a>
<a id='line_390'>  For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,</a>
<a id='line_391'>  Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather’d wings.</a>
<a id='line_392'></a>
<a id='line_393'>He looks upon his love, and neighs unto her;</a>
<a id='line_394'>She answers him as if she knew his mind,             308</a>
<a id='line_395'>Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,</a>
<a id='line_396'>She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,</a>
<a id='line_397'>  Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,</a>
<a id='line_398'>  Beating his kind embracements with her heels.      312</a>
<a id='line_399'></a>
<a id='line_400'>Then like a melancholy malcontent,</a>
<a id='line_401'>He vails his tail that like a falling plume,</a>
<a id='line_402'>Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:</a>
<a id='line_403'>He stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume.     316</a>
<a id='line_404'>  His love, perceiving how he was enrag’d,</a>
<a id='line_405'>  Grew kinder, and his fury was assuag’d.</a>
<a id='line_406'></a>
<a id='line_407'>His testy master goeth about to take him,</a>
<a id='line_408'>When lo the unback’d breeder, full of fear,         320</a>
<a id='line_409'>Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,</a>
<a id='line_410'>With her the horse, and left Adonis there:</a>
<a id='line_411'>  As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,</a>
<a id='line_412'>  Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them.    324</a>
<a id='line_413'></a>
<a id='line_414'>All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits,</a>
<a id='line_415'>Banning his boisterous and unruly beast;</a>
<a id='line_416'>And now the happy season once more fits</a>
<a id='line_417'>That love-sick love by pleading may be blest;        328</a>
<a id='line_418'>  For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong,</a>
<a id='line_419'>  When it is barr’d the aidance of the tongue.</a>
<a id='line_420'></a>
<a id='line_421'>An oven that is stopp’d, or river stay’d,</a>
<a id='line_422'>Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage:         332</a>
<a id='line_423'>So of concealed sorrow may be said,</a>
<a id='line_424'>Free vent of words love’s fire doth assuage;</a>
<a id='line_425'>  But when the heart’s attorney once is mute,</a>
<a id='line_426'>  The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.       336</a>
<a id='line_427'></a>
<a id='line_428'>He sees her coming, and begins to glow,</a>
<a id='line_429'>Even as a dying coal revives with wind,</a>
<a id='line_430'>And with his bonnet hides his angry brow,</a>
<a id='line_431'>Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind,         340</a>
<a id='line_432'>  Taking no notice that she is so nigh,</a>
<a id='line_433'>  For all askance he holds her in his eye.</a>
<a id='line_434'></a>
<a id='line_435'>O what a sight it was, wistly to view</a>
<a id='line_436'>How she came stealing to the wayward boy,            344</a>
<a id='line_437'>To note the fighting conflict of her hue,</a>
<a id='line_438'>How white and red each other did destroy:</a>
<a id='line_439'>  But now her cheek was pale, and by and by</a>
<a id='line_440'>  It flash’d forth fire, as lightning from the sky.  348</a>
<a id='line_441'></a>
<a id='line_442'>Now was she just before him as he sat,</a>
<a id='line_443'>And like a lowly lover down she kneels;</a>
<a id='line_444'>With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat,</a>
<a id='line_445'>Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels:          352</a>
<a id='line_446'>  His tend’rer cheek receives her soft hand’s print,</a>
<a id='line_447'>  As apt as new-fall’n snow takes any dint.</a>
<a id='line_448'></a>
<a id='line_449'>Oh what a war of looks was then between them,</a>
<a id='line_450'>Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing,              356</a>
<a id='line_451'>His eyes saw her eyes, as they had not seen them,</a>
<a id='line_452'>Her eyes woo’d still, his eyes disdain’d the wooing:</a>
<a id='line_453'>  And all this dumb play had his acts made plain</a>
<a id='line_454'>  With tears, which, chorus-like, her eyes did rain.</a>
<a id='line_455'></a>
<a id='line_456'>Full gently now she takes him by the hand,           361</a>
<a id='line_457'>A lily prison’d in a gaol of snow,</a>
<a id='line_458'>Or ivory in an alabaster band,</a>
<a id='line_459'>So white a friend engirts so white a foe:            364</a>
<a id='line_460'>  This beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,</a>
<a id='line_461'>  Show’d like two silver doves that sit a-billing.</a>
<a id='line_462'></a>
<a id='line_463'>Once more the engine of her thoughts began:</a>
<a id='line_464'>“O fairest mover on this mortal round,               368</a>
<a id='line_465'>Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,</a>
<a id='line_466'>My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound,</a>
<a id='line_467'>  For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,</a>
<a id='line_468'>  Though nothing but my body’s bane would cure thee.”</a>
<a id='line_469'></a>
<a id='line_470'>“Give me my hand,” saith he, “why dost thou feel it?”</a>
<a id='line_471'>“Give me my heart,” saith she, “and thou shalt have it.</a>
<a id='line_472'>O give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it,</a>
<a id='line_473'>And being steel’d, soft sighs can never grave it.    376</a>
<a id='line_474'>  Then love’s deep groans I never shall regard,</a>
<a id='line_475'>  Because Adonis’ heart hath made mine hard.”</a>
<a id='line_476'></a>
<a id='line_477'>“For shame,” he cries, “let go, and let me go,</a>
<a id='line_478'>My day’s delight is past, my horse is gone,          380</a>
<a id='line_479'>And ’tis your fault I am bereft him so,</a>
<a id='line_480'>I pray you hence, and leave me here alone,</a>
<a id='line_481'>  For all my mind, my thought, my busy care,</a>
<a id='line_482'>  Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.”           384</a>
<a id='line_483'></a>
<a id='line_484'>Thus she replies: “Thy palfrey as he should,</a>
<a id='line_485'>Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire,</a>
<a id='line_486'>Affection is a coal that must be cool’d;</a>
<a id='line_487'>Else, suffer’d, it will set the heart on fire,       388</a>
<a id='line_488'>  The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none;</a>
<a id='line_489'>  Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.</a>
<a id='line_490'></a>
<a id='line_491'>“How like a jade he stood tied to the tree,</a>
<a id='line_492'>Servilely master’d with a leathern rein!             392</a>
<a id='line_493'>But when he saw his love, his youth’s fair fee,</a>
<a id='line_494'>He held such petty bondage in disdain;</a>
<a id='line_495'>  Throwing the base thong from his bending crest,</a>
<a id='line_496'>  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.     396</a>
<a id='line_497'></a>
<a id='line_498'>“Who sees his true-love in her naked bed,</a>
<a id='line_499'>Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,</a>
<a id='line_500'>But when his glutton eye so full hath fed,</a>
<a id='line_501'>His other agents aim at like delight?                400</a>
<a id='line_502'>  Who is so faint that dare not be so bold</a>
<a id='line_503'>  To touch the fire, the weather being cold?</a>
<a id='line_504'></a>
<a id='line_505'>“Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy,</a>
<a id='line_506'>And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee,           404</a>
<a id='line_507'>To take advantage on presented joy,</a>
<a id='line_508'>Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee.</a>
<a id='line_509'>  O learn to love, the lesson is but plain,</a>
<a id='line_510'>  And once made perfect, never lost again.”          408</a>
<a id='line_511'></a>
<a id='line_512'>“I know not love,” quoth he, “nor will not know it,</a>
<a id='line_513'>Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it;</a>
<a id='line_514'>’Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it;</a>
<a id='line_515'>My love to love is love but to disgrace it;          412</a>
<a id='line_516'>  For I have heard, it is a life in death,</a>
<a id='line_517'>  That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.</a>
<a id='line_518'></a>
<a id='line_519'>“Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish’d?</a>
<a id='line_520'>Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?        416</a>
<a id='line_521'>If springing things be any jot diminish’d,</a>
<a id='line_522'>They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth;</a>
<a id='line_523'>  The colt that’s back’d and burden’d being young,</a>
<a id='line_524'>  Loseth his pride, and never waxeth strong.         420</a>
<a id='line_525'></a>
<a id='line_526'>“You hurt my hand with wringing. Let us part,</a>
<a id='line_527'>And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat:</a>
<a id='line_528'>Remove your siege from my unyielding heart,</a>
<a id='line_529'>To love’s alarms it will not ope the gate:           424</a>
<a id='line_530'>  Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flatt’ry;</a>
<a id='line_531'>  For where a heart is hard they make no batt’ry.”</a>
<a id='line_532'></a>
<a id='line_533'>“What! canst thou talk?” quoth she, “hast thou a tongue?</a>
<a id='line_534'>O would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing;        428</a>
<a id='line_535'>Thy mermaid’s voice hath done me double wrong;</a>
<a id='line_536'>I had my load before, now press’d with bearing:</a>
<a id='line_537'>  Melodious discord, heavenly tune, harsh-sounding,</a>
<a id='line_538'>  Ear’s deep sweet music, and heart’s deep sore wounding.</a>
<a id='line_539'></a>
<a id='line_540'>“Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love          433</a>
<a id='line_541'>That inward beauty and invisible;</a>
<a id='line_542'>Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move</a>
<a id='line_543'>Each part in me that were but sensible:              436</a>
<a id='line_544'>  Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,</a>
<a id='line_545'>  Yet should I be in love by touching thee.</a>
<a id='line_546'></a>
<a id='line_547'>“Say that the sense of feeling were bereft me,</a>
<a id='line_548'>And that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch,       440</a>
<a id='line_549'>And nothing but the very smell were left me,</a>
<a id='line_550'>Yet would my love to thee be still as much;</a>
<a id='line_551'>  For from the stillitory of thy face excelling</a>
<a id='line_552'>  Comes breath perfum’d, that breedeth love by smelling.</a>
<a id='line_553'></a>
<a id='line_554'>“But oh what banquet wert thou to the taste,         445</a>
<a id='line_555'>Being nurse and feeder of the other four;</a>
<a id='line_556'>Would they not wish the feast might ever last,</a>
<a id='line_557'>And bid suspicion double-lock the door,</a>
<a id='line_558'>  Lest jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,</a>
<a id='line_559'>  Should by his stealing in disturb the feast?”      448</a>
<a id='line_560'></a>
<a id='line_561'>Once more the ruby-colour’d portal open’d,</a>
<a id='line_562'>Which to his speech did honey passage yield,         452</a>
<a id='line_563'>Like a red morn that ever yet betoken’d</a>
<a id='line_564'>Wrack to the seaman, tempest to the field,</a>
<a id='line_565'>  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,</a>
<a id='line_566'>  Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.      456</a>
<a id='line_567'></a>
<a id='line_568'>This ill presage advisedly she marketh:</a>
<a id='line_569'>Even as the wind is hush’d before it raineth,</a>
<a id='line_570'>Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh,</a>
<a id='line_571'>Or as the berry breaks before it staineth,           460</a>
<a id='line_572'>  Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,</a>
<a id='line_573'>  His meaning struck her ere his words begun.</a>
<a id='line_574'></a>
<a id='line_575'>And at his look she flatly falleth down</a>
<a id='line_576'>For looks kill love, and love by looks reviveth;     464</a>
<a id='line_577'>A smile recures the wounding of a frown;</a>
<a id='line_578'>But blessed bankrout, that by love so thriveth!</a>
<a id='line_579'>  The silly boy, believing she is dead,</a>
<a id='line_580'>  Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red.  468</a>
<a id='line_581'></a>
<a id='line_582'>And all amaz’d brake off his late intent,</a>
<a id='line_583'>For sharply he did think to reprehend her,</a>
<a id='line_584'>Which cunning love did wittily prevent:</a>
<a id='line_585'>Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her!       472</a>
<a id='line_586'>  For on the grass she lies as she were slain,</a>
<a id='line_587'>  Till his breath breatheth life in her again.</a>
<a id='line_588'></a>
<a id='line_589'>He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,</a>
<a id='line_590'>He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,         476</a>
<a id='line_591'>He chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks</a>
<a id='line_592'>To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr’d:</a>
<a id='line_593'>  He kisses her; and she, by her good will,</a>
<a id='line_594'>  Will never rise, so he will kiss her still.        480</a>
<a id='line_595'></a>
<a id='line_596'>The night of sorrow now is turn’d to day:</a>
<a id='line_597'>Her two blue windows faintly she up-heaveth,</a>
<a id='line_598'>Like the fair sun when in his fresh array</a>
<a id='line_599'>He cheers the morn, and all the world relieveth:     484</a>
<a id='line_600'>  And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,</a>
<a id='line_601'>  So is her face illumin’d with her eye.</a>
<a id='line_602'></a>
<a id='line_603'>Whose beams upon his hairless face are fix’d,</a>
<a id='line_604'>As if from thence they borrow’d all their shine.     488</a>
<a id='line_605'>Were never four such lamps together mix’d,</a>
<a id='line_606'>Had not his clouded with his brow’s repine;</a>
<a id='line_607'>  But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light</a>
<a id='line_608'>  Shone like the moon in water seen by night.        492</a>
<a id='line_609'></a>
<a id='line_610'>“O where am I?” quoth she, “in earth or heaven?</a>
<a id='line_611'>Or in the ocean drench’d, or in the fire?</a>
<a id='line_612'>What hour is this? or morn or weary even?</a>
<a id='line_613'>Do I delight to die, or life desire?                 496</a>

<a id='line_1001'></a>
<a id='line_1002'>And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,</a>

<a id='line_1014'>  And still the choir of echoes answer so.           840</a>
<a id='line_1015'></a>
<a id='line_1016'>Her song was tedious, and outwore the night,</a>

<a id='line_1024'>But idle sounds resembling parasites;                848</a>
<a id='line_1025'>Like shrill-tongu’d tapsters answering every call,</a>
<a id='line_1026'>Soothing the humour of fantastic wits?</a>
<a id='line_1027'>  She says, “’Tis so:” they answer all, “’Tis so;”</a>

<a id='line_1029'></a>
<a id='line_1030'>Lo here the gentle lark, weary of rest,</a>
<a id='line_1031'>From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,</a>
<a id='line_1032'>And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast</a>
<a id='line_1033'>The sun ariseth in his majesty;                      856</a>
<a id='line_1034'>  Who doth the world so gloriously behold,</a>

<a id='line_1039'>From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow</a>
<a id='line_1040'>The beauteous influence that makes him bright,</a>
<a id='line_1041'>  There lives a son that suck’d an earthly mother,</a>
<a id='line_1042'>  May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other.”</a>
<a id='line_1043'></a>
<a id='line_1044'>This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,            865</a>
<a id='line_1045'>Musing the morning is so much o’erworn,</a>
<a id='line_1046'>And yet she hears no tidings of her love;</a>
<a id='line_1047'>She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn.        868</a>
<a id='line_1048'>  Anon she hears them chant it lustily,</a>
<a id='line_1049'>  And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.</a>
<a id='line_1050'></a>
<a id='line_1051'>And as she runs, the bushes in the way</a>
<a id='line_1052'>Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,      872</a>
<a id='line_1053'>Some twine about her thigh to make her stay:</a>
<a id='line_1054'>She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,</a>
<a id='line_1055'>  Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,</a>
<a id='line_1056'>  Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.        876</a>
<a id='line_1057'></a>
<a id='line_1058'>By this she hears the hounds are at a bay,</a>
<a id='line_1059'>Whereat she starts like one that spies an adder</a>
<a id='line_1060'>Wreath’d up in fatal folds just in his way,</a>
<a id='line_1061'>The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder;    880</a>
<a id='line_1062'>  Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds</a>
<a id='line_1063'>  Appals her senses, and her spirit confounds.</a>
<a id='line_1064'></a>
<a id='line_1065'>For now she knows it is no gentle chase,</a>
<a id='line_1066'>But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,       884</a>
<a id='line_1067'>Because the cry remaineth in one place,</a>
<a id='line_1068'>Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud,</a>
<a id='line_1069'>  Finding their enemy to be so curst,</a>
<a id='line_1070'>  They all strain court’sy who shall cope him first. 888</a>
<a id='line_1071'></a>
<a id='line_1072'>This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,</a>
<a id='line_1073'>Through which it enters to surprise her heart;</a>
<a id='line_1074'>Who overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,</a>
<a id='line_1075'>With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part;     892</a>
<a id='line_1076'>  Like soldiers when their captain once doth yield,</a>
<a id='line_1077'>  They basely fly and dare not stay the field.</a>
<a id='line_1078'></a>
<a id='line_1079'>Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy,</a>
<a id='line_1080'>Till cheering up her senses sore dismay’d,           896</a>
<a id='line_1081'>She tells them ’tis a causeless fantasy,</a>
<a id='line_1082'>And childish error, that they are afraid;</a>
<a id='line_1083'>  Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more:</a>
<a id='line_1084'>  And with that word, she spied the hunted boar.     900</a>
<a id='line_1085'></a>
<a id='line_1086'>Whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red,</a>
<a id='line_1087'>Like milk and blood being mingled both together,</a>
<a id='line_1088'>A second fear through all her sinews spread,</a>
<a id='line_1089'>Which madly hurries her she knows not whither:       904</a>
<a id='line_1090'>  This way she runs, and now she will no further,</a>
<a id='line_1091'>  But back retires, to rate the boar for murther.</a>
<a id='line_1092'></a>
<a id='line_1093'>A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways,</a>
<a id='line_1094'>She treads the path that she untreads again;         908</a>
<a id='line_1095'>Her more than haste is mated with delays,</a>
<a id='line_1096'>Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,</a>
<a id='line_1097'>  Full of respects, yet naught at all respecting,</a>
<a id='line_1098'>  In hand with all things, naught at all effecting.</a>
<a id='line_1099'></a>
<a id='line_1100'>Here kennel’d in a brake she finds a hound,          913</a>
<a id='line_1101'>And asks the weary caitiff for his master,</a>
<a id='line_1102'>And there another licking of his wound,</a>
<a id='line_1103'>’Gainst venom’d sores the only sovereign plaster.    916</a>
<a id='line_1104'>  And here she meets another sadly scowling,</a>
<a id='line_1105'>  To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling.</a>
<a id='line_1106'></a>
<a id='line_1107'>When he hath ceas’d his ill-resounding noise,</a>
<a id='line_1108'>Another flap-mouth’d mourner, black and grim,        920</a>
<a id='line_1109'>Against the welkin volleys out his voice;</a>
<a id='line_1110'>Another and another answer him,</a>
<a id='line_1111'>  Clapping their proud tails to the ground below,</a>
<a id='line_1112'>  Shaking their scratch’d ears, bleeding as they go.</a>
<a id='line_1113'></a>
<a id='line_1114'>Look how the world’s poor people are amazed          925</a>
<a id='line_1115'>At apparitions, signs, and prodigies,</a>
<a id='line_1116'>Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,</a>
<a id='line_1117'>Infusing them with dreadful prophecies;              928</a>
<a id='line_1118'>  So she at these sad sighs draws up her breath,</a>
<a id='line_1119'>  And sighing it again, exclaims on death.</a>
<a id='line_1120'></a>
<a id='line_1121'>“Hard-favour’d tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,           931</a>
<a id='line_1122'>Hateful divorce of love,” thus chides she death,</a>
<a id='line_1123'>“Grim-grinning ghost, earth’s worm, what dost thou mean?</a>
<a id='line_1124'>To stifle beauty and to steal his breath,</a>
<a id='line_1125'>  Who when he liv’d, his breath and beauty set</a>
<a id='line_1126'>  Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet.            936</a>
<a id='line_1127'></a>
<a id='line_1128'>“If he be dead, O no, it cannot be,</a>
<a id='line_1129'>Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it,</a>
<a id='line_1130'>O yes, it may, thou hast no eyes to see,</a>
<a id='line_1131'>But hatefully at random dost thou hit.               940</a>
<a id='line_1132'>  Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart</a>
<a id='line_1133'>  Mistakes that aim, and cleaves an infant’s heart.</a>

<a id='line_1138'>They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck’st a flower.</a>
<a id='line_1139'>  Love’s golden arrow at him should have fled,</a>
<a id='line_1140'>  And not death’s ebon dart to strike him dead.      948</a>
<a id='line_1141'></a>
<a id='line_1142'>“Dost thou drink tears, that thou provok’st such weeping?</a>
<a id='line_1143'>What may a heavy groan advantage thee?</a>
<a id='line_1144'>Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping</a>
<a id='line_1145'>Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?        952</a>
<a id='line_1146'>  Now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour,</a>
<a id='line_1147'>  Since her best work is ruin’d with thy rigour.”</a>
<a id='line_1148'></a>
<a id='line_1149'>Here overcome, as one full of despair,</a>
<a id='line_1150'>She vail’d her eyelids, who like sluices stopp’d     956</a>
<a id='line_1151'>The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair</a>
<a id='line_1152'>In the sweet channel of her bosom dropp’d</a>
<a id='line_1153'>  But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,</a>
<a id='line_1154'>  And with his strong course opens them again.       960</a>
<a id='line_1155'></a>
<a id='line_1156'>O how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow;</a>
<a id='line_1157'>Her eyes seen in the tears, tears in her eye;</a>
<a id='line_1158'>Both crystals, where they view’d each other’s sorrow,</a>
<a id='line_1159'>Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry;      964</a>
<a id='line_1160'>  But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,</a>
<a id='line_1161'>  Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.</a>
<a id='line_1162'></a>
<a id='line_1163'>Variable passions throng her constant woe,</a>
<a id='line_1164'>As striving who should best become her grief;        968</a>
<a id='line_1165'>All entertain’d, each passion labours so,</a>
<a id='line_1166'>That every present sorrow seemeth chief,</a>
<a id='line_1167'>  But none is best, then join they all together,</a>
<a id='line_1168'>  Like many clouds consulting for foul weather.      972</a>
<a id='line_1169'></a>
<a id='line_1170'>By this, far off she hears some huntsman holla;</a>
<a id='line_1171'>A nurse’s song ne’er pleas’d her babe so well:</a>
<a id='line_1172'>The dire imagination she did follow</a>
<a id='line_1173'>This sound of hope doth labour to expel;             976</a>
<a id='line_1174'>  For now reviving joy bids her rejoice,</a>
<a id='line_1175'>  And flatters her it is Adonis’ voice.</a>
<a id='line_1176'></a>
<a id='line_1177'>Whereat her tears began to turn their tide,</a>
<a id='line_1178'>Being prison’d in her eye, like pearls in glass;     980</a>
<a id='line_1179'>Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside,</a>
<a id='line_1180'>Which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass</a>
<a id='line_1181'>  To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground,</a>
<a id='line_1182'>  Who is but drunken when she seemeth drown’d.</a>
<a id='line_1183'></a>
<a id='line_1184'>O hard-believing love, how strange it seems          985</a>
<a id='line_1185'>Not to believe, and yet too credulous;</a>
<a id='line_1186'>Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;</a>
<a id='line_1187'>Despair and hope make thee ridiculous,               988</a>
<a id='line_1188'>  The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,</a>

<a id='line_1190'></a>
<a id='line_1191'>Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought,</a>

<a id='line_1198'>“No, no,” quoth she, “sweet death, I did but jest;</a>

<a id='line_1216'>  Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs and stories</a>
<a id='line_1217'>  His victories, his triumphs and his glories.</a>

<a id='line_1221'>To wail his death who lives, and must not die</a>
<a id='line_1222'>Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind;</a>
<a id='line_1223'>  For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,</a>
<a id='line_1224'>  And beauty dead, black Chaos comes again.         1020</a>
<a id='line_1225'></a>
<a id='line_1226'>“Fie, fie, fond love, thou art as full of fear</a>

<a id='line_1233'>As falcon to the lure, away she flies;</a>
<a id='line_1234'>The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light,    1028</a>
<a id='line_1235'>And in her haste unfortunately spies</a>
<a id='line_1236'>The foul boar’s conquest on her fair delight;</a>
<a id='line_1237'>  Which seen, her eyes, as murder’d with the view,</a>
<a id='line_1238'>  Like stars asham’d of day, themselves withdrew.</a>
<a id='line_1239'></a>
<a id='line_1240'>Or as the snail, whose tender horns being hit,      1033</a>
<a id='line_1241'>Shrinks backwards in his shelly cave with pain,</a>
<a id='line_1242'>And there all smother’d up, in shade doth sit,</a>
<a id='line_1243'>Long after fearing to creep forth again:            1036</a>
<a id='line_1244'>  So at his bloody view her eyes are fled</a>
<a id='line_1245'>  Into the deep dark cabins of her head.</a>
<a id='line_1246'></a>
<a id='line_1247'>Where they resign their office and their light</a>
<a id='line_1248'>To the disposing of her troubled brain,             1040</a>
<a id='line_1249'>Who bids them still consort with ugly night,</a>
<a id='line_1250'>And never wound the heart with looks again;</a>
<a id='line_1251'>  Who like a king perplexed in his throne,</a>
<a id='line_1252'>  By their suggestion gives a deadly groan.         1044</a>
<a id='line_1253'></a>
<a id='line_1254'>Whereat each tributary subject quakes,</a>
<a id='line_1255'>As when the wind imprison’d in the ground,</a>
<a id='line_1256'>Struggling for passage, earth’s foundation shakes,</a>
<a id='line_1257'>Which with cold terror doth men’s minds confound.</a>
<a id='line_1258'>  This mutiny each part doth so surprise            1049</a>
<a id='line_1259'>  That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes.</a>
<a id='line_1260'></a>
<a id='line_1261'>And being open’d, threw unwilling light</a>
<a id='line_1262'>Upon the wide wound that the boar had trench’d</a>
<a id='line_1263'>In his soft flank, whose wonted lily white          1053</a>
<a id='line_1264'>With purple tears that his wound wept, was drench’d.</a>
<a id='line_1265'>  No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf or weed,</a>
<a id='line_1266'>  But stole his blood and seem’d with him to bleed.</a>
<a id='line_1267'></a>
<a id='line_1268'>This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth,             1057</a>
<a id='line_1269'>Over one shoulder doth she hang her head,</a>
<a id='line_1270'>Dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth;</a>
<a id='line_1271'>She thinks he could not die, he is not dead:        1060</a>

<a id='line_1274'></a>
<a id='line_1275'>Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly,</a>
<a id='line_1276'>That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three;</a>
<a id='line_1277'>And then she reprehends her mangling eye,           1065</a>
<a id='line_1278'>That makes more gashes, where no breach should be:</a>
<a id='line_1279'>  His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled,</a>
<a id='line_1280'>  For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.</a>

<a id='line_1282'>“My tongue cannot express my grief for one,         1069</a>

<a id='line_1284'>My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,</a>

<a id='line_1289'>“Alas poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!</a>
<a id='line_1290'>What face remains alive that’s worth the viewing?</a>
<a id='line_1291'>Whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast</a>
<a id='line_1292'>Of things long since, or anything ensuing?          1078</a>
<a id='line_1293'>  The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim,</a>
<a id='line_1294'>  But true sweet beauty liv’d and died with him.</a>

<a id='line_1298'>Having no fair to lose, you need not fear;</a>
<a id='line_1299'>The sun doth scorn you, and the wind doth hiss you.</a>
<a id='line_1300'>  But when Adonis liv’d, sun and sharp air          1085</a>
<a id='line_1301'>  Lurk’d like two thieves, to rob him of his fair.</a>
<a id='line_1302'></a>
<a id='line_1303'>“And therefore would he put his bonnet on,</a>
<a id='line_1304'>Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;          1088</a>
<a id='line_1305'>The wind would blow it off, and being gone,</a>
<a id='line_1306'>Play with his locks; then would Adonis weep;</a>
<a id='line_1307'>  And straight, in pity of his tender years,</a>
<a id='line_1308'>  They both would strive who first should dry his tears.</a>

<a id='line_1310'>“To see his face the lion walk’d along              1093</a>

<a id='line_1313'>The tiger would be tame and gently hear him.        1096</a>
<a id='line_1314'>  If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey,</a>

<a id='line_1326'>Ne’er saw the beauteous livery that he wore;</a>
<a id='line_1327'>Witness the entertainment that he gave.             1108</a>
<a id='line_1328'>  If he did see his face, why then I know</a>

<a id='line_1331'>“’Tis true, ’tis true; thus was Adonis slain:</a>

<a id='line_1342'>  With this she falleth in the place she stood,</a>
<a id='line_1343'>  And stains her face with his congealed blood.</a>
<a id='line_1344'></a>
<a id='line_1345'>She looks upon his lips, and they are pale;</a>
<a id='line_1346'>She takes him by the hand, and that is cold,        1124</a>
<a id='line_1347'>She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,</a>
<a id='line_1348'>As if they heard the woeful words she told;</a>
<a id='line_1349'>She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1350'>Where lo, two lamps burnt out in darkness lies.</a>
<a id='line_1351'></a>
<a id='line_1352'>Two glasses where herself herself beheld            1129</a>
<a id='line_1353'>A thousand times, and now no more reflect;</a>
<a id='line_1354'>Their virtue lost, wherein they late excell’d,</a>
<a id='line_1355'>And every beauty robb’d of his effect.              1132</a>
<a id='line_1356'>  “Wonder of time,” quoth she, “this is my spite,</a>
<a id='line_1357'>  That thou being dead, the day should yet be light.</a>

<a id='line_1359'>“Since thou art dead, lo here I prophesy,</a>
<a id='line_1360'>Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend:              1136</a>

<a id='line_1368'>The bottom poison, and the top o’erstraw’d</a>
<a id='line_1369'>With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile.    1144</a>
<a id='line_1370'>  The strongest body shall it make most weak,</a>
<a id='line_1371'>  Strike the wise dumb, and teach the fool to speak.</a>
<a id='line_1372'></a>

<a id='line_1374'>Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures;        1148</a>
<a id='line_1375'>The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,</a>
<a id='line_1376'>Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures;</a>
<a id='line_1377'>  It shall be raging mad, and silly mild,</a>
<a id='line_1378'>  Make the young old, the old become a child.       1152</a>
<a id='line_1379'></a>
<a id='line_1380'>“It shall suspect where is no cause of fear,</a>
<a id='line_1381'>It shall not fear where it should most mistrust;</a>
<a id='line_1382'>It shall be merciful, and too severe,</a>
<a id='line_1383'>And most deceiving when it seems most just;         1156</a>
<a id='line_1384'>  Perverse it shall be, where it shows most toward,</a>
<a id='line_1385'>  Put fear to valour, courage to the coward.</a>
<a id='line_1386'></a>

<a id='line_1389'>Subject and servile to all discontents,</a>

<a id='line_1393'></a>
<a id='line_1394'>By this the boy that by her side lay kill’d</a>
<a id='line_1395'>Was melted like a vapour from her sight,</a>
<a id='line_1396'>And in his blood that on the ground lay spill’d,</a>
<a id='line_1397'>A purple flower sprung up, chequer’d with white,    1168</a>
<a id='line_1398'>  Resembling well his pale cheeks, and the blood</a>
<a id='line_1399'>  Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.</a>
<a id='line_1400'></a>
<a id='line_1401'>She bows her head, the new-sprung flower to smell,</a>
<a id='line_1402'>Comparing it to her Adonis’ breath;                 1172</a>
<a id='line_1403'>And says within her bosom it shall dwell,</a>
<a id='line_1404'>Since he himself is reft from her by death;</a>
<a id='line_1405'>  She drops the stalk, and in the breach appears</a>
<a id='line_1406'>  Green-dropping sap, which she compares to tears.</a>
<a id='line_1407'></a>
<a id='line_1408'>“Poor flower,” quoth she, “this was thy father’s guise,</a>
<a id='line_1409'>Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire,</a>
<a id='line_1410'>For every little grief to wet his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1411'>To grow unto himself was his desire,                1180</a>
<a id='line_1412'>  And so ’tis thine; but know, it is as good</a>
