<a id='line_55'></a>
<a id='line_56'>ACT I. SCENE 1.</a>
<a id='line_57'></a>
<a id='line_58'>London. A street</a>
<a id='line_59'></a>
<a id='line_60'>Enter RICHARD, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, solus</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>  GLOUCESTER. Now is the winter of our discontent</a>
<a id='line_63'>    Made glorious summer by this sun of York;</a>
<a id='line_64'>    And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house</a>
<a id='line_65'>    In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</a>
<a id='line_66'>    Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;</a>
<a id='line_67'>    Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;</a>
<a id='line_68'>    Our stern alarums chang'd to merry meetings,</a>
<a id='line_69'>    Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.</a>
<a id='line_70'>    Grim-visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front,</a>
<a id='line_71'>    And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds</a>
<a id='line_72'>    To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,</a>
<a id='line_73'>    He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber</a>
<a id='line_74'>    To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</a>
<a id='line_75'>    But I-that am not shap'd for sportive tricks,</a>
<a id='line_76'>    Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass-</a>
<a id='line_77'>    I-that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty</a>
<a id='line_78'>    To strut before a wanton ambling nymph-</a>
<a id='line_79'>    I-that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,</a>
<a id='line_80'>    Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</a>
<a id='line_81'>    Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time</a>
<a id='line_82'>    Into this breathing world scarce half made up,</a>
<a id='line_83'>    And that so lamely and unfashionable</a>
<a id='line_84'>    That dogs bark at me as I halt by them-</a>
<a id='line_85'>    Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,</a>
<a id='line_86'>    Have no delight to pass away the time,</a>
<a id='line_87'>    Unless to spy my shadow in the sun</a>
<a id='line_88'>    And descant on mine own deformity.</a>
<a id='line_89'>    And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover</a>
<a id='line_90'>    To entertain these fair well-spoken days,</a>
<a id='line_91'>    I am determined to prove a villain</a>
<a id='line_92'>    And hate the idle pleasures of these days.</a>
<a id='line_93'>    Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,</a>
<a id='line_94'>    By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,</a>
<a id='line_95'>    To set my brother Clarence and the King</a>
<a id='line_96'>    In deadly hate the one against the other;</a>
<a id='line_97'>    And if King Edward be as true and just</a>
<a id='line_98'>    As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,</a>
<a id='line_99'>    This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up-</a>
<a id='line_100'>    About a prophecy which says that G</a>
<a id='line_101'>    Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.</a>
<a id='line_102'>    Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes.</a>
<a id='line_103'></a>
<a id='line_104'>             Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>    Brother, good day. What means this armed guard</a>
<a id='line_107'>    That waits upon your Grace?</a>
<a id='line_108'>  CLARENCE. His Majesty,</a>
<a id='line_109'>    Tend'ring my person's safety, hath appointed</a>
<a id='line_110'>    This conduct to convey me to th' Tower.</a>
<a id='line_111'>  GLOUCESTER. Upon what cause?</a>
<a id='line_112'>  CLARENCE. Because my name is George.</a>
<a id='line_113'>  GLOUCESTER. Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours:</a>
<a id='line_114'>    He should, for that, commit your godfathers.</a>
<a id='line_115'>    O, belike his Majesty hath some intent</a>
<a id='line_116'>    That you should be new-christ'ned in the Tower.</a>
<a id='line_117'>    But what's the matter, Clarence? May I know?</a>
<a id='line_118'>  CLARENCE. Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest</a>
<a id='line_119'>    As yet I do not; but, as I can learn,</a>
<a id='line_120'>    He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,</a>
<a id='line_121'>    And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,</a>
<a id='line_122'>    And says a wizard told him that by G</a>
<a id='line_123'>    His issue disinherited should be;</a>
<a id='line_124'>    And, for my name of George begins with G,</a>
<a id='line_125'>    It follows in his thought that I am he.</a>
<a id='line_126'>    These, as I learn, and such like toys as these</a>
<a id='line_127'>    Hath mov'd his Highness to commit me now.</a>
<a id='line_128'>  GLOUCESTER. Why, this it is when men are rul'd by women:</a>
<a id='line_129'>    'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;</a>
<a id='line_130'>    My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she</a>
<a id='line_131'>    That tempers him to this extremity.</a>
<a id='line_132'>    Was it not she and that good man of worship,</a>
<a id='line_133'>    Antony Woodville, her brother there,</a>
<a id='line_134'>    That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,</a>
<a id='line_135'>    From whence this present day he is delivered?</a>
<a id='line_136'>    We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.</a>
<a id='line_137'>  CLARENCE. By heaven, I think there is no man is secure</a>
<a id='line_138'>    But the Queen's kindred, and night-walking heralds</a>
<a id='line_139'>    That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.</a>
<a id='line_140'>    Heard you not what an humble suppliant</a>
<a id='line_141'>    Lord Hastings was, for her delivery?</a>
<a id='line_142'>  GLOUCESTER. Humbly complaining to her deity</a>
<a id='line_143'>    Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.</a>
<a id='line_144'>    I'll tell you what-I think it is our way,</a>
<a id='line_145'>    If we will keep in favour with the King,</a>
<a id='line_146'>    To be her men and wear her livery:</a>
<a id='line_147'>    The jealous o'er-worn widow, and herself,</a>
<a id='line_148'>    Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen,</a>
<a id='line_149'>    Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.</a>
<a id='line_150'>  BRAKENBURY. I beseech your Graces both to pardon me:</a>
<a id='line_151'>    His Majesty hath straitly given in charge</a>
<a id='line_152'>    That no man shall have private conference,</a>
<a id='line_153'>    Of what degree soever, with your brother.</a>
<a id='line_154'>  GLOUCESTER. Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,</a>
<a id='line_155'>    You may partake of any thing we say:</a>
<a id='line_156'>    We speak no treason, man; we say the King</a>
<a id='line_157'>    Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen</a>
<a id='line_158'>    Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;</a>
<a id='line_159'>    We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,</a>
<a id='line_160'>    A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;</a>
<a id='line_161'>    And that the Queen's kindred are made gentlefolks.</a>
<a id='line_162'>    How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?</a>
<a id='line_163'>  BRAKENBURY. With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.</a>
<a id='line_164'>  GLOUCESTER. Naught to do with Mistress Shore! I tell thee,</a>
<a id='line_165'>    fellow,</a>
<a id='line_166'>    He that doth naught with her, excepting one,</a>
<a id='line_167'>    Were best to do it secretly alone.</a>
<a id='line_168'>  BRAKENBURY. What one, my lord?</a>
<a id='line_169'>  GLOUCESTER. Her husband, knave! Wouldst thou betray me?</a>
<a id='line_170'>  BRAKENBURY. I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and</a>
<a id='line_171'>    withal</a>
<a id='line_172'>    Forbear your conference with the noble Duke.</a>
<a id='line_173'>  CLARENCE. We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will</a>
<a id='line_174'>    obey.</a>
<a id='line_175'>  GLOUCESTER. We are the Queen's abjects and must obey.</a>
<a id='line_176'>    Brother, farewell; I will unto the King;</a>
<a id='line_177'>    And whatsoe'er you will employ me in-</a>
<a id='line_178'>    Were it to call King Edward's widow sister-</a>
<a id='line_179'>    I will perform it to enfranchise you.</a>
<a id='line_180'>    Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood</a>
<a id='line_181'>    Touches me deeper than you can imagine.</a>
<a id='line_182'>  CLARENCE. I know it pleaseth neither of us well.</a>
<a id='line_183'>  GLOUCESTER. Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;</a>
<a id='line_184'>    I will deliver or else lie for you.</a>
<a id='line_185'>    Meantime, have patience.</a>
<a id='line_186'>  CLARENCE. I must perforce. Farewell.</a>
<a id='line_187'>                          Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and guard</a>
<a id='line_188'>  GLOUCESTER. Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.</a>
<a id='line_189'>    Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so</a>
<a id='line_190'>    That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,</a>
<a id='line_191'>    If heaven will take the present at our hands.</a>
<a id='line_192'>    But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?</a>
<a id='line_193'></a>
<a id='line_194'>                       Enter LORD HASTINGS</a>
<a id='line_195'></a>
<a id='line_196'>  HASTINGS. Good time of day unto my gracious lord!</a>
<a id='line_197'>  GLOUCESTER. As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain!</a>
<a id='line_198'>    Well are you welcome to the open air.</a>
<a id='line_199'>    How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?</a>
<a id='line_200'>  HASTINGS. With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must;</a>
<a id='line_201'>    But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks</a>
<a id='line_202'>    That were the cause of my imprisonment.</a>
<a id='line_203'>  GLOUCESTER. No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;</a>
<a id='line_204'>    For they that were your enemies are his,</a>
<a id='line_205'>    And have prevail'd as much on him as you.</a>
<a id='line_206'>  HASTINGS. More pity that the eagles should be mew'd</a>
<a id='line_207'>    Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.</a>
<a id='line_208'>  GLOUCESTER. What news abroad?</a>
<a id='line_209'>  HASTINGS. No news so bad abroad as this at home:</a>
<a id='line_210'>    The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,</a>
<a id='line_211'>    And his physicians fear him mightily.</a>
<a id='line_212'>  GLOUCESTER. Now, by Saint John, that news is bad indeed.</a>
<a id='line_213'>    O, he hath kept an evil diet long</a>
<a id='line_214'>    And overmuch consum'd his royal person!</a>
<a id='line_215'>    'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.</a>
<a id='line_216'>    Where is he? In his bed?</a>
<a id='line_217'>  HASTINGS. He is.</a>
<a id='line_218'>  GLOUCESTER. Go you before, and I will follow you.</a>
<a id='line_219'>                                                   Exit HASTINGS</a>
<a id='line_220'>    He cannot live, I hope, and must not die</a>
<a id='line_221'>    Till George be pack'd with posthorse up to heaven.</a>
<a id='line_222'>    I'll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence</a>
<a id='line_223'>    With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;</a>
<a id='line_224'>    And, if I fail not in my deep intent,</a>
<a id='line_225'>    Clarence hath not another day to live;</a>
<a id='line_226'>    Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,</a>
<a id='line_227'>    And leave the world for me to bustle in!</a>
<a id='line_228'>    For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.</a>
<a id='line_229'>    What though I kill'd her husband and her father?</a>
<a id='line_230'>    The readiest way to make the wench amends</a>
<a id='line_231'>    Is to become her husband and her father;</a>
<a id='line_232'>    The which will I-not all so much for love</a>
<a id='line_233'>    As for another secret close intent</a>
<a id='line_234'>    By marrying her which I must reach unto.</a>
<a id='line_235'>    But yet I run before my horse to market.</a>
<a id='line_236'>    Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns;</a>
<a id='line_237'>    When they are gone, then must I count my gains.         Exit</a>
<a id='line_238'></a>
<a id='line_239'>SCENE 2.</a>

<a id='line_308'>    Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity,</a>
<a id='line_309'>    For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood</a>
<a id='line_310'>    From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells;</a>
<a id='line_311'>    Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural</a>
<a id='line_312'>    Provokes this deluge most unnatural.</a>
<a id='line_313'>    O God, which this blood mad'st, revenge his death!</a>
<a id='line_314'>    O earth, which this blood drink'st, revenge his death!</a>
<a id='line_315'>    Either, heav'n, with lightning strike the murd'rer dead;</a>
<a id='line_316'>    Or, earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,</a>
<a id='line_317'>    As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood,</a>
<a id='line_318'>    Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered.</a>
<a id='line_319'>  GLOUCESTER. Lady, you know no rules of charity,</a>
<a id='line_320'>    Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.</a>
<a id='line_321'>  ANNE. Villain, thou knowest nor law of God nor man:</a>
<a id='line_322'>    No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.</a>
<a id='line_323'>  GLOUCESTER. But I know none, and therefore am no beast.</a>
<a id='line_324'>  ANNE. O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!</a>
<a id='line_325'>  GLOUCESTER. More wonderful when angels are so angry.</a>
<a id='line_326'>    Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,</a>
<a id='line_327'>    Of these supposed crimes to give me leave</a>
<a id='line_328'>    By circumstance but to acquit myself.</a>
<a id='line_329'>  ANNE. Vouchsafe, diffus'd infection of a man,</a>
<a id='line_330'>    Of these known evils but to give me leave</a>
<a id='line_331'>    By circumstance to accuse thy cursed self.</a>
<a id='line_332'>  GLOUCESTER. Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have</a>
<a id='line_333'>    Some patient leisure to excuse myself.</a>
<a id='line_334'>  ANNE. Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make</a>
<a id='line_335'>    No excuse current but to hang thyself.</a>
<a id='line_336'>  GLOUCESTER. By such despair I should accuse myself.</a>
<a id='line_337'>  ANNE. And by despairing shalt thou stand excused</a>
<a id='line_338'>    For doing worthy vengeance on thyself</a>
<a id='line_339'>    That didst unworthy slaughter upon others.</a>
<a id='line_340'>  GLOUCESTER. Say that I slew them not?</a>
<a id='line_341'>  ANNE. Then say they were not slain.</a>
<a id='line_342'>    But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee.</a>
<a id='line_343'>  GLOUCESTER. I did not kill your husband.</a>
<a id='line_344'>  ANNE. Why, then he is alive.</a>
<a id='line_345'>  GLOUCESTER. Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward's hands.</a>
<a id='line_346'>  ANNE. In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw</a>
<a id='line_347'>    Thy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood;</a>
<a id='line_348'>    The which thou once didst bend against her breast,</a>
<a id='line_349'>    But that thy brothers beat aside the point.</a>
<a id='line_350'>  GLOUCESTER. I was provoked by her sland'rous tongue</a>
<a id='line_351'>    That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.</a>
<a id='line_352'>  ANNE. Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,</a>
<a id='line_353'>    That never dream'st on aught but butcheries.</a>
<a id='line_354'>    Didst thou not kill this king?</a>
<a id='line_355'>  GLOUCESTER. I grant ye.</a>
<a id='line_356'>  ANNE. Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then, God grant me to</a>
<a id='line_357'>    Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!</a>
<a id='line_358'>    O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!</a>
<a id='line_359'>  GLOUCESTER. The better for the King of Heaven, that hath</a>
<a id='line_360'>    him.</a>
<a id='line_361'>  ANNE. He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.</a>
<a id='line_362'>  GLOUCESTER. Let him thank me that holp to send him</a>
<a id='line_363'>    thither,</a>
<a id='line_364'>    For he was fitter for that place than earth.</a>
<a id='line_365'>  ANNE. And thou unfit for any place but hell.</a>
<a id='line_366'>  GLOUCESTER. Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.</a>
<a id='line_367'>  ANNE. Some dungeon.</a>
<a id='line_368'>  GLOUCESTER. Your bed-chamber.</a>
<a id='line_369'>  ANNE. Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!</a>
<a id='line_370'>  GLOUCESTER. So will it, madam, till I lie with you.</a>
<a id='line_371'>  ANNE. I hope so.</a>
<a id='line_372'>  GLOUCESTER. I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,</a>
<a id='line_373'>    To leave this keen encounter of our wits,</a>
<a id='line_374'>    And fall something into a slower method-</a>
<a id='line_375'>    Is not the causer of the timeless deaths</a>
<a id='line_376'>    Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,</a>
<a id='line_377'>    As blameful as the executioner?</a>
<a id='line_378'>  ANNE. Thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect.</a>
<a id='line_379'>  GLOUCESTER. Your beauty was the cause of that effect-</a>
<a id='line_380'>    Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep</a>
<a id='line_381'>    To undertake the death of all the world</a>
<a id='line_382'>    So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.</a>
<a id='line_383'>  ANNE. If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,</a>
<a id='line_384'>    These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.</a>
<a id='line_385'>  GLOUCESTER. These eyes could not endure that beauty's</a>
<a id='line_386'>    wreck;</a>
<a id='line_387'>    You should not blemish it if I stood by.</a>
<a id='line_388'>    As all the world is cheered by the sun,</a>
<a id='line_389'>    So I by that; it is my day, my life.</a>
<a id='line_390'>  ANNE. Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!</a>
<a id='line_391'>  GLOUCESTER. Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.</a>
<a id='line_392'>  ANNE. I would I were, to be reveng'd on thee.</a>
<a id='line_393'>  GLOUCESTER. It is a quarrel most unnatural,</a>
<a id='line_394'>    To be reveng'd on him that loveth thee.</a>
<a id='line_395'>  ANNE. It is a quarrel just and reasonable,</a>
<a id='line_396'>    To be reveng'd on him that kill'd my husband.</a>
<a id='line_397'>  GLOUCESTER. He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband</a>
<a id='line_398'>    Did it to help thee to a better husband.</a>
<a id='line_399'>  ANNE. His better doth not breathe upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_400'>  GLOUCESTER. He lives that loves thee better than he could.</a>
<a id='line_401'>  ANNE. Name him.</a>
<a id='line_402'>  GLOUCESTER. Plantagenet.</a>
<a id='line_403'>  ANNE. Why, that was he.</a>
<a id='line_404'>  GLOUCESTER. The self-same name, but one of better nature.</a>
<a id='line_405'>  ANNE. Where is he?</a>
<a id='line_406'>  GLOUCESTER. Here.  [She spits at him]  Why dost thou spit</a>
<a id='line_407'>    at me?</a>
<a id='line_408'>  ANNE. Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!</a>
<a id='line_409'>  GLOUCESTER. Never came poison from so sweet a place.</a>
<a id='line_410'>  ANNE. Never hung poison on a fouler toad.</a>
<a id='line_411'>    Out of my sight! Thou dost infect mine eyes.</a>
<a id='line_412'>  GLOUCESTER. Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.</a>
<a id='line_413'>  ANNE. Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead!</a>
<a id='line_414'>  GLOUCESTER. I would they were, that I might die at once;</a>
<a id='line_415'>    For now they kill me with a living death.</a>
<a id='line_416'>    Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,</a>
<a id='line_417'>    Sham'd their aspects with store of childish drops-</a>
<a id='line_418'>    These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear,</a>
<a id='line_419'>    No, when my father York and Edward wept</a>
<a id='line_420'>    To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made</a>
<a id='line_421'>    When black-fac'd Clifford shook his sword at him;</a>
<a id='line_422'>    Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,</a>
<a id='line_423'>    Told the sad story of my father's death,</a>
<a id='line_424'>    And twenty times made pause to sob and weep</a>
<a id='line_425'>    That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks</a>
<a id='line_426'>    Like trees bedash'd with rain-in that sad time</a>
<a id='line_427'>    My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;</a>
<a id='line_428'>    And what these sorrows could not thence exhale</a>
<a id='line_429'>    Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.</a>
<a id='line_430'>    I never sued to friend nor enemy;</a>
<a id='line_431'>    My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;</a>
<a id='line_432'>    But, now thy beauty is propos'd my fee,</a>
<a id='line_433'>    My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.</a>
<a id='line_434'>                                   [She looks scornfully at him]</a>
<a id='line_435'>    Teach not thy lip such scorn; for it was made</a>
<a id='line_436'>    For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.</a>
<a id='line_437'>    If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,</a>
<a id='line_438'>    Lo here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;</a>
<a id='line_439'>    Which if thou please to hide in this true breast</a>
<a id='line_440'>    And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,</a>
<a id='line_441'>    I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,</a>
<a id='line_442'>    And humbly beg the death upon my knee.</a>
<a id='line_443'>      [He lays his breast open; she offers at it with his sword]</a>
<a id='line_444'>    Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry-</a>
<a id='line_445'>    But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.</a>
<a id='line_446'>    Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward-</a>
<a id='line_447'>    But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.</a>
<a id='line_448'>                                           [She falls the sword]</a>
<a id='line_449'>    Take up the sword again, or take up me.</a>
<a id='line_450'>  ANNE. Arise, dissembler; though I wish thy death,</a>
<a id='line_451'>    I will not be thy executioner.</a>
<a id='line_452'>  GLOUCESTER. Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it;</a>
<a id='line_453'>  ANNE. I have already.</a>
<a id='line_454'>  GLOUCESTER. That was in thy rage.</a>
<a id='line_455'>    Speak it again, and even with the word</a>
<a id='line_456'>    This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,</a>
<a id='line_457'>    Shall for thy love kill a far truer love;</a>
<a id='line_458'>    To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary.</a>
<a id='line_459'>  ANNE. I would I knew thy heart.</a>
<a id='line_460'>  GLOUCESTER. 'Tis figur'd in my tongue.</a>
<a id='line_461'>  ANNE. I fear me both are false.</a>
<a id='line_462'>  GLOUCESTER. Then never was man true.</a>
<a id='line_463'>  ANNE. well put up your sword.</a>
<a id='line_464'>  GLOUCESTER. Say, then, my peace is made.</a>
<a id='line_465'>  ANNE. That shalt thou know hereafter.</a>
<a id='line_466'>  GLOUCESTER. But shall I live in hope?</a>
<a id='line_467'>  ANNE. All men, I hope, live so.</a>
<a id='line_468'>  GLOUCESTER. Vouchsafe to wear this ring.</a>
<a id='line_469'>  ANNE. To take is not to give.               [Puts on the ring]</a>
<a id='line_470'>  GLOUCESTER. Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger,</a>
<a id='line_471'>    Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;</a>
<a id='line_472'>    Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.</a>
<a id='line_473'>    And if thy poor devoted servant may</a>
<a id='line_474'>    But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,</a>
<a id='line_475'>    Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.</a>
<a id='line_476'>  ANNE. What is it?</a>
<a id='line_477'>  GLOUCESTER. That it may please you leave these sad designs</a>
<a id='line_478'>    To him that hath most cause to be a mourner,</a>
<a id='line_479'>    And presently repair to Crosby House;</a>

<a id='line_549'>  GREY. No other harm but loss of such a lord.</a>
<a id='line_550'>  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The loss of such a lord includes all</a>

<a id='line_694'>  GLOUCESTER. In all which time you and your husband Grey</a>
<a id='line_695'>    Were factious for the house of Lancaster;</a>
<a id='line_696'>    And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband</a>

<a id='line_701'>  QUEEN MARGARET. A murd'rous villain, and so still thou art.</a>

<a id='line_731'>    Ah, gentle villain, do not turn away!</a>
<a id='line_732'>  GLOUCESTER. Foul wrinkled witch, what mak'st thou in my</a>

<a id='line_734'>  QUEEN MARGARET. But repetition of what thou hast marr'd,</a>
<a id='line_735'>    That will I make before I let thee go.</a>
<a id='line_736'>  GLOUCESTER. Wert thou not banished on pain of death?</a>
<a id='line_737'>  QUEEN MARGARET. I was; but I do find more pain in</a>
<a id='line_738'>    banishment</a>
<a id='line_739'>    Than death can yield me here by my abode.</a>
<a id='line_740'>    A husband and a son thou ow'st to me;</a>

<a id='line_743'>    And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.</a>
<a id='line_744'>  GLOUCESTER. The curse my noble father laid on thee,</a>

<a id='line_746'>    And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_747'>    And then to dry them gav'st the Duke a clout</a>

<a id='line_749'>    His curses then from bitterness of soul</a>
<a id='line_750'>    Denounc'd against thee are all fall'n upon thee;</a>
<a id='line_751'>    And God, not we, hath plagu'd thy bloody deed.</a>
<a id='line_752'>  QUEEN ELIZABETH. So just is God to right the innocent.</a>
<a id='line_753'>  HASTINGS. O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,</a>
<a id='line_754'>    And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!</a>
<a id='line_755'>  RIVERS. Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.</a>
<a id='line_756'>  DORSET. No man but prophesied revenge for it.</a>
<a id='line_757'>  BUCKINGHAM. Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.</a>
<a id='line_758'>  QUEEN MARGARET. What, were you snarling all before I came,</a>
<a id='line_759'>    Ready to catch each other by the throat,</a>
<a id='line_760'>    And turn you all your hatred now on me?</a>
<a id='line_761'>    Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven</a>
<a id='line_762'>    That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,</a>
<a id='line_763'>    Their kingdom's loss, my woeful banishment,</a>

<a id='line_765'>    Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?</a>
<a id='line_766'>    Why then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!</a>
<a id='line_767'>    Though not by war, by surfeit die your king,</a>
<a id='line_768'>    As ours by murder, to make him a king!</a>
<a id='line_769'>    Edward thy son, that now is Prince of Wales,</a>
<a id='line_770'>    For Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales,</a>

<a id='line_772'>    Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,</a>

<a id='line_774'>    Long mayest thou live to wail thy children's death,</a>
<a id='line_775'>    And see another, as I see thee now,</a>
<a id='line_776'>    Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!</a>
<a id='line_777'>    Long die thy happy days before thy death;</a>
<a id='line_778'>    And, after many length'ned hours of grief,</a>
<a id='line_779'>    Die neither mother, wife, nor England's Queen!</a>
<a id='line_780'>    Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,</a>
<a id='line_781'>    And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son</a>

<a id='line_783'>    That none of you may live his natural age,</a>
<a id='line_784'>    But by some unlook'd accident cut off!</a>
<a id='line_785'>  GLOUCESTER. Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd</a>
<a id='line_786'>    hag.</a>
<a id='line_787'>  QUEEN MARGARET. And leave out thee? Stay, dog, for thou</a>
<a id='line_788'>    shalt hear me.</a>
<a id='line_789'>    If heaven have any grievous plague in store</a>
<a id='line_790'>    Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,</a>

<a id='line_809'>  QUEEN MARGARET. I call thee not.</a>

<a id='line_812'>  QUEEN MARGARET. Why, so I did, but look'd for no reply.</a>
<a id='line_813'>    O, let me make the period to my curse!</a>
<a id='line_814'>  GLOUCESTER. 'Tis done by me, and ends in-Margaret.</a>
<a id='line_815'>  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thus have you breath'd your curse</a>

<a id='line_833'>    O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!</a>
<a id='line_834'>  DORSET. Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.</a>

<a id='line_959'>  CLARENCE. O, I have pass'd a miserable night,</a>
<a id='line_960'>    So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,</a>
<a id='line_961'>    That, as I am a Christian faithful man,</a>
<a id='line_962'>    I would not spend another such a night</a>
<a id='line_963'>    Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days-</a>
<a id='line_964'>    So full of dismal terror was the time!</a>
<a id='line_965'>  KEEPER. What was your dream, my lord? I pray you</a>
<a id='line_966'>    tell me.</a>
<a id='line_967'>  CLARENCE. Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower</a>
<a id='line_968'>    And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;</a>
<a id='line_969'>    And in my company my brother Gloucester,</a>
<a id='line_970'>    Who from my cabin tempted me to walk</a>
<a id='line_971'>    Upon the hatches. Thence we look'd toward England,</a>
<a id='line_972'>    And cited up a thousand heavy times,</a>
<a id='line_973'>    During the wars of York and Lancaster,</a>
<a id='line_974'>    That had befall'n us. As we pac'd along</a>
<a id='line_975'>    Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,</a>
<a id='line_976'>    Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling</a>
<a id='line_977'>    Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard</a>
<a id='line_978'>    Into the tumbling billows of the main.</a>
<a id='line_979'>    O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown,</a>
<a id='line_980'>    What dreadful noise of waters in my ears,</a>
<a id='line_981'>    What sights of ugly death within my eyes!</a>
<a id='line_982'>    Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks,</a>
<a id='line_983'>    A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,</a>
<a id='line_984'>    Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,</a>
<a id='line_985'>    Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,</a>
<a id='line_986'>    All scatt'red in the bottom of the sea;</a>
<a id='line_987'>    Some lay in dead men's skulls, and in the holes</a>
<a id='line_988'>    Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept,</a>
<a id='line_989'>    As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,</a>
<a id='line_990'>    That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep</a>
<a id='line_991'>    And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatt'red by.</a>
<a id='line_992'>  KEEPER. Had you such leisure in the time of death</a>
<a id='line_993'>    To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?</a>
<a id='line_994'>  CLARENCE. Methought I had; and often did I strive</a>
<a id='line_995'>    To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood</a>
<a id='line_996'>    Stopp'd in my soul and would not let it forth</a>
<a id='line_997'>    To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring air;</a>
<a id='line_998'>    But smother'd it within my panting bulk,</a>
<a id='line_999'>    Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.</a>
<a id='line_1000'>  KEEPER. Awak'd you not in this sore agony?</a>
<a id='line_1001'>  CLARENCE. No, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life.</a>
<a id='line_1002'>    O, then began the tempest to my soul!</a>
<a id='line_1003'>    I pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood</a>
<a id='line_1004'>    With that sour ferryman which poets write of,</a>
<a id='line_1005'>    Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.</a>
<a id='line_1006'>    The first that there did greet my stranger soul</a>
<a id='line_1007'>    Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,</a>

<a id='line_1009'>    Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'</a>
<a id='line_1010'>    And so he vanish'd. Then came wand'ring by</a>
<a id='line_1011'>    A shadow like an angel, with bright hair</a>
<a id='line_1012'>    Dabbled in blood, and he shriek'd out aloud</a>
<a id='line_1013'>    'Clarence is come-false, fleeting, perjur'd Clarence,</a>
<a id='line_1014'>    That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury.</a>
<a id='line_1015'>    Seize on him, Furies, take him unto torment!'</a>
<a id='line_1016'>    With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends</a>
<a id='line_1017'>    Environ'd me, and howled in mine ears</a>
<a id='line_1018'>    Such hideous cries that, with the very noise,</a>
<a id='line_1019'>    I trembling wak'd, and for a season after</a>
<a id='line_1020'>    Could not believe but that I was in hell,</a>

<a id='line_1023'>    I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.</a>
<a id='line_1024'>  CLARENCE. Ah, Keeper, Keeper, I have done these things</a>
<a id='line_1025'>    That now give evidence against my soul</a>
<a id='line_1026'>    For Edward's sake, and see how he requites me!</a>
<a id='line_1027'>    O God! If my deep prayers cannot appease Thee,</a>
<a id='line_1028'>    But Thou wilt be aveng'd on my misdeeds,</a>
<a id='line_1029'>    Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone;</a>
<a id='line_1030'>    O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!</a>
<a id='line_1031'>  KEEPER, I prithee sit by me awhile;</a>
<a id='line_1032'>    My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.</a>

<a id='line_1038'>  BRAKENBURY. Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,</a>
<a id='line_1039'>    Makes the night morning and the noontide night.</a>
<a id='line_1040'>    Princes have but their titles for their glories,</a>

<a id='line_1042'>    And for unfelt imaginations</a>
<a id='line_1043'>    They often feel a world of restless cares,</a>
<a id='line_1044'>    So that between their tides and low name</a>
<a id='line_1045'>    There's nothing differs but the outward fame.</a>
<a id='line_1046'></a>
<a id='line_1047'>                      Enter the two MURDERERS</a>

<a id='line_1049'>  FIRST MURDERER. Ho! who's here?</a>
<a id='line_1050'>  BRAKENBURY. What wouldst thou, fellow, and how cam'st</a>
<a id='line_1051'>    thou hither?</a>
<a id='line_1052'>  FIRST MURDERER. I would speak with Clarence, and I came</a>
<a id='line_1053'>    hither on my legs.</a>
<a id='line_1054'>  BRAKENBURY. What, so brief?</a>
<a id='line_1055'>  SECOND MURDERER. 'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious. Let</a>
<a id='line_1056'>    him see our commission and talk no more.</a>
<a id='line_1057'>                                           [BRAKENBURY reads it]</a>
<a id='line_1058'>  BRAKENBURY. I am, in this, commanded to deliver</a>
<a id='line_1059'>    The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands.</a>
<a id='line_1060'>    I will not reason what is meant hereby,</a>
<a id='line_1061'>    Because I will be guiltless from the meaning.</a>
<a id='line_1062'>    There lies the Duke asleep; and there the keys.</a>
<a id='line_1063'>    I'll to the King and signify to him</a>
<a id='line_1064'>    That thus I have resign'd to you my charge.</a>
<a id='line_1065'>  FIRST MURDERER. You may, sir; 'tis a point of wisdom. Fare</a>
<a id='line_1066'>    you well.                       Exeunt BRAKENBURY and KEEPER</a>
<a id='line_1067'>  SECOND MURDERER. What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?</a>
<a id='line_1068'>  FIRST MURDERER. No; he'll say 'twas done cowardly, when</a>
<a id='line_1069'>    he wakes.</a>
<a id='line_1070'>  SECOND MURDERER. Why, he shall never wake until the great</a>
<a id='line_1071'>    judgment-day.</a>
<a id='line_1072'>  FIRST MURDERER. Why, then he'll say we stabb'd him</a>
<a id='line_1073'>    sleeping.</a>
<a id='line_1074'>  SECOND MURDERER. The urging of that word judgment hath</a>
<a id='line_1075'>    bred a kind of remorse in me.</a>
<a id='line_1076'>  FIRST MURDERER. What, art thou afraid?</a>
<a id='line_1077'>  SECOND MURDERER. Not to kill him, having a warrant; but to</a>
<a id='line_1078'>    be damn'd for killing him, from the which no warrant can</a>
<a id='line_1079'>    defend me.</a>
<a id='line_1080'>  FIRST MURDERER. I thought thou hadst been resolute.</a>
<a id='line_1081'>  SECOND MURDERER. So I am, to let him live.</a>
<a id='line_1082'>  FIRST MURDERER. I'll back to the Duke of Gloucester and</a>
<a id='line_1083'>    tell him so.</a>
<a id='line_1084'>  SECOND MURDERER. Nay, I prithee, stay a little. I hope this</a>
<a id='line_1085'>    passionate humour of mine will change; it was wont to</a>
<a id='line_1086'>    hold me but while one tells twenty.</a>
<a id='line_1087'>  FIRST MURDERER. How dost thou feel thyself now?</a>
<a id='line_1088'>    SECOND MURDERER. Faith, some certain dregs of conscience</a>
<a id='line_1089'>    are yet within me.</a>
<a id='line_1090'>  FIRST MURDERER. Remember our reward, when the deed's</a>
<a id='line_1091'>    done.</a>
<a id='line_1092'>  SECOND MURDERER. Zounds, he dies; I had forgot the reward.</a>
<a id='line_1093'>  FIRST MURDERER. Where's thy conscience now?</a>
<a id='line_1094'>  SECOND MURDERER. O, in the Duke of Gloucester's purse!</a>
<a id='line_1095'>  FIRST MURDERER. When he opens his purse to give us our</a>
<a id='line_1096'>    reward, thy conscience flies out.</a>
<a id='line_1097'>  SECOND MURDERER. 'Tis no matter; let it go; there's few or</a>
<a id='line_1098'>    none will entertain it.</a>
<a id='line_1099'>  FIRST MURDERER. What if it come to thee again?</a>
<a id='line_1100'>  SECOND MURDERER. I'll not meddle with it-it makes a man</a>
<a id='line_1101'>    coward: a man cannot steal, but it accuseth him; a man</a>
<a id='line_1102'>    cannot swear, but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his</a>
<a id='line_1103'>    neighbour's wife, but it detects him. 'Tis a blushing shame-</a>
<a id='line_1104'>    fac'd spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills a man</a>
<a id='line_1105'>    full of obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold</a>
<a id='line_1106'>    that-by chance I found. It beggars any man that keeps it.</a>
<a id='line_1107'>    It is turn'd out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing;</a>
<a id='line_1108'>    and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust</a>
<a id='line_1109'>    to himself and live without it.</a>
<a id='line_1110'>  FIRST MURDERER. Zounds, 'tis even now at my elbow,</a>
<a id='line_1111'>    persuading me not to kill the Duke.</a>
<a id='line_1112'>  SECOND MURDERER. Take the devil in thy mind and believe</a>
<a id='line_1113'>    him not; he would insinuate with thee but to make the</a>
<a id='line_1114'>    sigh.</a>
<a id='line_1115'>  FIRST MURDERER. I am strong-fram'd; he cannot prevail with</a>
<a id='line_1116'>    me.</a>
<a id='line_1117'>  SECOND MURDERER. Spoke like a tall man that respects thy</a>
<a id='line_1118'>    reputation. Come, shall we fall to work?</a>
<a id='line_1119'>  FIRST MURDERER. Take him on the costard with the hilts of</a>
<a id='line_1120'>    thy sword, and then chop him in the malmsey-butt in the</a>
<a id='line_1121'>    next room.</a>
<a id='line_1122'>  SECOND MURDERER. O excellent device! and make a sop of</a>
<a id='line_1123'>    him.</a>
<a id='line_1124'>  FIRST MURDERER. Soft! he wakes.</a>
<a id='line_1125'>  SECOND MURDERER. Strike!</a>
<a id='line_1126'>  FIRST MURDERER. No, we'll reason with him.</a>
<a id='line_1127'>  CLARENCE. Where art thou, Keeper? Give me a cup of wine.</a>
<a id='line_1128'>  SECOND MURDERER. You shall have wine enough, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_1129'>    anon.</a>
<a id='line_1130'>  CLARENCE. In God's name, what art thou?</a>
<a id='line_1131'>  FIRST MURDERER. A man, as you are.</a>
<a id='line_1132'>  CLARENCE. But not as I am, royal.</a>
<a id='line_1133'>  SECOND MURDERER. Nor you as we are, loyal.</a>
<a id='line_1134'>  CLARENCE. Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.</a>
<a id='line_1135'>  FIRST MURDERER. My voice is now the King's, my looks</a>
<a id='line_1136'>    mine own.</a>
<a id='line_1137'>  CLARENCE. How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!</a>
<a id='line_1138'>    Your eyes do menace me. Why look you pale?</a>
<a id='line_1139'>    Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?</a>
<a id='line_1140'>  SECOND MURDERER. To, to, to-</a>
<a id='line_1141'>  CLARENCE. To murder me?</a>
<a id='line_1142'>  BOTH MURDERERS. Ay, ay.</a>
<a id='line_1143'>  CLARENCE. You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,</a>
<a id='line_1144'>    And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.</a>
<a id='line_1145'>    Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?</a>
<a id='line_1146'>  FIRST MURDERER. Offended us you have not, but the King.</a>
<a id='line_1147'>  CLARENCE. I shall be reconcil'd to him again.</a>
<a id='line_1148'>  SECOND MURDERER. Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.</a>
<a id='line_1149'>  CLARENCE. Are you drawn forth among a world of men</a>
<a id='line_1150'>    To slay the innocent? What is my offence?</a>
<a id='line_1151'>    Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?</a>
<a id='line_1152'>    What lawful quest have given their verdict up</a>
<a id='line_1153'>    Unto the frowning judge, or who pronounc'd</a>
<a id='line_1154'>    The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?</a>
<a id='line_1155'>    Before I be convict by course of law,</a>
<a id='line_1156'>    To threaten me with death is most unlawful.</a>

<a id='line_1162'>  SECOND MURDERER. And he that hath commanded is our</a>

<a id='line_1164'>  CLARENCE. Erroneous vassals! the great King of kings</a>
<a id='line_1165'>    Hath in the tables of his law commanded</a>
<a id='line_1166'>    That thou shalt do no murder. Will you then</a>

<a id='line_1168'>    Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hand</a>
<a id='line_1169'>    To hurl upon their heads that break his law.</a>
<a id='line_1170'>  SECOND MURDERER. And that same vengeance doth he hurl</a>
<a id='line_1171'>    on thee</a>
<a id='line_1172'>    For false forswearing, and for murder too;</a>
<a id='line_1173'>    Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight</a>

<a id='line_1619'></a>
<a id='line_1620'>  FIRST CITIZEN. Good morrow, neighbour. Whither away so</a>
<a id='line_1621'>    fast?</a>
<a id='line_1622'>  SECOND CITIZEN. I promise you, I scarcely know myself.</a>
<a id='line_1623'>    Hear you the news abroad?</a>
<a id='line_1624'>  FIRST CITIZEN. Yes, that the King is dead.</a>
<a id='line_1625'>  SECOND CITIZEN. Ill news, by'r lady; seldom comes the</a>
<a id='line_1626'>    better.</a>
<a id='line_1627'>    I fear, I fear 'twill prove a giddy world.</a>
<a id='line_1628'></a>

<a id='line_1630'></a>
<a id='line_1631'>  THIRD CITIZEN. Neighbours, God speed!</a>
<a id='line_1632'>  FIRST CITIZEN. Give you good morrow, sir.</a>
<a id='line_1633'>  THIRD CITIZEN. Doth the news hold of good King Edward's</a>
<a id='line_1634'>    death?</a>
<a id='line_1635'>  SECOND CITIZEN. Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!</a>
<a id='line_1636'>  THIRD CITIZEN. Then, masters, look to see a troublous</a>
<a id='line_1637'>    world.</a>
<a id='line_1638'>  FIRST CITIZEN. No, no; by God's good grace, his son shall</a>
<a id='line_1639'>    reign.</a>
<a id='line_1640'>  THIRD CITIZEN. Woe to that land that's govern'd by a child.</a>
<a id='line_1641'>  SECOND CITIZEN. In him there is a hope of government,</a>
<a id='line_1642'>    Which, in his nonage, council under him,</a>
<a id='line_1643'>    And, in his full and ripened years, himself,</a>
<a id='line_1644'>    No doubt, shall then, and till then, govern well.</a>
<a id='line_1645'>  FIRST CITIZEN. So stood the state when Henry the Sixth</a>
<a id='line_1646'>    Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.</a>
<a id='line_1647'>  THIRD CITIZEN. Stood the state so? No, no, good friends,</a>
<a id='line_1648'>    God wot;</a>
<a id='line_1649'>    For then this land was famously enrich'd</a>
<a id='line_1650'>    With politic grave counsel; then the King</a>
<a id='line_1651'>    Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace.</a>
<a id='line_1652'>  FIRST CITIZEN. Why, so hath this, both by his father and</a>
<a id='line_1653'>    mother.</a>

<a id='line_1655'>    Or by his father there were none at all;</a>
<a id='line_1656'>    For emulation who shall now be nearest</a>
<a id='line_1657'>    Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.</a>
<a id='line_1658'>    O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!</a>
<a id='line_1659'>    And the Queen's sons and brothers haught and proud;</a>
<a id='line_1660'>    And were they to be rul'd, and not to rule,</a>
<a id='line_1661'>    This sickly land might solace as before.</a>
<a id='line_1662'>  FIRST CITIZEN. Come, come, we fear the worst; all will be</a>
<a id='line_1663'>    well.</a>
<a id='line_1664'>  THIRD CITIZEN. When clouds are seen, wise men put on</a>
<a id='line_1665'>    their cloaks;</a>
<a id='line_1666'>    When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand;</a>
<a id='line_1667'>    When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?</a>
<a id='line_1668'>    Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.</a>

<a id='line_1670'>    'Tis more than we deserve or I expect.</a>
<a id='line_1671'>  SECOND CITIZEN. Truly, the hearts of men are fun of fear.</a>
<a id='line_1672'>    You cannot reason almost with a man</a>
<a id='line_1673'>    That looks not heavily and fun of dread.</a>
<a id='line_1674'>  THIRD CITIZEN. Before the days of change, still is it so;</a>
<a id='line_1675'>    By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust</a>
<a id='line_1676'>    Ensuing danger; as by proof we see</a>

<a id='line_1678'>    But leave it all to God. Whither away?</a>

<a id='line_1690'>  ARCHBISHOP. Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford,</a>

<a id='line_1692'>    To-morrow or next day they will be here.</a>

<a id='line_1694'>    I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.</a>
<a id='line_1695'>  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But I hear no; they say my son of York</a>
<a id='line_1696'>    Has almost overta'en him in his growth.</a>
<a id='line_1697'>  YORK. Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.</a>
<a id='line_1698'>  DUCHESS. Why, my good cousin, it is good to grow.</a>
<a id='line_1699'>  YORK. Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,</a>
<a id='line_1700'>    My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow</a>
<a id='line_1701'>    More than my brother. 'Ay,' quoth my uncle Gloucester</a>
<a id='line_1702'>    'Small herbs have grace: great weeds do grow apace.'</a>
<a id='line_1703'>    And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,</a>
<a id='line_1704'>    Because sweet flow'rs are slow and weeds make haste.</a>

<a id='line_1706'>    In him that did object the same to thee.</a>

<a id='line_1712'>  YORK. Now, by my troth, if I had been rememb'red,</a>
<a id='line_1713'>    I could have given my uncle's Grace a flout</a>

<a id='line_1715'>  DUCHESS. How, my young York? I prithee let me hear it.</a>
<a id='line_1716'>  YORK. Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast</a>
<a id='line_1717'>    That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old.</a>
<a id='line_1718'>    'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.</a>

<a id='line_1782'>  BUCKINGHAM. Welcome, sweet Prince, to London, to your</a>

<a id='line_1784'>  GLOUCESTER. Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign.</a>
<a id='line_1785'>    The weary way hath made you melancholy.</a>
<a id='line_1786'>  PRINCE. No, uncle; but our crosses on the way</a>
<a id='line_1787'>    Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.</a>
<a id='line_1788'>    I want more uncles here to welcome me.</a>
<a id='line_1789'>  GLOUCESTER. Sweet Prince, the untainted virtue of your</a>
<a id='line_1790'>    years</a>
<a id='line_1791'>    Hath not yet div'd into the world's deceit;</a>
<a id='line_1792'>    Nor more can you distinguish of a man</a>
<a id='line_1793'>    Than of his outward show; which, God He knows,</a>
<a id='line_1794'>    Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.</a>
<a id='line_1795'>    Those uncles which you want were dangerous;</a>
<a id='line_1796'>    Your Grace attended to their sug'red words</a>
<a id='line_1797'>    But look'd not on the poison of their hearts.</a>
<a id='line_1798'>    God keep you from them and from such false friends!</a>
<a id='line_1799'>  PRINCE. God keep me from false friends! but they were</a>
<a id='line_1800'>    none.</a>
<a id='line_1801'>  GLOUCESTER. My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet</a>

<a id='line_1806'>  MAYOR. God bless your Grace with health and happy days!</a>
<a id='line_1807'>  PRINCE. I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.</a>
<a id='line_1808'>    I thought my mother and my brother York</a>
<a id='line_1809'>    Would long ere this have met us on the way.</a>
<a id='line_1810'>    Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not</a>

<a id='line_1815'>  BUCKINGHAM. And, in good time, here comes the sweating</a>
<a id='line_1816'>    Lord.</a>
<a id='line_1817'>  PRINCE. Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?</a>
<a id='line_1818'>  HASTINGS. On what occasion, God He knows, not I,</a>
<a id='line_1819'>    The Queen your mother and your brother York</a>
<a id='line_1820'>    Have taken sanctuary. The tender Prince</a>
<a id='line_1821'>    Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace,</a>
<a id='line_1822'>    But by his mother was perforce withheld.</a>
<a id='line_1823'>  BUCKINGHAM. Fie, what an indirect and peevish course</a>
<a id='line_1824'>    Is this of hers? Lord Cardinal, will your Grace</a>
<a id='line_1825'>    Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York</a>
<a id='line_1826'>    Unto his princely brother presently?</a>
<a id='line_1827'>    If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him</a>
<a id='line_1828'>    And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.</a>
<a id='line_1829'>  CARDINAL. My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory</a>
<a id='line_1830'>    Can from his mother win the Duke of York,</a>
<a id='line_1831'>    Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate</a>
<a id='line_1832'>    To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid</a>
<a id='line_1833'>    We should infringe the holy privilege</a>
<a id='line_1834'>    Of blessed sanctuary! Not for all this land</a>
<a id='line_1835'>    Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.</a>
<a id='line_1836'>  BUCKINGHAM. You are too senseless-obstinate, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_1837'>    Too ceremonious and traditional.</a>
<a id='line_1838'>    Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,</a>
<a id='line_1839'>    You break not sanctuary in seizing him.</a>
<a id='line_1840'>    The benefit thereof is always granted</a>
<a id='line_1841'>    To those whose dealings have deserv'd the place</a>
<a id='line_1842'>    And those who have the wit to claim the place.</a>
<a id='line_1843'>    This Prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserv'd it,</a>
<a id='line_1844'>    And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.</a>
<a id='line_1845'>    Then, taking him from thence that is not there,</a>
<a id='line_1846'>    You break no privilege nor charter there.</a>
<a id='line_1847'>    Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;</a>
<a id='line_1848'>    But sanctuary children never till now.</a>
<a id='line_1849'>  CARDINAL. My lord, you shall o'errule my mind for once.</a>
<a id='line_1850'>    Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?</a>
<a id='line_1851'>  HASTINGS. I go, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_1852'>  PRINCE. Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.</a>
<a id='line_1853'>                                    Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS</a>
<a id='line_1854'>    Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,</a>
<a id='line_1855'>    Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?</a>
<a id='line_1856'>  GLOUCESTER. Where it seems best unto your royal self.</a>
<a id='line_1857'>    If I may counsel you, some day or two</a>
<a id='line_1858'>    Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower,</a>
<a id='line_1859'>    Then where you please and shall be thought most fit</a>
<a id='line_1860'>    For your best health and recreation.</a>
<a id='line_1861'>  PRINCE. I do not like the Tower, of any place.</a>
<a id='line_1862'>    Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?</a>
<a id='line_1863'>  BUCKINGHAM. He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,</a>
<a id='line_1864'>    Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.</a>
<a id='line_1865'>  PRINCE. Is it upon record, or else reported</a>
<a id='line_1866'>    Successively from age to age, he built it?</a>
<a id='line_1867'>  BUCKINGHAM. Upon record, my gracious lord.</a>
<a id='line_1868'>  PRINCE. But say, my lord, it were not regist'red,</a>
<a id='line_1869'>    Methinks the truth should Eve from age to age,</a>
<a id='line_1870'>    As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,</a>
<a id='line_1871'>    Even to the general all-ending day.</a>
<a id='line_1872'>  GLOUCESTER.  [Aside]  So wise so young, they say, do never</a>
<a id='line_1873'>    live long.</a>
<a id='line_1874'>  PRINCE. What say you, uncle?</a>
<a id='line_1875'>  GLOUCESTER. I say, without characters, fame lives long.</a>
<a id='line_1876'>    [Aside]  Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,</a>
<a id='line_1877'>    I moralize two meanings in one word.</a>
<a id='line_1878'>  PRINCE. That Julius Caesar was a famous man;</a>
<a id='line_1879'>    With what his valour did enrich his wit,</a>
<a id='line_1880'>    His wit set down to make his valour live.</a>
<a id='line_1881'>    Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;</a>
<a id='line_1882'>    For now he lives in fame, though not in life.</a>
<a id='line_1883'>    I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham-</a>
<a id='line_1884'>  BUCKINGHAM. What, my gracious lord?</a>
<a id='line_1885'>  PRINCE. An if I live until I be a man,</a>
<a id='line_1886'>    I'll win our ancient right in France again,</a>
<a id='line_1887'>    Or die a soldier as I liv'd a king.</a>
<a id='line_1888'>  GLOUCESTER.  [Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward</a>
<a id='line_1889'>    spring.</a>
<a id='line_1890'></a>
<a id='line_1891'>              Enter HASTINGS, young YORK, and the CARDINAL</a>
<a id='line_1892'></a>
<a id='line_1893'>  BUCKINGHAM. Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of</a>
<a id='line_1894'>    York.</a>
<a id='line_1895'>  PRINCE. Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?</a>
<a id='line_1896'>  YORK. Well, my dread lord; so must I can you now.</a>
<a id='line_1897'>  PRINCE. Ay brother, to our grief, as it is yours.</a>
<a id='line_1898'>    Too late he died that might have kept that title,</a>
<a id='line_1899'>    Which by his death hath lost much majesty.</a>
<a id='line_1900'>  GLOUCESTER. How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?</a>
<a id='line_1901'>  YORK. I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_1902'>    You said that idle weeds are fast in growth.</a>
<a id='line_1903'>    The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far.</a>
<a id='line_1904'>  GLOUCESTER. He hath, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_1905'>  YORK. And therefore is he idle?</a>
<a id='line_1906'>  GLOUCESTER. O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.</a>
<a id='line_1907'>  YORK. Then he is more beholding to you than I.</a>
<a id='line_1908'>  GLOUCESTER. He may command me as my sovereign;</a>
<a id='line_1909'>    But you have power in me as in a kinsman.</a>
<a id='line_1910'>  YORK. I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.</a>
<a id='line_1911'>  GLOUCESTER. My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart!</a>
<a id='line_1912'>  PRINCE. A beggar, brother?</a>
<a id='line_1913'>  YORK. Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,</a>
<a id='line_1914'>    And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.</a>
<a id='line_1915'>  GLOUCESTER. A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.</a>
<a id='line_1916'>  YORK. A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it!</a>
<a id='line_1917'>  GLOUCESTER. Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.</a>
<a id='line_1918'>  YORK. O, then, I see you will part but with light gifts:</a>
<a id='line_1919'>    In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.</a>
<a id='line_1920'>  GLOUCESTER. It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.</a>
<a id='line_1921'>  YORK. I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.</a>
<a id='line_1922'>  GLOUCESTER. What, would you have my weapon, little</a>
<a id='line_1923'>    Lord?</a>
<a id='line_1924'>  YORK. I would, that I might thank you as you call me.</a>
<a id='line_1925'>  GLOUCESTER. How?</a>
<a id='line_1926'>  YORK. Little.</a>
<a id='line_1927'>  PRINCE. My Lord of York will still be cross in talk.</a>
<a id='line_1928'>    Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.</a>
<a id='line_1929'>  YORK. You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.</a>
<a id='line_1930'>    Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;</a>
<a id='line_1931'>    Because that I am little, like an ape,</a>
<a id='line_1932'>    He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.</a>
<a id='line_1933'>  BUCKINGHAM. With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!</a>
<a id='line_1934'>    To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle</a>
<a id='line_1935'>    He prettily and aptly taunts himself.</a>
<a id='line_1936'>    So cunning and so young is wonderful.</a>
<a id='line_1937'>  GLOUCESTER. My lord, will't please you pass along?</a>
<a id='line_1938'>    Myself and my good cousin Buckingham</a>
<a id='line_1939'>    Will to your mother, to entreat of her</a>
<a id='line_1940'>    To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.</a>
<a id='line_1941'>  YORK. What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?</a>
<a id='line_1942'>  PRINCE. My Lord Protector needs will have it so.</a>
<a id='line_1943'>  YORK. I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.</a>
<a id='line_1944'>  GLOUCESTER. Why, what should you fear?</a>
<a id='line_1945'>  YORK. Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost.</a>
<a id='line_1946'>    My grandam told me he was murder'd there.</a>
<a id='line_1947'>  PRINCE. I fear no uncles dead.</a>
<a id='line_1948'>  GLOUCESTER. Nor none that live, I hope.</a>
<a id='line_1949'>  PRINCE. An if they live, I hope I need not fear.</a>
<a id='line_1950'>    But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,</a>
<a id='line_1951'>    Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.</a>
<a id='line_1952'>    A sennet.</a>
<a id='line_1953'>              Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, and CATESBY</a>
<a id='line_1954'>  BUCKINGHAM. Think you, my lord, this little prating York</a>
<a id='line_1955'>    Was not incensed by his subtle mother</a>
<a id='line_1956'>    To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?</a>
<a id='line_1957'>  GLOUCESTER. No doubt, no doubt. O, 'tis a perilous boy;</a>
<a id='line_1958'>    Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.</a>
<a id='line_1959'>    He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.</a>
<a id='line_1960'>  BUCKINGHAM. Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.</a>
<a id='line_1961'>    Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend</a>
<a id='line_1962'>    As closely to conceal what we impart.</a>
<a id='line_1963'>    Thou know'st our reasons urg'd upon the way.</a>
<a id='line_1964'>    What think'st thou? Is it not an easy matter</a>
<a id='line_1965'>    To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,</a>
<a id='line_1966'>    For the instalment of this noble Duke</a>
<a id='line_1967'>    In the seat royal of this famous isle?</a>
<a id='line_1968'>  CATESBY. He for his father's sake so loves the Prince</a>
<a id='line_1969'>    That he will not be won to aught against him.</a>
<a id='line_1970'>  BUCKINGHAM. What think'st thou then of Stanley? Will</a>
<a id='line_1971'>    not he?</a>
<a id='line_1972'>  CATESBY. He will do all in all as Hastings doth.</a>
<a id='line_1973'>  BUCKINGHAM. Well then, no more but this: go, gentle</a>
<a id='line_1974'>    Catesby,</a>
<a id='line_1975'>    And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings</a>
<a id='line_1976'>    How he doth stand affected to our purpose;</a>
<a id='line_1977'>    And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,</a>

<a id='line_1981'>    If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling,</a>
<a id='line_1982'>    Be thou so too, and so break off the talk,</a>

<a id='line_1999'>    perceive</a>
<a id='line_2000'>    Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?</a>
<a id='line_2001'>  GLOUCESTER. Chop off his head-something we will</a>

<a id='line_2003'>    And, look when I am King, claim thou of me</a>
<a id='line_2004'>    The earldom of Hereford and all the movables</a>

<a id='line_2062'>  CATESBY. It is a reeling world indeed, my lord;</a>
<a id='line_2063'>    And I believe will never stand upright</a>

<a id='line_2075'>    That this same very day your enemies,</a>

<a id='line_2345'>    thy colour,</a>
<a id='line_2346'>    Murder thy breath in middle of a word,</a>
<a id='line_2347'>    And then again begin, and stop again,</a>

<a id='line_2349'>  BUCKINGHAM. Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;</a>

<a id='line_2351'>    Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,</a>

<a id='line_2356'>    But what, is Catesby gone?</a>
<a id='line_2357'>  GLOUCESTER. He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.</a>

<a id='line_2370'></a>
<a id='line_2371'>  GLOUCESTER. Be patient; they are friends-Ratcliff and Lovel.</a>
<a id='line_2372'>  LOVEL. Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,</a>
<a id='line_2373'>    The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.</a>
<a id='line_2374'>  GLOUCESTER. So dear I lov'd the man that I must weep.</a>
<a id='line_2375'>    I took him for the plainest harmless creature</a>
<a id='line_2376'>    That breath'd upon the earth a Christian;</a>
<a id='line_2377'>    Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded</a>
<a id='line_2378'>    The history of all her secret thoughts.</a>
<a id='line_2379'>    So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue</a>
<a id='line_2380'>    That, his apparent open guilt omitted,</a>
<a id='line_2381'>    I mean his conversation with Shore's wife-</a>
<a id='line_2382'>    He liv'd from all attainder of suspects.</a>
<a id='line_2383'>  BUCKINGHAM. Well, well, he was the covert'st shelt'red</a>
<a id='line_2384'>    traitor</a>

<a id='line_2386'>    Would you imagine, or almost believe-</a>

<a id='line_2389'>    This day had plotted, in the council-house,</a>
<a id='line_2390'>    To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester.</a>
<a id='line_2391'>  MAYOR. Had he done so?</a>
<a id='line_2392'>  GLOUCESTER. What! think you we are Turks or Infidels?</a>

<a id='line_2397'>    Enforc'd us to this execution?</a>
<a id='line_2398'>  MAYOR. Now, fair befall you! He deserv'd his death;</a>
<a id='line_2399'>    And your good Graces both have well proceeded</a>
<a id='line_2400'>    To warn false traitors from the like attempts.</a>
<a id='line_2401'>    I never look'd for better at his hands</a>
<a id='line_2402'>    After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.</a>

<a id='line_2406'>    Something against our meanings, have prevented-</a>

<a id='line_2409'>    The manner and the purpose of his treasons:</a>
<a id='line_2410'>    That you might well have signified the same</a>
<a id='line_2411'>    Unto the citizens, who haply may</a>
<a id='line_2412'>    Misconster us in him and wail his death.</a>
<a id='line_2413'>  MAYOR. But, my good lord, your Grace's words shall serve</a>

<a id='line_2415'>    And do not doubt, right noble Princes both,</a>

<a id='line_2445'>    Yet touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off;</a>
<a id='line_2446'>    Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.</a>

<a id='line_2518'>    Star'd each on other, and look'd deadly pale.</a>
<a id='line_2519'>    Which when I saw, I reprehended them,</a>

<a id='line_2527'>    At lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps,</a>
<a id='line_2528'>    And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'</a>

<a id='line_2636'>    Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,</a>
<a id='line_2637'>    And almost should'red in the swallowing gulf</a>
<a id='line_2638'>    Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion.</a>
<a id='line_2639'>    Which to recure, we heartily solicit</a>

<a id='line_2653'>    If not to answer, you might haply think</a>
<a id='line_2654'>    Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded</a>
<a id='line_2655'>    To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,</a>

<a id='line_2665'>    First, if all obstacles were cut away,</a>
<a id='line_2666'>    And that my path were even to the crown,</a>
<a id='line_2667'>    As the ripe revenue and due of birth,</a>
<a id='line_2668'>    Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,</a>
<a id='line_2669'>    So mighty and so many my defects,</a>
<a id='line_2670'>    That I would rather hide me from my greatness-</a>

<a id='line_2672'>    Than in my greatness covet to be hid,</a>
<a id='line_2673'>    And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.</a>
<a id='line_2674'>    But, God be thank'd, there is no need of me-</a>

<a id='line_2685'>    But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,</a>
<a id='line_2686'>    All circumstances well considered.</a>
<a id='line_2687'>    You say that Edward is your brother's son.</a>
<a id='line_2688'>    So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;</a>

<a id='line_2695'>    A beauty-waning and distressed widow,</a>
<a id='line_2696'>    Even in the afternoon of her best days,</a>
<a id='line_2697'>    Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,</a>
<a id='line_2698'>    Seduc'd the pitch and height of his degree</a>
<a id='line_2699'>    To base declension and loath'd bigamy.</a>
<a id='line_2700'>    By her, in his unlawful bed, he got</a>
<a id='line_2701'>    This Edward, whom our manners call the Prince.</a>
<a id='line_2702'>    More bitterly could I expostulate,</a>

<a id='line_2705'>    Then, good my lord, take to your royal self</a>
<a id='line_2706'>    This proffer'd benefit of dignity;</a>
<a id='line_2707'>    If not to bless us and the land withal,</a>
<a id='line_2708'>    Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry</a>
<a id='line_2709'>    From the corruption of abusing times</a>
<a id='line_2710'>    Unto a lineal true-derived course.</a>
<a id='line_2711'>  MAYOR. Do, good my lord; your citizens entreat you.</a>
<a id='line_2712'>  BUCKINGHAM. Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.</a>

<a id='line_2751'>  MAYOR. God bless your Grace! We see it, and will say it.</a>
<a id='line_2752'>  GLOUCESTER. In saying so, you shall but say the truth.</a>
