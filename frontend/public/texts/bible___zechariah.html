<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word</a>
<a id='line_4'>of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the</a>
<a id='line_5'>prophet, saying, 1:2 The LORD hath been sore displeased with your</a>
<a id='line_6'>fathers.</a>
<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>1:3 Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn</a>
<a id='line_9'>ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith</a>
<a id='line_10'>the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_11'></a>
<a id='line_12'>1:4 Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have</a>
<a id='line_13'>cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your</a>
<a id='line_14'>evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor</a>
<a id='line_15'>hearken unto me, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_16'></a>
<a id='line_17'>1:5 Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for</a>
<a id='line_18'>ever?  1:6 But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants</a>
<a id='line_19'>the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they</a>
<a id='line_20'>returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us,</a>
<a id='line_21'>according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt</a>
<a id='line_22'>with us.</a>
<a id='line_23'></a>
<a id='line_24'>1:7 Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is</a>
<a id='line_25'>the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the</a>
<a id='line_26'>LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the</a>
<a id='line_27'>prophet, saying, 1:8 I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a</a>
<a id='line_28'>red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the</a>
<a id='line_29'>bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.</a>
<a id='line_30'></a>
<a id='line_31'>1:9 Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked</a>
<a id='line_32'>with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.</a>
<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'>1:10 And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said,</a>
<a id='line_35'>These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the</a>
<a id='line_36'>earth.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>1:11 And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the</a>
<a id='line_39'>myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth,</a>
<a id='line_40'>and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.</a>
<a id='line_41'></a>
<a id='line_42'>1:12 Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts,</a>
<a id='line_43'>how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of</a>
<a id='line_44'>Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and</a>
<a id='line_45'>ten years?  1:13 And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me</a>
<a id='line_46'>with good words and comfortable words.</a>
<a id='line_47'></a>
<a id='line_48'>1:14 So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou,</a>
<a id='line_49'>saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and</a>
<a id='line_50'>for Zion with a great jealousy.</a>
<a id='line_51'></a>
<a id='line_52'>1:15 And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease:</a>
<a id='line_53'>for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the</a>
<a id='line_54'>affliction.</a>
<a id='line_55'></a>
<a id='line_56'>1:16 Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with</a>
<a id='line_57'>mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a</a>
<a id='line_58'>line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_59'></a>
<a id='line_60'>1:17 Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through</a>
<a id='line_61'>prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort</a>
<a id='line_62'>Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>1:18 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.</a>
<a id='line_65'></a>
<a id='line_66'>1:19 And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And</a>
<a id='line_67'>he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah,</a>
<a id='line_68'>Israel, and Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_69'></a>
<a id='line_70'>1:20 And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.</a>
<a id='line_71'></a>
<a id='line_72'>1:21 Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These</a>
<a id='line_73'>are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up</a>
<a id='line_74'>his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of</a>
<a id='line_75'>the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to</a>
<a id='line_76'>scatter it.</a>
<a id='line_77'></a>
<a id='line_78'>2:1 I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a</a>
<a id='line_79'>measuring line in his hand.</a>
<a id='line_80'></a>
<a id='line_81'>2:2 Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure</a>
<a id='line_82'>Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length</a>
<a id='line_83'>thereof.</a>
<a id='line_84'></a>
<a id='line_85'>2:3 And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another</a>
<a id='line_86'>angel went out to meet him, 2:4 And said unto him, Run, speak to this</a>
<a id='line_87'>young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls</a>
<a id='line_88'>for the multitude of men and cattle therein: 2:5 For I, saith the</a>
<a id='line_89'>LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the</a>
<a id='line_90'>glory in the midst of her.</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>2:6 Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith the</a>
<a id='line_93'>LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven,</a>
<a id='line_94'>saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_95'></a>
<a id='line_96'>2:7 Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of</a>
<a id='line_97'>Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_98'></a>
<a id='line_99'>2:8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me</a>
<a id='line_100'>unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth</a>
<a id='line_101'>the apple of his eye.</a>
<a id='line_102'></a>
<a id='line_103'>2:9 For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a</a>
<a id='line_104'>spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath</a>
<a id='line_105'>sent me.</a>
<a id='line_106'></a>
<a id='line_107'>2:10 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will</a>
<a id='line_108'>dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>
<a id='line_110'>2:11 And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and</a>
<a id='line_111'>shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou</a>
<a id='line_112'>shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_113'></a>
<a id='line_114'>2:12 And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land,</a>
<a id='line_115'>and shall choose Jerusalem again.</a>
<a id='line_116'></a>
<a id='line_117'>2:13 Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out</a>
<a id='line_118'>of his holy habitation.</a>
<a id='line_119'></a>
<a id='line_120'>3:1 And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel</a>
<a id='line_121'>of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.</a>
<a id='line_122'></a>
<a id='line_123'>3:2 And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even</a>
<a id='line_124'>the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand</a>
<a id='line_125'>plucked out of the fire?  3:3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy</a>
<a id='line_126'>garments, and stood before the angel.</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>3:4 And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him,</a>
<a id='line_129'>saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said,</a>
<a id='line_130'>Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will</a>
<a id='line_131'>clothe thee with change of raiment.</a>
<a id='line_132'></a>
<a id='line_133'>3:5 And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a</a>
<a id='line_134'>fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel</a>
<a id='line_135'>of the LORD stood by.</a>
<a id='line_136'></a>
<a id='line_137'>3:6 And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying, 3:7 Thus</a>
<a id='line_138'>saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou</a>
<a id='line_139'>wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt</a>
<a id='line_140'>also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these</a>
<a id='line_141'>that stand by.</a>
<a id='line_142'></a>
<a id='line_143'>3:8 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit</a>
<a id='line_144'>before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring</a>
<a id='line_145'>forth my servant the BRANCH.</a>
<a id='line_146'></a>
<a id='line_147'>3:9 For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one</a>
<a id='line_148'>stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof,</a>
<a id='line_149'>saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land</a>
<a id='line_150'>in one day.</a>
<a id='line_151'></a>
<a id='line_152'>3:10 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his</a>
<a id='line_153'>neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.</a>
<a id='line_154'></a>
<a id='line_155'>4:1 And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a</a>
<a id='line_156'>man that is wakened out of his sleep.</a>
<a id='line_157'></a>
<a id='line_158'>4:2 And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and</a>
<a id='line_159'>behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and</a>
<a id='line_160'>his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are</a>
<a id='line_161'>upon the top thereof: 4:3 And two olive trees by it, one upon the</a>
<a id='line_162'>right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>4:4 So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying,</a>
<a id='line_165'>What are these, my lord?  4:5 Then the angel that talked with me</a>
<a id='line_166'>answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said,</a>
<a id='line_167'>No, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_168'></a>
<a id='line_169'>4:6 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of</a>
<a id='line_170'>the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by</a>
<a id='line_171'>my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_172'></a>
<a id='line_173'>4:7 Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_174'>become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with</a>
<a id='line_175'>shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>4:8 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 4:9 The hands</a>
<a id='line_178'>of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall</a>
<a id='line_179'>also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent</a>
<a id='line_180'>me unto you.</a>
<a id='line_181'></a>
<a id='line_182'>4:10 For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall</a>
<a id='line_183'>rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with</a>
<a id='line_184'>those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro</a>
<a id='line_185'>through the whole earth.</a>
<a id='line_186'></a>
<a id='line_187'>4:11 Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive</a>
<a id='line_188'>trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side</a>
<a id='line_189'>thereof?  4:12 And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these</a>
<a id='line_190'>two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden</a>
<a id='line_191'>oil out of themselves?  4:13 And he answered me and said, Knowest thou</a>
<a id='line_192'>not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_193'></a>
<a id='line_194'>4:14 Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the</a>
<a id='line_195'>LORD of the whole earth.</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>5:1 Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a</a>
<a id='line_198'>flying roll.</a>
<a id='line_199'></a>
<a id='line_200'>5:2 And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a</a>
<a id='line_201'>flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth</a>
<a id='line_202'>thereof ten cubits.</a>
<a id='line_203'></a>
<a id='line_204'>5:3 Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the</a>
<a id='line_205'>face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off</a>
<a id='line_206'>as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be</a>
<a id='line_207'>cut off as on that side according to it.</a>
<a id='line_208'></a>
<a id='line_209'>5:4 I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter</a>
<a id='line_210'>into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth</a>
<a id='line_211'>falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and</a>
<a id='line_212'>shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.</a>
<a id='line_213'></a>
<a id='line_214'>5:5 Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me,</a>
<a id='line_215'>Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>5:6 And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth</a>
<a id='line_218'>forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance through all the</a>
<a id='line_219'>earth.</a>
<a id='line_220'></a>
<a id='line_221'>5:7 And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a</a>
<a id='line_222'>woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>5:8 And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of</a>
<a id='line_225'>the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>5:9 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came</a>
<a id='line_228'>out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings</a>
<a id='line_229'>like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the</a>
<a id='line_230'>earth and the heaven.</a>
<a id='line_231'></a>
<a id='line_232'>5:10 Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these</a>
<a id='line_233'>bear the ephah?  5:11 And he said unto me, To build it an house in the</a>
<a id='line_234'>land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her</a>
<a id='line_235'>own base.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>6:1 And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold,</a>
<a id='line_238'>there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the</a>
<a id='line_239'>mountains were mountains of brass.</a>
<a id='line_240'></a>
<a id='line_241'>6:2 In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot</a>
<a id='line_242'>black horses; 6:3 And in the third chariot white horses; and in the</a>
<a id='line_243'>fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.</a>
<a id='line_244'></a>
<a id='line_245'>6:4 Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What</a>
<a id='line_246'>are these, my lord?  6:5 And the angel answered and said unto me,</a>
<a id='line_247'>These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from</a>
<a id='line_248'>standing before the LORD of all the earth.</a>
<a id='line_249'></a>
<a id='line_250'>6:6 The black horses which are therein go forth into the north</a>
<a id='line_251'>country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth</a>
<a id='line_252'>toward the south country.</a>
<a id='line_253'></a>
<a id='line_254'>6:7 And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to</a>
<a id='line_255'>and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro</a>
<a id='line_256'>through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.</a>
<a id='line_257'></a>
<a id='line_258'>6:8 Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these</a>
<a id='line_259'>that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north</a>
<a id='line_260'>country.</a>
<a id='line_261'></a>
<a id='line_262'>6:9 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 6:10 Take of them</a>
<a id='line_263'>of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which</a>
<a id='line_264'>are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the</a>
<a id='line_265'>house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; 6:11 Then take silver and gold,</a>
<a id='line_266'>and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of</a>
<a id='line_267'>Josedech, the high priest; 6:12 And speak unto him, saying, Thus</a>
<a id='line_268'>speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The</a>
<a id='line_269'>BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the</a>
<a id='line_270'>temple of the LORD: 6:13 Even he shall build the temple of the LORD;</a>
<a id='line_271'>and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne;</a>
<a id='line_272'>and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace</a>
<a id='line_273'>shall be between them both.</a>
<a id='line_274'></a>
<a id='line_275'>6:14 And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah,</a>
<a id='line_276'>and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the</a>
<a id='line_277'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_278'></a>
<a id='line_279'>6:15 And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of</a>
<a id='line_280'>the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto</a>
<a id='line_281'>you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice</a>
<a id='line_282'>of the LORD your God.</a>
<a id='line_283'></a>
<a id='line_284'>7:1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the</a>
<a id='line_285'>word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth</a>
<a id='line_286'>month, even in Chisleu; 7:2 When they had sent unto the house of God</a>
<a id='line_287'>Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD, 7:3</a>
<a id='line_288'>And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of</a>
<a id='line_289'>hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month,</a>
<a id='line_290'>separating myself, as I have done these so many years?  7:4 Then came</a>
<a id='line_291'>the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying, 7:5 Speak unto all the</a>
<a id='line_292'>people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and</a>
<a id='line_293'>mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did</a>
<a id='line_294'>ye at all fast unto me, even to me?  7:6 And when ye did eat, and when</a>
<a id='line_295'>ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?</a>
<a id='line_296'>7:7 Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the</a>
<a id='line_297'>former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and</a>
<a id='line_298'>the cities thereof round about her, when men inhabited the south and</a>
<a id='line_299'>the plain?  7:8 And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,</a>
<a id='line_300'>7:9 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment,</a>
<a id='line_301'>and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother: 7:10 And</a>
<a id='line_302'>oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor;</a>
<a id='line_303'>and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.</a>
<a id='line_304'></a>
<a id='line_305'>7:11 But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and</a>
<a id='line_306'>stopped their ears, that they should not hear.</a>
<a id='line_307'></a>
<a id='line_308'>7:12 Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should</a>
<a id='line_309'>hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his</a>
<a id='line_310'>spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the</a>
<a id='line_311'>LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_312'></a>
<a id='line_313'>7:13 Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would</a>
<a id='line_314'>not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of</a>
<a id='line_315'>hosts: 7:14 But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the</a>
<a id='line_316'>nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them,</a>
<a id='line_317'>that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant</a>
<a id='line_318'>land desolate.</a>
<a id='line_319'></a>
<a id='line_320'>8:1 Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, 8:2 Thus</a>
<a id='line_321'>saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy,</a>
<a id='line_322'>and I was jealous for her with great fury.</a>
<a id='line_323'></a>
<a id='line_324'>8:3 Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in</a>
<a id='line_325'>the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth;</a>
<a id='line_326'>and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.</a>
<a id='line_327'></a>
<a id='line_328'>8:4 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old</a>
<a id='line_329'>women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff</a>
<a id='line_330'>in his hand for very age.</a>
<a id='line_331'></a>
<a id='line_332'>8:5 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls</a>
<a id='line_333'>playing in the streets thereof.</a>
<a id='line_334'></a>
<a id='line_335'>8:6 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of</a>
<a id='line_336'>the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous</a>
<a id='line_337'>in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_338'></a>
<a id='line_339'>8:7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from</a>
<a id='line_340'>the east country, and from the west country; 8:8 And I will bring</a>
<a id='line_341'>them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall</a>
<a id='line_342'>be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_343'></a>
<a id='line_344'>8:9 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that</a>
<a id='line_345'>hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which</a>
<a id='line_346'>were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts</a>
<a id='line_347'>was laid, that the temple might be built.</a>
<a id='line_348'></a>
<a id='line_349'>8:10 For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for</a>
<a id='line_350'>beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in</a>
<a id='line_351'>because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his</a>
<a id='line_352'>neighbour.</a>
<a id='line_353'></a>
<a id='line_354'>8:11 But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the</a>
<a id='line_355'>former days, saith the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_356'></a>
<a id='line_357'>8:12 For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit,</a>
<a id='line_358'>and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give</a>
<a id='line_359'>their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all</a>
<a id='line_360'>these things.</a>
<a id='line_361'></a>
<a id='line_362'>8:13 And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the</a>
<a id='line_363'>heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you,</a>
<a id='line_364'>and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong.</a>
<a id='line_365'></a>
<a id='line_366'>8:14 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you,</a>
<a id='line_367'>when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I</a>
<a id='line_368'>repented not: 8:15 So again have I thought in these days to do well</a>
<a id='line_369'>unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.</a>
<a id='line_370'></a>
<a id='line_371'>8:16 These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the</a>
<a id='line_372'>truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in</a>
<a id='line_373'>your gates: 8:17 And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts</a>
<a id='line_374'>against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are</a>
<a id='line_375'>things that I hate, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_376'></a>
<a id='line_377'>8:18 And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying, 8:19 Thus</a>
<a id='line_378'>saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of</a>
<a id='line_379'>the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth,</a>
<a id='line_380'>shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts;</a>
<a id='line_381'>therefore love the truth and peace.</a>
<a id='line_382'></a>
<a id='line_383'>8:20 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that</a>
<a id='line_384'>there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities: 8:21 And</a>
<a id='line_385'>the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go</a>
<a id='line_386'>speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I</a>
<a id='line_387'>will go also.</a>
<a id='line_388'></a>
<a id='line_389'>8:22 Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD</a>
<a id='line_390'>of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_391'></a>
<a id='line_392'>8:23 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to</a>
<a id='line_393'>pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the</a>
<a id='line_394'>nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew,</a>
<a id='line_395'>saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you.</a>
<a id='line_396'></a>
<a id='line_397'>9:1 The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and</a>
<a id='line_398'>Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all</a>
<a id='line_399'>the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_400'></a>
<a id='line_401'>9:2 And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it</a>
<a id='line_402'>be very wise.</a>
<a id='line_403'></a>
<a id='line_404'>9:3 And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as</a>
<a id='line_405'>the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.</a>
<a id='line_406'></a>
<a id='line_407'>9:4 Behold, the LORD will cast her out, and he will smite her power in</a>
<a id='line_408'>the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.</a>
<a id='line_409'></a>
<a id='line_410'>9:5 Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be</a>
<a id='line_411'>very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and</a>
<a id='line_412'>the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</a>
<a id='line_413'></a>
<a id='line_414'>9:6 And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride</a>
<a id='line_415'>of the Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_416'></a>
<a id='line_417'>9:7 And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his</a>
<a id='line_418'>abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he,</a>
<a id='line_419'>shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and</a>
<a id='line_420'>Ekron as a Jebusite.</a>
<a id='line_421'></a>
<a id='line_422'>9:8 And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of</a>
<a id='line_423'>him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no</a>
<a id='line_424'>oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with</a>
<a id='line_425'>mine eyes.</a>
<a id='line_426'></a>
<a id='line_427'>9:9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of</a>
<a id='line_428'>Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having</a>
<a id='line_429'>salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of</a>
<a id='line_430'>an ass.</a>
<a id='line_431'></a>
<a id='line_432'>9:10 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from</a>
<a id='line_433'>Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak</a>
<a id='line_434'>peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to</a>
<a id='line_435'>sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_436'></a>
<a id='line_437'>9:11 As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth</a>
<a id='line_438'>thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.</a>
<a id='line_439'></a>
<a id='line_440'>9:12 Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do</a>
<a id='line_441'>I declare that I will render double unto thee; 9:13 When I have bent</a>
<a id='line_442'>Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O</a>
<a id='line_443'>Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a</a>
<a id='line_444'>mighty man.</a>
<a id='line_445'></a>
<a id='line_446'>9:14 And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go</a>
<a id='line_447'>forth as the lightning: and the LORD God shall blow the trumpet, and</a>
<a id='line_448'>shall go with whirlwinds of the south.</a>
<a id='line_449'></a>
<a id='line_450'>9:15 The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and</a>
<a id='line_451'>subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as</a>
<a id='line_452'>through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, and as the corners</a>
<a id='line_453'>of the altar.</a>
<a id='line_454'></a>
<a id='line_455'>9:16 And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock</a>
<a id='line_456'>of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up</a>
<a id='line_457'>as an ensign upon his land.</a>
<a id='line_458'></a>
<a id='line_459'>9:17 For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn</a>
<a id='line_460'>shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.</a>
<a id='line_461'></a>
<a id='line_462'>10:1 Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the</a>
<a id='line_463'>LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every</a>
<a id='line_464'>one grass in the field.</a>
<a id='line_465'></a>
<a id='line_466'>10:2 For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a</a>
<a id='line_467'>lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they</a>
<a id='line_468'>went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no</a>
<a id='line_469'>shepherd.</a>
<a id='line_470'></a>
<a id='line_471'>10:3 Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the</a>
<a id='line_472'>goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of</a>
<a id='line_473'>Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.</a>
<a id='line_474'></a>
<a id='line_475'>10:4 Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him</a>
<a id='line_476'>the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.</a>
<a id='line_477'></a>
<a id='line_478'>10:5 And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies</a>
<a id='line_479'>in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight,</a>
<a id='line_480'>because the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be</a>
<a id='line_481'>confounded.</a>
<a id='line_482'></a>
<a id='line_483'>10:6 And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the</a>
<a id='line_484'>house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have</a>
<a id='line_485'>mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off:</a>
<a id='line_486'>for I am the LORD their God, and will hear them.</a>
<a id='line_487'></a>
<a id='line_488'>10:7 And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart</a>
<a id='line_489'>shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see it, and</a>
<a id='line_490'>be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_491'></a>
<a id='line_492'>10:8 I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them:</a>
<a id='line_493'>and they shall increase as they have increased.</a>
<a id='line_494'></a>
<a id='line_495'>10:9 And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me</a>
<a id='line_496'>in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn</a>
<a id='line_497'>again.</a>
<a id='line_498'></a>
<a id='line_499'>10:10 I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and</a>
<a id='line_500'>gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of</a>
<a id='line_501'>Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them.</a>
<a id='line_502'></a>
<a id='line_503'>10:11 And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall</a>
<a id='line_504'>smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry</a>
<a id='line_505'>up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of</a>
<a id='line_506'>Egypt shall depart away.</a>
<a id='line_507'></a>
<a id='line_508'>10:12 And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up</a>
<a id='line_509'>and down in his name, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_510'></a>
<a id='line_511'>11:1 Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.</a>
<a id='line_512'></a>
<a id='line_513'>11:2 Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are</a>
<a id='line_514'>spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is</a>
<a id='line_515'>come down.</a>
<a id='line_516'></a>
<a id='line_517'>11:3 There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory</a>
<a id='line_518'>is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of</a>
<a id='line_519'>Jordan is spoiled.</a>
<a id='line_520'></a>
<a id='line_521'>11:4 Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter; 11:5</a>
<a id='line_522'>Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they</a>
<a id='line_523'>that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am rich: and their own</a>
<a id='line_524'>shepherds pity them not.</a>
<a id='line_525'></a>
<a id='line_526'>11:6 For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the</a>
<a id='line_527'>LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbours</a>
<a id='line_528'>hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land,</a>
<a id='line_529'>and out of their hand I will not deliver them.</a>
<a id='line_530'></a>
<a id='line_531'>11:7 And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the</a>
<a id='line_532'>flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the</a>
<a id='line_533'>other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.</a>
<a id='line_534'></a>
<a id='line_535'>11:8 Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed</a>
<a id='line_536'>them, and their soul also abhorred me.</a>
<a id='line_537'></a>
<a id='line_538'>11:9 Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die;</a>
<a id='line_539'>and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest</a>
<a id='line_540'>eat every one the flesh of another.</a>
<a id='line_541'></a>
<a id='line_542'>11:10 And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I</a>
<a id='line_543'>might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.</a>
<a id='line_544'></a>
<a id='line_545'>11:11 And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that</a>
<a id='line_546'>waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_547'></a>
<a id='line_548'>11:12 And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if</a>
<a id='line_549'>not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.</a>
<a id='line_550'></a>
<a id='line_551'>11:13 And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly</a>
<a id='line_552'>price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of</a>
<a id='line_553'>silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_554'></a>
<a id='line_555'>11:14 Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might</a>
<a id='line_556'>break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</a>
<a id='line_557'></a>
<a id='line_558'>11:15 And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of</a>
<a id='line_559'>a foolish shepherd.</a>
<a id='line_560'></a>
<a id='line_561'>11:16 For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not</a>
<a id='line_562'>visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor</a>
<a id='line_563'>heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he</a>
<a id='line_564'>shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.</a>
<a id='line_565'></a>
<a id='line_566'>11:17 Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall</a>
<a id='line_567'>be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried</a>
<a id='line_568'>up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.</a>
<a id='line_569'></a>
<a id='line_570'>12:1 The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_571'>which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the</a>
<a id='line_572'>earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.</a>
<a id='line_573'></a>
<a id='line_574'>12:2 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the</a>
<a id='line_575'>people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah</a>
<a id='line_576'>and against Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_577'></a>
<a id='line_578'>12:3 And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all</a>
<a id='line_579'>people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces,</a>
<a id='line_580'>though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.</a>
<a id='line_581'></a>
<a id='line_582'>12:4 In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with</a>
<a id='line_583'>astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes</a>
<a id='line_584'>upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with</a>
<a id='line_585'>blindness.</a>
<a id='line_586'></a>
<a id='line_587'>12:5 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The</a>
<a id='line_588'>inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts</a>
<a id='line_589'>their God.</a>
<a id='line_590'></a>
<a id='line_591'>12:6 In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of</a>
<a id='line_592'>fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they</a>
<a id='line_593'>shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the</a>
<a id='line_594'>left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in</a>
<a id='line_595'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_596'></a>
<a id='line_597'>12:7 The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory</a>
<a id='line_598'>of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do</a>
<a id='line_599'>not magnify themselves against Judah.</a>
<a id='line_600'></a>
<a id='line_601'>12:8 In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem;</a>
<a id='line_602'>and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and</a>
<a id='line_603'>the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the LORD before</a>
<a id='line_604'>them.</a>
<a id='line_605'></a>
<a id='line_606'>12:9 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to</a>
<a id='line_607'>destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_608'></a>
<a id='line_609'>12:10 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the</a>
<a id='line_610'>inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications:</a>
<a id='line_611'>and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall</a>
<a id='line_612'>mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in</a>
<a id='line_613'>bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.</a>
<a id='line_614'></a>
<a id='line_615'>12:11 In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the</a>
<a id='line_616'>mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.</a>
<a id='line_617'></a>
<a id='line_618'>12:12 And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the</a>

<a id='line_621'>of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and</a>
<a id='line_622'>their wives apart; 12:14 All the families that remain, every family</a>
<a id='line_623'>apart, and their wives apart.</a>

<a id='line_625'>13:1 In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of</a>
<a id='line_626'>David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.</a>
<a id='line_627'></a>
<a id='line_628'>13:2 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts,</a>
<a id='line_629'>that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they</a>
<a id='line_630'>shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and</a>
<a id='line_631'>the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.</a>
<a id='line_632'></a>
<a id='line_633'>13:3 And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then</a>
<a id='line_634'>his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou</a>
<a id='line_635'>shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and</a>
<a id='line_636'>his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when</a>
<a id='line_637'>he prophesieth.</a>
<a id='line_638'></a>
<a id='line_639'>13:4 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be</a>
<a id='line_640'>ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither</a>
<a id='line_641'>shall they wear a rough garment to deceive: 13:5 But he shall say, I</a>
<a id='line_642'>am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle</a>
<a id='line_643'>from my youth.</a>
<a id='line_644'></a>
<a id='line_645'>13:6 And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands?</a>
<a id='line_646'>Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of</a>
<a id='line_647'>my friends.</a>
<a id='line_648'></a>
<a id='line_649'>13:7 Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is</a>
<a id='line_650'>my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep</a>
<a id='line_651'>shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.</a>
<a id='line_652'></a>
<a id='line_653'>13:8 And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_654'>two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be</a>
<a id='line_655'>left therein.</a>
<a id='line_656'></a>
<a id='line_657'>13:9 And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine</a>
<a id='line_658'>them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they</a>
<a id='line_659'>shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my</a>
<a id='line_660'>people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.</a>
<a id='line_661'></a>
<a id='line_662'>14:1 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be</a>
<a id='line_663'>divided in the midst of thee.</a>
<a id='line_664'></a>
<a id='line_665'>14:2 For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and</a>
<a id='line_666'>the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women</a>
<a id='line_667'>ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the</a>
<a id='line_668'>residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.</a>
<a id='line_669'></a>
<a id='line_670'>14:3 Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as</a>
<a id='line_671'>when he fought in the day of battle.</a>
<a id='line_672'></a>
<a id='line_673'>14:4 And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives,</a>
<a id='line_674'>which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall</a>
<a id='line_675'>cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and</a>
<a id='line_676'>there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall</a>
<a id='line_677'>remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.</a>
<a id='line_678'></a>
<a id='line_679'>14:5 And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley</a>
<a id='line_680'>of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye</a>
<a id='line_681'>fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah:</a>
<a id='line_682'>and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with thee.</a>
<a id='line_683'></a>
<a id='line_684'>14:6 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not</a>
<a id='line_685'>be clear, nor dark: 14:7 But it shall be one day which shall be known</a>
<a id='line_686'>to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at</a>
<a id='line_687'>evening time it shall be light.</a>
<a id='line_688'></a>
<a id='line_689'>14:8 And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from</a>
<a id='line_690'>Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward</a>
<a id='line_691'>the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.</a>
<a id='line_692'></a>
<a id='line_693'>14:9 And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall</a>
<a id='line_694'>there be one LORD, and his name one.</a>
<a id='line_695'></a>
<a id='line_696'>14:10 All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon</a>
<a id='line_697'>south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her</a>
<a id='line_698'>place, from Benjamin’s gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the</a>
<a id='line_699'>corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king’s</a>
<a id='line_700'>winepresses.</a>
<a id='line_701'></a>
<a id='line_702'>14:11 And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter</a>
<a id='line_703'>destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.</a>
<a id='line_704'></a>
<a id='line_705'>14:12 And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all</a>
<a id='line_706'>the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall</a>
<a id='line_707'>consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall</a>
<a id='line_708'>consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in</a>
<a id='line_709'>their mouth.</a>
<a id='line_710'></a>
<a id='line_711'>14:13 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from</a>
<a id='line_712'>the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the</a>
<a id='line_713'>hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of</a>
<a id='line_714'>his neighbour.</a>
<a id='line_715'></a>
<a id='line_716'>14:14 And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all</a>
<a id='line_717'>the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver,</a>
<a id='line_718'>and apparel, in great abundance.</a>
<a id='line_719'></a>
<a id='line_720'>14:15 And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the</a>
<a id='line_721'>camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these</a>
<a id='line_722'>tents, as this plague.</a>
<a id='line_723'></a>
<a id='line_724'>14:16 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all</a>
<a id='line_725'>the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to</a>
<a id='line_726'>year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of</a>
<a id='line_727'>tabernacles.</a>
<a id='line_728'></a>
<a id='line_729'>14:17 And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families</a>
<a id='line_730'>of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts,</a>
<a id='line_731'>even upon them shall be no rain.</a>
<a id='line_732'></a>
<a id='line_733'>14:18 And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no</a>
<a id='line_734'>rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will smite the</a>
<a id='line_735'>heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.</a>
<a id='line_736'></a>
<a id='line_737'>14:19 This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all</a>
<a id='line_738'>nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.</a>
<a id='line_739'></a>
<a id='line_740'>14:20 In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses,</a>
<a id='line_741'>HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD’s house shall be like</a>
<a id='line_742'>the bowls before the altar.</a>
<a id='line_743'></a>
<a id='line_744'>14:21 Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto</a>
<a id='line_745'>the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of</a>
<a id='line_746'>them, and seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the</a>
<a id='line_747'>Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.</a>
