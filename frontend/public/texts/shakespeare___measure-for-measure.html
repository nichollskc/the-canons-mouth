<a id='line_34'></a>
<a id='line_35'>  DUKE. Escalus!</a>
<a id='line_36'>  ESCALUS. My lord.</a>
<a id='line_37'>  DUKE. Of government the properties to unfold</a>
<a id='line_38'>    Would seem in me t' affect speech and discourse,</a>
<a id='line_39'>    Since I am put to know that your own science</a>
<a id='line_40'>    Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice</a>
<a id='line_41'>    My strength can give you; then no more remains</a>
<a id='line_42'>    But that to your sufficiency- as your worth is able-</a>
<a id='line_43'>    And let them work. The nature of our people,</a>
<a id='line_44'>    Our city's institutions, and the terms</a>
<a id='line_45'>    For common justice, y'are as pregnant in</a>
<a id='line_46'>    As art and practice hath enriched any</a>
<a id='line_47'>    That we remember. There is our commission,</a>
<a id='line_48'>    From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,</a>
<a id='line_49'>    I say, bid come before us, Angelo.         Exit an ATTENDANT</a>
<a id='line_50'>    What figure of us think you he will bear?</a>
<a id='line_51'>    For you must know we have with special soul</a>
<a id='line_52'>    Elected him our absence to supply;</a>
<a id='line_53'>    Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,</a>
<a id='line_54'>    And given his deputation all the organs</a>
<a id='line_55'>    Of our own power. What think you of it?</a>
<a id='line_56'>  ESCALUS. If any in Vienna be of worth</a>
<a id='line_57'>    To undergo such ample grace and honour,</a>
<a id='line_58'>    It is Lord Angelo.</a>
<a id='line_59'></a>
<a id='line_60'>                          Enter ANGELO</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>  DUKE. Look where he comes.</a>
<a id='line_63'>  ANGELO. Always obedient to your Grace's will,</a>
<a id='line_64'>    I come to know your pleasure.</a>
<a id='line_65'>  DUKE. Angelo,</a>
<a id='line_66'>    There is a kind of character in thy life</a>
<a id='line_67'>    That to th' observer doth thy history</a>
<a id='line_68'>    Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings</a>
<a id='line_69'>    Are not thine own so proper as to waste</a>
<a id='line_70'>    Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.</a>
<a id='line_71'>    Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,</a>
<a id='line_72'>    Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues</a>
<a id='line_73'>    Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike</a>
<a id='line_74'>    As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd</a>
<a id='line_75'>    But to fine issues; nor Nature never lends</a>
<a id='line_76'>    The smallest scruple of her excellence</a>
<a id='line_77'>    But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines</a>
<a id='line_78'>    Herself the glory of a creditor,</a>
<a id='line_79'>    Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech</a>
<a id='line_80'>    To one that can my part in him advertise.</a>
<a id='line_81'>    Hold, therefore, Angelo-</a>
<a id='line_82'>    In our remove be thou at full ourself;</a>
<a id='line_83'>    Mortality and mercy in Vienna</a>
<a id='line_84'>    Live in thy tongue and heart. Old Escalus,</a>
<a id='line_85'>    Though first in question, is thy secondary.</a>
<a id='line_86'>    Take thy commission.</a>
<a id='line_87'>  ANGELO. Now, good my lord,</a>
<a id='line_88'>    Let there be some more test made of my metal,</a>
<a id='line_89'>    Before so noble and so great a figure</a>
<a id='line_90'>    Be stamp'd upon it.</a>
<a id='line_91'>  DUKE. No more evasion!</a>
<a id='line_92'>    We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice</a>
<a id='line_93'>    Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.</a>
<a id='line_94'>    Our haste from hence is of so quick condition</a>
<a id='line_95'>    That it prefers itself, and leaves unquestion'd</a>
<a id='line_96'>    Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,</a>
<a id='line_97'>    As time and our concernings shall importune,</a>
<a id='line_98'>    How it goes with us, and do look to know</a>
<a id='line_99'>    What doth befall you here. So, fare you well.</a>
<a id='line_100'>    To th' hopeful execution do I leave you</a>
<a id='line_101'>    Of your commissions.</a>
<a id='line_102'>  ANGELO. Yet give leave, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_103'>    That we may bring you something on the way.</a>
<a id='line_104'>  DUKE. My haste may not admit it;</a>
<a id='line_105'>    Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do</a>
<a id='line_106'>    With any scruple: your scope is as mine own,</a>
<a id='line_107'>    So to enforce or qualify the laws</a>
<a id='line_108'>    As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand;</a>
<a id='line_109'>    I'll privily away. I love the people,</a>
<a id='line_110'>    But do not like to stage me to their eyes;</a>
<a id='line_111'>    Though it do well, I do not relish well</a>
<a id='line_112'>    Their loud applause and Aves vehement;</a>
<a id='line_113'>    Nor do I think the man of safe discretion</a>
<a id='line_114'>    That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.</a>
<a id='line_115'>  ANGELO. The heavens give safety to your purposes!</a>
<a id='line_116'>  ESCALUS. Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!</a>
<a id='line_117'>  DUKE. I thank you. Fare you well.                         Exit</a>
<a id='line_118'>  ESCALUS. I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave</a>
<a id='line_119'>    To have free speech with you; and it concerns me</a>
<a id='line_120'>    To look into the bottom of my place:</a>
<a id='line_121'>    A pow'r I have, but of what strength and nature</a>
<a id='line_122'>    I am not yet instructed.</a>
<a id='line_123'>  ANGELO. 'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,</a>
<a id='line_124'>    And we may soon our satisfaction have</a>
<a id='line_125'>    Touching that point.</a>
<a id='line_126'>  ESCALUS. I'll wait upon your honour.                    Exeunt</a>

<a id='line_128'>SCENE II. A street</a>
<a id='line_129'></a>
<a id='line_130'>Enter Lucio and two other GENTLEMEN</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'>  LUCIO. If the Duke, with the other dukes, come not to composition</a>
<a id='line_133'>    with the King of Hungary, why then all the dukes fall upon the</a>
<a id='line_134'>    King.</a>
<a id='line_135'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of</a>
<a id='line_136'>    Hungary's!</a>
<a id='line_137'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_138'>  LUCIO. Thou conclud'st like the sanctimonious pirate that went to</a>
<a id='line_139'>    sea with the Ten Commandments, but scrap'd one out of the table.</a>
<a id='line_140'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Thou shalt not steal'?</a>
<a id='line_141'>  LUCIO. Ay, that he raz'd.</a>
<a id='line_142'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain</a>
<a id='line_143'>    and all the rest from their functions: they put forth to steal.</a>
<a id='line_144'>    There's not a soldier of us all that, in the thanksgiving before</a>
<a id='line_145'>    meat, do relish the petition well that prays for peace.</a>
<a id='line_146'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I never heard any soldier dislike it.</a>
<a id='line_147'>  LUCIO. I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where grace was</a>
<a id='line_148'>    said.</a>
<a id='line_149'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. No? A dozen times at least.</a>
<a id='line_150'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. What, in metre?</a>
<a id='line_151'>  LUCIO. In any proportion or in any language.</a>
<a id='line_152'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I think, or in any religion.</a>
<a id='line_153'>  LUCIO. Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all controversy; as,</a>
<a id='line_154'>    for example, thou thyself art a wicked villain, despite of all</a>
<a id='line_155'>    grace.</a>
<a id='line_156'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.</a>
<a id='line_157'>  LUCIO. I grant; as there may between the lists and the velvet.</a>
<a id='line_158'>    Thou art the list.</a>
<a id='line_159'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. And thou the velvet; thou art good velvet; thou'rt</a>
<a id='line_160'>    a three-pil'd piece, I warrant thee. I had as lief be a list of</a>
<a id='line_161'>    an English kersey as be pil'd, as thou art pil'd, for a French</a>
<a id='line_162'>    velvet. Do I speak feelingly now?</a>
<a id='line_163'>  LUCIO. I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful feeling of</a>
<a id='line_164'>    thy speech. I will, out of thine own confession, learn to begin</a>
<a id='line_165'>    thy health; but, whilst I live, forget to drink after thee.</a>
<a id='line_166'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?</a>
<a id='line_167'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or</a>
<a id='line_168'>    free.</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>                        Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>  LUCIO. Behold, behold, where Madam Mitigation comes! I have</a>
<a id='line_173'>    purchas'd as many diseases under her roof as come to-</a>
<a id='line_174'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. To what, I pray?</a>
<a id='line_175'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Judge.</a>
<a id='line_176'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. To three thousand dolours a year.</a>
<a id='line_177'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, and more.</a>
<a id='line_178'>  LUCIO. A French crown more.</a>
<a id='line_179'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Thou art always figuring diseases in me, but thou</a>
<a id='line_180'>    art full of error; I am sound.</a>
<a id='line_181'>  LUCIO. Nay, not, as one would say, healthy; but so sound as things</a>
<a id='line_182'>    that are hollow: thy bones are hollow; impiety has made a feast</a>
<a id='line_183'>    of thee.</a>
<a id='line_184'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. How now! which of your hips has the most profound</a>
<a id='line_185'>    sciatica?</a>
<a id='line_186'>  MRS. OVERDONE. Well, well! there's one yonder arrested and carried</a>
<a id='line_187'>    to prison was worth five thousand of you all.</a>
<a id='line_188'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Who's that, I pray thee?</a>
<a id='line_189'>  MRS. OVERDONE. Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.</a>
<a id='line_190'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Claudio to prison? 'Tis not so.</a>
<a id='line_191'>  MRS. OVERDONE. Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested; saw him</a>
<a id='line_192'>    carried away; and, which is more, within these three days his</a>
<a id='line_193'>    head to be chopp'd off.</a>
<a id='line_194'>  LUCIO. But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so. Art</a>
<a id='line_195'>    thou sure of this?</a>
<a id='line_196'>  MRS. OVERDONE. I am too sure of it; and it is for getting Madam</a>
<a id='line_197'>    Julietta with child.</a>
<a id='line_198'>  LUCIO. Believe me, this may be; he promis'd to meet me two hours</a>
<a id='line_199'>    since, and he was ever precise in promise-keeping.</a>
<a id='line_200'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Besides, you know, it draws something near to the</a>
<a id='line_201'>    speech we had to such a purpose.</a>
<a id='line_202'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. But most of all agreeing with the proclamation.</a>
<a id='line_203'>  LUCIO. Away; let's go learn the truth of it.</a>
<a id='line_204'>                                      Exeunt Lucio and GENTLEMEN</a>
<a id='line_205'>  MRS. OVERDONE. Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what</a>
<a id='line_206'>    with the gallows, and what with poverty, I am custom-shrunk.</a>
<a id='line_207'></a>
<a id='line_208'>                               Enter POMPEY</a>
<a id='line_209'></a>
<a id='line_210'>    How now! what's the news with you?</a>
<a id='line_211'>  POMPEY. Yonder man is carried to prison.</a>
<a id='line_212'>  MRS. OVERDONE. Well, what has he done?</a>
<a id='line_213'>  POMPEY. A woman.</a>
<a id='line_214'>  MRS. OVERDONE. But what's his offence?</a>
<a id='line_215'>  POMPEY. Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.</a>
<a id='line_216'>  MRS. OVERDONE. What! is there a maid with child by him?</a>
<a id='line_217'>  POMPEY. No; but there's a woman with maid by him. You have not</a>
<a id='line_218'>   heard of the proclamation, have you?</a>
<a id='line_219'>  MRS. OVERDONE. What proclamation, man?</a>
<a id='line_220'>  POMPEY. All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be pluck'd down.</a>
<a id='line_221'>  MRS. OVERDONE. And what shall become of those in the city?</a>
<a id='line_222'>  POMPEY. They shall stand for seed; they had gone down too, but that</a>
<a id='line_223'>    a wise burgher put in for them.</a>
<a id='line_224'>  MRS. OVERDONE. But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be</a>
<a id='line_225'>    pull'd down?</a>
<a id='line_226'>  POMPEY. To the ground, mistress.</a>
<a id='line_227'>  MRS. OVERDONE. Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!</a>
<a id='line_228'>    What shall become of me?</a>
<a id='line_229'>  POMPEY. Come, fear not you: good counsellors lack no clients.</a>
<a id='line_230'>    Though you change your place you need not change your trade; I'll</a>
<a id='line_231'>    be your tapster still. Courage, there will be pity taken on you;</a>
<a id='line_232'>    you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you will</a>
<a id='line_233'>    be considered.</a>
<a id='line_234'>  MRS. OVERDONE. What's to do here, Thomas Tapster? Let's withdraw.</a>
<a id='line_235'>  POMPEY. Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to prison;</a>
<a id='line_236'>    and there's Madam Juliet.                             Exeunt</a>
<a id='line_237'></a>
<a id='line_238'>            Enter PROVOST, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and OFFICERS;</a>
<a id='line_239'>                            LUCIO following</a>
<a id='line_240'></a>
<a id='line_241'>  CLAUDIO. Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to th' world?</a>
<a id='line_242'>    Bear me to prison, where I am committed.</a>
<a id='line_243'>  PROVOST. I do it not in evil disposition,</a>
<a id='line_244'>    But from Lord Angelo by special charge.</a>
<a id='line_245'>  CLAUDIO. Thus can the demigod Authority</a>
<a id='line_246'>    Make us pay down for our offence by weight</a>
<a id='line_247'>    The words of heaven: on whom it will, it will;</a>
<a id='line_248'>    On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.</a>
<a id='line_249'>  LUCIO. Why, how now, Claudio, whence comes this restraint?</a>
<a id='line_250'>  CLAUDIO. From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty;</a>
<a id='line_251'>    As surfeit is the father of much fast,</a>
<a id='line_252'>    So every scope by the immoderate use</a>
<a id='line_253'>    Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,</a>
<a id='line_254'>    Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,</a>
<a id='line_255'>    A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.</a>
<a id='line_256'>  LUCIO. If I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would send for</a>
<a id='line_257'>    certain of my creditors; and yet, to say the truth, I had as lief</a>
<a id='line_258'>    have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment.</a>
<a id='line_259'>    What's thy offence, Claudio?</a>
<a id='line_260'>  CLAUDIO. What but to speak of would offend again.</a>
<a id='line_261'>  LUCIO. What, is't murder?</a>
<a id='line_262'>  CLAUDIO. No.</a>
<a id='line_263'>  LUCIO. Lechery?</a>
<a id='line_264'>  CLAUDIO. Call it so.</a>
<a id='line_265'>  PROVOST. Away, sir; you must go.</a>
<a id='line_266'>  CLAUDIO. One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.</a>
<a id='line_267'>  LUCIO. A hundred, if they'll do you any good. Is lechery so look'd</a>
<a id='line_268'>    after?</a>
<a id='line_269'>  CLAUDIO. Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract</a>
<a id='line_270'>    I got possession of Julietta's bed.</a>
<a id='line_271'>    You know the lady; she is fast my wife,</a>
<a id='line_272'>    Save that we do the denunciation lack</a>
<a id='line_273'>    Of outward order; this we came not to,</a>
<a id='line_274'>    Only for propagation of a dow'r</a>
<a id='line_275'>    Remaining in the coffer of her friends.</a>
<a id='line_276'>    From whom we thought it meet to hide our love</a>
<a id='line_277'>    Till time had made them for us. But it chances</a>
<a id='line_278'>    The stealth of our most mutual entertainment,</a>
<a id='line_279'>    With character too gross, is writ on Juliet.</a>
<a id='line_280'>  LUCIO. With child, perhaps?</a>
<a id='line_281'>  CLAUDIO. Unhappily, even so.</a>
<a id='line_282'>    And the new deputy now for the Duke-</a>
<a id='line_283'>    Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,</a>
<a id='line_284'>    Or whether that the body public be</a>
<a id='line_285'>    A horse whereon the governor doth ride,</a>
<a id='line_286'>    Who, newly in the seat, that it may know</a>
<a id='line_287'>    He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;</a>
<a id='line_288'>    Whether the tyranny be in his place,</a>
<a id='line_289'>    Or in his eminence that fills it up,</a>
<a id='line_290'>    I stagger in. But this new governor</a>
<a id='line_291'>    Awakes me all the enrolled penalties</a>
<a id='line_292'>    Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by th' wall</a>
<a id='line_293'>    So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round</a>
<a id='line_294'>    And none of them been worn; and, for a name,</a>
<a id='line_295'>    Now puts the drowsy and neglected act</a>
<a id='line_296'>    Freshly on me. 'Tis surely for a name.</a>
<a id='line_297'>  LUCIO. I warrant it is; and thy head stands so tickle on thy</a>

<a id='line_322'>Enter DUKE and FRIAR THOMAS</a>
<a id='line_323'></a>
<a id='line_324'>  DUKE. No, holy father; throw away that thought;</a>
<a id='line_325'>    Believe not that the dribbling dart of love</a>
<a id='line_326'>    Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee</a>

<a id='line_328'>    More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends</a>
<a id='line_329'>    Of burning youth.</a>
<a id='line_330'>  FRIAR. May your Grace speak of it?</a>
<a id='line_331'>  DUKE. My holy sir, none better knows than you</a>
<a id='line_332'>    How I have ever lov'd the life removed,</a>
<a id='line_333'>    And held in idle price to haunt assemblies</a>
<a id='line_334'>    Where youth, and cost, a witless bravery keeps.</a>
<a id='line_335'>    I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,</a>
<a id='line_336'>    A man of stricture and firm abstinence,</a>
<a id='line_337'>    My absolute power and place here in Vienna,</a>
<a id='line_338'>    And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;</a>
<a id='line_339'>    For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,</a>
<a id='line_340'>    And so it is received. Now, pious sir,</a>
<a id='line_341'>    You will demand of me why I do this.</a>
<a id='line_342'>  FRIAR. Gladly, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_343'>  DUKE. We have strict statutes and most biting laws,</a>
<a id='line_344'>    The needful bits and curbs to headstrong steeds,</a>
<a id='line_345'>    Which for this fourteen years we have let slip;</a>
<a id='line_346'>    Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,</a>
<a id='line_347'>    That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,</a>
<a id='line_348'>    Having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch,</a>
<a id='line_349'>    Only to stick it in their children's sight</a>
<a id='line_350'>    For terror, not to use, in time the rod</a>
<a id='line_351'>    Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,</a>
<a id='line_352'>    Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;</a>
<a id='line_353'>    And liberty plucks justice by the nose;</a>
<a id='line_354'>    The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart</a>
<a id='line_355'>    Goes all decorum.</a>
<a id='line_356'>  FRIAR. It rested in your Grace</a>
<a id='line_357'>    To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleas'd;</a>
<a id='line_358'>    And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd</a>
<a id='line_359'>    Than in Lord Angelo.</a>
<a id='line_360'>  DUKE. I do fear, too dreadful.</a>
<a id='line_361'>    Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,</a>
<a id='line_362'>    'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them</a>
<a id='line_363'>    For what I bid them do; for we bid this be done,</a>
<a id='line_364'>    When evil deeds have their permissive pass</a>
<a id='line_365'>    And not the punishment. Therefore, indeed, my father,</a>
<a id='line_366'>    I have on Angelo impos'd the office;</a>
<a id='line_367'>    Who may, in th' ambush of my name, strike home,</a>
<a id='line_368'>    And yet my nature never in the fight</a>

<a id='line_370'>    I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,</a>
<a id='line_371'>    Visit both prince and people. Therefore, I prithee,</a>
<a id='line_372'>    Supply me with the habit, and instruct me</a>
<a id='line_373'>    How I may formally in person bear me</a>
<a id='line_374'>    Like a true friar. Moe reasons for this action</a>
<a id='line_375'>    At our more leisure shall I render you.</a>
<a id='line_376'>    Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;</a>
<a id='line_377'>    Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses</a>
<a id='line_378'>    That his blood flows, or that his appetite</a>
<a id='line_379'>    Is more to bread than stone. Hence shall we see,</a>

<a id='line_419'>  ISABELLA. Sir, make me not your story.</a>
<a id='line_420'>  LUCIO. It is true.</a>

<a id='line_428'>  ISABELLA. You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.</a>

<a id='line_475'>    And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,</a>

<a id='line_477'>    All their petitions are as freely theirs</a>

<a id='line_556'>  ANGELO. What are you, sir?</a>
<a id='line_557'>  ELBOW. He, sir? A tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that serves a bad</a>
<a id='line_558'>    woman; whose house, sir, was, as they say, pluck'd down in the</a>
<a id='line_559'>    suburbs; and now she professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a</a>

<a id='line_561'>  ESCALUS. How know you that?</a>
<a id='line_562'>  ELBOW. My Wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour-</a>
<a id='line_563'>  ESCALUS. How! thy wife!</a>
<a id='line_564'>  ELBOW. Ay, sir; whom I thank heaven, is an honest woman-</a>
<a id='line_565'>  ESCALUS. Dost thou detest her therefore?</a>
<a id='line_566'>  ELBOW. I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she, that</a>
<a id='line_567'>    this house, if it be not a bawd's house, it is pity of her life,</a>
<a id='line_568'>    for it is a naughty house.</a>
<a id='line_569'>  ESCALUS. How dost thou know that, constable?</a>
<a id='line_570'>  ELBOW. Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman</a>
<a id='line_571'>    cardinally given, might have been accus'd in fornication,</a>
<a id='line_572'>    adultery, and all uncleanliness there.</a>
<a id='line_573'>  ESCALUS. By the woman's means?</a>
<a id='line_574'>  ELBOW. Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means; but as she spit in</a>
<a id='line_575'>    his face, so she defied him.</a>
<a id='line_576'>  POMPEY. Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.</a>
<a id='line_577'>  ELBOW. Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable man,</a>
<a id='line_578'>    prove it.</a>
<a id='line_579'>  ESCALUS. Do you hear how he misplaces?</a>
<a id='line_580'>  POMPEY. Sir, she came in great with child; and longing, saving your</a>
<a id='line_581'>    honour's reverence, for stew'd prunes. Sir, we had but two in the</a>
<a id='line_582'>    house, which at that very distant time stood, as it were, in a</a>
<a id='line_583'>    fruit dish, a dish of some three pence; your honours have seen</a>
<a id='line_584'>    such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very good dishes.</a>
<a id='line_585'>  ESCALUS. Go to, go to; no matter for the dish, sir.</a>
<a id='line_586'>  POMPEY. No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in the</a>
<a id='line_587'>    right; but to the point. As I say, this Mistress Elbow, being, as</a>
<a id='line_588'>    I say, with child, and being great-bellied, and longing, as I</a>
<a id='line_589'>    said, for prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,</a>
<a id='line_590'>    Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the rest, as I</a>
<a id='line_591'>    said, and, as I say, paying for them very honestly; for, as you</a>

<a id='line_593'>  FROTH. No, indeed.</a>
<a id='line_594'>  POMPEY. Very well; you being then, if you be rememb'red, cracking</a>
<a id='line_595'>    the stones of the foresaid prunes-</a>
<a id='line_596'>  FROTH. Ay, so I did indeed.</a>
<a id='line_597'>  POMPEY. Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be rememb'red,</a>
<a id='line_598'>    that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you</a>
<a id='line_599'>    wot of, unless they kept very good diet, as I told you-</a>
<a id='line_600'>  FROTH. All this is true.</a>
<a id='line_601'>  POMPEY. Why, very well then-</a>
<a id='line_602'>  ESCALUS. Come, you are a tedious fool. To the purpose: what was</a>
<a id='line_603'>    done to Elbow's wife that he hath cause to complain of? Come me</a>
<a id='line_604'>    to what was done to her.</a>
<a id='line_605'>  POMPEY. Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.</a>
<a id='line_606'>  ESCALUS. No, sir, nor I mean it not.</a>
<a id='line_607'>  POMPEY. Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's leave. And,</a>
<a id='line_608'>    I beseech you, look into Master Froth here, sir, a man of</a>
<a id='line_609'>    fourscore pound a year; whose father died at Hallowmas- was't not</a>
<a id='line_610'>    at Hallowmas, Master Froth?</a>
<a id='line_611'>  FROTH. All-hallond eve.</a>
<a id='line_612'>  POMPEY. Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir, sitting, as</a>

<a id='line_614'>    where, indeed, you have a delight to sit, have you not?</a>
<a id='line_615'>  FROTH. I have so; because it is an open room, and good for winter.</a>
<a id='line_616'>  POMPEY. Why, very well then; I hope here be truths.</a>
<a id='line_617'>  ANGELO. This will last out a night in Russia,</a>
<a id='line_618'>    When nights are longest there; I'll take my leave,</a>
<a id='line_619'>    And leave you to the hearing of the cause,</a>
<a id='line_620'>    Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.</a>
<a id='line_621'>  ESCALUS. I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.</a>
<a id='line_622'>    [Exit ANGELO] Now, sir, come on; what was done to Elbow's wife,</a>
<a id='line_623'>    once more?</a>
<a id='line_624'>  POMPEY. Once?- sir. There was nothing done to her once.</a>
<a id='line_625'>  ELBOW. I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.</a>
<a id='line_626'>  POMPEY. I beseech your honour, ask me.</a>
<a id='line_627'>  ESCALUS. Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her?</a>
<a id='line_628'>  POMPEY. I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face. Good</a>
<a id='line_629'>    Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a good purpose. Doth</a>
<a id='line_630'>    your honour mark his face?</a>
<a id='line_631'>  ESCALUS. Ay, sir, very well.</a>
<a id='line_632'>  POMPEY. Nay, I beseech you, mark it well.</a>
<a id='line_633'>  ESCALUS. Well, I do so.</a>
<a id='line_634'>  POMPEY. Doth your honour see any harm in his face?</a>
<a id='line_635'>  ESCALUS. Why, no.</a>
<a id='line_636'>  POMPEY. I'll be suppos'd upon a book his face is the worst thing</a>
<a id='line_637'>    about him. Good then; if his face be the worst thing about him,</a>
<a id='line_638'>    how could Master Froth do the constable's wife any harm? I would</a>
<a id='line_639'>    know that of your honour.</a>
<a id='line_640'>  ESCALUS. He's in the right, constable; what say you to it?</a>
<a id='line_641'>  ELBOW. First, an it like you, the house is a respected house; next,</a>
<a id='line_642'>    this is a respected fellow; and his mistress is a respected</a>
<a id='line_643'>    woman.</a>
<a id='line_644'>  POMPEY. By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than</a>
<a id='line_645'>    any of us all.</a>
<a id='line_646'>  ELBOW. Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicket varlet; the time is</a>
<a id='line_647'>    yet to come that she was ever respected with man, woman, or</a>
<a id='line_648'>    child.</a>
<a id='line_649'>  POMPEY. Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.</a>
<a id='line_650'>  ESCALUS. Which is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity? Is this</a>
<a id='line_651'>    true?</a>
<a id='line_652'>  ELBOW. O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked Hannibal! I</a>
<a id='line_653'>    respected with her before I was married to her! If ever I was</a>
<a id='line_654'>    respected with her, or she with me, let not your worship think me</a>
<a id='line_655'>    the poor Duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or</a>
<a id='line_656'>    I'll have mine action of batt'ry on thee.</a>
<a id='line_657'>  ESCALUS. If he took you a box o' th' ear, you might have your</a>
<a id='line_658'>    action of slander too.</a>
<a id='line_659'>  ELBOW. Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't your</a>
<a id='line_660'>    worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?</a>
<a id='line_661'>  ESCALUS. Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him that</a>
<a id='line_662'>    thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him continue in his</a>
<a id='line_663'>    courses till thou know'st what they are.</a>
<a id='line_664'>  ELBOW. Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou wicked</a>
<a id='line_665'>    varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art to continue now,</a>
<a id='line_666'>    thou varlet; thou art to continue.</a>
<a id='line_667'>  ESCALUS. Where were you born, friend?</a>
<a id='line_668'>  FROTH. Here in Vienna, sir.</a>
<a id='line_669'>  ESCALUS. Are you of fourscore pounds a year?</a>
<a id='line_670'>  FROTH. Yes, an't please you, sir.</a>
<a id='line_671'>  ESCALUS. So. What trade are you of, sir?</a>
<a id='line_672'>  POMPEY. A tapster, a poor widow's tapster.</a>
<a id='line_673'>  ESCALUS. Your mistress' name?</a>
<a id='line_674'>  POMPEY. Mistress Overdone.</a>
<a id='line_675'>  ESCALUS. Hath she had any more than one husband?</a>
<a id='line_676'>  POMPEY. Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.</a>
<a id='line_677'>  ESCALUS. Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master Froth, I</a>
<a id='line_678'>    would not have you acquainted with tapsters: they will draw you,</a>
<a id='line_679'>    Master Froth, and you will hang them. Get you gone, and let me</a>
<a id='line_680'>    hear no more of you.</a>
<a id='line_681'>  FROTH. I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never come into</a>
<a id='line_682'>    any room in a taphouse but I am drawn in.</a>
<a id='line_683'>  ESCALUS. Well, no more of it, Master Froth; farewell. [Exit FROTH]</a>
<a id='line_684'>    Come you hither to me, Master Tapster; what's your name, Master</a>
<a id='line_685'>    Tapster?</a>
<a id='line_686'>  POMPEY. Pompey.</a>
<a id='line_687'>  ESCALUS. What else?</a>
<a id='line_688'>  POMPEY. Bum, sir.</a>
<a id='line_689'>  ESCALUS. Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; so</a>
<a id='line_690'>    that, in the beastliest sense, you are Pompey the Great. Pompey,</a>
<a id='line_691'>    you are partly a bawd, Pompey, howsoever you colour it in being a</a>
<a id='line_692'>    tapster. Are you not? Come, tell me true; it shall be the better</a>
<a id='line_693'>    for you.</a>
<a id='line_694'>  POMPEY. Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.</a>
<a id='line_695'>  ESCALUS. How would you live, Pompey- by being a bawd? What do you</a>
<a id='line_696'>    think of the trade, Pompey? Is it a lawful trade?</a>
<a id='line_697'>  POMPEY. If the law would allow it, sir.</a>
<a id='line_698'>  ESCALUS. But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be</a>
<a id='line_699'>    allowed in Vienna.</a>
<a id='line_700'>  POMPEY. Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of</a>
<a id='line_701'>    the city?</a>
<a id='line_702'>  ESCALUS. No, Pompey.</a>
<a id='line_703'>  POMPEY. Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then. If</a>
<a id='line_704'>    your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves, you</a>
<a id='line_705'>    need not to fear the bawds.</a>
<a id='line_706'>  ESCALUS. There is pretty orders beginning, I can tell you: but it</a>
<a id='line_707'>    is but heading and hanging.</a>
<a id='line_708'>  POMPEY. If you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten</a>
<a id='line_709'>    year together, you'll be glad to give out a commission for more</a>
<a id='line_710'>    heads; if this law hold in Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest</a>
<a id='line_711'>    house in it, after threepence a bay. If you live to see this come</a>
<a id='line_712'>    to pass, say Pompey told you so.</a>
<a id='line_713'>  ESCALUS. Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your prophecy,</a>
<a id='line_714'>    hark you: I advise you, let me not find you before me again upon</a>
<a id='line_715'>    any complaint whatsoever- no, not for dwelling where you do; if I</a>
<a id='line_716'>    do, Pompey, I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd</a>
<a id='line_717'>    Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall have you whipt.</a>
<a id='line_718'>    So for this time, Pompey, fare you well.</a>
<a id='line_719'>  POMPEY. I thank your worship for your good counsel; [Aside] but I</a>
<a id='line_720'>    shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine.</a>
<a id='line_721'>    Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade;</a>
<a id='line_722'>    The valiant heart's not whipt out of his trade.         Exit</a>
<a id='line_723'>  ESCALUS. Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master</a>
<a id='line_724'>    Constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?</a>
<a id='line_725'>  ELBOW. Seven year and a half, sir.</a>
<a id='line_726'>  ESCALUS. I thought, by the readiness in the office, you had</a>
<a id='line_727'>    continued in it some time. You say seven years together?</a>
<a id='line_728'>  ELBOW. And a half, sir.</a>
<a id='line_729'>  ESCALUS. Alas, it hath been great pains to you! They do you wrong</a>
<a id='line_730'>    to put you so oft upon't. Are there not men in your ward</a>
<a id='line_731'>    sufficient to serve it?</a>
<a id='line_732'>  ELBOW. Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters; as they are</a>
<a id='line_733'>    chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I do it for some</a>
<a id='line_734'>    piece of money, and go through with all.</a>
<a id='line_735'>  ESCALUS. Look you, bring me in the names of some six or seven, the</a>
<a id='line_736'>    most sufficient of your parish.</a>
<a id='line_737'>  ELBOW. To your worship's house, sir?</a>
<a id='line_738'>  ESCALUS. To my house. Fare you well.              [Exit ELBOW]</a>
<a id='line_739'>    What's o'clock, think you?</a>
<a id='line_740'>  JUSTICE. Eleven, sir.</a>
<a id='line_741'>  ESCALUS. I pray you home to dinner with me.</a>
<a id='line_742'>  JUSTICE. I humbly thank you.</a>
<a id='line_743'>  ESCALUS. It grieves me for the death of Claudio;</a>
<a id='line_744'>    But there's no remedy.</a>

<a id='line_877'>    Those many had not dar'd to do that evil</a>
<a id='line_878'>    If the first that did th' edict infringe</a>
<a id='line_879'>    Had answer'd for his deed. Now 'tis awake,</a>
<a id='line_880'>    Takes note of what is done, and, like a prophet,</a>

<a id='line_885'>    But here they live to end.</a>
<a id='line_886'>  ISABELLA. Yet show some pity.</a>
<a id='line_887'>  ANGELO. I show it most of all when I show justice;</a>
<a id='line_888'>    For then I pity those I do not know,</a>
<a id='line_889'>    Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall,</a>
<a id='line_890'>    And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,</a>
<a id='line_891'>    Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;</a>
<a id='line_892'>    Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.</a>
<a id='line_893'>  ISABELLA. So you must be the first that gives this sentence,</a>
<a id='line_894'>    And he that suffers. O, it is excellent</a>
<a id='line_895'>    To have a giant's strength! But it is tyrannous</a>
<a id='line_896'>    To use it like a giant.</a>
<a id='line_897'>  LUCIO. [To ISABELLA] That's well said.</a>
<a id='line_898'>  ISABELLA. Could great men thunder</a>
<a id='line_899'>    As Jove himself does, Jove would never be quiet,</a>
<a id='line_900'>    For every pelting petty officer</a>
<a id='line_901'>    Would use his heaven for thunder,</a>
<a id='line_902'>    Nothing but thunder. Merciful Heaven,</a>
<a id='line_903'>    Thou rather, with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt,</a>
<a id='line_904'>    Splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak</a>

<a id='line_908'>    His glassy essence, like an angry ape,</a>
<a id='line_909'>    Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven</a>
<a id='line_910'>    As makes the angels weep; who, with our speens,</a>

<a id='line_912'>  LUCIO. [To ISABELLA] O, to him, to him, wench! He will relent;</a>

<a id='line_914'>  PROVOST. [Aside] Pray heaven she win him.</a>
<a id='line_915'>  ISABELLA. We cannot weigh our brother with ourself.</a>
<a id='line_916'>    Great men may jest with saints: 'tis wit in them;</a>

<a id='line_918'>  LUCIO. [To ISABELLA] Thou'rt i' th' right, girl; more o' that.</a>

<a id='line_921'>  LUCIO. [To ISABELLA] Art avis'd o' that? More on't.</a>
<a id='line_922'>  ANGELO. Why do you put these sayings upon me?</a>
<a id='line_923'>  ISABELLA. Because authority, though it err like others,</a>
<a id='line_924'>    Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself</a>
<a id='line_925'>    That skins the vice o' th' top. Go to your bosom,</a>
<a id='line_926'>    Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know</a>
<a id='line_927'>    That's like my brother's fault. If it confess</a>

<a id='line_1011'>  JULIET. I do; and bear the shame most patiently.</a>
<a id='line_1012'>  DUKE. I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,</a>

<a id='line_1019'>    Was mutually committed.</a>

<a id='line_1023'>  DUKE. 'Tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent</a>
<a id='line_1024'>    As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,</a>

<a id='line_1115'>    Might there not be a charity in sin</a>

<a id='line_1117'>  ISABELLA. Please you to do't,</a>
<a id='line_1118'>    I'll take it as a peril to my soul</a>
<a id='line_1119'>    It is no sin at all, but charity.</a>
<a id='line_1120'>  ANGELO. Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul,</a>
<a id='line_1121'>    Were equal poise of sin and charity.</a>
<a id='line_1122'>  ISABELLA. That I do beg his life, if it be sin,</a>
<a id='line_1123'>    Heaven let me bear it! You granting of my suit,</a>
<a id='line_1124'>    If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer</a>

<a id='line_1126'>    And nothing of your answer.</a>
<a id='line_1127'>  ANGELO. Nay, but hear me;</a>
<a id='line_1128'>    Your sense pursues not mine; either you are ignorant</a>

<a id='line_1146'>    Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,</a>
<a id='line_1147'>    Could fetch your brother from the manacles</a>
<a id='line_1148'>    Of the all-binding law; and that there were</a>
<a id='line_1149'>    No earthly mean to save him but that either</a>
<a id='line_1150'>    You must lay down the treasures of your body</a>
<a id='line_1151'>    To this supposed, or else to let him suffer-</a>
<a id='line_1152'>    What would you do?</a>
<a id='line_1153'>  ISABELLA. As much for my poor brother as myself;</a>
<a id='line_1154'>    That is, were I under the terms of death,</a>
<a id='line_1155'>    Th' impression of keen whips I'd wear as rubies,</a>

<a id='line_1158'>    My body up to shame.</a>
<a id='line_1159'>  ANGELO. Then must your brother die.</a>
<a id='line_1160'>  ISABELLA. And 'twere the cheaper way:</a>
<a id='line_1161'>    Better it were a brother died at once</a>
<a id='line_1162'>    Than that a sister, by redeeming him,</a>
<a id='line_1163'>    Should die for ever.</a>
<a id='line_1164'>  ANGELO. Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence</a>
<a id='line_1165'>    That you have slander'd so?</a>
<a id='line_1166'>  ISABELLA. Ignominy in ransom and free pardon</a>

<a id='line_1169'>  ANGELO. You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;</a>
<a id='line_1170'>    And rather prov'd the sliding of your brother</a>
<a id='line_1171'>    A merriment than a vice.</a>
<a id='line_1172'>  ISABELLA. O, pardon me, my lord! It oft falls out,</a>

<a id='line_1183'>    Women, help heaven! Men their creation mar</a>

<a id='line_1250'>Enter DUKE, disguised as before, CLAUDIO, and PROVOST</a>
<a id='line_1251'></a>
<a id='line_1252'>  DUKE. So, then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?</a>
<a id='line_1253'>  CLAUDIO. The miserable have no other medicine</a>
<a id='line_1254'>    But only hope:</a>
<a id='line_1255'>    I have hope to Eve, and am prepar'd to die.</a>
<a id='line_1256'>  DUKE. Be absolute for death; either death or life</a>
<a id='line_1257'>    Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life.</a>
<a id='line_1258'>    If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing</a>
<a id='line_1259'>    That none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,</a>
<a id='line_1260'>    Servile to all the skyey influences,</a>
<a id='line_1261'>    That dost this habitation where thou keep'st</a>
<a id='line_1262'>    Hourly afflict. Merely, thou art Death's fool;</a>
<a id='line_1263'>    For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun</a>
<a id='line_1264'>    And yet run'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;</a>
<a id='line_1265'>    For all th' accommodations that thou bear'st</a>
<a id='line_1266'>    Are nurs'd by baseness. Thou 'rt by no means valiant;</a>
<a id='line_1267'>    For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork</a>
<a id='line_1268'>    Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,</a>
<a id='line_1269'>    And that thou oft provok'st; yet grossly fear'st</a>
<a id='line_1270'>    Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;</a>
<a id='line_1271'>    For thou exists on many a thousand grains</a>

<a id='line_1273'>    For what thou hast not, still thou striv'st to get,</a>

<a id='line_1277'>    For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,</a>
<a id='line_1278'>    Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey,</a>

<a id='line_1282'>    Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,</a>
<a id='line_1283'>    For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,</a>

<a id='line_1285'>    Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth</a>
<a id='line_1286'>    Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms</a>
<a id='line_1287'>    Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,</a>
<a id='line_1288'>    Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,</a>

<a id='line_1310'>  ISABELLA. Why,</a>
<a id='line_1311'>    As all comforts are; most good, most good, indeed.</a>
<a id='line_1312'>    Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,</a>
<a id='line_1313'>    Intends you for his swift ambassador,</a>

<a id='line_1316'>    To-morrow you set on.</a>
<a id='line_1317'>  CLAUDIO. Is there no remedy?</a>
<a id='line_1318'>  ISABELLA. None, but such remedy as, to save a head,</a>
<a id='line_1319'>    To cleave a heart in twain.</a>
<a id='line_1320'>  CLAUDIO. But is there any?</a>
<a id='line_1321'>  ISABELLA. Yes, brother, you may live:</a>
<a id='line_1322'>    There is a devilish mercy in the judge,</a>
<a id='line_1323'>    If you'll implore it, that will free your life,</a>
<a id='line_1324'>    But fetter you till death.</a>
<a id='line_1325'>  CLAUDIO. Perpetual durance?</a>
<a id='line_1326'>  ISABELLA. Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,</a>
<a id='line_1327'>    Though all the world's vastidity you had,</a>
<a id='line_1328'>    To a determin'd scope.</a>
<a id='line_1329'>  CLAUDIO. But in what nature?</a>
<a id='line_1330'>  ISABELLA. In such a one as, you consenting to't,</a>
<a id='line_1331'>    Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,</a>
<a id='line_1332'>    And leave you naked.</a>
<a id='line_1333'>  CLAUDIO. Let me know the point.</a>
<a id='line_1334'>  ISABELLA. O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,</a>
<a id='line_1335'>    Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,</a>
<a id='line_1336'>    And six or seven winters more respect</a>
<a id='line_1337'>    Than a perpetual honour. Dar'st thou die?</a>
<a id='line_1338'>    The sense of death is most in apprehension;</a>
<a id='line_1339'>    And the poor beetle that we tread upon</a>
<a id='line_1340'>    In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great</a>
<a id='line_1341'>    As when a giant dies.</a>
<a id='line_1342'>  CLAUDIO. Why give you me this shame?</a>
<a id='line_1343'>    Think you I can a resolution fetch</a>
<a id='line_1344'>    From flow'ry tenderness? If I must die,</a>
<a id='line_1345'>    I will encounter darkness as a bride</a>
<a id='line_1346'>    And hug it in mine arms.</a>
<a id='line_1347'>  ISABELLA. There spake my brother; there my father's grave</a>
<a id='line_1348'>    Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:</a>
<a id='line_1349'>    Thou art too noble to conserve a life</a>
<a id='line_1350'>    In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,</a>
<a id='line_1351'>    Whose settled visage and deliberate word</a>
<a id='line_1352'>    Nips youth i' th' head, and follies doth enew</a>
<a id='line_1353'>    As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil;</a>
<a id='line_1354'>    His filth within being cast, he would appear</a>
<a id='line_1355'>    A pond as deep as hell.</a>
<a id='line_1356'>  CLAUDIO. The precise Angelo!</a>
<a id='line_1357'>  ISABELLA. O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell</a>
<a id='line_1358'>    The damned'st body to invest and cover</a>
<a id='line_1359'>    In precise guards! Dost thou think, Claudio,</a>
<a id='line_1360'>    If I would yield him my virginity</a>
<a id='line_1361'>    Thou mightst be freed?</a>
<a id='line_1362'>  CLAUDIO. O heavens! it cannot be.</a>
<a id='line_1363'>  ISABELLA. Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,</a>
<a id='line_1364'>    So to offend him still. This night's the time</a>
<a id='line_1365'>    That I should do what I abhor to name,</a>
<a id='line_1366'>    Or else thou diest to-morrow.</a>
<a id='line_1367'>  CLAUDIO. Thou shalt not do't.</a>
<a id='line_1368'>  ISABELLA. O, were it but my life!</a>
<a id='line_1369'>    I'd throw it down for your deliverance</a>
<a id='line_1370'>    As frankly as a pin.</a>
<a id='line_1371'>  CLAUDIO. Thanks, dear Isabel.</a>
<a id='line_1372'>  ISABELLA. Be ready, Claudio, for your death to-morrow.</a>
<a id='line_1373'>  CLAUDIO. Yes. Has he affections in him</a>
<a id='line_1374'>    That thus can make him bite the law by th' nose</a>
<a id='line_1375'>    When he would force it? Sure it is no sin;</a>
<a id='line_1376'>    Or of the deadly seven it is the least.</a>
<a id='line_1377'>  ISABELLA. Which is the least?</a>
<a id='line_1378'>  CLAUDIO. If it were damnable, he being so wise,</a>
<a id='line_1379'>    Why would he for the momentary trick</a>
<a id='line_1380'>    Be perdurably fin'd?- O Isabel!</a>
<a id='line_1381'>  ISABELLA. What says my brother?</a>
<a id='line_1382'>  CLAUDIO. Death is a fearful thing.</a>
<a id='line_1383'>  ISABELLA. And shamed life a hateful.</a>
<a id='line_1384'>  CLAUDIO. Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;</a>
<a id='line_1385'>    To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;</a>
<a id='line_1386'>    This sensible warm motion to become</a>
<a id='line_1387'>    A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit</a>

<a id='line_1389'>    In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;</a>
<a id='line_1390'>    To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,</a>
<a id='line_1391'>    And blown with restless violence round about</a>

<a id='line_1393'>    Of those that lawless and incertain thought</a>
<a id='line_1394'>    Imagine howling- 'tis too horrible.</a>
<a id='line_1395'>    The weariest and most loathed worldly life</a>
<a id='line_1396'>    That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment,</a>
<a id='line_1397'>    Can lay on nature is a paradise</a>
<a id='line_1398'>    To what we fear of death.</a>
<a id='line_1399'>  ISABELLA. Alas, alas!</a>
<a id='line_1400'>  CLAUDIO. Sweet sister, let me live.</a>
<a id='line_1401'>    What sin you do to save a brother's life,</a>
<a id='line_1402'>    Nature dispenses with the deed so far</a>

<a id='line_1406'>    Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?</a>
<a id='line_1407'>    Is't not a kind of incest to take life</a>

<a id='line_1418'>    Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.</a>
<a id='line_1419'>    Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd;</a>

<a id='line_1425'>  DUKE. Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.</a>
<a id='line_1426'>  ISABELLA. What is your will?</a>
<a id='line_1427'>  DUKE. Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and by have</a>
<a id='line_1428'>    some speech with you; the satisfaction I would require is</a>
<a id='line_1429'>    likewise your own benefit.</a>
<a id='line_1430'>  ISABELLA. I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be stolen out</a>

<a id='line_1433'>  DUKE. Son, I have overheard what hath pass'd between you and your</a>
<a id='line_1434'>    sister. Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her; only he hath</a>
<a id='line_1435'>    made an assay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the</a>
<a id='line_1436'>    disposition of natures. She, having the truth of honour in her,</a>
<a id='line_1437'>    hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to</a>
<a id='line_1438'>    receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I know this to be true;</a>
<a id='line_1439'>    therefore prepare yourself to death. Do not satisfy your</a>
<a id='line_1440'>    resolution with hopes that are fallible; to-morrow you must die;</a>
<a id='line_1441'>    go to your knees and make ready.</a>
<a id='line_1442'>  CLAUDIO. Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life</a>

<a id='line_1449'>  PROVOST. What's your will, father?</a>
<a id='line_1450'>  DUKE. That, now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me a while</a>
<a id='line_1451'>    with the maid; my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch</a>

<a id='line_1453'>  PROVOST. In good time.                            Exit PROVOST</a>
<a id='line_1454'>  DUKE. The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good; the</a>
<a id='line_1455'>    goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness;</a>
<a id='line_1456'>    but grace, being the soul of your complexion, shall keep the body</a>
<a id='line_1457'>    of it ever fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,</a>
<a id='line_1458'>    fortune hath convey'd to my understanding; and, but that frailty</a>
<a id='line_1459'>    hath examples for his falling, I should wonder at Angelo. How</a>
<a id='line_1460'>    will you do to content this substitute, and to save your brother?</a>
<a id='line_1461'>  ISABELLA. I am now going to resolve him; I had rather my brother</a>
<a id='line_1462'>    die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born. But, O, how</a>
<a id='line_1463'>    much is the good Duke deceiv'd in Angelo! If ever he return, and</a>
<a id='line_1464'>    I can speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or discover his</a>
<a id='line_1465'>    government.</a>
<a id='line_1466'>  DUKE. That shall not be much amiss; yet, as the matter now stands,</a>
<a id='line_1467'>    he will avoid your accusation: he made trial of you only.</a>
<a id='line_1468'>    Therefore fasten your ear on my advisings; to the love I have in</a>
<a id='line_1469'>    doing good a remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe</a>
<a id='line_1470'>    that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited</a>
<a id='line_1471'>    benefit; redeem your brother from the angry law; do no stain to</a>
<a id='line_1472'>    your own gracious person; and much please the absent Duke, if</a>
<a id='line_1473'>    peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this</a>
<a id='line_1474'>    business.</a>
<a id='line_1475'>  ISABELLA. Let me hear you speak farther; I have spirit to do</a>
<a id='line_1476'>    anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.</a>
<a id='line_1477'>  DUKE. Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not</a>
<a id='line_1478'>    heard speak of Mariana, the sister of Frederick, the great</a>
<a id='line_1479'>    soldier who miscarried at sea?</a>
<a id='line_1480'>  ISABELLA. I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her</a>
<a id='line_1481'>    name.</a>
<a id='line_1482'>  DUKE. She should this Angelo have married; was affianced to her by</a>
<a id='line_1483'>    oath, and the nuptial appointed; between which time of the</a>
<a id='line_1484'>    contract and limit of the solemnity her brother Frederick was</a>
<a id='line_1485'>    wreck'd at sea, having in that perished vessel the dowry of his</a>
<a id='line_1486'>    sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman:</a>
<a id='line_1487'>    there she lost a noble and renowned brother, in his love toward</a>
<a id='line_1488'>    her ever most kind and natural; with him the portion and sinew of</a>
<a id='line_1489'>    her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her combinate</a>
<a id='line_1490'>    husband, this well-seeming Angelo.</a>
<a id='line_1491'>  ISABELLA. Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?</a>
<a id='line_1492'>  DUKE. Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his</a>
<a id='line_1493'>    comfort; swallowed his vows whole, pretending in her discoveries</a>
<a id='line_1494'>    of dishonour; in few, bestow'd her on her own lamentation, which</a>
<a id='line_1495'>    she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, is</a>
<a id='line_1496'>    washed with them, but relents not.</a>
<a id='line_1497'>  ISABELLA. What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from</a>
<a id='line_1498'>    the world! What corruption in this life that it will let this man</a>
<a id='line_1499'>    live! But how out of this can she avail?</a>
<a id='line_1500'>  DUKE. It is a rupture that you may easily heal; and the cure of it</a>
<a id='line_1501'>    not only saves your brother, but keeps you from dishonour in</a>
<a id='line_1502'>    doing it.</a>
<a id='line_1503'>  ISABELLA. Show me how, good father.</a>
<a id='line_1504'>  DUKE. This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her</a>
<a id='line_1505'>    first affection; his unjust unkindness, that in all reason should</a>
<a id='line_1506'>    have quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the current,</a>
<a id='line_1507'>    made it more violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his</a>
<a id='line_1508'>    requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with his demands to</a>
<a id='line_1509'>    the point; only refer yourself to this advantage: first, that</a>
<a id='line_1510'>    your stay with him may not be long; that the time may have all</a>
<a id='line_1511'>    shadow and silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.</a>
<a id='line_1512'>    This being granted in course- and now follows all: we shall</a>
<a id='line_1513'>    advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment, go in your</a>
<a id='line_1514'>    place. If the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may</a>
<a id='line_1515'>    compel him to her recompense; and here, by this, is your brother</a>
<a id='line_1516'>    saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana advantaged, and</a>
<a id='line_1517'>    the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid will I frame and make fit for</a>
<a id='line_1518'>    his attempt. If you think well to carry this as you may, the</a>
<a id='line_1519'>    doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. What</a>
<a id='line_1520'>    think you of it?</a>
<a id='line_1521'>  ISABELLA. The image of it gives me content already; and I trust it</a>
<a id='line_1522'>    will grow to a most prosperous perfection.</a>
<a id='line_1523'>  DUKE. It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily to</a>
<a id='line_1524'>    Angelo; if for this night he entreat you to his bed, give him</a>
<a id='line_1525'>    promise of satisfaction. I will presently to Saint Luke's; there,</a>
<a id='line_1526'>    at the moated grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that</a>
<a id='line_1527'>    place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that it may be</a>
<a id='line_1528'>    quickly.</a>
<a id='line_1529'>  ISABELLA. I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.</a>
<a id='line_1530'>                                                Exeunt severally</a>

<a id='line_1540'>  DUKE. O heavens! what stuff is here?</a>
<a id='line_1541'>  POMPEY. 'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the merriest</a>
<a id='line_1542'>    was put down, and the worser allow'd by order of law a furr'd</a>
<a id='line_1543'>    gown to keep him warm; and furr'd with fox on lamb-skins too, to</a>

<a id='line_1546'>  ELBOW. Come your way, sir. Bless you, good father friar.</a>
<a id='line_1547'>  DUKE. And you, good brother father. What offence hath this man made</a>
<a id='line_1548'>    you, sir?</a>
<a id='line_1549'>  ELBOW. Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir, we take him</a>
<a id='line_1550'>    to be a thief too, sir, for we have found upon him, sir, a</a>
<a id='line_1551'>    strange picklock, which we have sent to the deputy.</a>
<a id='line_1552'>  DUKE. Fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd!</a>
<a id='line_1553'>    The evil that thou causest to be done,</a>
<a id='line_1554'>    That is thy means to live. Do thou but think</a>
<a id='line_1555'>    What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back</a>
<a id='line_1556'>    From such a filthy vice; say to thyself</a>
<a id='line_1557'>    'From their abominable and beastly touches</a>
<a id='line_1558'>    I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.'</a>
<a id='line_1559'>    Canst thou believe thy living is a life,</a>
<a id='line_1560'>    So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.</a>
<a id='line_1561'>  POMPEY. Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet, sir,</a>
<a id='line_1562'>    I would prove-</a>
<a id='line_1563'>  DUKE. Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,</a>
<a id='line_1564'>    Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer;</a>
<a id='line_1565'>    Correction and instruction must both work</a>
<a id='line_1566'>    Ere this rude beast will profit.</a>
<a id='line_1567'>  ELBOW. He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him warning.</a>
<a id='line_1568'>    The deputy cannot abide a whoremaster; if he be a whoremonger,</a>
<a id='line_1569'>    and comes before him, he were as good go a mile on his errand.</a>
<a id='line_1570'>  DUKE. That we were all, as some would seem to be,</a>
<a id='line_1571'>    From our faults, as his faults from seeming, free.</a>
<a id='line_1572'>  ELBOW. His neck will come to your waist- a cord, sir.</a>
<a id='line_1573'></a>
<a id='line_1574'>                          Enter LUCIO</a>
<a id='line_1575'></a>
<a id='line_1576'>  POMPEY. I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman, and a friend</a>
<a id='line_1577'>    of mine.</a>
<a id='line_1578'>  LUCIO. How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of Caesar? Art</a>
<a id='line_1579'>    thou led in triumph? What, is there none of Pygmalion's images,</a>
<a id='line_1580'>    newly made woman, to be had now for putting the hand in the</a>
<a id='line_1581'>    pocket and extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What say'st</a>
<a id='line_1582'>    thou to this tune, matter, and method? Is't not drown'd i' th'</a>
<a id='line_1583'>    last rain, ha? What say'st thou, trot? Is the world as it was,</a>
<a id='line_1584'>    man? Which is the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The</a>
<a id='line_1585'>    trick of it?</a>
<a id='line_1586'>  DUKE. Still thus, and thus; still worse!</a>
<a id='line_1587'>  LUCIO. How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she still,</a>
<a id='line_1588'>    ha?</a>
<a id='line_1589'>  POMPEY. Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is</a>
<a id='line_1590'>    herself in the tub.</a>
<a id='line_1591'>  LUCIO. Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be so; ever</a>
<a id='line_1592'>    your fresh whore and your powder'd bawd- an unshunn'd</a>
<a id='line_1593'>    consequence; it must be so. Art going to prison, Pompey?</a>
<a id='line_1594'>  POMPEY. Yes, faith, sir.</a>
<a id='line_1595'>  LUCIO. Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell; go, say I sent thee</a>
<a id='line_1596'>    thither. For debt, Pompey- or how?</a>
<a id='line_1597'>  ELBOW. For being a bawd, for being a bawd.</a>
<a id='line_1598'>  LUCIO. Well, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be the due of a</a>
<a id='line_1599'>    bawd, why, 'tis his right. Bawd is he doubtless, and of</a>
<a id='line_1600'>    antiquity, too; bawd-born. Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to</a>
<a id='line_1601'>    the prison, Pompey. You will turn good husband now, Pompey; you</a>
<a id='line_1602'>    will keep the house.</a>
<a id='line_1603'>  POMPEY. I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.</a>
<a id='line_1604'>  LUCIO. No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear. I will</a>
<a id='line_1605'>    pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage. If you take it not</a>
<a id='line_1606'>    patiently, why, your mettle is the more. Adieu trusty Pompey.</a>
<a id='line_1607'>    Bless you, friar.</a>
<a id='line_1608'>  DUKE. And you.</a>
<a id='line_1609'>  LUCIO. Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?</a>
<a id='line_1610'>  ELBOW. Come your ways, sir; come.</a>
<a id='line_1611'>  POMPEY. You will not bail me then, sir?</a>
<a id='line_1612'>  LUCIO. Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar? what news?</a>
<a id='line_1613'>  ELBOW. Come your ways, sir; come.</a>
<a id='line_1614'>  LUCIO. Go to kennel, Pompey, go.</a>
<a id='line_1615'></a>
<a id='line_1616'>                               Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and OFFICERS</a>
<a id='line_1617'></a>
<a id='line_1618'>    What news, friar, of the Duke?</a>
<a id='line_1619'>  DUKE. I know none. Can you tell me of any?</a>
<a id='line_1620'>  LUCIO. Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is</a>
<a id='line_1621'>    in Rome; but where is he, think you?</a>
<a id='line_1622'>  DUKE. I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.</a>
<a id='line_1623'>  LUCIO. It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the</a>
<a id='line_1624'>    state and usurp the beggary he was never born to. Lord Angelo</a>
<a id='line_1625'>    dukes it well in his absence; he puts transgression to't.</a>
<a id='line_1626'>  DUKE. He does well in't.</a>
<a id='line_1627'>  LUCIO. A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him;</a>
<a id='line_1628'>    something too crabbed that way, friar.</a>
<a id='line_1629'>  DUKE. It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.</a>
<a id='line_1630'>  LUCIO. Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is</a>
<a id='line_1631'>    well allied; but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till</a>
<a id='line_1632'>    eating and drinking be put down. They say this Angelo was not</a>
<a id='line_1633'>    made by man and woman after this downright way of creation. Is it</a>
<a id='line_1634'>    true, think you?</a>
<a id='line_1635'>  DUKE. How should he be made, then?</a>
<a id='line_1636'>  LUCIO. Some report a sea-maid spawn'd him; some, that he was begot</a>
<a id='line_1637'>    between two stock-fishes. But it is certain that when he makes</a>
<a id='line_1638'>    water his urine is congeal'd ice; that I know to be true. And he</a>
<a id='line_1639'>    is a motion generative; that's infallible.</a>
<a id='line_1640'>  DUKE. You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.</a>
<a id='line_1641'>  LUCIO. Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion</a>
<a id='line_1642'>    of a codpiece to take away the life of a man! Would the Duke that</a>
<a id='line_1643'>    is absent have done this? Ere he would have hang'd a man for the</a>
<a id='line_1644'>    getting a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a</a>
<a id='line_1645'>    thousand. He had some feeling of the sport; he knew the service,</a>
<a id='line_1646'>    and that instructed him to mercy.</a>
<a id='line_1647'>  DUKE. I never heard the absent Duke much detected for women; he was</a>
<a id='line_1648'>    not inclin'd that way.</a>
<a id='line_1649'>  LUCIO. O, sir, you are deceiv'd.</a>
<a id='line_1650'>  DUKE. 'Tis not possible.</a>
<a id='line_1651'>  LUCIO. Who- not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use</a>
<a id='line_1652'>    was to put a ducat in her clack-dish. The Duke had crotchets in</a>
<a id='line_1653'>    him. He would be drunk too; that let me inform you.</a>
<a id='line_1654'>  DUKE. You do him wrong, surely.</a>
<a id='line_1655'>  LUCIO. Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the Duke; and</a>
<a id='line_1656'>    I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing.</a>
<a id='line_1657'>  DUKE. What, I prithee, might be the cause?</a>
<a id='line_1658'>  LUCIO. No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be lock'd within the teeth</a>
<a id='line_1659'>    and the lips; but this I can let you understand: the greater file</a>
<a id='line_1660'>    of the subject held the Duke to be wise.</a>
<a id='line_1661'>  DUKE. Wise? Why, no question but he was.</a>
<a id='line_1662'>  LUCIO. A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.</a>
<a id='line_1663'>  DUKE. Either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking; the very</a>
<a id='line_1664'>    stream of his life, and the business he hath helmed, must, upon a</a>
<a id='line_1665'>    warranted need, give him a better proclamation. Let him be but</a>
<a id='line_1666'>    testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he shall appear to</a>
<a id='line_1667'>    the envious a scholar, a statesman, and a soldier. Therefore you</a>
<a id='line_1668'>    speak unskilfully; or, if your knowledge be more, it is much</a>
<a id='line_1669'>    dark'ned in your malice.</a>
<a id='line_1670'>  LUCIO. Sir, I know him, and I love him.</a>
<a id='line_1671'>  DUKE. Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer</a>
<a id='line_1672'>    love.</a>
<a id='line_1673'>  LUCIO. Come, sir, I know what I know.</a>
<a id='line_1674'>  DUKE. I can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak.</a>
<a id='line_1675'>    But, if ever the Duke return, as our prayers are he may, let me</a>
<a id='line_1676'>    desire you to make your answer before him. If it be honest you</a>
<a id='line_1677'>    have spoke, you have courage to maintain it; I am bound to call</a>
<a id='line_1678'>    upon you; and I pray you your name?</a>
<a id='line_1679'>  LUCIO. Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.</a>
<a id='line_1680'>  DUKE. He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to report you.</a>
<a id='line_1681'>  LUCIO. I fear you not.</a>
<a id='line_1682'>  DUKE. O, you hope the Duke will return no more; or you imagine me</a>
<a id='line_1683'>    too unhurtful an opposite. But, indeed, I can do you little harm:</a>
<a id='line_1684'>    you'll forswear this again.</a>
<a id='line_1685'>  LUCIO. I'll be hang'd first. Thou art deceiv'd in me, friar. But no</a>
<a id='line_1686'>    more of this. Canst thou tell if Claudio die to-morrow or no?</a>
<a id='line_1687'>  DUKE. Why should he die, sir?</a>
<a id='line_1688'>  LUCIO. Why? For filling a bottle with a tun-dish. I would the Duke</a>
<a id='line_1689'>    we talk of were return'd again. This ungenitur'd agent will</a>
<a id='line_1690'>    unpeople the province with continency; sparrows must not build in</a>
<a id='line_1691'>    his house-eaves because they are lecherous. The Duke yet would</a>
<a id='line_1692'>    have dark deeds darkly answered; he would never bring them to</a>
<a id='line_1693'>    light. Would he were return'd! Marry, this Claudio is condemned</a>
<a id='line_1694'>    for untrussing. Farewell, good friar; I prithee pray for me. The</a>
<a id='line_1695'>    Duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on Fridays. He's not</a>
<a id='line_1696'>    past it yet; and, I say to thee, he would mouth with a beggar</a>
<a id='line_1697'>    though she smelt brown bread and garlic. Say that I said so.</a>
<a id='line_1698'>    Farewell.                                               Exit</a>
<a id='line_1699'>  DUKE. No might nor greatness in mortality</a>
<a id='line_1700'>    Can censure scape; back-wounding calumny</a>
<a id='line_1701'>    The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong</a>
<a id='line_1702'>    Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?</a>
<a id='line_1703'>    But who comes here?</a>
<a id='line_1704'></a>

<a id='line_1715'>  MRS. OVERDONE. My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.</a>
<a id='line_1716'>    Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the Duke's time;</a>
<a id='line_1717'>    he promis'd her marriage. His child is a year and a quarter old</a>
<a id='line_1718'>    come Philip and Jacob; I have kept it myself; and see how he goes</a>
<a id='line_1719'>    about to abuse me.</a>
<a id='line_1720'>  ESCALUS. That fellow is a fellow of much license. Let him be call'd</a>

<a id='line_1722'>    OFFICERS with MISTRESS OVERDONE]  Provost, my brother Angelo will</a>
<a id='line_1723'>    not be alter'd: Claudio must die to-morrow. Let him be furnish'd</a>
<a id='line_1724'>    with divines, and have all charitable preparation. If my brother</a>
<a id='line_1725'>    wrought by my pity, it should not be so with him.</a>
<a id='line_1726'>  PROVOST. So please you, this friar hath been with him, and advis'd</a>

<a id='line_1729'>  DUKE. Bliss and goodness on you!</a>
<a id='line_1730'>  ESCALUS. Of whence are you?</a>
<a id='line_1731'>  DUKE. Not of this country, though my chance is now</a>
<a id='line_1732'>    To use it for my time. I am a brother</a>
<a id='line_1733'>    Of gracious order, late come from the See</a>
<a id='line_1734'>    In special business from his Holiness.</a>
<a id='line_1735'>  ESCALUS. What news abroad i' th' world?</a>
<a id='line_1736'>  DUKE. None, but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the</a>
<a id='line_1737'>    dissolution of it must cure it. Novelty is only in request; and,</a>
<a id='line_1738'>    as it is, as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is</a>
<a id='line_1739'>    virtuous to be constant in any undertakeing. There is scarce</a>
<a id='line_1740'>    truth enough alive to make societies secure; but security enough</a>
<a id='line_1741'>    to make fellowships accurst. Much upon this riddle runs the</a>
<a id='line_1742'>    wisdom of the world. This news is old enough, yet it is every</a>
<a id='line_1743'>    day's news. I pray you, sir, of what disposition was the Duke?</a>
<a id='line_1744'>  ESCALUS. One that, above all other strifes, contended especially to</a>
<a id='line_1745'>    know himself.</a>
<a id='line_1746'>  DUKE. What pleasure was he given to?</a>
<a id='line_1747'>  ESCALUS. Rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at</a>
<a id='line_1748'>    anything which profess'd to make him rejoice; a gentleman of all</a>
<a id='line_1749'>    temperance. But leave we him to his events, with a prayer they</a>
<a id='line_1750'>    may prove prosperous; and let me desire to know how you find</a>
<a id='line_1751'>    Claudio prepar'd. I am made to understand that you have lent him</a>
<a id='line_1752'>    visitation.</a>
<a id='line_1753'>  DUKE. He professes to have received no sinister measure from his</a>
<a id='line_1754'>    judge, but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of</a>
<a id='line_1755'>    justice. Yet had he framed to himself, by the instruction of his</a>
<a id='line_1756'>    frailty, many deceiving promises of life; which I, by my good</a>
<a id='line_1757'>    leisure, have discredited to him, and now he is resolv'd to die.</a>
<a id='line_1758'>  ESCALUS. You have paid the heavens your function, and the prisoner</a>
<a id='line_1759'>    the very debt of your calling. I have labour'd for the poor</a>
<a id='line_1760'>    gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty; but my brother</a>
<a id='line_1761'>    justice have I found so severe that he hath forc'd me to tell him</a>
<a id='line_1762'>    he is indeed Justice.</a>
<a id='line_1763'>  DUKE. If his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding, it</a>
<a id='line_1764'>    shall become him well; wherein if he chance to fail, he hath</a>

<a id='line_2001'>  PROVOST. None, sir, none.</a>
<a id='line_2002'>  DUKE. As near the dawning, Provost, as it is,</a>
<a id='line_2003'>    You shall hear more ere morning.</a>
<a id='line_2004'>  PROVOST. Happily</a>
<a id='line_2005'>    You something know; yet I believe there comes</a>
<a id='line_2006'>    No countermand; no such example have we.</a>
<a id='line_2007'>    Besides, upon the very siege of justice,</a>
<a id='line_2008'>    Lord Angelo hath to the public ear</a>
<a id='line_2009'>    Profess'd the contrary.</a>
<a id='line_2010'></a>
<a id='line_2011'>                         Enter a MESSENGER</a>
<a id='line_2012'>    This is his lordship's man.</a>
<a id='line_2013'>  DUKE. And here comes Claudio's pardon.</a>
<a id='line_2014'>  MESSENGER. My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this further</a>
<a id='line_2015'>    charge, that you swerve not from the smallest article of it,</a>
<a id='line_2016'>    neither in time, matter, or other circumstance. Good morrow; for</a>
<a id='line_2017'>    as I take it, it is almost day.</a>
<a id='line_2018'>  PROVOST. I shall obey him.                      Exit MESSENGER</a>
<a id='line_2019'>  DUKE. [Aside] This is his pardon, purchas'd by such sin</a>
<a id='line_2020'>    For which the pardoner himself is in;</a>
<a id='line_2021'>    Hence hath offence his quick celerity,</a>
<a id='line_2022'>    When it is borne in high authority.</a>
<a id='line_2023'>    When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended</a>
<a id='line_2024'>    That for the fault's love is th' offender friended.</a>
<a id='line_2025'>    Now, sir, what news?</a>
<a id='line_2026'>  PROVOST. I told you: Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss in mine</a>
<a id='line_2027'>    office, awakens me with this unwonted putting-on; methinks</a>
<a id='line_2028'>    strangely, for he hath not us'd it before.</a>
<a id='line_2029'>  DUKE. Pray you, let's hear.</a>
<a id='line_2030'>  PROVOST. [Reads] 'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let</a>
<a id='line_2031'>    Claudio be executed by four of the clock, and, in the afternoon,</a>
<a id='line_2032'>    Barnardine. For my better satisfaction, let me have Claudio's</a>
<a id='line_2033'>    head sent me by five. Let this be duly performed, with a thought</a>
<a id='line_2034'>    that more depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail not</a>
<a id='line_2035'>    to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'</a>
<a id='line_2036'>    What say you to this, sir?</a>
<a id='line_2037'>  DUKE. What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in th'</a>
<a id='line_2038'>    afternoon?</a>
<a id='line_2039'>  PROVOST. A Bohemian born; but here nurs'd up and bred.</a>
<a id='line_2040'>    One that is a prisoner nine years old.</a>
<a id='line_2041'>  DUKE. How came it that the absent Duke had not either deliver'd him</a>
<a id='line_2042'>    to his liberty or executed him? I have heard it was ever his</a>
<a id='line_2043'>    manner to do so.</a>
<a id='line_2044'>  PROVOST. His friends still wrought reprieves for him; and, indeed,</a>
<a id='line_2045'>    his fact, till now in the government of Lord Angelo, came not to</a>
<a id='line_2046'>    an undoubted proof.</a>
<a id='line_2047'>  DUKE. It is now apparent?</a>
<a id='line_2048'>  PROVOST. Most manifest, and not denied by himself.</a>
<a id='line_2049'>  DUKE. Hath he borne himself penitently in prison? How seems he to</a>
<a id='line_2050'>    be touch'd?</a>
<a id='line_2051'>  PROVOST. A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a</a>
<a id='line_2052'>    drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless, of what's past,</a>
<a id='line_2053'>    present, or to come; insensible of mortality and desperately</a>
<a id='line_2054'>    mortal.</a>
<a id='line_2055'>  DUKE. He wants advice.</a>
<a id='line_2056'>  PROVOST. He will hear none. He hath evermore had the liberty of the</a>
<a id='line_2057'>    prison; give him leave to escape hence, he would not; drunk many</a>
<a id='line_2058'>    times a day, if not many days entirely drunk. We have very oft</a>
<a id='line_2059'>    awak'd him, as if to carry him to execution, and show'd him a</a>
<a id='line_2060'>    seeming warrant for it; it hath not moved him at all.</a>
<a id='line_2061'>  DUKE. More of him anon. There is written in your brow, Provost,</a>
<a id='line_2062'>    honesty and constancy. If I read it not truly, my ancient skill</a>
<a id='line_2063'>    beguiles me; but in the boldness of my cunning I will lay myself</a>
<a id='line_2064'>    in hazard. Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is no</a>
<a id='line_2065'>    greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath sentenc'd him. To</a>
<a id='line_2066'>    make you understand this in a manifested effect, I crave but four</a>
<a id='line_2067'>    days' respite; for the which you are to do me both a present and</a>
<a id='line_2068'>    a dangerous courtesy.</a>
<a id='line_2069'>  PROVOST. Pray, sir, in what?</a>
<a id='line_2070'>  DUKE. In the delaying death.</a>
<a id='line_2071'>  PROVOST. Alack! How may I do it, having the hour limited, and an</a>
<a id='line_2072'>    express command, under penalty, to deliver his head in the view</a>
<a id='line_2073'>    of Angelo? I may make my case as Claudio's, to cross this in the</a>
<a id='line_2074'>    smallest.</a>
<a id='line_2075'>  DUKE. By the vow of mine order, I warrant you, if my instructions</a>
<a id='line_2076'>    may be your guide. Let this Barnardine be this morning executed,</a>
<a id='line_2077'>    and his head borne to Angelo.</a>
<a id='line_2078'>  PROVOST. Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.</a>
<a id='line_2079'>  DUKE. O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it. Shave</a>
<a id='line_2080'>    the head and tie the beard; and say it was the desire of the</a>
<a id='line_2081'>    penitent to be so bar'd before his death. You know the course is</a>
<a id='line_2082'>    common. If anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and</a>
<a id='line_2083'>    good fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead against</a>
<a id='line_2084'>    it with my life.</a>
<a id='line_2085'>  PROVOST. Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.</a>
<a id='line_2086'>  DUKE. Were you sworn to the Duke, or to the deputy?</a>
<a id='line_2087'>  PROVOST. To him and to his substitutes.</a>
<a id='line_2088'>  DUKE. You will think you have made no offence if the Duke avouch</a>
<a id='line_2089'>    the justice of your dealing?</a>
<a id='line_2090'>  PROVOST. But what likelihood is in that?</a>
<a id='line_2091'>  DUKE. Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see you</a>
<a id='line_2092'>    fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor persuasion, can</a>
<a id='line_2093'>    with ease attempt you, I will go further than I meant, to pluck</a>
<a id='line_2094'>    all fears out of you. Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of</a>
<a id='line_2095'>    the Duke. You know the character, I doubt not; and the signet is</a>
<a id='line_2096'>    not strange to you.</a>
<a id='line_2097'>  PROVOST. I know them both.</a>
<a id='line_2098'>  DUKE. The contents of this is the return of the Duke; you shall</a>
<a id='line_2099'>    anon over-read it at your pleasure, where you shall find within</a>
<a id='line_2100'>    these two days he will be here. This is a thing that Angelo knows</a>
<a id='line_2101'>    not; for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour,</a>
<a id='line_2102'>    perchance of the Duke's death, perchance entering into some</a>
<a id='line_2103'>    monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what is writ. Look, th'</a>
<a id='line_2104'>    unfolding star calls up the shepherd. Put not yourself into</a>
<a id='line_2105'>    amazement how these things should be: all difficulties are but</a>
<a id='line_2106'>    easy when they are known. Call your executioner, and off with</a>
<a id='line_2107'>    Barnardine's head. I will give him a present shrift, and advise</a>
<a id='line_2108'>    him for a better place. Yet you are amaz'd, but this shall</a>
<a id='line_2109'>    absolutely resolve you. Come away; it is almost clear dawn.</a>
<a id='line_2110'>                                                          Exeunt</a>

<a id='line_2116'>  POMPEY. I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house of</a>

<a id='line_2121'>  Marry, then ginger was not much in request, for the old women were</a>

<a id='line_2286'>  LUCIO. O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes</a>
<a id='line_2287'>    so red. Thou must be patient. I am fain to dine and sup with</a>
<a id='line_2288'>    water and bran; I dare not for my head fill my belly; one</a>
<a id='line_2289'>    fruitful meal would set me to't. But they say the Duke will be</a>
<a id='line_2290'>    here to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I lov'd thy brother. If the</a>
<a id='line_2291'>    old fantastical Duke of dark corners had been at home, he had</a>

<a id='line_2293'>  DUKE. Sir, the Duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports;</a>
<a id='line_2294'>    but the best is, he lives not in them.</a>
<a id='line_2295'>  LUCIO. Friar, thou knowest not the Duke so well as I do; he's a</a>

<a id='line_2297'>  DUKE. Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.</a>
<a id='line_2298'>  LUCIO. Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee; I can tell thee pretty</a>

<a id='line_2306'>  DUKE. Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.</a>
<a id='line_2307'>  LUCIO. By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end. If bawdy</a>

<a id='line_2463'>    In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,</a>

<a id='line_2468'>    If she be mad, as I believe no other,</a>
<a id='line_2469'>    Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,</a>
<a id='line_2470'>    Such a dependency of thing on thing,</a>
<a id='line_2471'>    As e'er I heard in madness.</a>
<a id='line_2472'>  ISABELLA. O gracious Duke,</a>
<a id='line_2473'>    Harp not on that; nor do not banish reason</a>
<a id='line_2474'>    For inequality; but let your reason serve</a>
<a id='line_2475'>    To make the truth appear where it seems hid,</a>
<a id='line_2476'>    And hide the false seems true.</a>
<a id='line_2477'>  DUKE. Many that are not mad</a>
<a id='line_2478'>    Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?</a>
<a id='line_2479'>  ISABELLA. I am the sister of one Claudio,</a>

<a id='line_2481'>    To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo.</a>
<a id='line_2482'>    I, in probation of a sisterhood,</a>

<a id='line_2485'>  LUCIO. That's I, an't like your Grace.</a>
<a id='line_2486'>    I came to her from Claudio, and desir'd her</a>
<a id='line_2487'>    To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo</a>
<a id='line_2488'>    For her poor brother's pardon.</a>
<a id='line_2489'>  ISABELLA. That's he, indeed.</a>
<a id='line_2490'>  DUKE. You were not bid to speak.</a>
<a id='line_2491'>  LUCIO. No, my good lord;</a>
<a id='line_2492'>    Nor wish'd to hold my peace.</a>
<a id='line_2493'>  DUKE. I wish you now, then;</a>
<a id='line_2494'>    Pray you take note of it; and when you have</a>
<a id='line_2495'>    A business for yourself, pray heaven you then</a>
<a id='line_2496'>    Be perfect.</a>
<a id='line_2497'>  LUCIO. I warrant your honour.</a>
<a id='line_2498'>  DUKE. The warrant's for yourself; take heed to't.</a>
<a id='line_2499'>  ISABELLA. This gentleman told somewhat of my tale.</a>
<a id='line_2500'>  LUCIO. Right.</a>
<a id='line_2501'>  DUKE. It may be right; but you are i' the wrong</a>
<a id='line_2502'>    To speak before your time. Proceed.</a>
<a id='line_2503'>  ISABELLA. I went</a>
<a id='line_2504'>    To this pernicious caitiff deputy.</a>
<a id='line_2505'>  DUKE. That's somewhat madly spoken.</a>
<a id='line_2506'>  ISABELLA. Pardon it;</a>

<a id='line_2508'>  DUKE. Mended again. The matter- proceed.</a>
<a id='line_2509'>  ISABELLA. In brief- to set the needless process by,</a>
<a id='line_2510'>    How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,</a>
<a id='line_2511'>    How he refell'd me, and how I replied,</a>
<a id='line_2512'>    For this was of much length- the vile conclusion</a>
<a id='line_2513'>    I now begin with grief and shame to utter:</a>
<a id='line_2514'>    He would not, but by gift of my chaste body</a>
<a id='line_2515'>    To his concupiscible intemperate lust,</a>
<a id='line_2516'>    Release my brother; and, after much debatement,</a>
<a id='line_2517'>    My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,</a>
<a id='line_2518'>    And I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes,</a>
<a id='line_2519'>    His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant</a>
<a id='line_2520'>    For my poor brother's head.</a>
<a id='line_2521'>  DUKE. This is most likely!</a>
<a id='line_2522'>  ISABELLA. O that it were as like as it is true!</a>
<a id='line_2523'>  DUKE. By heaven, fond wretch, thou know'st not what thou speak'st,</a>
<a id='line_2524'>    Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour</a>
<a id='line_2525'>    In hateful practice. First, his integrity</a>
<a id='line_2526'>    Stands without blemish; next, it imports no reason</a>
<a id='line_2527'>    That with such vehemency he should pursue</a>
<a id='line_2528'>    Faults proper to himself. If he had so offended,</a>
<a id='line_2529'>    He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself,</a>
<a id='line_2530'>    And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on;</a>
<a id='line_2531'>    Confess the truth, and say by whose advice</a>
<a id='line_2532'>    Thou cam'st here to complain.</a>
<a id='line_2533'>  ISABELLA. And is this all?</a>
<a id='line_2534'>    Then, O you blessed ministers above,</a>

<a id='line_2553'>  LUCIO. But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,</a>
<a id='line_2554'>    I saw them at the prison; a saucy friar,</a>
<a id='line_2555'>    A very scurvy fellow.</a>
<a id='line_2556'>  PETER. Blessed be your royal Grace!</a>
<a id='line_2557'>    I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard</a>

<a id='line_2569'>  LUCIO. My lord, most villainously; believe it.</a>
<a id='line_2570'>  PETER. Well, he in time may come to clear himself;</a>
<a id='line_2571'>    But at this instant he is sick, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_2572'>    Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request-</a>

<a id='line_2579'>    To justify this worthy nobleman,</a>
<a id='line_2580'>    So vulgarly and personally accus'd-</a>

<a id='line_2596'>  DUKE. What, are you married?</a>
<a id='line_2597'>  MARIANA. No, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2598'>  DUKE. Are you a maid?</a>
<a id='line_2599'>  MARIANA. No, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2600'>  DUKE. A widow, then?</a>
<a id='line_2601'>  MARIANA. Neither, my lord.</a>

<a id='line_2607'>  LUCIO. Well, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2608'>  MARIANA. My lord, I do confess I ne'er was married,</a>

<a id='line_2626'>    Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,</a>
<a id='line_2627'>    But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.</a>
<a id='line_2628'>  ANGELO. This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.</a>

<a id='line_2641'>  LUCIO. Enough, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2642'>  ANGELO. My lord, I must confess I know this woman;</a>
<a id='line_2643'>    And five years since there was some speech of marriage</a>

<a id='line_2646'>    Came short of composition; but in chief</a>
<a id='line_2647'>    For that her reputation was disvalued</a>
<a id='line_2648'>    In levity. Since which time of five years</a>
<a id='line_2649'>    I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,</a>

<a id='line_2821'>    That I, your vassal have employ'd and pain'd</a>
<a id='line_2822'>    Your unknown sovereignty.</a>
<a id='line_2823'>  DUKE. You are pardon'd, Isabel.</a>
<a id='line_2824'>    And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.</a>
<a id='line_2825'>    Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;</a>
<a id='line_2826'>    And you may marvel why I obscur'd myself,</a>
<a id='line_2827'>    Labouring to save his life, and would not rather</a>
<a id='line_2828'>    Make rash remonstrance of my hidden pow'r</a>
<a id='line_2829'>    Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,</a>
<a id='line_2830'>    It was the swift celerity of his death,</a>
<a id='line_2831'>    Which I did think with slower foot came on,</a>
<a id='line_2832'>    That brain'd my purpose. But peace be with him!</a>
<a id='line_2833'>    That life is better life, past fearing death,</a>
<a id='line_2834'>    Than that which lives to fear. Make it your comfort,</a>
<a id='line_2835'>    So happy is your brother.</a>
<a id='line_2836'>  ISABELLA. I do, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2837'></a>
<a id='line_2838'>       Re-enter ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and PROVOST</a>
<a id='line_2839'></a>
<a id='line_2840'>  DUKE. For this new-married man approaching here,</a>
<a id='line_2841'>    Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd</a>
<a id='line_2842'>    Your well-defended honour, you must pardon</a>
<a id='line_2843'>    For Mariana's sake; but as he adjudg'd your brother-</a>
<a id='line_2844'>    Being criminal in double violation</a>
<a id='line_2845'>    Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach,</a>
<a id='line_2846'>    Thereon dependent, for your brother's life-</a>
<a id='line_2847'>    The very mercy of the law cries out</a>
<a id='line_2848'>    Most audible, even from his proper tongue,</a>
<a id='line_2849'>    'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'</a>
<a id='line_2850'>    Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;</a>
<a id='line_2851'>    Like doth quit like, and Measure still for Measure.</a>
<a id='line_2852'>    Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested,</a>
<a id='line_2853'>    Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.</a>
<a id='line_2854'>    We do condemn thee to the very block</a>
<a id='line_2855'>    Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.</a>
<a id='line_2856'>    Away with him!</a>
<a id='line_2857'>  MARIANA. O my most gracious lord,</a>
<a id='line_2858'>    I hope you will not mock me with a husband.</a>
<a id='line_2859'>  DUKE. It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.</a>
<a id='line_2860'>    Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,</a>
<a id='line_2861'>    I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,</a>
<a id='line_2862'>    For that he knew you, might reproach your life,</a>
<a id='line_2863'>    And choke your good to come. For his possessions,</a>
<a id='line_2864'>    Although by confiscation they are ours,</a>
<a id='line_2865'>    We do instate and widow you withal</a>
<a id='line_2866'>    To buy you a better husband.</a>
<a id='line_2867'>  MARIANA. O my dear lord,</a>
<a id='line_2868'>    I crave no other, nor no better man.</a>
<a id='line_2869'>  DUKE. Never crave him; we are definitive.</a>
<a id='line_2870'>  MARIANA. Gentle my liege-                           [Kneeling]</a>
<a id='line_2871'>  DUKE. You do but lose your labour.</a>
<a id='line_2872'>    Away with him to death! [To LUCIO] Now, sir, to you.</a>
<a id='line_2873'>  MARIANA. O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;</a>
<a id='line_2874'>    Lend me your knees, and all my life to come</a>
<a id='line_2875'>    I'll lend you all my life to do you service.</a>
<a id='line_2876'>  DUKE. Against all sense you do importune her.</a>
<a id='line_2877'>    Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,</a>
<a id='line_2878'>    Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,</a>
<a id='line_2879'>    And take her hence in horror.</a>
<a id='line_2880'>  MARIANA. Isabel,</a>
<a id='line_2881'>    Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;</a>
<a id='line_2882'>    Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.</a>
<a id='line_2883'>    They say best men moulded out of faults;</a>
<a id='line_2884'>    And, for the most, become much more the better</a>
<a id='line_2885'>    For being a little bad; so may my husband.</a>
<a id='line_2886'>    O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?</a>
<a id='line_2887'>  DUKE. He dies for Claudio's death.</a>
<a id='line_2888'>  ISABELLA. [Kneeling] Most bounteous sir,</a>
<a id='line_2889'>    Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,</a>
<a id='line_2890'>    As if my brother liv'd. I partly think</a>
<a id='line_2891'>    A due sincerity govern'd his deeds</a>
<a id='line_2892'>    Till he did look on me; since it is so,</a>
<a id='line_2893'>    Let him not die. My brother had but justice,</a>
<a id='line_2894'>    In that he did the thing for which he died;</a>
<a id='line_2895'>    For Angelo,</a>
<a id='line_2896'>    His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,</a>
<a id='line_2897'>    And must be buried but as an intent</a>
<a id='line_2898'>    That perish'd by the way. Thoughts are no subjects;</a>
<a id='line_2899'>    Intents but merely thoughts.</a>
<a id='line_2900'>  MARIANA. Merely, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2901'>  DUKE. Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.</a>
<a id='line_2902'>    I have bethought me of another fault.</a>
<a id='line_2903'>    Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded</a>
<a id='line_2904'>    At an unusual hour?</a>
<a id='line_2905'>  PROVOST. It was commanded so.</a>
<a id='line_2906'>  DUKE. Had you a special warrant for the deed?</a>
<a id='line_2907'>  PROVOST. No, my good lord; it was by private message.</a>
<a id='line_2908'>  DUKE. For which I do discharge you of your office;</a>
<a id='line_2909'>    Give up your keys.</a>
<a id='line_2910'>  PROVOST. Pardon me, noble lord;</a>
<a id='line_2911'>    I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;</a>
<a id='line_2912'>    Yet did repent me, after more advice;</a>
<a id='line_2913'>    For testimony whereof, one in the prison,</a>
<a id='line_2914'>    That should by private order else have died,</a>
<a id='line_2915'>    I have reserv'd alive.</a>
<a id='line_2916'>  DUKE. What's he?</a>
<a id='line_2917'>  PROVOST. His name is Barnardine.</a>
<a id='line_2918'>  DUKE. I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.</a>
<a id='line_2919'>    Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.      Exit PROVOST</a>
<a id='line_2920'>  ESCALUS. I am sorry one so learned and so wise</a>
<a id='line_2921'>    As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,</a>
<a id='line_2922'>    Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood</a>
<a id='line_2923'>    And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.</a>
<a id='line_2924'>  ANGELO. I am sorry that such sorrow I procure;</a>
<a id='line_2925'>    And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart</a>
<a id='line_2926'>    That I crave death more willingly than mercy;</a>
<a id='line_2927'>    'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.</a>
<a id='line_2928'></a>
<a id='line_2929'>       Re-enter PROVOST, with BARNARDINE, CLAUDIO (muffled)</a>
<a id='line_2930'>                            and JULIET</a>
<a id='line_2931'></a>
<a id='line_2932'>  DUKE. Which is that Barnardine?</a>
<a id='line_2933'>  PROVOST. This, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2934'>  DUKE. There was a friar told me of this man.</a>
<a id='line_2935'>    Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul,</a>
<a id='line_2936'>    That apprehends no further than this world,</a>
<a id='line_2937'>    And squar'st thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd;</a>
<a id='line_2938'>    But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all,</a>
<a id='line_2939'>    And pray thee take this mercy to provide</a>
<a id='line_2940'>    For better times to come. Friar, advise him;</a>
<a id='line_2941'>    I leave him to your hand. What muffl'd fellow's that?</a>
<a id='line_2942'>  PROVOST. This is another prisoner that I sav'd,</a>
<a id='line_2943'>    Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;</a>
<a id='line_2944'>    As like almost to Claudio as himself.    [Unmuffles CLAUDIO]</a>
<a id='line_2945'>  DUKE. [To ISABELLA] If he be like your brother, for his sake</a>
<a id='line_2946'>    Is he pardon'd; and for your lovely sake,</a>
<a id='line_2947'>    Give me your hand and say you will be mine,</a>
<a id='line_2948'>    He is my brother too. But fitter time for that.</a>
<a id='line_2949'>    By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;</a>
<a id='line_2950'>    Methinks I see a quick'ning in his eye.</a>
<a id='line_2951'>    Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well.</a>
<a id='line_2952'>    Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.</a>
<a id='line_2953'>    I find an apt remission in myself;</a>
<a id='line_2954'>    And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.</a>
<a id='line_2955'>    To Lucio] You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,</a>
<a id='line_2956'>    One all of luxury, an ass, a madman!</a>
<a id='line_2957'>    Wherein have I so deserv'd of you</a>
<a id='line_2958'>    That you extol me thus?</a>
<a id='line_2959'>  LUCIO. Faith, my lord, I spoke it but according to the trick.</a>
<a id='line_2960'>    If you will hang me for it, you may; but I had rather it would</a>
<a id='line_2961'>    please you I might be whipt.</a>
<a id='line_2962'>  DUKE. Whipt first, sir, and hang'd after.</a>
<a id='line_2963'>    Proclaim it, Provost, round about the city,</a>
<a id='line_2964'>    If any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow-</a>
<a id='line_2965'>    As I have heard him swear himself there's one</a>
<a id='line_2966'>    Whom he begot with child, let her appear,</a>
<a id='line_2967'>    And he shall marry her. The nuptial finish'd,</a>
<a id='line_2968'>    Let him be whipt and hang'd.</a>
<a id='line_2969'>  LUCIO. I beseech your Highness, do not marry me to a whore. Your</a>
<a id='line_2970'>    Highness said even now I made you a duke; good my lord, do not</a>
<a id='line_2971'>    recompense me in making me a cuckold.</a>
<a id='line_2972'>  DUKE. Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.</a>
<a id='line_2973'>    Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal</a>
<a id='line_2974'>    Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;</a>
<a id='line_2975'>    And see our pleasure herein executed.</a>
<a id='line_2976'>  LUCIO. Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, whipping,</a>
<a id='line_2977'>    and hanging.</a>
<a id='line_2978'>  DUKE. Slandering a prince deserves it.</a>
<a id='line_2979'>                                      Exeunt OFFICERS with LUCIO</a>
<a id='line_2980'>    She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.</a>
<a id='line_2981'>    Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo;</a>
<a id='line_2982'>    I have confess'd her, and I know her virtue.</a>
<a id='line_2983'>    Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness;</a>
<a id='line_2984'>    There's more behind that is more gratulate.</a>
<a id='line_2985'>    Thanks, Provost, for thy care and secrecy;</a>
<a id='line_2986'>    We shall employ thee in a worthier place.</a>
<a id='line_2987'>    Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home</a>
<a id='line_2988'>    The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:</a>
<a id='line_2989'>    Th' offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,</a>
<a id='line_2990'>    I have a motion much imports your good;</a>
<a id='line_2991'>    Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,</a>
<a id='line_2992'>    What's mine is yours, and what is yours is mine.</a>
<a id='line_2993'>    So, bring us to our palace, where we'll show</a>
<a id='line_2994'>    What's yet behind that's meet you all should know.</a>
