<a id='line_3'>1:1 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of</a>
<a id='line_4'>the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred</a>
<a id='line_5'>up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation</a>
<a id='line_6'>throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying, 1:2</a>
<a id='line_7'>Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me</a>
<a id='line_8'>all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an</a>
<a id='line_9'>house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</a>
<a id='line_10'></a>
<a id='line_11'>1:3 Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and</a>
<a id='line_12'>let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of</a>
<a id='line_13'>the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_14'></a>
<a id='line_15'>1:4 And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the</a>
<a id='line_16'>men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods,</a>
<a id='line_17'>and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God</a>
<a id='line_18'>that is in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_19'></a>
<a id='line_20'>1:5 Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and</a>
<a id='line_21'>the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had</a>
<a id='line_22'>raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_23'></a>
<a id='line_24'>1:6 And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with</a>
<a id='line_25'>vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with</a>
<a id='line_26'>precious things, beside all that was willingly offered.</a>
<a id='line_27'></a>
<a id='line_28'>1:7 Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the</a>
<a id='line_29'>LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had</a>
<a id='line_30'>put them in the house of his gods; 1:8 Even those did Cyrus king of</a>
<a id='line_31'>Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and</a>
<a id='line_32'>numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'>1:9 And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a</a>
<a id='line_35'>thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives, 1:10 Thirty</a>
<a id='line_36'>basons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten,</a>
<a id='line_37'>and other vessels a thousand.</a>
<a id='line_38'></a>
<a id='line_39'>1:11 All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four</a>
<a id='line_40'>hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity</a>
<a id='line_41'>that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>2:1 Now these are the children of the province that went up out of the</a>
<a id='line_44'>captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar</a>
<a id='line_45'>the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and came again unto</a>
<a id='line_46'>Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city; 2:2 Which came with</a>

<a id='line_173'>2:62 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by</a>
<a id='line_174'>genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as polluted,</a>
<a id='line_175'>put from the priesthood.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>2:63 And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the</a>

<a id='line_188'>five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.</a>
<a id='line_189'></a>
<a id='line_190'>2:68 And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house</a>
<a id='line_191'>of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God</a>
<a id='line_192'>to set it up in his place: 2:69 They gave after their ability unto the</a>
<a id='line_193'>treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and</a>
<a id='line_194'>five thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priestsâ€™ garments.</a>
<a id='line_195'></a>
<a id='line_196'>2:70 So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the</a>
<a id='line_197'>singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities,</a>
<a id='line_198'>and all Israel in their cities.</a>
<a id='line_199'></a>
<a id='line_200'>3:1 And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel</a>
<a id='line_201'>were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man</a>
<a id='line_202'>to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_203'></a>
<a id='line_204'>3:2 Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the</a>
<a id='line_205'>priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and</a>
<a id='line_206'>builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings</a>
<a id='line_207'>thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.</a>
<a id='line_208'></a>
<a id='line_209'>3:3 And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them</a>
<a id='line_210'>because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt</a>
<a id='line_211'>offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and</a>
<a id='line_212'>evening.</a>
<a id='line_213'></a>
<a id='line_214'>3:4 They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and</a>
<a id='line_215'>offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom,</a>
<a id='line_216'>as the duty of every day required; 3:5 And afterward offered the</a>
<a id='line_217'>continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set</a>
<a id='line_218'>feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that</a>
<a id='line_219'>willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_220'></a>
<a id='line_221'>3:6 From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt</a>
<a id='line_222'>offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_223'>was not yet laid.</a>
<a id='line_224'></a>
<a id='line_225'>3:7 They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and</a>
<a id='line_226'>meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to</a>
<a id='line_227'>bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the</a>
<a id='line_228'>grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.</a>
<a id='line_229'></a>
<a id='line_230'>3:8 Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at</a>
<a id='line_231'>Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel,</a>
<a id='line_232'>and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the</a>
<a id='line_233'>priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the</a>
<a id='line_234'>captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years</a>
<a id='line_235'>old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>3:9 Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his</a>
<a id='line_238'>sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the</a>
<a id='line_239'>house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren</a>
<a id='line_240'>the Levites.</a>
<a id='line_241'></a>
<a id='line_242'>3:10 And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the</a>
<a id='line_243'>LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the</a>
<a id='line_244'>Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the</a>
<a id='line_245'>ordinance of David king of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'>3:11 And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks</a>
<a id='line_248'>unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever</a>
<a id='line_249'>toward Israel.</a>
<a id='line_250'></a>
<a id='line_251'>And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the</a>
<a id='line_252'>LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.</a>
<a id='line_253'></a>
<a id='line_254'>3:12 But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who</a>
<a id='line_255'>were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation</a>
<a id='line_256'>of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and</a>
<a id='line_257'>many shouted aloud for joy: 3:13 So that the people could not discern</a>
<a id='line_258'>the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the</a>
<a id='line_259'>people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was</a>
<a id='line_260'>heard afar off.</a>
<a id='line_261'></a>
<a id='line_262'>4:1 Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the</a>
<a id='line_263'>children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of</a>
<a id='line_264'>Israel; 4:2 Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the</a>
<a id='line_265'>fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your</a>
<a id='line_266'>God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of</a>
<a id='line_267'>Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.</a>
<a id='line_268'></a>
<a id='line_269'>4:3 But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the</a>
<a id='line_270'>fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to</a>
<a id='line_271'>build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto</a>
<a id='line_272'>the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath</a>
<a id='line_273'>commanded us.</a>
<a id='line_274'></a>
<a id='line_275'>4:4 Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of</a>
<a id='line_276'>Judah, and troubled them in building, 4:5 And hired counsellors</a>
<a id='line_277'>against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king</a>
<a id='line_278'>of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</a>
<a id='line_279'></a>
<a id='line_280'>4:6 And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign,</a>
<a id='line_281'>wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and</a>
<a id='line_282'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_283'></a>
<a id='line_284'>4:7 And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel,</a>
<a id='line_285'>and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and</a>
<a id='line_286'>the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and</a>
<a id='line_287'>interpreted in the Syrian tongue.</a>
<a id='line_288'></a>
<a id='line_289'>4:8 Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter</a>
<a id='line_290'>against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort: 4:9 Then wrote</a>
<a id='line_291'>Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their</a>
<a id='line_292'>companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the</a>
<a id='line_293'>Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the</a>
<a id='line_294'>Dehavites, and the Elamites, 4:10 And the rest of the nations whom the</a>
<a id='line_295'>great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of</a>
<a id='line_296'>Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a</a>
<a id='line_297'>time.</a>
<a id='line_298'></a>
<a id='line_299'>4:11 This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto</a>
<a id='line_300'>Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and</a>
<a id='line_301'>at such a time.</a>
<a id='line_302'></a>
<a id='line_303'>4:12 Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee</a>
<a id='line_304'>to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad</a>
<a id='line_305'>city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.</a>
<a id='line_306'></a>
<a id='line_307'>4:13 Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and</a>
<a id='line_308'>the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and</a>
<a id='line_309'>custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.</a>
<a id='line_310'></a>
<a id='line_311'>4:14 Now because we have maintenance from the kingâ€™s palace, and it</a>
<a id='line_312'>was not meet for us to see the kingâ€™s dishonour, therefore have we</a>
<a id='line_313'>sent and certified the king; 4:15 That search may be made in the book</a>
<a id='line_314'>of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the</a>
<a id='line_315'>records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful</a>
<a id='line_316'>unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the</a>
<a id='line_317'>same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.</a>
<a id='line_318'></a>
<a id='line_319'>4:16 We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the</a>
<a id='line_320'>walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this</a>
<a id='line_321'>side the river.</a>
<a id='line_322'></a>
<a id='line_323'>4:17 Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to</a>
<a id='line_324'>Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in</a>
<a id='line_325'>Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a</a>
<a id='line_326'>time.</a>
<a id='line_327'></a>
<a id='line_328'>4:18 The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before</a>
<a id='line_329'>me.</a>
<a id='line_330'></a>
<a id='line_331'>4:19 And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that</a>
<a id='line_332'>this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that</a>
<a id='line_333'>rebellion and sedition have been made therein.</a>
<a id='line_334'></a>
<a id='line_335'>4:20 There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have</a>
<a id='line_336'>ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and</a>
<a id='line_337'>custom, was paid unto them.</a>
<a id='line_338'></a>
<a id='line_339'>4:21 Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that</a>
<a id='line_340'>this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given</a>
<a id='line_341'>from me.</a>
<a id='line_342'></a>
<a id='line_343'>4:22 Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow</a>
<a id='line_344'>to the hurt of the kings?  4:23 Now when the copy of king Artaxerxesâ€™</a>
<a id='line_345'>letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their</a>
<a id='line_346'>companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made</a>
<a id='line_347'>them to cease by force and power.</a>
<a id='line_348'></a>
<a id='line_349'>4:24 Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_350'>So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of</a>
<a id='line_351'>Persia.</a>
<a id='line_352'></a>
<a id='line_353'>5:1 Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of</a>
<a id='line_354'>Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the</a>
<a id='line_355'>name of the God of Israel, even unto them.</a>
<a id='line_356'></a>
<a id='line_357'>5:2 Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son</a>
<a id='line_358'>of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem:</a>
<a id='line_359'>and with them were the prophets of God helping them.</a>
<a id='line_360'></a>
<a id='line_361'>5:3 At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the</a>
<a id='line_362'>river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said thus unto</a>
<a id='line_363'>them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this</a>
<a id='line_364'>wall?  5:4 Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the</a>
<a id='line_365'>names of the men that make this building?  5:5 But the eye of their</a>
<a id='line_366'>God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to</a>
<a id='line_367'>cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer</a>
<a id='line_368'>by letter concerning this matter.</a>
<a id='line_369'></a>
<a id='line_370'>5:6 The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the</a>
<a id='line_371'>river, and Shetharboznai and his companions the Apharsachites, which</a>
<a id='line_372'>were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king: 5:7 They sent</a>
<a id='line_373'>a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all</a>
<a id='line_374'>peace.</a>
<a id='line_375'></a>
<a id='line_376'>5:8 Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of</a>
<a id='line_377'>Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great</a>
<a id='line_378'>stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on,</a>
<a id='line_379'>and prospereth in their hands.</a>
<a id='line_380'></a>
<a id='line_381'>5:9 Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded</a>
<a id='line_382'>you to build this house, and to make up these walls?  5:10 We asked</a>
<a id='line_383'>their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of</a>
<a id='line_384'>the men that were the chief of them.</a>
<a id='line_385'></a>
<a id='line_386'>5:11 And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of</a>
<a id='line_387'>the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded</a>
<a id='line_388'>these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up.</a>
<a id='line_389'></a>
<a id='line_390'>5:12 But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto</a>
<a id='line_391'>wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of</a>
<a id='line_392'>Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the</a>
<a id='line_393'>people away into Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_394'></a>
<a id='line_395'>5:13 But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king</a>
<a id='line_396'>Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.</a>
<a id='line_397'></a>
<a id='line_398'>5:14 And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God,</a>
<a id='line_399'>which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and</a>
<a id='line_400'>brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take</a>
<a id='line_401'>out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose</a>
<a id='line_402'>name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; 5:15 And said unto</a>
<a id='line_403'>him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in</a>
<a id='line_404'>Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place.</a>
<a id='line_405'></a>
<a id='line_406'>5:16 Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the</a>
<a id='line_407'>house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now</a>
<a id='line_408'>hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.</a>
<a id='line_409'></a>
<a id='line_410'>5:17 Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search</a>
<a id='line_411'>made in the kingâ€™s treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether</a>
<a id='line_412'>it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house</a>
<a id='line_413'>of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us</a>
<a id='line_414'>concerning this matter.</a>
<a id='line_415'></a>
<a id='line_416'>6:1 Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the</a>
<a id='line_417'>house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_418'></a>
<a id='line_419'>6:2 And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the</a>
<a id='line_420'>province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written:</a>
<a id='line_421'>6:3 In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a</a>
<a id='line_422'>decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be</a>
<a id='line_423'>builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the</a>
<a id='line_424'>foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore</a>
<a id='line_425'>cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits; 6:4 With three rows</a>
<a id='line_426'>of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be</a>
<a id='line_427'>given out of the kingâ€™s house: 6:5 And also let the golden and silver</a>
<a id='line_428'>vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of</a>
<a id='line_429'>the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be</a>
<a id='line_430'>restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_431'>every one to his place, and place them in the house of God.</a>
<a id='line_432'></a>
<a id='line_433'>6:6 Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai,</a>
<a id='line_434'>and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be</a>
<a id='line_435'>ye far from thence: 6:7 Let the work of this house of God alone; let</a>
<a id='line_436'>the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house</a>
<a id='line_437'>of God in his place.</a>
<a id='line_438'></a>
<a id='line_439'>6:8 Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these</a>
<a id='line_440'>Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the kingâ€™s goods,</a>
<a id='line_441'>even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto</a>
<a id='line_442'>these men, that they be not hindered.</a>
<a id='line_443'></a>
<a id='line_444'>6:9 And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams,</a>
<a id='line_445'>and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt,</a>
<a id='line_446'>wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are</a>
<a id='line_447'>at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail: 6:10 That</a>
<a id='line_448'>they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and</a>
<a id='line_449'>pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.</a>
<a id='line_450'></a>
<a id='line_451'>6:11 Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word,</a>
<a id='line_452'>let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be</a>
<a id='line_453'>hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.</a>
<a id='line_454'></a>
<a id='line_455'>6:12 And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all</a>
<a id='line_456'>kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy</a>
<a id='line_457'>this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree;</a>
<a id='line_458'>let it be done with speed.</a>
<a id='line_459'></a>
<a id='line_460'>6:13 Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and</a>
<a id='line_461'>their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so</a>
<a id='line_462'>they did speedily.</a>
<a id='line_463'></a>
<a id='line_464'>6:14 And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through</a>
<a id='line_465'>the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo.</a>
<a id='line_466'>And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the</a>
<a id='line_467'>God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius,</a>
<a id='line_468'>and Artaxerxes king of Persia.</a>
<a id='line_469'></a>
<a id='line_470'>6:15 And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar,</a>
<a id='line_471'>which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.</a>
<a id='line_472'></a>
<a id='line_473'>6:16 And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the</a>
<a id='line_474'>rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this</a>
<a id='line_475'>house of God with joy.</a>
<a id='line_476'></a>
<a id='line_477'>6:17 And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred</a>
<a id='line_478'>bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering</a>
<a id='line_479'>for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes</a>
<a id='line_480'>of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_481'></a>
<a id='line_482'>6:18 And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in</a>
<a id='line_483'>their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is</a>
<a id='line_484'>written in the book of Moses.</a>
<a id='line_485'></a>
<a id='line_486'>6:19 And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the</a>
<a id='line_487'>fourteenth day of the first month.</a>
<a id='line_488'></a>
<a id='line_489'>6:20 For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of</a>
<a id='line_490'>them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the</a>
<a id='line_491'>captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.</a>
<a id='line_492'></a>
<a id='line_493'>6:21 And the children of Israel, which were come again out of</a>
<a id='line_494'>captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the</a>
<a id='line_495'>filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_496'>did eat, 6:22 And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with</a>
<a id='line_497'>joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the</a>
<a id='line_498'>king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of</a>
<a id='line_499'>the house of God, the God of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_500'></a>
<a id='line_501'>7:1 Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia,</a>
<a id='line_502'>Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, 7:2</a>
<a id='line_503'>The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, 7:3 The son</a>
<a id='line_504'>of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, 7:4 The son of</a>
<a id='line_505'>Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, 7:5 The son of Abishua,</a>
<a id='line_506'>the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief</a>
<a id='line_507'>priest: 7:6 This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe</a>
<a id='line_508'>in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the</a>
<a id='line_509'>king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_510'>his God upon him.</a>
<a id='line_511'></a>
<a id='line_512'>7:7 And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the</a>
<a id='line_513'>priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the</a>
<a id='line_514'>Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.</a>
<a id='line_515'></a>
<a id='line_516'>7:8 And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the</a>
<a id='line_517'>seventh year of the king.</a>
<a id='line_518'></a>
<a id='line_519'>7:9 For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from</a>
<a id='line_520'>Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_521'>according to the good hand of his God upon him.</a>
<a id='line_522'></a>
<a id='line_523'>7:10 For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_524'>to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.</a>
<a id='line_525'></a>
<a id='line_526'>7:11 Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave</a>
<a id='line_527'>unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the</a>
<a id='line_528'>commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel.</a>
<a id='line_529'></a>
<a id='line_530'>7:12 Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the</a>
<a id='line_531'>law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time.</a>
<a id='line_532'></a>
<a id='line_533'>7:13 I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of</a>
<a id='line_534'>his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own</a>
<a id='line_535'>freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.</a>
<a id='line_536'></a>
<a id='line_537'>7:14 Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven</a>
<a id='line_538'>counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to</a>
<a id='line_539'>the law of thy God which is in thine hand; 7:15 And to carry the</a>
<a id='line_540'>silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely</a>
<a id='line_541'>offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem, 7:16</a>
<a id='line_542'>And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province</a>
<a id='line_543'>of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the</a>
<a id='line_544'>priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in</a>
<a id='line_545'>Jerusalem: 7:17 That thou mayest buy speedily with this money</a>
<a id='line_546'>bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink</a>
<a id='line_547'>offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God</a>
<a id='line_548'>which is in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_549'></a>
<a id='line_550'>7:18 And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to</a>
<a id='line_551'>do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of</a>
<a id='line_552'>your God.</a>
<a id='line_553'></a>
<a id='line_554'>7:19 The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house</a>
<a id='line_555'>of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_556'></a>
<a id='line_557'>7:20 And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God,</a>
<a id='line_558'>which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the kingâ€™s</a>
<a id='line_559'>treasure house.</a>
<a id='line_560'></a>
<a id='line_561'>7:21 And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the</a>
<a id='line_562'>treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the</a>
<a id='line_563'>priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of</a>
<a id='line_564'>you, it be done speedily, 7:22 Unto an hundred talents of silver, and</a>
<a id='line_565'>to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and</a>
<a id='line_566'>to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.</a>
<a id='line_567'></a>
<a id='line_568'>7:23 Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be</a>
<a id='line_569'>diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should</a>
<a id='line_570'>there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?  7:24 Also</a>
<a id='line_571'>we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers,</a>
<a id='line_572'>porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be</a>
<a id='line_573'>lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them.</a>
<a id='line_574'></a>
<a id='line_575'>7:25 And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine</a>
<a id='line_576'>hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that</a>
<a id='line_577'>are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach</a>
<a id='line_578'>ye them that know them not.</a>
<a id='line_579'></a>
<a id='line_580'>7:26 And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the</a>
<a id='line_581'>king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto</a>
<a id='line_582'>death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to</a>
<a id='line_583'>imprisonment.</a>
<a id='line_584'></a>
<a id='line_585'>7:27 Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a</a>
<a id='line_586'>thing as this in the kingâ€™s heart, to beautify the house of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_587'>which is in Jerusalem: 7:28 And hath extended mercy unto me before the</a>
<a id='line_588'>king, and his counsellors, and before all the kingâ€™s mighty princes.</a>
<a id='line_589'>And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and</a>

<a id='line_620'>8:10 And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him</a>
<a id='line_621'>an hundred and threescore males.</a>
<a id='line_622'></a>
<a id='line_623'>8:11 And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with</a>
<a id='line_624'>him twenty and eight males.</a>
<a id='line_625'></a>
<a id='line_626'>8:12 And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with</a>
<a id='line_627'>him an hundred and ten males.</a>
<a id='line_628'></a>
<a id='line_629'>8:13 And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these,</a>
<a id='line_630'>Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males.</a>
<a id='line_631'></a>
<a id='line_632'>8:14 Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them</a>
<a id='line_633'>seventy males.</a>
<a id='line_634'></a>
<a id='line_635'>8:15 And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava;</a>
<a id='line_636'>and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and</a>
<a id='line_637'>the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.</a>
<a id='line_638'></a>
<a id='line_639'>8:16 Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for</a>
<a id='line_640'>Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for</a>
<a id='line_641'>Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for</a>
<a id='line_642'>Elnathan, men of understanding.</a>
<a id='line_643'></a>
<a id='line_644'>8:17 And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place</a>
<a id='line_645'>Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his</a>
<a id='line_646'>brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring</a>
<a id='line_647'>unto us ministers for the house of our God.</a>
<a id='line_648'></a>
<a id='line_649'>8:18 And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of</a>
<a id='line_650'>understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of</a>
<a id='line_651'>Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen; 8:19</a>
<a id='line_652'>And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his</a>
<a id='line_653'>brethren and their sons, twenty; 8:20 Also of the Nethinims, whom</a>
<a id='line_654'>David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites,</a>
<a id='line_655'>two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.</a>
<a id='line_656'></a>
<a id='line_657'>8:21 Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we</a>
<a id='line_658'>might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for</a>
<a id='line_659'>us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.</a>
<a id='line_660'></a>
<a id='line_661'>8:22 For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and</a>
<a id='line_662'>horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had</a>
<a id='line_663'>spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for</a>
<a id='line_664'>good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them</a>
<a id='line_665'>that forsake him.</a>
<a id='line_666'></a>
<a id='line_667'>8:23 So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated</a>
<a id='line_668'>of us.</a>
<a id='line_669'></a>
<a id='line_670'>8:24 Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah,</a>
<a id='line_671'>Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, 8:25 And weighed unto</a>
<a id='line_672'>them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of</a>
<a id='line_673'>the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his</a>
<a id='line_674'>lords, and all Israel there present, had offered: 8:26 I even weighed</a>
<a id='line_675'>unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver</a>
<a id='line_676'>vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents; 8:27 Also</a>
<a id='line_677'>twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine</a>
<a id='line_678'>copper, precious as gold.</a>
<a id='line_679'></a>
<a id='line_680'>8:28 And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are</a>
<a id='line_681'>holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto</a>
<a id='line_682'>the LORD God of your fathers.</a>
<a id='line_683'></a>
<a id='line_684'>8:29 Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of</a>
<a id='line_685'>the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at</a>
<a id='line_686'>Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_687'></a>
<a id='line_688'>8:30 So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and</a>
<a id='line_689'>the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house</a>
<a id='line_690'>of our God.</a>
<a id='line_691'></a>
<a id='line_692'>8:31 Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of</a>
<a id='line_693'>the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was</a>
<a id='line_694'>upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such</a>
<a id='line_695'>as lay in wait by the way.</a>
<a id='line_696'></a>
<a id='line_697'>8:32 And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.</a>
<a id='line_698'></a>
<a id='line_699'>8:33 Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels</a>
<a id='line_700'>weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of</a>
<a id='line_701'>Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and</a>
<a id='line_702'>with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of</a>
<a id='line_703'>Binnui, Levites; 8:34 By number and by weight of every one: and all</a>
<a id='line_704'>the weight was written at that time.</a>
<a id='line_705'></a>
<a id='line_706'>8:35 Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were</a>
<a id='line_707'>come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of</a>
<a id='line_708'>Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy</a>
<a id='line_709'>and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a</a>
<a id='line_710'>burnt offering unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_711'></a>
<a id='line_712'>8:36 And they delivered the kingâ€™s commissions unto the kingâ€™s</a>
<a id='line_713'>lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they</a>
<a id='line_714'>furthered the people, and the house of God.</a>
<a id='line_715'></a>
<a id='line_716'>9:1 Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying,</a>
<a id='line_717'>The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not</a>
<a id='line_718'>separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to</a>
<a id='line_719'>their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the</a>
<a id='line_720'>Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians,</a>
<a id='line_721'>and the Amorites.</a>
<a id='line_722'></a>
<a id='line_723'>9:2 For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for</a>
<a id='line_724'>their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the</a>
<a id='line_725'>people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath</a>
<a id='line_726'>been chief in this trespass.</a>
<a id='line_727'></a>
<a id='line_728'>9:3 And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and</a>
<a id='line_729'>plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down</a>
<a id='line_730'>astonied.</a>
<a id='line_731'></a>
<a id='line_732'>9:4 Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words</a>
<a id='line_733'>of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had</a>
<a id='line_734'>been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.</a>
<a id='line_735'></a>
<a id='line_736'>9:5 And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and</a>
<a id='line_737'>having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread</a>
<a id='line_738'>out my hands unto the LORD my God, 9:6 And said, O my God, I am</a>
<a id='line_739'>ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our</a>
<a id='line_740'>iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up</a>
<a id='line_741'>unto the heavens.</a>
<a id='line_742'></a>
<a id='line_743'>9:7 Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass</a>
<a id='line_744'>unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our</a>
<a id='line_745'>priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to</a>
<a id='line_746'>the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as</a>
<a id='line_747'>it is this day.</a>
<a id='line_748'></a>
<a id='line_749'>9:8 And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD</a>
<a id='line_750'>our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his</a>
<a id='line_751'>holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little</a>
<a id='line_752'>reviving in our bondage.</a>
<a id='line_753'></a>
<a id='line_754'>9:9 For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our</a>
<a id='line_755'>bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of</a>
<a id='line_756'>Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to</a>
<a id='line_757'>repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in</a>
<a id='line_758'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_759'></a>
<a id='line_760'>9:10 And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have</a>
<a id='line_761'>forsaken thy commandments, 9:11 Which thou hast commanded by thy</a>
<a id='line_762'>servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess</a>
<a id='line_763'>it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands,</a>
<a id='line_764'>with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another</a>
<a id='line_765'>with their uncleanness.</a>
<a id='line_766'></a>
<a id='line_767'>9:12 Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither</a>
<a id='line_768'>take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their</a>
<a id='line_769'>wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land,</a>
<a id='line_770'>and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.</a>
<a id='line_771'></a>
<a id='line_772'>9:13 And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for</a>
<a id='line_773'>our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less</a>
<a id='line_774'>than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as</a>
<a id='line_775'>this; 9:14 Should we again break thy commandments, and join in</a>
<a id='line_776'>affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be</a>
<a id='line_777'>angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no</a>
<a id='line_778'>remnant nor escaping?  9:15 O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous:</a>
<a id='line_779'>for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before</a>
<a id='line_780'>thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of</a>
<a id='line_781'>this.</a>
<a id='line_782'></a>
<a id='line_783'>10:1 Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and</a>
<a id='line_784'>casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him</a>
<a id='line_785'>out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children:</a>
<a id='line_786'>for the people wept very sore.</a>
<a id='line_787'></a>
<a id='line_788'>10:2 And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam,</a>
<a id='line_789'>answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and</a>
<a id='line_790'>have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is</a>
<a id='line_791'>hope in Israel concerning this thing.</a>
<a id='line_792'></a>
<a id='line_793'>10:3 Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all</a>
<a id='line_794'>the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of</a>
<a id='line_795'>my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and</a>
<a id='line_796'>let it be done according to the law.</a>
<a id='line_797'></a>
<a id='line_798'>10:4 Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with</a>
<a id='line_799'>thee: be of good courage, and do it.</a>
<a id='line_800'></a>
<a id='line_801'>10:5 Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all</a>
<a id='line_802'>Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they</a>
<a id='line_803'>sware.</a>
<a id='line_804'></a>
<a id='line_805'>10:6 Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the</a>
<a id='line_806'>chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he</a>
<a id='line_807'>did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the</a>
<a id='line_808'>transgression of them that had been carried away.</a>
<a id='line_809'></a>
<a id='line_810'>10:7 And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto</a>
<a id='line_811'>all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves</a>
<a id='line_812'>together unto Jerusalem; 10:8 And that whosoever would not come within</a>
<a id='line_813'>three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders,</a>
<a id='line_814'>all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the</a>
<a id='line_815'>congregation of those that had been carried away.</a>
<a id='line_816'></a>
<a id='line_817'>10:9 Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves</a>
<a id='line_818'>together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on</a>
<a id='line_819'>the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street</a>
<a id='line_820'>of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the</a>
<a id='line_821'>great rain.</a>
<a id='line_822'></a>
<a id='line_823'>10:10 And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have</a>
<a id='line_824'>transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass</a>
<a id='line_825'>of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_826'></a>
<a id='line_827'>10:11 Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers,</a>
<a id='line_828'>and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the</a>
<a id='line_829'>land, and from the strange wives.</a>
<a id='line_830'></a>
<a id='line_831'>10:12 Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice,</a>
<a id='line_832'>As thou hast said, so must we do.</a>
<a id='line_833'></a>
<a id='line_834'>10:13 But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we</a>
<a id='line_835'>are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or</a>
<a id='line_836'>two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.</a>
<a id='line_837'></a>
<a id='line_838'>10:14 Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all</a>
<a id='line_839'>them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed</a>
<a id='line_840'>times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof,</a>
<a id='line_841'>until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.</a>
<a id='line_842'></a>
<a id='line_843'>10:15 Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah</a>
<a id='line_844'>were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the</a>
<a id='line_845'>Levite helped them.</a>
<a id='line_846'></a>
<a id='line_847'>10:16 And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest,</a>
<a id='line_848'>with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers,</a>
<a id='line_849'>and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the</a>
<a id='line_850'>first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.</a>
<a id='line_851'></a>
<a id='line_852'>10:17 And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange</a>
<a id='line_853'>wives by the first day of the first month.</a>
<a id='line_854'></a>
<a id='line_855'>10:18 And among the sons of the priests there were found that had</a>
<a id='line_856'>taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak,</a>
<a id='line_857'>and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.</a>
<a id='line_858'></a>
<a id='line_859'>10:19 And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives;</a>
<a id='line_860'>and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass.</a>
<a id='line_861'></a>
<a id='line_862'>10:20 And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.</a>
<a id='line_863'></a>
