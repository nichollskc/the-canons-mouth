                    <a id='line_0'>The General Epistle of James</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,</a>
<a id='line_4'>to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</a>
<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'>1:2 My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers</a>
<a id='line_7'>temptations; 1:3 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh</a>
<a id='line_8'>patience.</a>
<a id='line_9'></a>
<a id='line_10'>1:4 But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and</a>
<a id='line_11'>entire, wanting nothing.</a>
<a id='line_12'></a>
<a id='line_13'>1:5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all</a>
<a id='line_14'>men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</a>
<a id='line_15'></a>
<a id='line_16'>1:6 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth</a>
<a id='line_17'>is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</a>
<a id='line_18'></a>
<a id='line_19'>1:7 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the</a>
<a id='line_20'>Lord.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>1:8 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</a>
<a id='line_23'></a>
<a id='line_24'>1:9 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: 1:10</a>
<a id='line_25'>But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the</a>
<a id='line_26'>grass he shall pass away.</a>
<a id='line_27'></a>
<a id='line_28'>1:11 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it</a>
<a id='line_29'>withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of</a>
<a id='line_30'>the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in</a>
<a id='line_31'>his ways.</a>
<a id='line_32'></a>
<a id='line_33'>1:12 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is</a>
<a id='line_34'>tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath</a>
<a id='line_35'>promised to them that love him.</a>
<a id='line_36'></a>
<a id='line_37'>1:13 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God</a>
<a id='line_38'>cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: 1:14 But</a>
<a id='line_39'>every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and</a>
<a id='line_40'>enticed.</a>
<a id='line_41'></a>
<a id='line_42'>1:15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin,</a>
<a id='line_43'>when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</a>
<a id='line_44'></a>
<a id='line_45'>1:16 Do not err, my beloved brethren.</a>
<a id='line_46'></a>
<a id='line_47'>1:17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh</a>
<a id='line_48'>down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither</a>
<a id='line_49'>shadow of turning.</a>
<a id='line_50'></a>
<a id='line_51'>1:18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we</a>
<a id='line_52'>should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</a>
<a id='line_53'></a>
<a id='line_54'>1:19 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear,</a>
<a id='line_55'>slow to speak, slow to wrath: 1:20 For the wrath of man worketh not</a>
<a id='line_56'>the righteousness of God.</a>
<a id='line_57'></a>
<a id='line_58'>1:21 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of</a>
<a id='line_59'>naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is</a>
<a id='line_60'>able to save your souls.</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>1:22 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your</a>
<a id='line_63'>own selves.</a>
<a id='line_64'></a>
<a id='line_65'>1:23 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like</a>
<a id='line_66'>unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: 1:24 For he</a>
<a id='line_67'>beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what</a>
<a id='line_68'>manner of man he was.</a>
<a id='line_69'></a>
<a id='line_70'>1:25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth</a>
<a id='line_71'>therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this</a>
<a id='line_72'>man shall be blessed in his deed.</a>
<a id='line_73'></a>
<a id='line_74'>1:26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his</a>
<a id='line_75'>tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.</a>
<a id='line_76'></a>
<a id='line_77'>1:27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To</a>
<a id='line_78'>visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep</a>
<a id='line_79'>himself unspotted from the world.</a>
<a id='line_80'></a>
<a id='line_81'>2:1 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord</a>
<a id='line_82'>of glory, with respect of persons.</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>2:2 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in</a>
<a id='line_85'>goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; 2:3</a>
<a id='line_86'>And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto</a>
<a id='line_87'>him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou</a>
<a id='line_88'>there, or sit here under my footstool: 2:4 Are ye not then partial in</a>
<a id='line_89'>yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?  2:5 Hearken, my</a>
<a id='line_90'>beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in</a>
<a id='line_91'>faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that</a>
<a id='line_92'>love him?  2:6 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress</a>
<a id='line_93'>you, and draw you before the judgment seats?  2:7 Do not they</a>
<a id='line_94'>blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?  2:8 If ye</a>
<a id='line_95'>fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy</a>
<a id='line_96'>neighbour as thyself, ye do well: 2:9 But if ye have respect to</a>
<a id='line_97'>persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</a>
<a id='line_98'></a>
<a id='line_99'>2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one</a>
<a id='line_100'>point, he is guilty of all.</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>2:11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill.</a>
<a id='line_103'>Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a</a>
<a id='line_104'>transgressor of the law.</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>2:12 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law</a>
<a id='line_107'>of liberty.</a>
<a id='line_108'></a>
<a id='line_109'>2:13 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no</a>
<a id='line_110'>mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'>2:14 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith,</a>
<a id='line_113'>and have not works? can faith save him?  2:15 If a brother or sister</a>
<a id='line_114'>be naked, and destitute of daily food, 2:16 And one of you say unto</a>
<a id='line_115'>them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye</a>
<a id='line_116'>give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it</a>
<a id='line_117'>profit?  2:17 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being</a>
<a id='line_118'>alone.</a>
<a id='line_119'></a>
<a id='line_120'>2:18 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me</a>
<a id='line_121'>thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my</a>
<a id='line_122'>works.</a>
<a id='line_123'></a>
<a id='line_124'>2:19 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils</a>
<a id='line_125'>also believe, and tremble.</a>
<a id='line_126'></a>
<a id='line_127'>2:20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</a>
<a id='line_128'>2:21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had</a>
<a id='line_129'>offered Isaac his son upon the altar?  2:22 Seest thou how faith</a>
<a id='line_130'>wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?  2:23 And</a>
<a id='line_131'>the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it</a>
<a id='line_132'>was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend</a>
<a id='line_133'>of God.</a>
<a id='line_134'></a>
<a id='line_135'>2:24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by</a>
<a id='line_136'>faith only.</a>
<a id='line_137'></a>
<a id='line_138'>2:25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when</a>
<a id='line_139'>she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</a>
<a id='line_140'>2:26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without</a>
<a id='line_141'>works is dead also.</a>
<a id='line_142'></a>
<a id='line_143'>3:1 My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive</a>
<a id='line_144'>the greater condemnation.</a>
<a id='line_145'></a>
<a id='line_146'>3:2 For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word,</a>
<a id='line_147'>the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</a>
<a id='line_148'></a>
<a id='line_149'>3:3 Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us;</a>
<a id='line_150'>and we turn about their whole body.</a>
<a id='line_151'></a>
<a id='line_152'>3:4 Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are</a>
<a id='line_153'>driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small</a>
<a id='line_154'>helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.</a>
<a id='line_155'></a>
<a id='line_156'>3:5 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.</a>
<a id='line_157'></a>
<a id='line_158'>Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!  3:6 And the tongue</a>
<a id='line_159'>is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members,</a>
<a id='line_160'>that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of</a>
<a id='line_161'>nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</a>
<a id='line_162'></a>
<a id='line_163'>3:7 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of</a>
<a id='line_164'>things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: 3:8 But</a>
<a id='line_165'>the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly</a>
<a id='line_166'>poison.</a>
<a id='line_167'></a>
<a id='line_168'>3:9 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we</a>
<a id='line_169'>men, which are made after the similitude of God.</a>
<a id='line_170'></a>
<a id='line_171'>3:10 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My</a>
<a id='line_172'>brethren, these things ought not so to be.</a>
<a id='line_173'></a>
<a id='line_174'>3:11 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and</a>
<a id='line_175'>bitter?  3:12 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries?</a>
<a id='line_176'>either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and</a>
<a id='line_177'>fresh.</a>
<a id='line_178'></a>
<a id='line_179'>3:13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him</a>
<a id='line_180'>shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</a>
<a id='line_181'></a>
<a id='line_182'>3:14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory</a>
<a id='line_183'>not, and lie not against the truth.</a>
<a id='line_184'></a>
<a id='line_185'>3:15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual,</a>
<a id='line_186'>devilish.</a>
<a id='line_187'></a>
<a id='line_188'>3:16 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every</a>
<a id='line_189'>evil work.</a>
<a id='line_190'></a>
<a id='line_191'>3:17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable,</a>
<a id='line_192'>gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits,</a>
<a id='line_193'>without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</a>
<a id='line_194'></a>
<a id='line_195'>3:18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make</a>
<a id='line_196'>peace.</a>
<a id='line_197'></a>
<a id='line_198'>4:1 From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not</a>
<a id='line_199'>hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?  4:2 Ye lust, and</a>
<a id='line_200'>have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and</a>
<a id='line_201'>war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.</a>
<a id='line_202'></a>
<a id='line_203'>4:3 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume</a>
<a id='line_204'>it upon your lusts.</a>
<a id='line_205'></a>
<a id='line_206'>4:4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of</a>
<a id='line_207'>the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of</a>
<a id='line_208'>the world is the enemy of God.</a>
<a id='line_209'></a>
<a id='line_210'>4:5 Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that</a>
<a id='line_211'>dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?  4:6 But he giveth more grace.</a>
<a id='line_212'>Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the</a>
<a id='line_213'>humble.</a>
<a id='line_214'></a>
<a id='line_215'>4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will</a>
<a id='line_216'>flee from you.</a>
<a id='line_217'></a>
<a id='line_218'>4:8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your</a>
<a id='line_219'>hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</a>
<a id='line_220'></a>
<a id='line_221'>4:9 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to</a>
<a id='line_222'>mourning, and your joy to heaviness.</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>4:10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you</a>
<a id='line_225'>up.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>4:11 Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of</a>
<a id='line_228'>his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and</a>
<a id='line_229'>judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the</a>
<a id='line_230'>law, but a judge.</a>
<a id='line_231'></a>
<a id='line_232'>4:12 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who</a>
<a id='line_233'>art thou that judgest another?  4:13 Go to now, ye that say, To day or</a>
<a id='line_234'>to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and</a>
<a id='line_235'>buy and sell, and get gain: 4:14 Whereas ye know not what shall be on</a>
<a id='line_236'>the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth</a>
<a id='line_237'>for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</a>
<a id='line_238'></a>
<a id='line_239'>4:15 For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do</a>
<a id='line_240'>this, or that.</a>
<a id='line_241'></a>
<a id='line_242'>4:16 But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</a>
<a id='line_243'></a>
<a id='line_244'>4:17 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to</a>
<a id='line_245'>him it is sin.</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'>5:1 Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall</a>
<a id='line_248'>come upon you.</a>
<a id='line_249'></a>
<a id='line_250'>5:2 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.</a>
<a id='line_251'></a>
<a id='line_252'>5:3 Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a</a>
<a id='line_253'>witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have</a>
<a id='line_254'>heaped treasure together for the last days.</a>
<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'>5:4 Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your</a>
<a id='line_257'>fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of</a>
<a id='line_258'>them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of</a>
<a id='line_259'>sabaoth.</a>
<a id='line_260'></a>
<a id='line_261'>5:5 Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have</a>
<a id='line_262'>nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>5:6 Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.</a>
<a id='line_265'></a>
<a id='line_266'>5:7 Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth,</a>
<a id='line_269'>and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter</a>
<a id='line_270'>rain.</a>
<a id='line_271'></a>
<a id='line_272'>5:8 Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the</a>
<a id='line_273'>Lord draweth nigh.</a>
<a id='line_274'></a>
<a id='line_275'>5:9 Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned:</a>
<a id='line_276'>behold, the judge standeth before the door.</a>
<a id='line_277'></a>
<a id='line_278'>5:10 Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of</a>
<a id='line_279'>the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>5:11 Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the</a>
<a id='line_282'>patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is</a>
<a id='line_283'>very pitiful, and of tender mercy.</a>
<a id='line_284'></a>
<a id='line_285'>5:12 But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven,</a>
<a id='line_286'>neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be</a>
<a id='line_287'>yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.</a>
<a id='line_288'></a>
<a id='line_289'>5:13 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him</a>
<a id='line_290'>sing psalms.</a>
<a id='line_291'></a>
<a id='line_292'>5:14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church;</a>
<a id='line_293'>and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the</a>
<a id='line_294'>Lord: 5:15 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord</a>
<a id='line_295'>shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be</a>
<a id='line_296'>forgiven him.</a>
<a id='line_297'></a>
<a id='line_298'>5:16 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another,</a>
<a id='line_299'>that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man</a>
<a id='line_300'>availeth much.</a>
<a id='line_301'></a>
<a id='line_302'>5:17 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed</a>
<a id='line_303'>earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by</a>
<a id='line_304'>the space of three years and six months.</a>
<a id='line_305'></a>
<a id='line_306'>5:18 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth</a>
<a id='line_307'>brought forth her fruit.</a>
<a id='line_308'></a>
<a id='line_309'>5:19 Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert</a>
<a id='line_310'>him; 5:20 Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the</a>
<a id='line_311'>error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a</a>
<a id='line_312'>multitude of sins.</a>
