<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>      After pursuing above six hundred years the fleeting Caesars of</a>
<a id='line_9'>      Constantinople and Germany, I now descend, in the reign of</a>
<a id='line_10'>      Heraclius, on the eastern borders of the Greek monarchy. While</a>
<a id='line_11'>      the state was exhausted by the Persian war, and the church was</a>
<a id='line_12'>      distracted by the Nestorian and Monophysite sects, Mahomet, with</a>
<a id='line_13'>      the sword in one hand and the Koran in the other, erected his</a>
<a id='line_14'>      throne on the ruins of Christianity and of Rome. The genius of</a>
<a id='line_15'>      the Arabian prophet, the manners of his nation, and the spirit of</a>
<a id='line_16'>      his religion, involve the causes of the decline and fall of the</a>
<a id='line_17'>      Eastern empire; and our eyes are curiously intent on one of the</a>
<a id='line_18'>      most memorable revolutions, which have impressed a new and</a>
<a id='line_19'>      lasting character on the nations of the globe. 1</a>
<a id='line_20'></a>
<a id='line_21'>      1 (return) [ As in this and the following chapter I shall display</a>
<a id='line_22'>      much Arabic learning, I must profess my total ignorance of the</a>
<a id='line_23'>      Oriental tongues, and my gratitude to the learned interpreters,</a>
<a id='line_24'>      who have transfused their science into the Latin, French, and</a>
<a id='line_25'>      English languages. Their collections, versions, and histories, I</a>
<a id='line_26'>      shall occasionally notice.]</a>
<a id='line_27'></a>
<a id='line_28'>      In the vacant space between Persia, Syria, Egypt, and Aethiopia,</a>
<a id='line_29'>      the Arabian peninsula 2 may be conceived as a triangle of</a>
<a id='line_30'>      spacious but irregular dimensions. From the northern point of</a>
<a id='line_31'>      Beles 3 on the Euphrates, a line of fifteen hundred miles is</a>
<a id='line_32'>      terminated by the Straits of Bebelmandel and the land of</a>
<a id='line_33'>      frankincense. About half this length may be allowed for the</a>
<a id='line_34'>      middle breadth, from east to west, from Bassora to Suez, from the</a>
<a id='line_35'>      Persian Gulf to the Red Sea. 4 The sides of the triangle are</a>
<a id='line_36'>      gradually enlarged, and the southern basis presents a front of a</a>
<a id='line_37'>      thousand miles to the Indian Ocean. The entire surface of the</a>
<a id='line_38'>      peninsula exceeds in a fourfold proportion that of Germany or</a>
<a id='line_39'>      France; but the far greater part has been justly stigmatized with</a>
<a id='line_40'>      the epithets of the stony and the sandy. Even the wilds of</a>
<a id='line_41'>      Tartary are decked, by the hand of nature, with lofty trees and</a>
<a id='line_42'>      luxuriant herbage; and the lonesome traveller derives a sort of</a>
<a id='line_43'>      comfort and society from the presence of vegetable life. But in</a>
<a id='line_44'>      the dreary waste of Arabia, a boundless level of sand is</a>
<a id='line_45'>      intersected by sharp and naked mountains; and the face of the</a>
<a id='line_46'>      desert, without shade or shelter, is scorched by the direct and</a>
<a id='line_47'>      intense rays of a tropical sun. Instead of refreshing breezes,</a>
<a id='line_48'>      the winds, particularly from the south-west, diffuse a noxious</a>
<a id='line_49'>      and even deadly vapor; the hillocks of sand which they</a>
<a id='line_50'>      alternately raise and scatter, are compared to the billows of the</a>
<a id='line_51'>      ocean, and whole caravans, whole armies, have been lost and</a>
<a id='line_52'>      buried in the whirlwind. The common benefits of water are an</a>
<a id='line_53'>      object of desire and contest; and such is the scarcity of wood,</a>
<a id='line_54'>      that some art is requisite to preserve and propagate the element</a>
<a id='line_55'>      of fire. Arabia is destitute of navigable rivers, which fertilize</a>
<a id='line_56'>      the soil, and convey its produce to the adjacent regions: the</a>
<a id='line_57'>      torrents that fall from the hills are imbibed by the thirsty</a>
<a id='line_58'>      earth: the rare and hardy plants, the tamarind or the acacia,</a>
<a id='line_59'>      that strike their roots into the clefts of the rocks, are</a>
<a id='line_60'>      nourished by the dews of the night: a scanty supply of rain is</a>
<a id='line_61'>      collected in cisterns and aqueducts: the wells and springs are</a>
<a id='line_62'>      the secret treasure of the desert; and the pilgrim of Mecca, 5</a>
<a id='line_63'>      after many a dry and sultry march, is disgusted by the taste of</a>
<a id='line_64'>      the waters which have rolled over a bed of sulphur or salt. Such</a>
<a id='line_65'>      is the general and genuine picture of the climate of Arabia. The</a>
<a id='line_66'>      experience of evil enhances the value of any local or partial</a>
<a id='line_67'>      enjoyments. A shady grove, a green pasture, a stream of fresh</a>
<a id='line_68'>      water, are sufficient to attract a colony of sedentary Arabs to</a>
<a id='line_69'>      the fortunate spots which can afford food and refreshment to</a>
<a id='line_70'>      themselves and their cattle, and which encourage their industry</a>
<a id='line_71'>      in the cultivation of the palmtree and the vine. The high lands</a>
<a id='line_72'>      that border on the Indian Ocean are distinguished by their</a>
<a id='line_73'>      superior plenty of wood and water; the air is more temperate, the</a>
<a id='line_74'>      fruits are more delicious, the animals and the human race more</a>
<a id='line_75'>      numerous: the fertility of the soil invites and rewards the toil</a>
<a id='line_76'>      of the husbandman; and the peculiar gifts of frankincense 6 and</a>
<a id='line_77'>      coffee have attracted in different ages the merchants of the</a>
<a id='line_78'>      world. If it be compared with the rest of the peninsula, this</a>
<a id='line_79'>      sequestered region may truly deserve the appellation of the</a>
<a id='line_80'>      happy; and the splendid coloring of fancy and fiction has been</a>
<a id='line_81'>      suggested by contrast, and countenanced by distance. It was for</a>
<a id='line_82'>      this earthly paradise that Nature had reserved her choicest</a>
<a id='line_83'>      favors and her most curious workmanship: the incompatible</a>
<a id='line_84'>      blessings of luxury and innocence were ascribed to the natives:</a>
<a id='line_85'>      the soil was impregnated with gold 7 and gems, and both the land</a>
<a id='line_86'>      and sea were taught to exhale the odors of aromatic sweets. This</a>
<a id='line_87'>      division of the sandy, the stony, and the happy, so familiar to</a>
<a id='line_88'>      the Greeks and Latins, is unknown to the Arabians themselves; and</a>
<a id='line_89'>      it is singular enough, that a country, whose language and</a>
<a id='line_90'>      inhabitants have ever been the same, should scarcely retain a</a>
<a id='line_91'>      vestige of its ancient geography. The maritime districts of</a>
<a id='line_92'>      Bahrein and Oman are opposite to the realm of Persia. The kingdom</a>
<a id='line_93'>      of Yemen displays the limits, or at least the situation, of</a>
<a id='line_94'>      Arabia Felix: the name of Neged is extended over the inland</a>
<a id='line_95'>      space; and the birth of Mahomet has illustrated the province of</a>
<a id='line_96'>      Hejaz along the coast of the Red Sea. 8</a>

<a id='line_173'></a>
<a id='line_174'>      The measure of population is regulated by the means of</a>

<a id='line_176'>      outnumbered by the subjects of a fertile and industrious</a>
<a id='line_177'>      province. Along the shores of the Persian Gulf, of the ocean, and</a>
<a id='line_178'>      even of the Red Sea, the Icthyophagi, 9 or fish eaters, continued</a>
<a id='line_179'>      to wander in quest of their precarious food. In this primitive</a>
<a id='line_180'>      and abject state, which ill deserves the name of society, the</a>
<a id='line_181'>      human brute, without arts or laws, almost without sense or</a>
<a id='line_182'>      language, is poorly distinguished from the rest of the animal</a>
<a id='line_183'>      creation. Generations and ages might roll away in silent</a>
<a id='line_184'>      oblivion, and the helpless savage was restrained from multiplying</a>
<a id='line_185'>      his race by the wants and pursuits which confined his existence</a>
<a id='line_186'>      to the narrow margin of the seacoast. But in an early period of</a>
<a id='line_187'>      antiquity the great body of the Arabs had emerged from this scene</a>
<a id='line_188'>      of misery; and as the naked wilderness could not maintain a</a>
<a id='line_189'>      people of hunters, they rose at once to the more secure and</a>
<a id='line_190'>      plentiful condition of the pastoral life. The same life is</a>
<a id='line_191'>      uniformly pursued by the roving tribes of the desert; and in the</a>
<a id='line_192'>      portrait of the modern Bedoweens, we may trace the features of</a>
<a id='line_193'>      their ancestors, 10 who, in the age of Moses or Mahomet, dwelt</a>
<a id='line_194'>      under similar tents, and conducted their horses, and camels, and</a>
<a id='line_195'>      sheep, to the same springs and the same pastures. Our toil is</a>
<a id='line_196'>      lessened, and our wealth is increased, by our dominion over the</a>
<a id='line_197'>      useful animals; and the Arabian shepherd had acquired the</a>
<a id='line_198'>      absolute possession of a faithful friend and a laborious slave.</a>
<a id='line_199'>      11 Arabia, in the opinion of the naturalist, is the genuine and</a>
<a id='line_200'>      original country of the horse; the climate most propitious, not</a>
<a id='line_201'>      indeed to the size, but to the spirit and swiftness, of that</a>
<a id='line_202'>      generous animal. The merit of the Barb, the Spanish, and the</a>
<a id='line_203'>      English breed, is derived from a mixture of Arabian blood: 12 the</a>
<a id='line_204'>      Bedoweens preserve, with superstitious care, the honors and the</a>
<a id='line_205'>      memory of the purest race: the males are sold at a high price,</a>
<a id='line_206'>      but the females are seldom alienated; and the birth of a noble</a>
<a id='line_207'>      foal was esteemed among the tribes, as a subject of joy and</a>
<a id='line_208'>      mutual congratulation. These horses are educated in the tents,</a>
<a id='line_209'>      among the children of the Arabs, with a tender familiarity, which</a>
<a id='line_210'>      trains them in the habits of gentleness and attachment. They are</a>
<a id='line_211'>      accustomed only to walk and to gallop: their sensations are not</a>
<a id='line_212'>      blunted by the incessant abuse of the spur and the whip: their</a>
<a id='line_213'>      powers are reserved for the moments of flight and pursuit: but no</a>
<a id='line_214'>      sooner do they feel the touch of the hand or the stirrup, than</a>
<a id='line_215'>      they dart away with the swiftness of the wind; and if their</a>
<a id='line_216'>      friend be dismounted in the rapid career, they instantly stop</a>
<a id='line_217'>      till he has recovered his seat. In the sands of Africa and</a>
<a id='line_218'>      Arabia, the camel is a sacred and precious gift. That strong and</a>
<a id='line_219'>      patient beast of burden can perform, without eating or drinking,</a>
<a id='line_220'>      a journey of several days; and a reservoir of fresh water is</a>
<a id='line_221'>      preserved in a large bag, a fifth stomach of the animal, whose</a>
<a id='line_222'>      body is imprinted with the marks of servitude: the larger breed</a>
<a id='line_223'>      is capable of transporting a weight of a thousand pounds; and the</a>
<a id='line_224'>      dromedary, of a lighter and more active frame, outstrips the</a>
<a id='line_225'>      fleetest courser in the race. Alive or dead, almost every part of</a>
<a id='line_226'>      the camel is serviceable to man: her milk is plentiful and</a>
<a id='line_227'>      nutritious: the young and tender flesh has the taste of veal: 13</a>
<a id='line_228'>      a valuable salt is extracted from the urine: the dung supplies</a>
<a id='line_229'>      the deficiency of fuel; and the long hair, which falls each year</a>
<a id='line_230'>      and is renewed, is coarsely manufactured into the garments, the</a>
<a id='line_231'>      furniture, and the tents of the Bedoweens. In the rainy seasons,</a>
<a id='line_232'>      they consume the rare and insufficient herbage of the desert:</a>
<a id='line_233'>      during the heats of summer and the scarcity of winter, they</a>
<a id='line_234'>      remove their encampments to the sea-coast, the hills of Yemen, or</a>
<a id='line_235'>      the neighborhood of the Euphrates, and have often extorted the</a>
<a id='line_236'>      dangerous license of visiting the banks of the Nile, and the</a>
<a id='line_237'>      villages of Syria and Palestine. The life of a wandering Arab is</a>
<a id='line_238'>      a life of danger and distress; and though sometimes, by rapine or</a>
<a id='line_239'>      exchange, he may appropriate the fruits of industry, a private</a>
<a id='line_240'>      citizen in Europe is in the possession of more solid and pleasing</a>
<a id='line_241'>      luxury than the proudest emir, who marches in the field at the</a>

<a id='line_289'>      populous were situate in the happy Yemen: the towers of Saana, 15</a>
<a id='line_290'>      and the marvellous reservoir of Merab, 16 were constructed by the</a>

<a id='line_299'>      have impelled the founders, in the choice of a most unpromising</a>

<a id='line_411'>      their intrepid valor had been severely felt by their neighbors in</a>
<a id='line_412'>      offensive and defensive war. The patient and active virtues of a</a>

<a id='line_414'>      pastoral life. The care of the sheep and camels is abandoned to</a>
<a id='line_415'>      the women of the tribe; but the martial youth, under the banner</a>
<a id='line_416'>      of the emir, is ever on horseback, and in the field, to practise</a>
<a id='line_417'>      the exercise of the bow, the javelin, and the cimeter. The long</a>

<a id='line_419'>      perpetuity and succeeding generations are animated to prove their</a>
<a id='line_420'>      descent, and to maintain their inheritance. Their domestic feuds</a>
<a id='line_421'>      are suspended on the approach of a common enemy; and in their</a>
<a id='line_422'>      last hostilities against the Turks, the caravan of Mecca was</a>
<a id='line_423'>      attacked and pillaged by fourscore thousand of the confederates.</a>
<a id='line_424'>      When they advance to battle, the hope of victory is in the front;</a>
<a id='line_425'>      in the rear, the assurance of a retreat. Their horses and camels,</a>
<a id='line_426'>      who, in eight or ten days, can perform a march of four or five</a>

<a id='line_430'>      invisible foe, who scorns his efforts, and safely reposes in the</a>
<a id='line_431'>      heart of the burning solitude. The arms and deserts of the</a>
<a id='line_432'>      Bedoweens are not only the safeguards of their own freedom, but</a>

<a id='line_553'>      prerogatives of nature. In every tribe, superstition, or</a>
<a id='line_554'>      gratitude, or fortune, has exalted a particular family above the</a>
<a id='line_555'>      heads of their equals. The dignities of sheick and emir</a>
<a id='line_556'>      invariably descend in this chosen race; but the order of</a>
<a id='line_557'>      succession is loose and precarious; and the most worthy or aged</a>
<a id='line_558'>      of the noble kinsmen are preferred to the simple, though</a>
<a id='line_559'>      important, office of composing disputes by their advice, and</a>
<a id='line_560'>      guiding valor by their example. Even a female of sense and spirit</a>
<a id='line_561'>      has been permitted to command the countrymen of Zenobia. 31 The</a>
<a id='line_562'>      momentary junction of several tribes produces an army: their more</a>
<a id='line_563'>      lasting union constitutes a nation; and the supreme chief, the</a>
<a id='line_564'>      emir of emirs, whose banner is displayed at their head, may</a>
<a id='line_565'>      deserve, in the eyes of strangers, the honors of the kingly name.</a>

<a id='line_567'>      If the Arabian princes abuse their power, they are quickly</a>
<a id='line_568'>      punished by the desertion of their subjects, who had been</a>
<a id='line_569'>      accustomed to a mild and parental jurisdiction. Their spirit is</a>
<a id='line_570'>      free, their steps are unconfined, the desert is open, and the</a>
<a id='line_571'>      tribes and families are held together by a mutual and voluntary</a>
<a id='line_572'>      compact. The softer natives of Yemen supported the pomp and</a>
<a id='line_573'>      majesty of a monarch; but if he could not leave his palace</a>
<a id='line_574'>      without endangering his life, 32 the active powers of government</a>
<a id='line_575'>      must have been devolved on his nobles and magistrates. The cities</a>
<a id='line_576'>      of Mecca and Medina present, in the heart of Asia, the form, or</a>
<a id='line_577'>      rather the substance, of a commonwealth. The grandfather of</a>
<a id='line_578'>      Mahomet, and his lineal ancestors, appear in foreign and domestic</a>
<a id='line_579'>      transactions as the princes of their country; but they reigned,</a>
<a id='line_580'>      like Pericles at Athens, or the Medici at Florence, by the</a>
<a id='line_581'>      opinion of their wisdom and integrity; their influence was</a>
<a id='line_582'>      divided with their patrimony; and the sceptre was transferred</a>
<a id='line_583'>      from the uncles of the prophet to a younger branch of the tribe</a>
<a id='line_584'>      of Koreish. On solemn occasions they convened the assembly of the</a>
<a id='line_585'>      people; and, since mankind must be either compelled or persuaded</a>
<a id='line_586'>      to obey, the use and reputation of oratory among the ancient</a>
<a id='line_587'>      Arabs is the clearest evidence of public freedom. 33 But their</a>
<a id='line_588'>      simple freedom was of a very different cast from the nice and</a>
<a id='line_589'>      artificial machinery of the Greek and Roman republics, in which</a>
<a id='line_590'>      each member possessed an undivided share of the civil and</a>
<a id='line_591'>      political rights of the community. In the more simple state of</a>
<a id='line_592'>      the Arabs, the nation is free, because each of her sons disdains</a>
<a id='line_593'>      a base submission to the will of a master. His breast is</a>
<a id='line_594'>      fortified by the austere virtues of courage, patience, and</a>
<a id='line_595'>      sobriety; the love of independence prompts him to exercise the</a>
<a id='line_596'>      habits of self-command; and the fear of dishonor guards him from</a>
<a id='line_597'>      the meaner apprehension of pain, of danger, and of death. The</a>
<a id='line_598'>      gravity and firmness of the mind is conspicuous in his outward</a>
<a id='line_599'>      demeanor; his speech is low, weighty, and concise; he is seldom</a>
<a id='line_600'>      provoked to laughter; his only gesture is that of stroking his</a>
<a id='line_601'>      beard, the venerable symbol of manhood; and the sense of his own</a>
<a id='line_602'>      importance teaches him to accost his equals without levity, and</a>
<a id='line_603'>      his superiors without awe. 34 The liberty of the Saracens</a>
<a id='line_604'>      survived their conquests: the first caliphs indulged the bold and</a>
<a id='line_605'>      familiar language of their subjects; they ascended the pulpit to</a>
<a id='line_606'>      persuade and edify the congregation; nor was it before the seat</a>
<a id='line_607'>      of empire was removed to the Tigris, that the Abbasides adopted</a>

<a id='line_639'>      character. The separation of the Arabs from the rest of mankind</a>
<a id='line_640'>      has accustomed them to confound the ideas of stranger and enemy;</a>
<a id='line_641'>      and the poverty of the land has introduced a maxim of</a>
<a id='line_642'>      jurisprudence, which they believe and practise to the present</a>
<a id='line_643'>      hour. They pretend, that, in the division of the earth, the rich</a>
<a id='line_644'>      and fertile climates were assigned to the other branches of the</a>
<a id='line_645'>      human family; and that the posterity of the outlaw Ismael might</a>
<a id='line_646'>      recover, by fraud or force, the portion of inheritance of which</a>
<a id='line_647'>      he had been unjustly deprived. According to the remark of Pliny,</a>
<a id='line_648'>      the Arabian tribes are equally addicted to theft and merchandise;</a>
<a id='line_649'>      the caravans that traverse the desert are ransomed or pillaged;</a>
<a id='line_650'>      and their neighbors, since the remote times of Job and Sesostris,</a>
<a id='line_651'>      35 have been the victims of their rapacious spirit. If a Bedoween</a>
<a id='line_652'>      discovers from afar a solitary traveller, he rides furiously</a>
<a id='line_653'>      against him, crying, with a loud voice, “Undress thyself, thy</a>
<a id='line_654'>      aunt (my wife) is without a garment.” A ready submission entitles</a>
<a id='line_655'>      him to mercy; resistance will provoke the aggressor, and his own</a>
<a id='line_656'>      blood must expiate the blood which he presumes to shed in</a>
<a id='line_657'>      legitimate defence. A single robber, or a few associates, are</a>
<a id='line_658'>      branded with their genuine name; but the exploits of a numerous</a>
<a id='line_659'>      band assume the character of lawful and honorable war. The temper</a>
<a id='line_660'>      of a people thus armed against mankind was doubly inflamed by the</a>
<a id='line_661'>      domestic license of rapine, murder, and revenge. In the</a>
<a id='line_662'>      constitution of Europe, the right of peace and war is now</a>
<a id='line_663'>      confined to a small, and the actual exercise to a much smaller,</a>
<a id='line_664'>      list of respectable potentates; but each Arab, with impunity and</a>
<a id='line_665'>      renown, might point his javelin against the life of his</a>
<a id='line_666'>      countrymen. The union of the nation consisted only in a vague</a>
<a id='line_667'>      resemblance of language and manners; and in each community, the</a>
<a id='line_668'>      jurisdiction of the magistrate was mute and impotent. Of the time</a>
<a id='line_669'>      of ignorance which preceded Mahomet, seventeen hundred battles 36</a>
<a id='line_670'>      are recorded by tradition: hostility was imbittered with the</a>
<a id='line_671'>      rancor of civil faction; and the recital, in prose or verse, of</a>
<a id='line_672'>      an obsolete feud, was sufficient to rekindle the same passions</a>
<a id='line_673'>      among the descendants of the hostile tribes. In private life</a>
<a id='line_674'>      every man, at least every family, was the judge and avenger of</a>
<a id='line_675'>      his own cause. The nice sensibility of honor, which weighs the</a>
<a id='line_676'>      insult rather than the injury, sheds its deadly venom on the</a>
<a id='line_677'>      quarrels of the Arabs: the honor of their women, and of their</a>
<a id='line_678'>      beards, is most easily wounded; an indecent action, a</a>
<a id='line_679'>      contemptuous word, can be expiated only by the blood of the</a>
<a id='line_680'>      offender; and such is their patient inveteracy, that they expect</a>
<a id='line_681'>      whole months and years the opportunity of revenge. A fine or</a>
<a id='line_682'>      compensation for murder is familiar to the Barbarians of every</a>
<a id='line_683'>      age: but in Arabia the kinsmen of the dead are at liberty to</a>
<a id='line_684'>      accept the atonement, or to exercise with their own hands the law</a>
<a id='line_685'>      of retaliation. The refined malice of the Arabs refuses even the</a>
<a id='line_686'>      head of the murderer, substitutes an innocent for the guilty</a>
<a id='line_687'>      person, and transfers the penalty to the best and most</a>
<a id='line_688'>      considerable of the race by whom they have been injured. If he</a>
<a id='line_689'>      falls by their hands, they are exposed, in their turn, to the</a>
<a id='line_690'>      danger of reprisals, the interest and principal of the bloody</a>
<a id='line_691'>      debt are accumulated: the individuals of either family lead a</a>
<a id='line_692'>      life of malice and suspicion, and fifty years may sometimes</a>
<a id='line_693'>      elapse before the account of vengeance be finally settled. 37</a>
<a id='line_694'>      This sanguinary spirit, ignorant of pity or forgiveness, has been</a>
<a id='line_695'>      moderated, however, by the maxims of honor, which require in</a>
<a id='line_696'>      every private encounter some decent equality of age and strength,</a>
<a id='line_697'>      of numbers and weapons. An annual festival of two, perhaps of</a>
<a id='line_698'>      four, months, was observed by the Arabs before the time of</a>
<a id='line_699'>      Mahomet, during which their swords were religiously sheathed both</a>
<a id='line_700'>      in foreign and domestic hostility; and this partial truce is more</a>

<a id='line_735'>      the merchant is the friend of mankind; and the annual caravans</a>
<a id='line_736'>      imported the first seeds of knowledge and politeness into the</a>
<a id='line_737'>      cities, and even the camps of the desert. Whatever may be the</a>
<a id='line_738'>      pedigree of the Arabs, their language is derived from the same</a>
<a id='line_739'>      original stock with the Hebrew, the Syriac, and the Chaldaean</a>
<a id='line_740'>      tongues; the independence of the tribes was marked by their</a>
<a id='line_741'>      peculiar dialects; 39 but each, after their own, allowed a just</a>
<a id='line_742'>      preference to the pure and perspicuous idiom of Mecca. In Arabia,</a>
<a id='line_743'>      as well as in Greece, the perfection of language outstripped the</a>
<a id='line_744'>      refinement of manners; and her speech could diversify the</a>
<a id='line_745'>      fourscore names of honey, the two hundred of a serpent, the five</a>
<a id='line_746'>      hundred of a lion, the thousand of a sword, at a time when this</a>
<a id='line_747'>      copious dictionary was intrusted to the memory of an illiterate</a>
<a id='line_748'>      people. The monuments of the Homerites were inscribed with an</a>
<a id='line_749'>      obsolete and mysterious character; but the Cufic letters, the</a>
<a id='line_750'>      groundwork of the present alphabet, were invented on the banks of</a>
<a id='line_751'>      the Euphrates; and the recent invention was taught at Mecca by a</a>
<a id='line_752'>      stranger who settled in that city after the birth of Mahomet. The</a>
<a id='line_753'>      arts of grammar, of metre, and of rhetoric, were unknown to the</a>
<a id='line_754'>      freeborn eloquence of the Arabians; but their penetration was</a>
<a id='line_755'>      sharp, their fancy luxuriant, their wit strong and sententious,</a>
<a id='line_756'>      40 and their more elaborate compositions were addressed with</a>
<a id='line_757'>      energy and effect to the minds of their hearers. The genius and</a>
<a id='line_758'>      merit of a rising poet was celebrated by the applause of his own</a>
<a id='line_759'>      and the kindred tribes. A solemn banquet was prepared, and a</a>
<a id='line_760'>      chorus of women, striking their tymbals, and displaying the pomp</a>
<a id='line_761'>      of their nuptials, sung in the presence of their sons and</a>
<a id='line_762'>      husbands the felicity of their native tribe; that a champion had</a>
<a id='line_763'>      now appeared to vindicate their rights; that a herald had raised</a>
<a id='line_764'>      his voice to immortalize their renown. The distant or hostile</a>
<a id='line_765'>      tribes resorted to an annual fair, which was abolished by the</a>
<a id='line_766'>      fanaticism of the first Moslems; a national assembly that must</a>
<a id='line_767'>      have contributed to refine and harmonize the Barbarians. Thirty</a>
<a id='line_768'>      days were employed in the exchange, not only of corn and wine,</a>
<a id='line_769'>      but of eloquence and poetry. The prize was disputed by the</a>
<a id='line_770'>      generous emulation of the bards; the victorious performance was</a>
<a id='line_771'>      deposited in the archives of princes and emirs; and we may read</a>
<a id='line_772'>      in our own language, the seven original poems which were</a>
<a id='line_773'>      inscribed in letters of gold, and suspended in the temple of</a>
<a id='line_774'>      Mecca. 41 The Arabian poets were the historians and moralists of</a>
<a id='line_775'>      the age; and if they sympathized with the prejudices, they</a>
<a id='line_776'>      inspired and crowned the virtues, of their countrymen. The</a>
<a id='line_777'>      indissoluble union of generosity and valor was the darling theme</a>
<a id='line_778'>      of their song; and when they pointed their keenest satire against</a>
<a id='line_779'>      a despicable race, they affirmed, in the bitterness of reproach,</a>
<a id='line_780'>      that the men knew not how to give, nor the women to deny. 42 The</a>
<a id='line_781'>      same hospitality, which was practised by Abraham, and celebrated</a>
<a id='line_782'>      by Homer, is still renewed in the camps of the Arabs. The</a>
<a id='line_783'>      ferocious Bedoweens, the terror of the desert, embrace, without</a>
<a id='line_784'>      inquiry or hesitation, the stranger who dares to confide in their</a>
<a id='line_785'>      honor and to enter their tent. His treatment is kind and</a>
<a id='line_786'>      respectful: he shares the wealth, or the poverty, of his host;</a>
<a id='line_787'>      and, after a needful repose, he is dismissed on his way, with</a>
<a id='line_788'>      thanks, with blessings, and perhaps with gifts. The heart and</a>
<a id='line_789'>      hand are more largely expanded by the wants of a brother or a</a>
<a id='line_790'>      friend; but the heroic acts that could deserve the public</a>
<a id='line_791'>      applause, must have surpassed the narrow measure of discretion</a>
<a id='line_792'>      and experience. A dispute had arisen, who, among the citizens of</a>
<a id='line_793'>      Mecca, was entitled to the prize of generosity; and a successive</a>
<a id='line_794'>      application was made to the three who were deemed most worthy of</a>
<a id='line_795'>      the trial. Abdallah, the son of Abbas, had undertaken a distant</a>
<a id='line_796'>      journey, and his foot was in the stirrup when he heard the voice</a>
<a id='line_797'>      of a suppliant, “O son of the uncle of the apostle of God, I am a</a>
<a id='line_798'>      traveller, and in distress!” He instantly dismounted to present</a>
<a id='line_799'>      the pilgrim with his camel, her rich caparison, and a purse of</a>
<a id='line_800'>      four thousand pieces of gold, excepting only the sword, either</a>
<a id='line_801'>      for its intrinsic value, or as the gift of an honored kinsman.</a>
<a id='line_802'>      The servant of Kais informed the second suppliant that his master</a>
<a id='line_803'>      was asleep: but he immediately added, “Here is a purse of seven</a>
<a id='line_804'>      thousand pieces of gold, (it is all we have in the house,) and</a>
<a id='line_805'>      here is an order, that will entitle you to a camel and a slave;”</a>
<a id='line_806'>      the master, as soon as he awoke, praised and enfranchised his</a>
<a id='line_807'>      faithful steward, with a gentle reproof, that by respecting his</a>
<a id='line_808'>      slumbers he had stinted his bounty. The third of these heroes,</a>
<a id='line_809'>      the blind Arabah, at the hour of prayer, was supporting his steps</a>
<a id='line_810'>      on the shoulders of two slaves. “Alas!” he replied, “my coffers</a>
<a id='line_811'>      are empty! but these you may sell; if you refuse, I renounce</a>
<a id='line_812'>      them.” At these words, pushing away the youths, he groped along</a>

<a id='line_859'>      The religion of the Arabs, 44 as well as of the Indians,</a>
<a id='line_860'>      consisted in the worship of the sun, the moon, and the fixed</a>
<a id='line_861'>      stars; a primitive and specious mode of superstition. The bright</a>
<a id='line_862'>      luminaries of the sky display the visible image of a Deity: their</a>
<a id='line_863'>      number and distance convey to a philosophic, or even a vulgar,</a>
<a id='line_864'>      eye, the idea of boundless space: the character of eternity is</a>
<a id='line_865'>      marked on these solid globes, that seem incapable of corruption</a>
<a id='line_866'>      or decay: the regularity of their motions may be ascribed to a</a>
<a id='line_867'>      principle of reason or instinct; and their real, or imaginary,</a>
<a id='line_868'>      influence encourages the vain belief that the earth and its</a>
<a id='line_869'>      inhabitants are the object of their peculiar care. The science of</a>
<a id='line_870'>      astronomy was cultivated at Babylon; but the school of the Arabs</a>
<a id='line_871'>      was a clear firmament and a naked plain. In their nocturnal</a>
<a id='line_872'>      marches, they steered by the guidance of the stars: their names,</a>
<a id='line_873'>      and order, and daily station, were familiar to the curiosity and</a>
<a id='line_874'>      devotion of the Bedoween; and he was taught by experience to</a>
<a id='line_875'>      divide, in twenty-eight parts, the zodiac of the moon, and to</a>
<a id='line_876'>      bless the constellations who refreshed, with salutary rains, the</a>
<a id='line_877'>      thirst of the desert. The reign of the heavenly orbs could not be</a>
<a id='line_878'>      extended beyond the visible sphere; and some metaphysical powers</a>
<a id='line_879'>      were necessary to sustain the transmigration of souls and the</a>
<a id='line_880'>      resurrection of bodies: a camel was left to perish on the grave,</a>
<a id='line_881'>      that he might serve his master in another life; and the</a>
<a id='line_882'>      invocation of departed spirits implies that they were still</a>
<a id='line_883'>      endowed with consciousness and power. I am ignorant, and I am</a>
<a id='line_884'>      careless, of the blind mythology of the Barbarians; of the local</a>
<a id='line_885'>      deities, of the stars, the air, and the earth, of their sex or</a>
<a id='line_886'>      titles, their attributes or subordination. Each tribe, each</a>
<a id='line_887'>      family, each independent warrior, created and changed the rites</a>
<a id='line_888'>      and the object of his fantastic worship; but the nation, in every</a>
<a id='line_889'>      age, has bowed to the religion, as well as to the language, of</a>
<a id='line_890'>      Mecca. The genuine antiquity of the Caaba ascends beyond the</a>
<a id='line_891'>      Christian aera; in describing the coast of the Red Sea, the Greek</a>
<a id='line_892'>      historian Diodorus 45 has remarked, between the Thamudites and</a>
<a id='line_893'>      the Sabaeans, a famous temple, whose superior sanctity was</a>
<a id='line_894'>      revered by all the Arabians; the linen or silken veil, which is</a>
<a id='line_895'>      annually renewed by the Turkish emperor, was first offered by a</a>
<a id='line_896'>      pious king of the Homerites, who reigned seven hundred years</a>
<a id='line_897'>      before the time of Mahomet. 46 A tent, or a cavern, might suffice</a>
<a id='line_898'>      for the worship of the savages, but an edifice of stone and clay</a>
<a id='line_899'>      has been erected in its place; and the art and power of the</a>
<a id='line_900'>      monarchs of the East have been confined to the simplicity of the</a>
<a id='line_901'>      original model. 47 A spacious portico encloses the quadrangle of</a>
<a id='line_902'>      the Caaba; a square chapel, twenty-four cubits long, twenty-three</a>
<a id='line_903'>      broad, and twenty-seven high: a door and a window admit the</a>
<a id='line_904'>      light; the double roof is supported by three pillars of wood; a</a>
<a id='line_905'>      spout (now of gold) discharges the rain-water, and the well</a>
<a id='line_906'>      Zemzen is protected by a dome from accidental pollution. The</a>
<a id='line_907'>      tribe of Koreish, by fraud and force, had acquired the custody of</a>
<a id='line_908'>      the Caaba: the sacerdotal office devolved through four lineal</a>
<a id='line_909'>      descents to the grandfather of Mahomet; and the family of the</a>
<a id='line_910'>      Hashemites, from whence he sprung, was the most respectable and</a>
<a id='line_911'>      sacred in the eyes of their country. 48 The precincts of Mecca</a>
<a id='line_912'>      enjoyed the rights of sanctuary; and, in the last month of each</a>
<a id='line_913'>      year, the city and the temple were crowded with a long train of</a>
<a id='line_914'>      pilgrims, who presented their vows and offerings in the house of</a>
<a id='line_915'>      God. The same rites which are now accomplished by the faithful</a>
<a id='line_916'>      Mussulman, were invented and practised by the superstition of the</a>
<a id='line_917'>      idolaters. At an awful distance they cast away their garments:</a>
<a id='line_918'>      seven times, with hasty steps, they encircled the Caaba, and</a>
<a id='line_919'>      kissed the black stone: seven times they visited and adored the</a>
<a id='line_920'>      adjacent mountains; seven times they threw stones into the valley</a>
<a id='line_921'>      of Mina; and the pilgrimage was achieved, as at the present hour,</a>
<a id='line_922'>      by a sacrifice of sheep and camels, and the burial of their hair</a>
<a id='line_923'>      and nails in the consecrated ground. Each tribe either found or</a>
<a id='line_924'>      introduced in the Caaba their domestic worship: the temple was</a>
<a id='line_925'>      adorned, or defiled, with three hundred and sixty idols of men,</a>
<a id='line_926'>      eagles, lions, and antelopes; and most conspicuous was the statue</a>
<a id='line_927'>      of Hebal, of red agate, holding in his hand seven arrows, without</a>
<a id='line_928'>      heads or feathers, the instruments and symbols of profane</a>
<a id='line_929'>      divination. But this statue was a monument of Syrian arts: the</a>
<a id='line_930'>      devotion of the ruder ages was content with a pillar or a tablet;</a>
<a id='line_931'>      and the rocks of the desert were hewn into gods or altars, in</a>
<a id='line_932'>      imitation of the black stone 49 of Mecca, which is deeply tainted</a>
<a id='line_933'>      with the reproach of an idolatrous origin. From Japan to Peru,</a>
<a id='line_934'>      the use of sacrifice has universally prevailed; and the votary</a>
<a id='line_935'>      has expressed his gratitude, or fear, by destroying or consuming,</a>
<a id='line_936'>      in honor of the gods, the dearest and most precious of their</a>
<a id='line_937'>      gifts. The life of a man 50 is the most precious oblation to</a>
<a id='line_938'>      deprecate a public calamity: the altars of Phoenicia and Egypt,</a>
<a id='line_939'>      of Rome and Carthage, have been polluted with human gore: the</a>
<a id='line_940'>      cruel practice was long preserved among the Arabs; in the third</a>
<a id='line_941'>      century, a boy was annually sacrificed by the tribe of the</a>
<a id='line_942'>      Dumatians; 51 and a royal captive was piously slaughtered by the</a>
<a id='line_943'>      prince of the Saracens, the ally and soldier of the emperor</a>
<a id='line_944'>      Justinian. 52 A parent who drags his son to the altar, exhibits</a>
<a id='line_945'>      the most painful and sublime effort of fanaticism: the deed, or</a>
<a id='line_946'>      the intention, was sanctified by the example of saints and</a>
<a id='line_947'>      heroes; and the father of Mahomet himself was devoted by a rash</a>
<a id='line_948'>      vow, and hardly ransomed for the equivalent of a hundred camels.</a>
<a id='line_949'>      In the time of ignorance, the Arabs, like the Jews and Egyptians,</a>
<a id='line_950'>      abstained from the taste of swine’s flesh; 53 they circumcised 54</a>
<a id='line_951'>      their children at the age of puberty: the same customs, without</a>

<a id='line_1061'>      Sabianism was diffused over Asia by the science of the Chaldaeans</a>
<a id='line_1062'>      55 and the arms of the Assyrians. From the observations of two</a>
<a id='line_1063'>      thousand years, the priests and astronomers of Babylon 56 deduced</a>
<a id='line_1064'>      the eternal laws of nature and providence. They adored the seven</a>
<a id='line_1065'>      gods or angels, who directed the course of the seven planets, and</a>
<a id='line_1066'>      shed their irresistible influence on the earth. The attributes of</a>
<a id='line_1067'>      the seven planets, with the twelve signs of the zodiac, and the</a>
<a id='line_1068'>      twenty-four constellations of the northern and southern</a>
<a id='line_1069'>      hemisphere, were represented by images and talismans; the seven</a>
<a id='line_1070'>      days of the week were dedicated to their respective deities; the</a>
<a id='line_1071'>      Sabians prayed thrice each day; and the temple of the moon at</a>
<a id='line_1072'>      Haran was the term of their pilgrimage. 57 But the flexible</a>
<a id='line_1073'>      genius of their faith was always ready either to teach or to</a>
<a id='line_1074'>      learn: in the tradition of the creation, the deluge, and the</a>
<a id='line_1075'>      patriarchs, they held a singular agreement with their Jewish</a>
<a id='line_1076'>      captives; they appealed to the secret books of Adam, Seth, and</a>
<a id='line_1077'>      Enoch; and a slight infusion of the gospel has transformed the</a>
<a id='line_1078'>      last remnant of the Polytheists into the Christians of St. John,</a>
<a id='line_1079'>      in the territory of Bassora. 58 The altars of Babylon were</a>
<a id='line_1080'>      overturned by the Magians; but the injuries of the Sabians were</a>
<a id='line_1081'>      revenged by the sword of Alexander; Persia groaned above five</a>
<a id='line_1082'>      hundred years under a foreign yoke; and the purest disciples of</a>
<a id='line_1083'>      Zoroaster escaped from the contagion of idolatry, and breathed</a>
<a id='line_1084'>      with their adversaries the freedom of the desert. 59 Seven</a>
<a id='line_1085'>      hundred years before the death of Mahomet, the Jews were settled</a>
<a id='line_1086'>      in Arabia; and a far greater multitude was expelled from the Holy</a>
<a id='line_1087'>      Land in the wars of Titus and Hadrian. The industrious exiles</a>
<a id='line_1088'>      aspired to liberty and power: they erected synagogues in the</a>
<a id='line_1089'>      cities, and castles in the wilderness, and their Gentile converts</a>
<a id='line_1090'>      were confounded with the children of Israel, whom they resembled</a>
<a id='line_1091'>      in the outward mark of circumcision. The Christian missionaries</a>
<a id='line_1092'>      were still more active and successful: the Catholics asserted</a>
<a id='line_1093'>      their universal reign; the sects whom they oppressed,</a>
<a id='line_1094'>      successively retired beyond the limits of the Roman empire; the</a>
<a id='line_1095'>      Marcionites and Manichaeans dispersed their fantastic opinions</a>
<a id='line_1096'>      and apocryphal gospels; the churches of Yemen, and the princes of</a>
<a id='line_1097'>      Hira and Gassan, were instructed in a purer creed by the Jacobite</a>
<a id='line_1098'>      and Nestorian bishops. 60 The liberty of choice was presented to</a>
<a id='line_1099'>      the tribes: each Arab was free to elect or to compose his private</a>
<a id='line_1100'>      religion: and the rude superstition of his house was mingled with</a>
<a id='line_1101'>      the sublime theology of saints and philosophers. A fundamental</a>
<a id='line_1102'>      article of faith was inculcated by the consent of the learned</a>
<a id='line_1103'>      strangers; the existence of one supreme God who is exalted above</a>
<a id='line_1104'>      the powers of heaven and earth, but who has often revealed</a>
<a id='line_1105'>      himself to mankind by the ministry of his angels and prophets,</a>
<a id='line_1106'>      and whose grace or justice has interrupted, by seasonable</a>

<a id='line_1208'>      of the elephant. 65 The glory of Abdol Motalleb was crowned with</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      domestic happiness; his life was prolonged to the age of one</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      hundred and ten years; and he became the father of six daughters</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      and thirteen sons. His best beloved Abdallah was the most</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      beautiful and modest of the Arabian youth; and in the first</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      night, when he consummated his marriage with Amina, 651 of the</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      noble race of the Zahrites, two hundred virgins are said to have</a>
<a id='line_1215'>      expired of jealousy and despair. Mahomet, or more properly</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      Mohammed, the only son of Abdallah and Amina, was born at Mecca,</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      four years after the death of Justinian, and two months after the</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      defeat of the Abyssinians, 66 whose victory would have introduced</a>
<a id='line_1219'>      into the Caaba the religion of the Christians. In his early</a>
<a id='line_1220'>      infancy, he was deprived of his father, his mother, and his</a>
<a id='line_1221'>      grandfather; his uncles were strong and numerous; and, in the</a>
<a id='line_1222'>      division of the inheritance, the orphan’s share was reduced to</a>
<a id='line_1223'>      five camels and an Aethiopian maid-servant. At home and abroad,</a>
<a id='line_1224'>      in peace and war, Abu Taleb, the most respectable of his uncles,</a>
<a id='line_1225'>      was the guide and guardian of his youth; in his twenty-fifth</a>
<a id='line_1226'>      year, he entered into the service of Cadijah, a rich and noble</a>
<a id='line_1227'>      widow of Mecca, who soon rewarded his fidelity with the gift of</a>
<a id='line_1228'>      her hand and fortune. The marriage contract, in the simple style</a>

<a id='line_1326'>      sensation of the soul, and his gestures that enforced each</a>
<a id='line_1327'>      expression of the tongue. In the familiar offices of life he</a>
<a id='line_1328'>      scrupulously adhered to the grave and ceremonious politeness of</a>
<a id='line_1329'>      his country: his respectful attention to the rich and powerful</a>
<a id='line_1330'>      was dignified by his condescension and affability to the poorest</a>

<a id='line_1332'>      artifice of his views; and the habits of courtesy were imputed to</a>
<a id='line_1333'>      personal friendship or universal benevolence. His memory was</a>
<a id='line_1334'>      capacious and retentive; his wit easy and social; his imagination</a>
<a id='line_1335'>      sublime; his judgment clear, rapid, and decisive. He possessed</a>
<a id='line_1336'>      the courage both of thought and action; and, although his designs</a>
<a id='line_1337'>      might gradually expand with his success, the first idea which he</a>
<a id='line_1338'>      entertained of his divine mission bears the stamp of an original</a>
<a id='line_1339'>      and superior genius. The son of Abdallah was educated in the</a>
<a id='line_1340'>      bosom of the noblest race, in the use of the purest dialect of</a>
<a id='line_1341'>      Arabia; and the fluency of his speech was corrected and enhanced</a>
<a id='line_1342'>      by the practice of discreet and seasonable silence. With these</a>
<a id='line_1343'>      powers of eloquence, Mahomet was an illiterate Barbarian: his</a>
<a id='line_1344'>      youth had never been instructed in the arts of reading and</a>
<a id='line_1345'>      writing; 70 the common ignorance exempted him from shame or</a>
<a id='line_1346'>      reproach, but he was reduced to a narrow circle of existence, and</a>
<a id='line_1347'>      deprived of those faithful mirrors, which reflect to our mind the</a>
<a id='line_1348'>      minds of sages and heroes. Yet the book of nature and of man was</a>
<a id='line_1349'>      open to his view; and some fancy has been indulged in the</a>
<a id='line_1350'>      political and philosophical observations which are ascribed to</a>
<a id='line_1351'>      the Arabian traveller. 71 He compares the nations and the regions</a>
<a id='line_1352'>      of the earth; discovers the weakness of the Persian and Roman</a>
<a id='line_1353'>      monarchies; beholds, with pity and indignation, the degeneracy of</a>
<a id='line_1354'>      the times; and resolves to unite under one God and one king the</a>
<a id='line_1355'>      invincible spirit and primitive virtues of the Arabs. Our more</a>
<a id='line_1356'>      accurate inquiry will suggest, that, instead of visiting the</a>
<a id='line_1357'>      courts, the camps, the temples, of the East, the two journeys of</a>
<a id='line_1358'>      Mahomet into Syria were confined to the fairs of Bostra and</a>
<a id='line_1359'>      Damascus; that he was only thirteen years of age when he</a>
<a id='line_1360'>      accompanied the caravan of his uncle; and that his duty compelled</a>
<a id='line_1361'>      him to return as soon as he had disposed of the merchandise of</a>
<a id='line_1362'>      Cadijah. In these hasty and superficial excursions, the eye of</a>
<a id='line_1363'>      genius might discern some objects invisible to his grosser</a>
<a id='line_1364'>      companions; some seeds of knowledge might be cast upon a fruitful</a>
<a id='line_1365'>      soil; but his ignorance of the Syriac language must have checked</a>
<a id='line_1366'>      his curiosity; and I cannot perceive, in the life or writings of</a>
<a id='line_1367'>      Mahomet, that his prospect was far extended beyond the limits of</a>
<a id='line_1368'>      the Arabian world. From every region of that solitary world, the</a>
<a id='line_1369'>      pilgrims of Mecca were annually assembled, by the calls of</a>
<a id='line_1370'>      devotion and commerce: in the free concourse of multitudes, a</a>
<a id='line_1371'>      simple citizen, in his native tongue, might study the political</a>
<a id='line_1372'>      state and character of the tribes, the theory and practice of the</a>
<a id='line_1373'>      Jews and Christians. Some useful strangers might be tempted, or</a>
<a id='line_1374'>      forced, to implore the rights of hospitality; and the enemies of</a>
<a id='line_1375'>      Mahomet have named the Jew, the Persian, and the Syrian monk,</a>
<a id='line_1376'>      whom they accuse of lending their secret aid to the composition</a>
<a id='line_1377'>      of the Koran. 72 Conversation enriches the understanding, but</a>
<a id='line_1378'>      solitude is the school of genius; and the uniformity of a work</a>
<a id='line_1379'>      denotes the hand of a single artist. From his earliest youth</a>
<a id='line_1380'>      Mahomet was addicted to religious contemplation; each year,</a>
<a id='line_1381'>      during the month of Ramadan, he withdrew from the world, and from</a>
<a id='line_1382'>      the arms of Cadijah: in the cave of Hera, three miles from Mecca,</a>
<a id='line_1383'>      73 he consulted the spirit of fraud or enthusiasm, whose abode is</a>
<a id='line_1384'>      not in the heavens, but in the mind of the prophet. The faith</a>

<a id='line_1460'>      invisible essence. After the ruin of the temple, the faith of the</a>
<a id='line_1461'>      Hebrew exiles was purified, fixed, and enlightened, by the</a>
<a id='line_1462'>      spiritual devotion of the synagogue; and the authority of Mahomet</a>

<a id='line_1472'>      imperfection of the conqueror. The Christians of the seventh</a>

<a id='line_1474'>      their public and private vows were addressed to the relics and</a>
<a id='line_1475'>      images that disgraced the temples of the East: the throne of the</a>

<a id='line_1480'>      mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation appear to contradict the</a>
<a id='line_1481'>      principle of the divine unity. In their obvious sense, they</a>
<a id='line_1482'>      introduce three equal deities, and transform the man Jesus into</a>
<a id='line_1483'>      the substance of the Son of God: 76 an orthodox commentary will</a>
<a id='line_1484'>      satisfy only a believing mind: intemperate curiosity and zeal had</a>
<a id='line_1485'>      torn the veil of the sanctuary; and each of the Oriental sects</a>
<a id='line_1486'>      was eager to confess that all, except themselves, deserved the</a>
<a id='line_1487'>      reproach of idolatry and polytheism. The creed of Mahomet is free</a>

<a id='line_1489'>      testimony to the unity of God. The prophet of Mecca rejected the</a>
<a id='line_1490'>      worship of idols and men, of stars and planets, on the rational</a>
<a id='line_1491'>      principle that whatever rises must set, that whatever is born</a>
<a id='line_1492'>      must die, that whatever is corruptible must decay and perish. 77</a>
<a id='line_1493'>      In the Author of the universe, his rational enthusiasm confessed</a>
<a id='line_1494'>      and adored an infinite and eternal being, without form or place,</a>

<a id='line_1499'>      firmly held by his disciples, and defined with metaphysical</a>

<a id='line_1728'>      editions of the Koran assert the same miraculous privilege of a</a>
<a id='line_1729'>      uniform and incorruptible text. In the spirit of enthusiasm or</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      vanity, the prophet rests the truth of his mission on the merit</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      of his book; audaciously challenges both men and angels to</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      imitate the beauties of a single page; and presumes to assert</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      that God alone could dictate this incomparable performance. 92</a>
<a id='line_1734'>      This argument is most powerfully addressed to a devout Arabian,</a>

<a id='line_1829'>      the angels, in their respective mansions. Beyond the seventh</a>

<a id='line_1831'>      veil of unity, approached within two bow-shots of the throne, and</a>
<a id='line_1832'>      felt a cold that pierced him to the heart, when his shoulder was</a>

<a id='line_1908'>      alms, are the religious duties of a Mussulman; and he is</a>
<a id='line_1909'>      encouraged to hope, that prayer will carry him half way to God,</a>
<a id='line_1910'>      fasting will bring him to the door of his palace, and alms will</a>
<a id='line_1911'>      gain him admittance. 101 I. According to the tradition of the</a>
<a id='line_1912'>      nocturnal journey, the apostle, in his personal conference with</a>
<a id='line_1913'>      the Deity, was commanded to impose on his disciples the daily</a>
<a id='line_1914'>      obligation of fifty prayers. By the advice of Moses, he applied</a>
<a id='line_1915'>      for an alleviation of this intolerable burden; the number was</a>
<a id='line_1916'>      gradually reduced to five; without any dispensation of business</a>
<a id='line_1917'>      or pleasure, or time or place: the devotion of the faithful is</a>
<a id='line_1918'>      repeated at daybreak, at noon, in the afternoon, in the evening,</a>
<a id='line_1919'>      and at the first watch of the night; and in the present decay of</a>
<a id='line_1920'>      religious fervor, our travellers are edified by the profound</a>
<a id='line_1921'>      humility and attention of the Turks and Persians. Cleanliness is</a>
<a id='line_1922'>      the key of prayer: the frequent lustration of the hands, the</a>
<a id='line_1923'>      face, and the body, which was practised of old by the Arabs, is</a>
<a id='line_1924'>      solemnly enjoined by the Koran; and a permission is formally</a>
<a id='line_1925'>      granted to supply with sand the scarcity of water. The words and</a>
<a id='line_1926'>      attitudes of supplication, as it is performed either sitting, or</a>
<a id='line_1927'>      standing, or prostrate on the ground, are prescribed by custom or</a>
<a id='line_1928'>      authority; but the prayer is poured forth in short and fervent</a>
<a id='line_1929'>      ejaculations; the measure of zeal is not exhausted by a tedious</a>
<a id='line_1930'>      liturgy; and each Mussulman for his own person is invested with</a>
<a id='line_1931'>      the character of a priest. Among the theists, who reject the use</a>
<a id='line_1932'>      of images, it has been found necessary to restrain the wanderings</a>
<a id='line_1933'>      of the fancy, by directing the eye and the thought towards a</a>
<a id='line_1934'>      kebla, or visible point of the horizon. The prophet was at first</a>
<a id='line_1935'>      inclined to gratify the Jews by the choice of Jerusalem; but he</a>
<a id='line_1936'>      soon returned to a more natural partiality; and five times every</a>
<a id='line_1937'>      day the eyes of the nations at Astracan, at Fez, at Delhi, are</a>
<a id='line_1938'>      devoutly turned to the holy temple of Mecca. Yet every spot for</a>
<a id='line_1939'>      the service of God is equally pure: the Mahometans indifferently</a>
<a id='line_1940'>      pray in their chamber or in the street. As a distinction from the</a>
<a id='line_1941'>      Jews and Christians, the Friday in each week is set apart for the</a>
<a id='line_1942'>      useful institution of public worship: the people is assembled in</a>
<a id='line_1943'>      the mosch; and the imam, some respectable elder, ascends the</a>
<a id='line_1944'>      pulpit, to begin the prayer and pronounce the sermon. But the</a>
<a id='line_1945'>      Mahometan religion is destitute of priesthood or sacrifice; and</a>
<a id='line_1946'>      the independent spirit of fanaticism looks down with contempt on</a>
<a id='line_1947'>      the ministers and the slaves of superstition. 1011</a>

<a id='line_1949'>      II. The voluntary 102 penance of the ascetics, the torment and</a>
<a id='line_1950'>      glory of their lives, was odious to a prophet who censured in his</a>
<a id='line_1951'>      companions a rash vow of abstaining from flesh, and women, and</a>
<a id='line_1952'>      sleep; and firmly declared, that he would suffer no monks in his</a>
<a id='line_1953'>      religion. 103 Yet he instituted, in each year, a fast of thirty</a>
<a id='line_1954'>      days; and strenuously recommended the observance as a discipline</a>
<a id='line_1955'>      which purifies the soul and subdues the body, as a salutary</a>
<a id='line_1956'>      exercise of obedience to the will of God and his apostle. During</a>
<a id='line_1957'>      the month of Ramadan, from the rising to the setting of the sun,</a>
<a id='line_1958'>      the Mussulman abstains from eating, and drinking, and women, and</a>
<a id='line_1959'>      baths, and perfumes; from all nourishment that can restore his</a>
<a id='line_1960'>      strength, from all pleasure that can gratify his senses. In the</a>
<a id='line_1961'>      revolution of the lunar year, the Ramadan coincides, by turns,</a>
<a id='line_1962'>      with the winter cold and the summer heat; and the patient martyr,</a>
<a id='line_1963'>      without assuaging his thirst with a drop of water, must expect</a>
<a id='line_1964'>      the close of a tedious and sultry day. The interdiction of wine,</a>
<a id='line_1965'>      peculiar to some orders of priests or hermits, is converted by</a>
<a id='line_1966'>      Mahomet alone into a positive and general law; 104 and a</a>
<a id='line_1967'>      considerable portion of the globe has abjured, at his command,</a>
<a id='line_1968'>      the use of that salutary, though dangerous, liquor. These painful</a>
<a id='line_1969'>      restraints are, doubtless, infringed by the libertine, and eluded</a>
<a id='line_1970'>      by the hypocrite; but the legislator, by whom they are enacted,</a>
<a id='line_1971'>      cannot surely be accused of alluring his proselytes by the</a>
<a id='line_1972'>      indulgence of their sensual appetites. III. The charity of the</a>
<a id='line_1973'>      Mahometans descends to the animal creation; and the Koran</a>
<a id='line_1974'>      repeatedly inculcates, not as a merit, but as a strict and</a>
<a id='line_1975'>      indispensable duty, the relief of the indigent and unfortunate.</a>
<a id='line_1976'>      Mahomet, perhaps, is the only lawgiver who has defined the</a>
<a id='line_1977'>      precise measure of charity: the standard may vary with the degree</a>
<a id='line_1978'>      and nature of property, as it consists either in money, in corn</a>
<a id='line_1979'>      or cattle, in fruits or merchandise; but the Mussulman does not</a>
<a id='line_1980'>      accomplish the law, unless he bestows a tenth of his revenue; and</a>
<a id='line_1981'>      if his conscience accuses him of fraud or extortion, the tenth,</a>

<a id='line_2097'>      humanity and enthusiasm. 109 The doom of the infidels is common:</a>
<a id='line_2098'>      the measure of their guilt and punishment is determined by the</a>
<a id='line_2099'>      degree of evidence which they have rejected, by the magnitude of</a>

<a id='line_2115'>      distinction, will pass over the sharp and perilous bridge of the</a>
<a id='line_2116'>      abyss; but the innocent, treading in the footsteps of Mahomet,</a>
<a id='line_2117'>      will gloriously enter the gates of paradise, while the guilty</a>
<a id='line_2118'>      will fall into the first and mildest of the seven hells. The term</a>
<a id='line_2119'>      of expiation will vary from nine hundred to seven thousand years;</a>

<a id='line_2123'>      that superstition should act most powerfully on the fears of her</a>
<a id='line_2124'>      votaries, since the human fancy can paint with more energy the</a>
<a id='line_2125'>      misery than the bliss of a future life. With the two simple</a>
<a id='line_2126'>      elements of darkness and fire, we create a sensation of pain,</a>
<a id='line_2127'>      which may be aggravated to an infinite degree by the idea of</a>
<a id='line_2128'>      endless duration. But the same idea operates with an opposite</a>
<a id='line_2129'>      effect on the continuity of pleasure; and too much of our present</a>
<a id='line_2130'>      enjoyments is obtained from the relief, or the comparison, of</a>
<a id='line_2131'>      evil. It is natural enough that an Arabian prophet should dwell</a>
<a id='line_2132'>      with rapture on the groves, the fountains, and the rivers of</a>
<a id='line_2133'>      paradise; but instead of inspiring the blessed inhabitants with a</a>
<a id='line_2134'>      liberal taste for harmony and science, conversation and</a>
<a id='line_2135'>      friendship, he idly celebrates the pearls and diamonds, the robes</a>

<a id='line_2137'>      artificial dainties, numerous attendants, and the whole train of</a>
<a id='line_2138'>      sensual and costly luxury, which becomes insipid to the owner,</a>
<a id='line_2139'>      even in the short period of this mortal life. Seventy-two Houris,</a>
<a id='line_2140'>      or black-eyed girls, of resplendent beauty, blooming youth,</a>
<a id='line_2141'>      virgin purity, and exquisite sensibility, will be created for the</a>
<a id='line_2142'>      use of the meanest believer; a moment of pleasure will be</a>
<a id='line_2143'>      prolonged to a thousand years; and his faculties will be</a>
<a id='line_2144'>      increased a hundred fold, to render him worthy of his felicity.</a>

<a id='line_2146'>      open to both sexes; but Mahomet has not specified the male</a>

<a id='line_2222'>      transport, and Abu Taled was ironically exhorted to respect the</a>
<a id='line_2223'>      superior dignity of his son. In a more serious tone, the father</a>

<a id='line_2231'>      advanced with a slow and painful progress within the walls of</a>

<a id='line_2234'>      him as a prophet, and to whom he seasonably dispensed the</a>

<a id='line_2243'>      solemn festivals, in the days of pilgrimage, he frequented the</a>

<a id='line_2380'>      only resource of Mahomet. 117 At the dead of night, accompanied</a>
<a id='line_2381'>      by his friend Abubeker, he silently escaped from his house: the</a>
<a id='line_2382'>      assassins watched at the door; but they were deceived by the</a>
<a id='line_2383'>      figure of Ali, who reposed on the bed, and was covered with the</a>
<a id='line_2384'>      green vestment of the apostle. The Koreish respected the piety of</a>
<a id='line_2385'>      the heroic youth; but some verses of Ali, which are still extant,</a>
<a id='line_2386'>      exhibit an interesting picture of his anxiety, his tenderness,</a>
<a id='line_2387'>      and his religious confidence. Three days Mahomet and his</a>
<a id='line_2388'>      companion were concealed in the cave of Thor, at the distance of</a>
<a id='line_2389'>      a league from Mecca; and in the close of each evening, they</a>
<a id='line_2390'>      received from the son and daughter of Abubeker a secret supply of</a>
<a id='line_2391'>      intelligence and food. The diligence of the Koreish explored</a>
<a id='line_2392'>      every haunt in the neighborhood of the city: they arrived at the</a>
<a id='line_2393'>      entrance of the cavern; but the providential deceit of a spider’s</a>
<a id='line_2394'>      web and a pigeon’s nest is supposed to convince them that the</a>
<a id='line_2395'>      place was solitary and inviolate. “We are only two,” said the</a>
<a id='line_2396'>      trembling Abubeker. “There is a third,” replied the prophet; “it</a>
<a id='line_2397'>      is God himself.” No sooner was the pursuit abated than the two</a>
<a id='line_2398'>      fugitives issued from the rock, and mounted their camels: on the</a>
<a id='line_2399'>      road to Medina, they were overtaken by the emissaries of the</a>
<a id='line_2400'>      Koreish; they redeemed themselves with prayers and promises from</a>
<a id='line_2401'>      their hands. In this eventful moment, the lance of an Arab might</a>
<a id='line_2402'>      have changed the history of the world. The flight of the prophet</a>

<a id='line_2449'>      wives, their children, and their absent brethren, that they would</a>
<a id='line_2450'>      forever profess the creed, and observe the precepts, of the</a>

<a id='line_2453'>      two women of Medina held a solemn conference with Mahomet, his</a>
<a id='line_2454'>      kinsman, and his disciples; and pledged themselves to each other</a>
<a id='line_2455'>      by a mutual oath of fidelity. They promised, in the name of the</a>

<a id='line_2457'>      confederate, obey him as a leader, and defend him to the last</a>
<a id='line_2458'>      extremity, like their wives and children. “But if you are</a>

<a id='line_2460'>      “will you not abandon your new allies?” “All things,” replied</a>
<a id='line_2461'>      Mahomet with a smile, “are now common between us; your blood is</a>

<a id='line_2465'>      exclaimed the deputies of Medina, “will be our reward?”</a>
<a id='line_2466'>      “Paradise,” replied the prophet. “Stretch forth thy hand.” He</a>
<a id='line_2467'>      stretched it forth, and they reiterated the oath of allegiance</a>
<a id='line_2468'>      and fidelity. Their treaty was ratified by the people, who</a>
<a id='line_2469'>      unanimously embraced the profession of Islam; they rejoiced in</a>
<a id='line_2470'>      the exile of the apostle, but they trembled for his safety, and</a>
<a id='line_2471'>      impatiently expected his arrival. After a perilous and rapid</a>
<a id='line_2472'>      journey along the sea-coast, he halted at Koba, two miles from</a>
<a id='line_2473'>      the city, and made his public entry into Medina, sixteen days</a>
<a id='line_2474'>      after his flight from Mecca. Five hundred of the citizens</a>
<a id='line_2475'>      advanced to meet him; he was hailed with acclamations of loyalty</a>
<a id='line_2476'>      and devotion; Mahomet was mounted on a she-camel, an umbrella</a>
<a id='line_2477'>      shaded his head, and a turban was unfurled before him to supply</a>
<a id='line_2478'>      the deficiency of a standard. His bravest disciples, who had been</a>
<a id='line_2479'>      scattered by the storm, assembled round his person; and the</a>

<a id='line_2483'>      Mahomet judiciously coupled his principal followers with the</a>
<a id='line_2484'>      rights and obligations of brethren; and when Ali found himself</a>
<a id='line_2485'>      without a peer, the prophet tenderly declared, that he would be</a>
<a id='line_2486'>      the companion and brother of the noble youth. The expedient was</a>
<a id='line_2487'>      crowned with success; the holy fraternity was respected in peace</a>

<a id='line_2558'>      weakness: 123 the means of persuasion had been tried, the season</a>
<a id='line_2559'>      of forbearance was elapsed, and he was now commanded to propagate</a>

<a id='line_2561'>      and, without regarding the sanctity of days or months, to pursue</a>

<a id='line_2563'>      so repeatedly inculcated in the Koran, are ascribed by the author</a>

<a id='line_2565'>      evangelic style may explain an ambiguous text, that Jesus did not</a>
<a id='line_2566'>      bring peace on the earth, but a sword: his patient and humble</a>
<a id='line_2567'>      virtues should not be confounded with the intolerant zeal of</a>

<a id='line_2570'>      appeal with more propriety to the example of Moses, of the</a>
<a id='line_2571'>      Judges, and the kings of Israel. The military laws of the Hebrews</a>
<a id='line_2572'>      are still more rigid than those of the Arabian legislator. 124</a>
<a id='line_2573'>      The Lord of hosts marched in person before the Jews: if a city</a>
<a id='line_2574'>      resisted their summons, the males, without distinction, were put</a>
<a id='line_2575'>      to the sword: the seven nations of Canaan were devoted to</a>
<a id='line_2576'>      destruction; and neither repentance nor conversion, could shield</a>
<a id='line_2577'>      them from the inevitable doom, that no creature within their</a>
<a id='line_2578'>      precincts should be left alive. 1241 The fair option of</a>
<a id='line_2579'>      friendship, or submission, or battle, was proposed to the enemies</a>
<a id='line_2580'>      of Mahomet. If they professed the creed of Islam, they were</a>
<a id='line_2581'>      admitted to all the temporal and spiritual benefits of his</a>
<a id='line_2582'>      primitive disciples, and marched under the same banner to extend</a>
<a id='line_2583'>      the religion which they had embraced. The clemency of the prophet</a>
<a id='line_2584'>      was decided by his interest: yet he seldom trampled on a</a>
<a id='line_2585'>      prostrate enemy; and he seems to promise, that on the payment of</a>
<a id='line_2586'>      a tribute, the least guilty of his unbelieving subjects might be</a>
<a id='line_2587'>      indulged in their worship, or at least in their imperfect faith.</a>
<a id='line_2588'>      In the first months of his reign he practised the lessons of holy</a>
<a id='line_2589'>      warfare, and displayed his white banner before the gates of</a>
<a id='line_2590'>      Medina: the martial apostle fought in person at nine battles or</a>
<a id='line_2591'>      sieges; 125 and fifty enterprises of war were achieved in ten</a>
<a id='line_2592'>      years by himself or his lieutenants. The Arab continued to unite</a>
<a id='line_2593'>      the professions of a merchant and a robber; and his petty</a>
<a id='line_2594'>      excursions for the defence or the attack of a caravan insensibly</a>
<a id='line_2595'>      prepared his troops for the conquest of Arabia. The distribution</a>
<a id='line_2596'>      of the spoil was regulated by a divine law: 126 the whole was</a>
<a id='line_2597'>      faithfully collected in one common mass: a fifth of the gold and</a>
<a id='line_2598'>      silver, the prisoners and cattle, the movables and immovables,</a>
<a id='line_2599'>      was reserved by the prophet for pious and charitable uses; the</a>
<a id='line_2600'>      remainder was shared in adequate portions by the soldiers who had</a>
<a id='line_2601'>      obtained the victory or guarded the camp: the rewards of the</a>
<a id='line_2602'>      slain devolved to their widows and orphans; and the increase of</a>
<a id='line_2603'>      cavalry was encouraged by the allotment of a double share to the</a>
<a id='line_2604'>      horse and to the man. From all sides the roving Arabs were</a>
<a id='line_2605'>      allured to the standard of religion and plunder: the apostle</a>
<a id='line_2606'>      sanctified the license of embracing the female captives as their</a>
<a id='line_2607'>      wives or concubines, and the enjoyment of wealth and beauty was a</a>
<a id='line_2608'>      feeble type of the joys of paradise prepared for the valiant</a>
<a id='line_2609'>      martyrs of the faith. “The sword,” says Mahomet, “is the key of</a>
<a id='line_2610'>      heaven and of hell; a drop of blood shed in the cause of God, a</a>
<a id='line_2611'>      night spent in arms, is of more avail than two months of fasting</a>
<a id='line_2612'>      or prayer: whosoever falls in battle, his sins are forgiven: at</a>
<a id='line_2613'>      the day of judgment his wounds shall be resplendent as vermilion,</a>
<a id='line_2614'>      and odoriferous as musk; and the loss of his limbs shall be</a>

<a id='line_2678'>      mounted by turns a train of seventy camels, (the camels of</a>

<a id='line_2688'>      glided through the valley. “O God,” he exclaimed, as the numbers</a>

<a id='line_2690'>      destroyed, by whom wilt thou be worshipped on the earth?—Courage,</a>
<a id='line_2691'>      my children; close your ranks; discharge your arrows, and the day</a>
<a id='line_2692'>      is your own.” At these words he placed himself, with Abubeker, on</a>
<a id='line_2693'>      a throne or pulpit, 130 and instantly demanded the succor of</a>
<a id='line_2694'>      Gabriel and three thousand angels. His eye was fixed on the field</a>
<a id='line_2695'>      of battle: the Mussulmans fainted and were pressed: in that</a>
<a id='line_2696'>      decisive moment the prophet started from his throne, mounted his</a>
<a id='line_2697'>      horse, and cast a handful of sand into the air: “Let their faces</a>
<a id='line_2698'>      be covered with confusion.” Both armies heard the thunder of his</a>
<a id='line_2699'>      voice: their fancy beheld the angelic warriors: 131 the Koreish</a>
<a id='line_2700'>      trembled and fled: seventy of the bravest were slain; and seventy</a>
<a id='line_2701'>      captives adorned the first victory of the faithful. The dead</a>
<a id='line_2702'>      bodies of the Koreish were despoiled and insulted: two of the</a>
<a id='line_2703'>      most obnoxious prisoners were punished with death; and the ransom</a>
<a id='line_2704'>      of the others, four thousand drams of silver, compensated in some</a>

<a id='line_2706'>      camels of Abu Sophian explored a new road through the desert and</a>
<a id='line_2707'>      along the Euphrates: they were overtaken by the diligence of the</a>
<a id='line_2708'>      Mussulmans; and wealthy must have been the prize, if twenty</a>
<a id='line_2709'>      thousand drams could be set apart for the fifth of the apostle.</a>
<a id='line_2710'>      The resentment of the public and private loss stimulated Abu</a>
<a id='line_2711'>      Sophian to collect a body of three thousand men, seven hundred of</a>
<a id='line_2712'>      whom were armed with cuirasses, and two hundred were mounted on</a>
<a id='line_2713'>      horseback; three thousand camels attended his march; and his wife</a>
<a id='line_2714'>      Henda, with fifteen matrons of Mecca, incessantly sounded their</a>
<a id='line_2715'>      timbrels to animate the troops, and to magnify the greatness of</a>
<a id='line_2716'>      Hobal, the most popular deity of the Caaba. The standard of God</a>
<a id='line_2717'>      and Mahomet was upheld by nine hundred and fifty believers: the</a>
<a id='line_2718'>      disproportion of numbers was not more alarming than in the field</a>
<a id='line_2719'>      of Beder; and their presumption of victory prevailed against the</a>
<a id='line_2720'>      divine and human sense of the apostle. The second battle was</a>
<a id='line_2721'>      fought on Mount Ohud, six miles to the north of Medina; 132 the</a>
<a id='line_2722'>      Koreish advanced in the form of a crescent; and the right wing of</a>
<a id='line_2723'>      cavalry was led by Caled, the fiercest and most successful of the</a>
<a id='line_2724'>      Arabian warriors. The troops of Mahomet were skilfully posted on</a>
<a id='line_2725'>      the declivity of the hill; and their rear was guarded by a</a>
<a id='line_2726'>      detachment of fifty archers. The weight of their charge impelled</a>
<a id='line_2727'>      and broke the centre of the idolaters: but in the pursuit they</a>
<a id='line_2728'>      lost the advantage of their ground: the archers deserted their</a>
<a id='line_2729'>      station: the Mussulmans were tempted by the spoil, disobeyed</a>
<a id='line_2730'>      their general, and disordered their ranks. The intrepid Caled,</a>
<a id='line_2731'>      wheeling his cavalry on their flank and rear, exclaimed, with a</a>
<a id='line_2732'>      loud voice, that Mahomet was slain. He was indeed wounded in the</a>
<a id='line_2733'>      face with a javelin: two of his teeth were shattered with a</a>
<a id='line_2734'>      stone; yet, in the midst of tumult and dismay, he reproached the</a>
<a id='line_2735'>      infidels with the murder of a prophet; and blessed the friendly</a>
<a id='line_2736'>      hand that stanched his blood, and conveyed him to a place of</a>
<a id='line_2737'>      safety. Seventy martyrs died for the sins of the people; they</a>
<a id='line_2738'>      fell, said the apostle, in pairs, each brother embracing his</a>
<a id='line_2739'>      lifeless companion; 133 their bodies were mangled by the inhuman</a>
<a id='line_2740'>      females of Mecca; and the wife of Abu Sophian tasted the entrails</a>
<a id='line_2741'>      of Hamza, the uncle of Mahomet. They might applaud their</a>
<a id='line_2742'>      superstition, and satiate their fury; but the Mussulmans soon</a>
<a id='line_2743'>      rallied in the field, and the Koreish wanted strength or courage</a>
<a id='line_2744'>      to undertake the siege of Medina. It was attacked the ensuing</a>

<a id='line_2748'>      before the city, and a camp of three thousand Mussulmans. The</a>
<a id='line_2749'>      prudence of Mahomet declined a general engagement: the valor of</a>
<a id='line_2750'>      Ali was signalized in single combat; and the war was protracted</a>
<a id='line_2751'>      twenty days, till the final separation of the confederates. A</a>

<a id='line_2858'>      the Jewish power in Arabia: the territory, a fertile spot in the</a>

<a id='line_2860'>      eight castles, some of which were esteemed of impregnable</a>
<a id='line_2861'>      strength. The forces of Mahomet consisted of two hundred horse</a>
<a id='line_2862'>      and fourteen hundred foot: in the succession of eight regular and</a>
<a id='line_2863'>      painful sieges they were exposed to danger, and fatigue, and</a>
<a id='line_2864'>      hunger; and the most undaunted chiefs despaired of the event. The</a>
<a id='line_2865'>      apostle revived their faith and courage by the example of Ali, on</a>
<a id='line_2866'>      whom he bestowed the surname of the Lion of God: perhaps we may</a>

<a id='line_2927'>      disappointment might justly accuse the failure of a prophet who</a>
<a id='line_2928'>      had so often appealed to the evidence of success. The faith and</a>

<a id='line_2938'>      the Arabian tribes; ten thousand soldiers were assembled for the</a>
<a id='line_2939'>      conquest of Mecca; and the idolaters, the weaker party, were</a>
<a id='line_2940'>      easily convicted of violating the truce. Enthusiasm and</a>

<a id='line_2947'>      kingdom, and confessed, under the cimeter of Omar, that he was</a>
<a id='line_2948'>      the apostle of the true God. The return of Marius and Scylla was</a>
<a id='line_2949'>      stained with the blood of the Romans: the revenge of Mahomet was</a>
<a id='line_2950'>      stimulated by religious zeal, and his injured followers were</a>
<a id='line_2951'>      eager to execute or to prevent the order of a massacre. Instead</a>
<a id='line_2952'>      of indulging their passions and his own, 139 the victorious exile</a>
<a id='line_2953'>      forgave the guilt, and united the factions, of Mecca. His troops,</a>
<a id='line_2954'>      in three divisions, marched into the city: eight-and-twenty of</a>
<a id='line_2955'>      the inhabitants were slain by the sword of Caled; eleven men and</a>
<a id='line_2956'>      six women were proscribed by the sentence of Mahomet; but he</a>

<a id='line_3053'>      opened by the miners; that the breach was assaulted by the</a>
<a id='line_3054'>      troops. After a siege of twenty-days, the prophet sounded a</a>

<a id='line_3056'>      affected to pray for the repentance and safety of the unbelieving</a>

<a id='line_3119'>      Heraclius and Mahomet was of short continuance: the new religion</a>
<a id='line_3120'>      had inflamed rather than assuaged the rapacious spirit of the</a>
<a id='line_3121'>      Saracens, and the murder of an envoy afforded a decent pretence</a>

<a id='line_3128'>      to the command; and if the three should perish in the war, the</a>

<a id='line_3135'>      body: he embraced the standard with his bleeding stumps, till he</a>
<a id='line_3136'>      was transfixed to the ground with fifty honorable wounds. 1461</a>
<a id='line_3137'>      “Advance,” cried Abdallah, who stepped into the vacant place,</a>

<a id='line_3141'>      swords were broken in his hand; and his valor withstood and</a>
<a id='line_3142'>      repulsed the superior numbers of the Christians. In the nocturnal</a>

<a id='line_3151'>      “You see,” replied the apostle, “a friend who is deploring the</a>

<a id='line_3153'>      the sovereign of Arabia affected to prevent the hostile</a>
<a id='line_3154'>      preparations of Heraclius; and solemnly proclaimed war against</a>
<a id='line_3155'>      the Romans, without attempting to disguise the hardships and</a>
<a id='line_3156'>      dangers of the enterprise. 147 The Moslems were discouraged: they</a>
<a id='line_3157'>      alleged the want of money, or horses, or provisions; the season</a>
<a id='line_3158'>      of harvest, and the intolerable heat of the summer: “Hell is much</a>
<a id='line_3159'>      hotter,” said the indignant prophet. He disdained to compel their</a>
<a id='line_3160'>      service: but on his return he admonished the most guilty, by an</a>
<a id='line_3161'>      excommunication of fifty days. Their desertion enhanced the merit</a>
<a id='line_3162'>      of Abubeker, Othman, and the faithful companions who devoted</a>
<a id='line_3163'>      their lives and fortunes; and Mahomet displayed his banner at the</a>
<a id='line_3164'>      head of ten thousand horse and twenty thousand foot. Painful</a>
<a id='line_3165'>      indeed was the distress of the march: lassitude and thirst were</a>
<a id='line_3166'>      aggravated by the scorching and pestilential winds of the desert:</a>
<a id='line_3167'>      ten men rode by turns on one camel; and they were reduced to the</a>
<a id='line_3168'>      shameful necessity of drinking the water from the belly of that</a>
<a id='line_3169'>      useful animal. In the mid-way, ten days’ journey from Medina and</a>
<a id='line_3170'>      Damascus, they reposed near the grove and fountain of Tabuc.</a>
<a id='line_3171'>      Beyond that place Mahomet declined the prosecution of the war: he</a>
<a id='line_3172'>      declared himself satisfied with the peaceful intentions, he was</a>
<a id='line_3173'>      more probably daunted by the martial array, of the emperor of the</a>

<a id='line_3243'>      replied a voice from the crowd, “I am entitled to three drams of</a>
<a id='line_3244'>      silver.” Mahomet heard the complaint, satisfied the demand, and</a>
<a id='line_3245'>      thanked his creditor for accusing him in this world rather than</a>
<a id='line_3246'>      at the day of judgment. He beheld with temperate firmness the</a>

<a id='line_3253'>      appeared to mark that ancient and faithful friend as his</a>
<a id='line_3254'>      successor in the sacerdotal and regal office; but he prudently</a>
<a id='line_3255'>      declined the risk and envy of a more explicit nomination. At a</a>
<a id='line_3256'>      moment when his faculties were visibly impaired, he called for</a>
<a id='line_3257'>      pen and ink to write, or, more properly, to dictate, a divine</a>
<a id='line_3258'>      book, the sum and accomplishment of all his revelations: a</a>
<a id='line_3259'>      dispute arose in the chamber, whether he should be allowed to</a>
<a id='line_3260'>      supersede the authority of the Koran; and the prophet was forced</a>
<a id='line_3261'>      to reprove the indecent vehemence of his disciples. If the</a>
<a id='line_3262'>      slightest credit may be afforded to the traditions of his wives</a>

<a id='line_3264'>      the last moments of his life, the dignity 1501 of an apostle, and</a>
<a id='line_3265'>      the faith of an enthusiast; described the visits of Gabriel, who</a>
<a id='line_3266'>      bade an everlasting farewell to the earth, and expressed his</a>
<a id='line_3267'>      lively confidence, not only of the mercy, but of the favor, of</a>
<a id='line_3268'>      the Supreme Being. In a familiar discourse he had mentioned his</a>
<a id='line_3269'>      special prerogative, that the angel of death was not allowed to</a>
<a id='line_3270'>      take his soul till he had respectfully asked the permission of</a>
<a id='line_3271'>      the prophet. The request was granted; and Mahomet immediately</a>
<a id='line_3272'>      fell into the agony of his dissolution: his head was reclined on</a>
<a id='line_3273'>      the lap of Ayesha, the best beloved of all his wives; he fainted</a>
<a id='line_3274'>      with the violence of pain; recovering his spirits, he raised his</a>
<a id='line_3275'>      eyes towards the roof of the house, and, with a steady look,</a>
<a id='line_3276'>      though a faltering voice, uttered the last broken, though</a>
<a id='line_3277'>      articulate, words: “O God!..... pardon my sins....... Yes, ......</a>
<a id='line_3278'>      I come,...... among my fellow-citizens on high;” and thus</a>
<a id='line_3279'>      peaceably expired on a carpet spread upon the floor. An</a>
<a id='line_3280'>      expedition for the conquest of Syria was stopped by this mournful</a>
<a id='line_3281'>      event; the army halted at the gates of Medina; the chiefs were</a>
<a id='line_3282'>      assembled round their dying master. The city, more especially the</a>
<a id='line_3283'>      house, of the prophet, was a scene of clamorous sorrow of silent</a>
<a id='line_3284'>      despair: fanaticism alone could suggest a ray of hope and</a>
<a id='line_3285'>      consolation. “How can he be dead, our witness, our intercessor,</a>
<a id='line_3286'>      our mediator, with God? By God he is not dead: like Moses and</a>
<a id='line_3287'>      Jesus, he is wrapped in a holy trance, and speedily will he</a>
<a id='line_3288'>      return to his faithful people.” The evidence of sense was</a>

<a id='line_3291'>      that the prophet was no more. The tumult was appeased by the</a>
<a id='line_3292'>      weight and moderation of Abubeker. “Is it Mahomet,” said he to</a>

<a id='line_3408'>      Charity may believe that the original motives of Mahomet were</a>

<a id='line_3415'>      of Nineveh, for the destruction of the rebels whom he had</a>
<a id='line_3416'>      condemned. The injustice of Mecca and the choice of Medina,</a>
<a id='line_3417'>      transformed the citizen into a prince, the humble preacher into</a>
<a id='line_3418'>      the leader of armies; but his sword was consecrated by the</a>
<a id='line_3419'>      example of the saints; and the same God who afflicts a sinful</a>
<a id='line_3420'>      world with pestilence and earthquakes, might inspire for their</a>
<a id='line_3421'>      conversion or chastisement the valor of his servants. In the</a>

<a id='line_3423'>      the stern rigor of fanaticism, to comply in some measure with the</a>
<a id='line_3424'>      prejudices and passions of his followers, and to employ even the</a>
<a id='line_3425'>      vices of mankind as the instruments of their salvation. The use</a>
<a id='line_3426'>      of fraud and perfidy, of cruelty and injustice, were often</a>
<a id='line_3427'>      subservient to the propagation of the faith; and Mahomet</a>
<a id='line_3428'>      commanded or approved the assassination of the Jews and idolaters</a>
<a id='line_3429'>      who had escaped from the field of battle. By the repetition of</a>
<a id='line_3430'>      such acts, the character of Mahomet must have been gradually</a>
<a id='line_3431'>      stained; and the influence of such pernicious habits would be</a>
<a id='line_3432'>      poorly compensated by the practice of the personal and social</a>
<a id='line_3433'>      virtues which are necessary to maintain the reputation of a</a>
<a id='line_3434'>      prophet among his sectaries and friends. Of his last years,</a>
<a id='line_3435'>      ambition was the ruling passion; and a politician will suspect,</a>
<a id='line_3436'>      that he secretly smiled (the victorious impostor!) at the</a>
<a id='line_3437'>      enthusiasm of his youth, and the credulity of his proselytes. 156</a>
<a id='line_3438'>      A philosopher will observe, that their credulity and his success</a>
<a id='line_3439'>      would tend more strongly to fortify the assurance of his divine</a>
<a id='line_3440'>      mission, that his interest and religion were inseparably</a>
<a id='line_3441'>      connected, and that his conscience would be soothed by the</a>
<a id='line_3442'>      persuasion, that he alone was absolved by the Deity from the</a>
<a id='line_3443'>      obligation of positive and moral laws. If he retained any vestige</a>
<a id='line_3444'>      of his native innocence, the sins of Mahomet may be allowed as an</a>
<a id='line_3445'>      evidence of his sincerity. In the support of truth, the arts of</a>

<a id='line_3509'>      incontinence was regulated by the civil and religious laws of the</a>

<a id='line_3511'>      license of polygamy was reduced to four legitimate wives or</a>
<a id='line_3512'>      concubines; their rights both of bed and of dowry were equitably</a>
<a id='line_3513'>      determined; the freedom of divorce was discouraged, adultery was</a>
<a id='line_3514'>      condemned as a capital offence; and fornication, in either sex,</a>
<a id='line_3515'>      was punished with a hundred stripes. 160 Such were the calm and</a>
<a id='line_3516'>      rational precepts of the legislator: but in his private conduct,</a>
<a id='line_3517'>      Mahomet indulged the appetites of a man, and abused the claims of</a>
<a id='line_3518'>      a prophet. A special revelation dispensed him from the laws which</a>
<a id='line_3519'>      he had imposed on his nation: the female sex, without reserve,</a>
<a id='line_3520'>      was abandoned to his desires; and this singular prerogative</a>
<a id='line_3521'>      excited the envy, rather than the scandal, the veneration, rather</a>
<a id='line_3522'>      than the envy, of the devout Mussulmans. If we remember the seven</a>
<a id='line_3523'>      hundred wives and three hundred concubines of the wise Solomon,</a>
<a id='line_3524'>      we shall applaud the modesty of the Arabian, who espoused no more</a>
<a id='line_3525'>      than seventeen or fifteen wives; eleven are enumerated who</a>
<a id='line_3526'>      occupied at Medina their separate apartments round the house of</a>
<a id='line_3527'>      the apostle, and enjoyed in their turns the favor of his conjugal</a>
<a id='line_3528'>      society. What is singular enough, they were all widows, excepting</a>
<a id='line_3529'>      only Ayesha, the daughter of Abubeker. She was doubtless a</a>
<a id='line_3530'>      virgin, since Mahomet consummated his nuptials (such is the</a>
<a id='line_3531'>      premature ripeness of the climate) when she was only nine years</a>
<a id='line_3532'>      of age. The youth, the beauty, the spirit of Ayesha, gave her a</a>
<a id='line_3533'>      superior ascendant: she was beloved and trusted by the prophet;</a>
<a id='line_3534'>      and, after his death, the daughter of Abubeker was long revered</a>
<a id='line_3535'>      as the mother of the faithful. Her behavior had been ambiguous</a>
<a id='line_3536'>      and indiscreet: in a nocturnal march she was accidentally left</a>
<a id='line_3537'>      behind; and in the morning Ayesha returned to the camp with a</a>
<a id='line_3538'>      man. The temper of Mahomet was inclined to jealousy; but a divine</a>
<a id='line_3539'>      revelation assured him of her innocence: he chastised her</a>
<a id='line_3540'>      accusers, and published a law of domestic peace, that no woman</a>
<a id='line_3541'>      should be condemned unless four male witnesses had seen her in</a>
<a id='line_3542'>      the act of adultery. 161 In his adventures with Zeineb, the wife</a>
<a id='line_3543'>      of Zeid, and with Mary, an Egyptian captive, the amorous prophet</a>
<a id='line_3544'>      forgot the interest of his reputation. At the house of Zeid, his</a>
<a id='line_3545'>      freedman and adopted son, he beheld, in a loose undress, the</a>
<a id='line_3546'>      beauty of Zeineb, and burst forth into an ejaculation of devotion</a>
<a id='line_3547'>      and desire. The servile, or grateful, freedman understood the</a>
<a id='line_3548'>      hint, and yielded without hesitation to the love of his</a>
<a id='line_3549'>      benefactor. But as the filial relation had excited some doubt and</a>
<a id='line_3550'>      scandal, the angel Gabriel descended from heaven to ratify the</a>
<a id='line_3551'>      deed, to annul the adoption, and gently to reprove the apostle</a>
<a id='line_3552'>      for distrusting the indulgence of his God. One of his wives,</a>
<a id='line_3553'>      Hafna, the daughter of Omar, surprised him on her own bed, in the</a>
<a id='line_3554'>      embraces of his Egyptian captive: she promised secrecy and</a>
<a id='line_3555'>      forgiveness, he swore that he would renounce the possession of</a>
<a id='line_3556'>      Mary. Both parties forgot their engagements; and Gabriel again</a>
<a id='line_3557'>      descended with a chapter of the Koran, to absolve him from his</a>
<a id='line_3558'>      oath, and to exhort him freely to enjoy his captives and</a>
<a id='line_3559'>      concubines, without listening to the clamors of his wives. In a</a>

<a id='line_3730'>      desirous of bestowing and resuming the sceptre by a free and</a>

<a id='line_3738'>      who, suddenly renouncing his own pretensions, stretched forth his</a>
<a id='line_3739'>      hand, and declared himself the first subject of the mild and</a>
<a id='line_3740'>      venerable Abubeker. 1672 The urgency of the moment, and the</a>
<a id='line_3741'>      acquiescence of the people, might excuse this illegal and</a>
<a id='line_3742'>      precipitate measure; but Omar himself confessed from the pulpit,</a>

<a id='line_3744'>      suffrage of his brethren, both the elector and the elected would</a>
<a id='line_3745'>      be worthy of death. 168 After the simple inauguration of</a>
<a id='line_3746'>      Abubeker, he was obeyed in Medina, Mecca, and the provinces of</a>
<a id='line_3747'>      Arabia: the Hashemites alone declined the oath of fidelity; and</a>
<a id='line_3748'>      their chief, in his own house, maintained, above six months, a</a>
<a id='line_3749'>      sullen and independent reserve; without listening to the threats</a>
<a id='line_3750'>      of Omar, who attempted to consume with fire the habitation of the</a>
<a id='line_3751'>      daughter of the apostle. The death of Fatima, and the decline of</a>
<a id='line_3752'>      his party, subdued the indignant spirit of Ali: he condescended</a>
<a id='line_3753'>      to salute the commander of the faithful, accepted his excuse of</a>
<a id='line_3754'>      the necessity of preventing their common enemies, and wisely</a>
<a id='line_3755'>      rejected his courteous offer of abdicating the government of the</a>
<a id='line_3756'>      Arabians. After a reign of two years, the aged caliph was</a>
<a id='line_3757'>      summoned by the angel of death. In his testament, with the tacit</a>
<a id='line_3758'>      approbation of his companions, he bequeathed the sceptre to the</a>
<a id='line_3759'>      firm and intrepid virtue of Omar. “I have no occasion,” said the</a>
<a id='line_3760'>      modest candidate, “for the place.” “But the place has occasion</a>
<a id='line_3761'>      for you,” replied Abubeker; who expired with a fervent prayer,</a>
<a id='line_3762'>      that the God of Mahomet would ratify his choice, and direct the</a>
<a id='line_3763'>      Mussulmans in the way of concord and obedience. The prayer was</a>
<a id='line_3764'>      not ineffectual, since Ali himself, in a life of privacy and</a>
<a id='line_3765'>      prayer, professed to revere the superior worth and dignity of his</a>
<a id='line_3766'>      rival; who comforted him for the loss of empire, by the most</a>
<a id='line_3767'>      flattering marks of confidence and esteem. In the twelfth year of</a>
<a id='line_3768'>      his reign, Omar received a mortal wound from the hand of an</a>
<a id='line_3769'>      assassin: he rejected with equal impartiality the names of his</a>
<a id='line_3770'>      son and of Ali, refused to load his conscience with the sins of</a>
<a id='line_3771'>      his successor, and devolved on six of the most respectable</a>
<a id='line_3772'>      companions the arduous task of electing a commander of the</a>
<a id='line_3773'>      faithful. On this occasion, Ali was again blamed by his friends</a>
<a id='line_3774'>      169 for submitting his right to the judgment of men, for</a>
<a id='line_3775'>      recognizing their jurisdiction by accepting a place among the six</a>
<a id='line_3776'>      electors. He might have obtained their suffrage, had he deigned</a>
<a id='line_3777'>      to promise a strict and servile conformity, not only to the Koran</a>

<a id='line_3779'>      170 With these limitations, Othman, the secretary of Mahomet,</a>

<a id='line_3841'>      the prudence of the first, the severity of the second, maintained</a>
<a id='line_3842'>      the peace and prosperity of their reigns. The feeble temper and</a>

<a id='line_3844'>      of conquest and empire. He chose, and he was deceived; he</a>
<a id='line_3845'>      trusted, and he was betrayed: the most deserving of the faithful</a>
<a id='line_3846'>      became useless or hostile to his government, and his lavish</a>
<a id='line_3847'>      bounty was productive only of ingratitude and discontent. The</a>
<a id='line_3848'>      spirit of discord went forth in the provinces: their deputies</a>
<a id='line_3849'>      assembled at Medina; and the Charegites, the desperate fanatics</a>
<a id='line_3850'>      who disclaimed the yoke of subordination and reason, were</a>
<a id='line_3851'>      confounded among the free-born Arabs, who demanded the redress of</a>
<a id='line_3852'>      their wrongs and the punishment of their oppressors. From Cufa,</a>
<a id='line_3853'>      from Bassora, from Egypt, from the tribes of the desert, they</a>
<a id='line_3854'>      rose in arms, encamped about a league from Medina, and despatched</a>
<a id='line_3855'>      a haughty mandate to their sovereign, requiring him to execute</a>
<a id='line_3856'>      justice, or to descend from the throne. His repentance began to</a>
<a id='line_3857'>      disarm and disperse the insurgents; but their fury was rekindled</a>
<a id='line_3858'>      by the arts of his enemies; and the forgery of a perfidious</a>
<a id='line_3859'>      secretary was contrived to blast his reputation and precipitate</a>
<a id='line_3860'>      his fall. The caliph had lost the only guard of his predecessors,</a>
<a id='line_3861'>      the esteem and confidence of the Moslems: during a siege of six</a>
<a id='line_3862'>      weeks his water and provisions were intercepted, and the feeble</a>
<a id='line_3863'>      gates of the palace were protected only by the scruples of the</a>
<a id='line_3864'>      more timorous rebels. Forsaken by those who had abused his</a>
<a id='line_3865'>      simplicity, the hopeless and venerable caliph expected the</a>
<a id='line_3866'>      approach of death: the brother of Ayesha marched at the head of</a>
<a id='line_3867'>      the assassins; and Othman, with the Koran in his lap, was pierced</a>
<a id='line_3868'>      with a multitude of wounds. 1731 A tumultuous anarchy of five</a>
<a id='line_3869'>      days was appeased by the inauguration of Ali: his refusal would</a>
<a id='line_3870'>      have provoked a general massacre. In this painful situation he</a>
<a id='line_3871'>      supported the becoming pride of the chief of the Hashemites;</a>
<a id='line_3872'>      declared that he had rather serve than reign; rebuked the</a>
<a id='line_3873'>      presumption of the strangers; and required the formal, if not the</a>
<a id='line_3874'>      voluntary, assent of the chiefs of the nation. He has never been</a>
<a id='line_3875'>      accused of prompting the assassin of Omar; though Persia</a>
<a id='line_3876'>      indiscreetly celebrates the festival of that holy martyr. The</a>
<a id='line_3877'>      quarrel between Othman and his subjects was assuaged by the early</a>
<a id='line_3878'>      mediation of Ali; and Hassan, the eldest of his sons, was</a>
<a id='line_3879'>      insulted and wounded in the defence of the caliph. Yet it is</a>
<a id='line_3880'>      doubtful whether the father of Hassan was strenuous and sincere</a>
<a id='line_3881'>      in his opposition to the rebels; and it is certain that he</a>
<a id='line_3882'>      enjoyed the benefit of their crime. The temptation was indeed of</a>
<a id='line_3883'>      such magnitude as might stagger and corrupt the most obdurate</a>

<a id='line_3930'>      enemies, perhaps the assassins, of Othman now demanded vengeance</a>
<a id='line_3931'>      for his blood. They were accompanied in their flight by Ayesha,</a>

<a id='line_3933'>      life, an implacable hatred against the husband and the posterity</a>
<a id='line_3934'>      of Fatima. The most reasonable Moslems were scandalized, that the</a>
<a id='line_3935'>      mother of the faithful should expose in a camp her person and</a>
<a id='line_3936'>      character; 1733 but the superstitious crowd was confident that</a>
<a id='line_3937'>      her presence would sanctify the justice, and assure the success,</a>
<a id='line_3938'>      of their cause. At the head of twenty thousand of his loyal</a>
<a id='line_3939'>      Arabs, and nine thousand valiant auxiliaries of Cufa, the caliph</a>
<a id='line_3940'>      encountered and defeated the superior numbers of the rebels under</a>
<a id='line_3941'>      the walls of Bassora. 1734 Their leaders, Telha and Zobeir, 1735</a>
<a id='line_3942'>      were slain in the first battle that stained with civil blood the</a>
<a id='line_3943'>      arms of the Moslems. 1736 After passing through the ranks to</a>
<a id='line_3944'>      animate the troops, Ayesha had chosen her post amidst the dangers</a>
<a id='line_3945'>      of the field. In the heat of the action, seventy men, who held</a>
<a id='line_3946'>      the bridle of her camel, were successively killed or wounded; and</a>
<a id='line_3947'>      the cage or litter, in which she sat, was stuck with javelins and</a>
<a id='line_3948'>      darts like the quills of a porcupine. The venerable captive</a>
<a id='line_3949'>      sustained with firmness the reproaches of the conqueror, and was</a>
<a id='line_3950'>      speedily dismissed to her proper station at the tomb of Mahomet,</a>
<a id='line_3951'>      with the respect and tenderness that was still due to the widow</a>
<a id='line_3952'>      of the apostle. 1737 After this victory, which was styled the Day</a>
<a id='line_3953'>      of the Camel, Ali marched against a more formidable adversary;</a>
<a id='line_3954'>      against Moawiyah, the son of Abu Sophian, who had assumed the</a>
<a id='line_3955'>      title of caliph, and whose claim was supported by the forces of</a>
<a id='line_3956'>      Syria and the interest of the house of Ommiyah. From the passage</a>
<a id='line_3957'>      of Thapsacus, the plain of Siffin 174 extends along the western</a>
<a id='line_3958'>      bank of the Euphrates. On this spacious and level theatre, the</a>
<a id='line_3959'>      two competitors waged a desultory war of one hundred and ten</a>
<a id='line_3960'>      days. In the course of ninety actions or skirmishes, the loss of</a>
<a id='line_3961'>      Ali was estimated at twenty-five, that of Moawiyah at forty-five,</a>
<a id='line_3962'>      thousand soldiers; and the list of the slain was dignified with</a>
<a id='line_3963'>      the names of five-and-twenty veterans who had fought at Beder</a>
<a id='line_3964'>      under the standard of Mahomet. In this sanguinary contest the</a>
<a id='line_3965'>      lawful caliph displayed a superior character of valor and</a>
<a id='line_3966'>      humanity. 1741 His troops were strictly enjoined to await the</a>
<a id='line_3967'>      first onset of the enemy, to spare their flying brethren, and to</a>
<a id='line_3968'>      respect the bodies of the dead, and the chastity of the female</a>
<a id='line_3969'>      captives. He generously proposed to save the blood of the Moslems</a>
<a id='line_3970'>      by a single combat; but his trembling rival declined the</a>
<a id='line_3971'>      challenge as a sentence of inevitable death. The ranks of the</a>
<a id='line_3972'>      Syrians were broken by the charge of a hero who was mounted on a</a>
<a id='line_3973'>      piebald horse, and wielded with irresistible force his ponderous</a>
<a id='line_3974'>      and two-edged sword. As often as he smote a rebel, he shouted the</a>
<a id='line_3975'>      Allah Acbar, “God is victorious!” and in the tumult of a</a>
<a id='line_3976'>      nocturnal battle, he was heard to repeat four hundred times that</a>
<a id='line_3977'>      tremendous exclamation. The prince of Damascus already meditated</a>
<a id='line_3978'>      his flight; but the certain victory was snatched from the grasp</a>
<a id='line_3979'>      of Ali by the disobedience and enthusiasm of his troops. Their</a>
<a id='line_3980'>      conscience was awed by the solemn appeal to the books of the</a>
<a id='line_3981'>      Koran which Moawiyah exposed on the foremost lances; and Ali was</a>
<a id='line_3982'>      compelled to yield to a disgraceful truce and an insidious</a>
<a id='line_3983'>      compromise. He retreated with sorrow and indignation to Cufa; his</a>
<a id='line_3984'>      party was discouraged; the distant provinces of Persia, of Yemen,</a>
<a id='line_3985'>      and of Egypt, were subdued or seduced by his crafty rival; and</a>
<a id='line_3986'>      the stroke of fanaticism, which was aimed against the three</a>
<a id='line_3987'>      chiefs of the nation, was fatal only to the cousin of Mahomet. In</a>
<a id='line_3988'>      the temple of Mecca, three Charegites or enthusiasts discoursed</a>
<a id='line_3989'>      of the disorders of the church and state: they soon agreed, that</a>
<a id='line_3990'>      the deaths of Ali, of Moawiyah, and of his friend Amrou, the</a>
<a id='line_3991'>      viceroy of Egypt, would restore the peace and unity of religion.</a>
<a id='line_3992'>      Each of the assassins chose his victim, poisoned his dagger,</a>
<a id='line_3993'>      devoted his life, and secretly repaired to the scene of action.</a>
<a id='line_3994'>      Their resolution was equally desperate: but the first mistook the</a>
<a id='line_3995'>      person of Amrou, and stabbed the deputy who occupied his seat;</a>
<a id='line_3996'>      the prince of Damascus was dangerously hurt by the second; the</a>
<a id='line_3997'>      lawful caliph, in the mosch of Cufa, received a mortal wound from</a>

<a id='line_4132'>      inherited a remnant of his father’s spirit, and served with honor</a>
<a id='line_4133'>      against the Christians in the siege of Constantinople. The</a>
<a id='line_4134'>      primogeniture of the line of Hashem, and the holy character of</a>

<a id='line_4140'>      professed their attachment to his cause, and who were eager to</a>
<a id='line_4141'>      draw their swords so soon as he should appear on the banks of the</a>
<a id='line_4142'>      Euphrates. Against the advice of his wisest friends, he resolved</a>
<a id='line_4143'>      to trust his person and family in the hands of a perfidious</a>
<a id='line_4144'>      people. He traversed the desert of Arabia with a timorous retinue</a>
<a id='line_4145'>      of women and children; but as he approached the confines of Irak</a>
<a id='line_4146'>      he was alarmed by the solitary or hostile face of the country,</a>
<a id='line_4147'>      and suspected either the defection or ruin of his party. His</a>
<a id='line_4148'>      fears were just: Obeidollah, the governor of Cufa, had</a>
<a id='line_4149'>      extinguished the first sparks of an insurrection; and Hosein, in</a>
<a id='line_4150'>      the plain of Kerbela, was encompassed by a body of five thousand</a>
<a id='line_4151'>      horse, who intercepted his communication with the city and the</a>
<a id='line_4152'>      river. He might still have escaped to a fortress in the desert,</a>
<a id='line_4153'>      that had defied the power of Caesar and Chosroes, and confided in</a>
<a id='line_4154'>      the fidelity of the tribe of Tai, which would have armed ten</a>

<a id='line_4156'></a>
<a id='line_4157'>      In a conference with the chief of the enemy, he proposed the</a>
<a id='line_4158'>      option of three honorable conditions: that he should be allowed</a>

<a id='line_4160'>      against the Turks, or safely conducted to the presence of Yezid.</a>
<a id='line_4161'>      But the commands of the caliph, or his lieutenant, were stern and</a>
<a id='line_4162'>      absolute; and Hosein was informed that he must either submit as a</a>
<a id='line_4163'>      captive and a criminal to the commander of the faithful, or</a>
<a id='line_4164'>      expect the consequences of his rebellion. “Do you think,” replied</a>
<a id='line_4165'>      he, “to terrify me with death?” And, during the short respite of</a>
<a id='line_4166'>      a night, 1781 he prepared with calm and solemn resignation to</a>
<a id='line_4167'>      encounter his fate. He checked the lamentations of his sister</a>
<a id='line_4168'>      Fatima, who deplored the impending ruin of his house. “Our</a>
<a id='line_4169'>      trust,” said Hosein, “is in God alone. All things, both in heaven</a>
<a id='line_4170'>      and earth, must perish and return to their Creator. My brother,</a>
<a id='line_4171'>      my father, my mother, were better than me, and every Mussulman</a>
<a id='line_4172'>      has an example in the prophet.” He pressed his friends to consult</a>
<a id='line_4173'>      their safety by a timely flight: they unanimously refused to</a>
<a id='line_4174'>      desert or survive their beloved master: and their courage was</a>
<a id='line_4175'>      fortified by a fervent prayer and the assurance of paradise. On</a>
<a id='line_4176'>      the morning of the fatal day, he mounted on horseback, with his</a>
<a id='line_4177'>      sword in one hand and the Koran in the other: his generous band</a>
<a id='line_4178'>      of martyrs consisted only of thirty-two horse and forty foot; but</a>
<a id='line_4179'>      their flanks and rear were secured by the tent-ropes, and by a</a>
<a id='line_4180'>      deep trench which they had filled with lighted fagots, according</a>
<a id='line_4181'>      to the practice of the Arabs. The enemy advanced with reluctance,</a>
<a id='line_4182'>      and one of their chiefs deserted, with thirty followers, to claim</a>
<a id='line_4183'>      the partnership of inevitable death. In every close onset, or</a>
<a id='line_4184'>      single combat, the despair of the Fatimites was invincible; but</a>
<a id='line_4185'>      the surrounding multitudes galled them from a distance with a</a>
<a id='line_4186'>      cloud of arrows, and the horses and men were successively slain;</a>
<a id='line_4187'>      a truce was allowed on both sides for the hour of prayer; and the</a>
<a id='line_4188'>      battle at length expired by the death of the last companions of</a>
<a id='line_4189'>      Hosein. Alone, weary, and wounded, he seated himself at the door</a>
<a id='line_4190'>      of his tent. As he tasted a drop of water, he was pierced in the</a>
<a id='line_4191'>      mouth with a dart; and his son and nephew, two beautiful youths,</a>
<a id='line_4192'>      were killed in his arms. He lifted his hands to heaven; they were</a>
<a id='line_4193'>      full of blood; and he uttered a funeral prayer for the living and</a>
<a id='line_4194'>      the dead. In a transport of despair his sister issued from the</a>
<a id='line_4195'>      tent, and adjured the general of the Cufians, that he would not</a>
<a id='line_4196'>      suffer Hosein to be murdered before his eyes: a tear trickled</a>
<a id='line_4197'>      down his venerable beard; and the boldest of his soldiers fell</a>
<a id='line_4198'>      back on every side as the dying hero threw himself among them.</a>
<a id='line_4199'>      The remorseless Shamer, a name detested by the faithful,</a>
<a id='line_4200'>      reproached their cowardice; and the grandson of Mahomet was slain</a>
<a id='line_4201'>      with three-and-thirty strokes of lances and swords. After they</a>
<a id='line_4202'>      had trampled on his body, they carried his head to the castle of</a>
<a id='line_4203'>      Cufa, and the inhuman Obeidollah struck him on the mouth with a</a>
<a id='line_4204'>      cane: “Alas,” exclaimed an aged Mussulman, “on these lips have I</a>

<a id='line_4359'>      the East, a hundred fortunate usurpers have arisen from a baser</a>
<a id='line_4360'>      origin, surmounted more formidable obstacles, and filled a larger</a>
<a id='line_4361'>      scope of empire and conquest. Mahomet was alike instructed to</a>
<a id='line_4362'>      preach and to fight; and the union of these opposite qualities,</a>
<a id='line_4363'>      while it enhanced his merit, contributed to his success: the</a>

<a id='line_4365'>      continually acted on each other, till every barrier yielded to</a>

<a id='line_4367'>      and victory, to arms and rapine, to the indulgence of their</a>
<a id='line_4368'>      darling passions in this world and the other: the restraints</a>
<a id='line_4369'>      which he imposed were requisite to establish the credit of the</a>
<a id='line_4370'>      prophet, and to exercise the obedience of the people; and the</a>
<a id='line_4371'>      only objection to his success was his rational creed of the unity</a>
<a id='line_4372'>      and perfections of God. It is not the propagation, but the</a>
<a id='line_4373'>      permanency, of his religion, that deserves our wonder: the same</a>
<a id='line_4374'>      pure and perfect impression which he engraved at Mecca and</a>
<a id='line_4375'>      Medina, is preserved, after the revolutions of twelve centuries,</a>
<a id='line_4376'>      by the Indian, the African, and the Turkish proselytes of the</a>
<a id='line_4377'>      Koran. If the Christian apostles, St. Peter or St. Paul, could</a>
<a id='line_4378'>      return to the Vatican, they might possibly inquire the name of</a>
<a id='line_4379'>      the Deity who is worshipped with such mysterious rites in that</a>
<a id='line_4380'>      magnificent temple: at Oxford or Geneva, they would experience</a>
<a id='line_4381'>      less surprise; but it might still be incumbent on them to peruse</a>
<a id='line_4382'>      the catechism of the church, and to study the orthodox</a>
<a id='line_4383'>      commentators on their own writings and the words of their Master.</a>
<a id='line_4384'>      But the Turkish dome of St. Sophia, with an increase of splendor</a>
<a id='line_4385'>      and size, represents the humble tabernacle erected at Medina by</a>
<a id='line_4386'>      the hands of Mahomet. The Mahometans have uniformly withstood the</a>
<a id='line_4387'>      temptation of reducing the object of their faith and devotion to</a>
<a id='line_4388'>      a level with the senses and imagination of man. “I believe in one</a>
<a id='line_4389'>      God, and Mahomet the apostle of God,” is the simple and</a>
<a id='line_4390'>      invariable profession of Islam. The intellectual image of the</a>
<a id='line_4391'>      Deity has never been degraded by any visible idol; the honors of</a>
<a id='line_4392'>      the prophet have never transgressed the measure of human virtue;</a>
<a id='line_4393'>      and his living precepts have restrained the gratitude of his</a>
<a id='line_4394'>      disciples within the bounds of reason and religion. The votaries</a>
<a id='line_4395'>      of Ali have, indeed, consecrated the memory of their hero, his</a>
<a id='line_4396'>      wife, and his children; and some of the Persian doctors pretend</a>
<a id='line_4397'>      that the divine essence was incarnate in the person of the Imams;</a>
<a id='line_4398'>      but their superstition is universally condemned by the Sonnites;</a>
<a id='line_4399'>      and their impiety has afforded a seasonable warning against the</a>
<a id='line_4400'>      worship of saints and martyrs. The metaphysical questions on the</a>
<a id='line_4401'>      attributes of God, and the liberty of man, have been agitated in</a>
<a id='line_4402'>      the schools of the Mahometans, as well as in those of the</a>
<a id='line_4403'>      Christians; but among the former they have never engaged the</a>
<a id='line_4404'>      passions of the people, or disturbed the tranquillity of the</a>
<a id='line_4405'>      state. The cause of this important difference may be found in the</a>
<a id='line_4406'>      separation or union of the regal and sacerdotal characters. It</a>
<a id='line_4407'>      was the interest of the caliphs, the successors of the prophet</a>
<a id='line_4408'>      and commanders of the faithful, to repress and discourage all</a>
<a id='line_4409'>      religious innovations: the order, the discipline, the temporal</a>
<a id='line_4410'>      and spiritual ambition of the clergy, are unknown to the Moslems;</a>
<a id='line_4411'>      and the sages of the law are the guides of their conscience and</a>
<a id='line_4412'>      the oracles of their faith. From the Atlantic to the Ganges, the</a>
<a id='line_4413'>      Koran is acknowledged as the fundamental code, not only of</a>
<a id='line_4414'>      theology, but of civil and criminal jurisprudence; and the laws</a>
<a id='line_4415'>      which regulate the actions and the property of mankind are</a>
<a id='line_4416'>      guarded by the infallible and immutable sanction of the will of</a>
<a id='line_4417'>      God. This religious servitude is attended with some practical</a>
<a id='line_4418'>      disadvantage; the illiterate legislator had been often misled by</a>
<a id='line_4419'>      his own prejudices and those of his country; and the institutions</a>
<a id='line_4420'>      of the Arabian desert may be ill adapted to the wealth and</a>
<a id='line_4421'>      numbers of Ispahan and Constantinople. On these occasions, the</a>
<a id='line_4422'>      Cadhi respectfully places on his head the holy volume, and</a>
<a id='line_4423'>      substitutes a dexterous interpretation more apposite to the</a>
<a id='line_4424'>      principles of equity, and the manners and policy of the times.</a>
<a id='line_4425'></a>
<a id='line_4426'>      His beneficial or pernicious influence on the public happiness is</a>
<a id='line_4427'>      the last consideration in the character of Mahomet. The most</a>
<a id='line_4428'>      bitter or most bigoted of his Christian or Jewish foes will</a>
<a id='line_4429'>      surely allow that he assumed a false commission to inculcate a</a>
<a id='line_4430'>      salutary doctrine, less perfect only than their own. He piously</a>
<a id='line_4431'>      supposed, as the basis of his religion, the truth and sanctity of</a>
<a id='line_4432'>      their prior revolutions, the virtues and miracles of their</a>
<a id='line_4433'>      founders. The idols of Arabia were broken before the throne of</a>
<a id='line_4434'>      God; the blood of human victims was expiated by prayer, and</a>
<a id='line_4435'>      fasting, and alms, the laudable or innocent arts of devotion; and</a>
<a id='line_4436'>      his rewards and punishments of a future life were painted by the</a>
<a id='line_4437'>      images most congenial to an ignorant and carnal generation.</a>
<a id='line_4438'>      Mahomet was, perhaps, incapable of dictating a moral and</a>
<a id='line_4439'>      political system for the use of his countrymen: but he breathed</a>
<a id='line_4440'>      among the faithful a spirit of charity and friendship;</a>
<a id='line_4441'>      recommended the practice of the social virtues; and checked, by</a>
<a id='line_4442'>      his laws and precepts, the thirst of revenge, and the oppression</a>
<a id='line_4443'>      of widows and orphans. The hostile tribes were united in faith</a>
<a id='line_4444'>      and obedience, and the valor which had been idly spent in</a>
<a id='line_4445'>      domestic quarrels was vigorously directed against a foreign</a>
<a id='line_4446'>      enemy. Had the impulse been less powerful, Arabia, free at home</a>
<a id='line_4447'>      and formidable abroad, might have flourished under a succession</a>
<a id='line_4448'>      of her native monarchs. Her sovereignty was lost by the extent</a>
<a id='line_4449'>      and rapidity of conquest. The colonies of the nation were</a>
<a id='line_4450'>      scattered over the East and West, and their blood was mingled</a>
<a id='line_4451'>      with the blood of their converts and captives. After the reign of</a>
<a id='line_4452'>      three caliphs, the throne was transported from Medina to the</a>
<a id='line_4453'>      valley of Damascus and the banks of the Tigris; the holy cities</a>
<a id='line_4454'>      were violated by impious war; Arabia was ruled by the rod of a</a>
<a id='line_4455'>      subject, perhaps of a stranger; and the Bedoweens of the desert,</a>
<a id='line_4456'>      awakening from their dream of dominion, resumed their old and</a>
<a id='line_4457'>      solitary independence. 187</a>
