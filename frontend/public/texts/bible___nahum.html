<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.</a>
<a id='line_4'></a>
<a id='line_5'>1:2 God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is</a>
<a id='line_6'>furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he</a>
<a id='line_7'>reserveth wrath for his enemies.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>1:3 The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all</a>
<a id='line_10'>acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the</a>
<a id='line_11'>storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.</a>
<a id='line_12'></a>
<a id='line_13'>1:4 He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the</a>
<a id='line_14'>rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon</a>
<a id='line_15'>languisheth.</a>
<a id='line_16'></a>
<a id='line_17'>1:5 The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is</a>
<a id='line_18'>burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.</a>
<a id='line_19'></a>
<a id='line_20'>1:6 Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the</a>
<a id='line_21'>fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the</a>
<a id='line_22'>rocks are thrown down by him.</a>
<a id='line_23'></a>
<a id='line_24'>1:7 The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he</a>
<a id='line_25'>knoweth them that trust in him.</a>
<a id='line_26'></a>
<a id='line_27'>1:8 But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the</a>
<a id='line_28'>place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>1:9 What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end:</a>
<a id='line_31'>affliction shall not rise up the second time.</a>
<a id='line_32'></a>
<a id='line_33'>1:10 For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are</a>
<a id='line_34'>drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.</a>
<a id='line_35'></a>
<a id='line_36'>1:11 There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the</a>
<a id='line_37'>LORD, a wicked counsellor.</a>
<a id='line_38'></a>
<a id='line_39'>1:12 Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet</a>
<a id='line_40'>thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have</a>
<a id='line_41'>afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>1:13 For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy</a>
<a id='line_44'>bonds in sunder.</a>
<a id='line_45'></a>
<a id='line_46'>1:14 And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no</a>
<a id='line_47'>more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off</a>
<a id='line_48'>the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou</a>
<a id='line_49'>art vile.</a>
<a id='line_50'></a>
<a id='line_51'>1:15 Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good</a>
<a id='line_52'>tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts,</a>
<a id='line_53'>perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he</a>
<a id='line_54'>is utterly cut off.</a>
<a id='line_55'></a>
<a id='line_56'>2:1 He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the</a>
<a id='line_57'>munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power</a>
<a id='line_58'>mightily.</a>
<a id='line_59'></a>
<a id='line_60'>2:2 For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the</a>
<a id='line_61'>excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and</a>
<a id='line_62'>marred their vine branches.</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>2:3 The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in</a>
<a id='line_65'>scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his</a>
<a id='line_66'>preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.</a>
<a id='line_67'></a>
<a id='line_68'>2:4 The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one</a>
<a id='line_69'>against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they</a>
<a id='line_70'>shall run like the lightnings.</a>
<a id='line_71'></a>
<a id='line_72'>2:5 He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk;</a>
<a id='line_73'>they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be</a>
<a id='line_74'>prepared.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>2:6 The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be</a>
<a id='line_77'>dissolved.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>2:7 And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and</a>
<a id='line_80'>her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, tabering upon</a>
<a id='line_81'>their breasts.</a>
<a id='line_82'></a>
<a id='line_83'>2:8 But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee</a>
<a id='line_84'>away.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look back.</a>
<a id='line_87'></a>
<a id='line_88'>2:9 Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is</a>
<a id='line_89'>none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture.</a>
<a id='line_90'></a>
<a id='line_91'>2:10 She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the</a>
<a id='line_92'>knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of</a>
<a id='line_93'>them all gather blackness.</a>
<a id='line_94'></a>
<a id='line_95'>2:11 Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the</a>
<a id='line_96'>young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lionâ€™s</a>
<a id='line_97'>whelp, and none made them afraid?  2:12 The lion did tear in pieces</a>
<a id='line_98'>enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his</a>
<a id='line_99'>holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>2:13 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will</a>
<a id='line_102'>burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young</a>
<a id='line_103'>lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of</a>
<a id='line_104'>thy messengers shall no more be heard.</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>3:1 Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery; the</a>
<a id='line_107'>prey departeth not; 3:2 The noise of a whip, and the noise of the</a>
<a id='line_108'>rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping</a>
<a id='line_109'>chariots.</a>
<a id='line_110'></a>
<a id='line_111'>3:3 The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering</a>
<a id='line_112'>spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a great number of</a>
<a id='line_113'>carcases; and there is none end of their corpses; they stumble upon</a>
<a id='line_114'>their corpses: 3:4 Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the</a>
<a id='line_115'>wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations</a>
<a id='line_116'>through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.</a>
<a id='line_117'></a>
<a id='line_118'>3:5 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will</a>
<a id='line_119'>discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy</a>
<a id='line_120'>nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>3:6 And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile,</a>
<a id='line_123'>and will set thee as a gazingstock.</a>
<a id='line_124'></a>
<a id='line_125'>3:7 And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall</a>
<a id='line_126'>flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her?</a>
<a id='line_127'>whence shall I seek comforters for thee?  3:8 Art thou better than</a>
<a id='line_128'>populous No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters</a>
<a id='line_129'>round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the</a>
<a id='line_130'>sea?  3:9 Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite;</a>
<a id='line_131'>Put and Lubim were thy helpers.</a>
<a id='line_132'></a>
<a id='line_133'>3:10 Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young</a>
<a id='line_134'>children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and</a>
<a id='line_135'>they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were</a>
<a id='line_136'>bound in chains.</a>
<a id='line_137'></a>
<a id='line_138'>3:11 Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt</a>
<a id='line_139'>seek strength because of the enemy.</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>3:12 All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe</a>
<a id='line_142'>figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the</a>
<a id='line_143'>eater.</a>
<a id='line_144'></a>
<a id='line_145'>3:13 Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates of</a>
<a id='line_146'>thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall</a>
<a id='line_147'>devour thy bars.</a>
<a id='line_148'></a>
<a id='line_149'>3:14 Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into</a>
<a id='line_150'>clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.</a>
<a id='line_151'></a>
<a id='line_152'>3:15 There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off,</a>
<a id='line_153'>it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the</a>
<a id='line_154'>cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.</a>
<a id='line_155'></a>
<a id='line_156'>3:16 Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the</a>
<a id='line_157'>cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away.</a>
<a id='line_158'></a>
<a id='line_159'>3:17 Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great</a>
<a id='line_160'>grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the</a>
<a id='line_161'>sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they</a>
<a id='line_162'>are.</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>3:18 Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell</a>
<a id='line_165'>in the dust: thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man</a>
<a id='line_166'>gathereth them.</a>
<a id='line_167'></a>
<a id='line_168'>3:19 There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all</a>
<a id='line_169'>that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon</a>
<a id='line_170'>whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
