<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>      The division of the Roman world between the sons of Theodosius</a>
<a id='line_10'>      marks the final establishment of the empire of the East, which,</a>
<a id='line_11'>      from the reign of Arcadius to the taking of Constantinople by the</a>
<a id='line_12'>      Turks, subsisted one thousand and fifty-eight years, in a state</a>
<a id='line_13'>      of premature and perpetual decay. The sovereign of that empire</a>
<a id='line_14'>      assumed, and obstinately retained, the vain, and at length</a>
<a id='line_15'>      fictitious, title of Emperor of the Romans; and the hereditary</a>
<a id='line_16'>      appellation of Caesar and Augustus continued to declare, that he</a>
<a id='line_17'>      was the legitimate successor of the first of men, who had reigned</a>
<a id='line_18'>      over the first of nations. The place of Constantinople rivalled,</a>
<a id='line_19'>      and perhaps excelled, the magnificence of Persia; and the</a>
<a id='line_20'>      eloquent sermons of St. Chrysostom 1 celebrate, while they</a>
<a id='line_21'>      condemn, the pompous luxury of the reign of Arcadius. “The</a>
<a id='line_22'>      emperor,” says he, “wears on his head either a diadem, or a crown</a>
<a id='line_23'>      of gold, decorated with precious stones of inestimable value.</a>
<a id='line_24'>      These ornaments, and his purple garments, are reserved for his</a>
<a id='line_25'>      sacred person alone; and his robes of silk are embroidered with</a>
<a id='line_26'>      the figures of golden dragons. His throne is of massy gold.</a>
<a id='line_27'>      Whenever he appears in public, he is surrounded by his courtiers,</a>
<a id='line_28'>      his guards, and his attendants. Their spears, their shields,</a>
<a id='line_29'>      their cuirasses, the bridles and trappings of their horses, have</a>
<a id='line_30'>      either the substance or the appearance of gold; and the large</a>
<a id='line_31'>      splendid boss in the midst of their shield is encircled with</a>
<a id='line_32'>      smaller bosses, which represent the shape of the human eye. The</a>
<a id='line_33'>      two mules that drew the chariot of the monarch are perfectly</a>
<a id='line_34'>      white, and shining all over with gold. The chariot itself, of</a>
<a id='line_35'>      pure and solid gold, attracts the admiration of the spectators,</a>
<a id='line_36'>      who contemplate the purple curtains, the snowy carpet, the size</a>
<a id='line_37'>      of the precious stones, and the resplendent plates of gold, that</a>
<a id='line_38'>      glitter as they are agitated by the motion of the carriage. The</a>
<a id='line_39'>      Imperial pictures are white, on a blue ground; the emperor</a>
<a id='line_40'>      appears seated on his throne, with his arms, his horses, and his</a>
<a id='line_41'>      guards beside him; and his vanquished enemies in chains at his</a>
<a id='line_42'>      feet.” The successors of Constantine established their perpetual</a>
<a id='line_43'>      residence in the royal city, which he had erected on the verge of</a>
<a id='line_44'>      Europe and Asia. Inaccessible to the menaces of their enemies,</a>
<a id='line_45'>      and perhaps to the complaints of their people, they received,</a>
<a id='line_46'>      with each wind, the tributary productions of every climate; while</a>
<a id='line_47'>      the impregnable strength of their capital continued for ages to</a>
<a id='line_48'>      defy the hostile attempts of the Barbarians. Their dominions were</a>
<a id='line_49'>      bounded by the Adriatic and the Tigris; and the whole interval of</a>
<a id='line_50'>      twenty-five days’ navigation, which separated the extreme cold of</a>
<a id='line_51'>      Scythia from the torrid zone of Æthiopia, 2 was comprehended</a>
<a id='line_52'>      within the limits of the empire of the East. The populous</a>
<a id='line_53'>      countries of that empire were the seat of art and learning, of</a>
<a id='line_54'>      luxury and wealth; and the inhabitants, who had assumed the</a>
<a id='line_55'>      language and manners of Greeks, styled themselves, with some</a>
<a id='line_56'>      appearance of truth, the most enlightened and civilized portion</a>
<a id='line_57'>      of the human species. The form of government was a pure and</a>
<a id='line_58'>      simple monarchy; the name of the Roman Republic, which so long</a>
<a id='line_59'>      preserved a faint tradition of freedom, was confined to the Latin</a>
<a id='line_60'>      provinces; and the princes of Constantinople measured their</a>
<a id='line_61'>      greatness by the servile obedience of their people. They were</a>
<a id='line_62'>      ignorant how much this passive disposition enervates and degrades</a>
<a id='line_63'>      every faculty of the mind. The subjects, who had resigned their</a>
<a id='line_64'>      will to the absolute commands of a master, were equally incapable</a>
<a id='line_65'>      of guarding their lives and fortunes against the assaults of the</a>
<a id='line_66'>      Barbarians, or of defending their reason from the terrors of</a>
<a id='line_67'>      superstition.</a>

<a id='line_90'></a>
<a id='line_91'>      The first events of the reign of Arcadius and Honorius are so</a>
<a id='line_92'>      intimately connected, that the rebellion of the Goths, and the</a>
<a id='line_93'>      fall of Rufinus, have already claimed a place in the history of</a>
<a id='line_94'>      the West. It has already been observed, that Eutropius, 3 one of</a>
<a id='line_95'>      the principal eunuchs of the palace of Constantinople, succeeded</a>
<a id='line_96'>      the haughty minister whose ruin he had accomplished, and whose</a>
<a id='line_97'>      vices he soon imitated. Every order of the state bowed to the new</a>
<a id='line_98'>      favorite; and their tame and obsequious submission encouraged him</a>
<a id='line_99'>      to insult the laws, and, what is still more difficult and</a>
<a id='line_100'>      dangerous, the manners of his country. Under the weakest of the</a>
<a id='line_101'>      predecessors of Arcadius, the reign of the eunuchs had been</a>
<a id='line_102'>      secret and almost invisible. They insinuated themselves into the</a>
<a id='line_103'>      confidence of the prince; but their ostensible functions were</a>
<a id='line_104'>      confined to the menial service of the wardrobe and Imperial</a>
<a id='line_105'>      bed-chamber. They might direct, in a whisper, the public</a>
<a id='line_106'>      counsels, and blast, by their malicious suggestions, the fame and</a>
<a id='line_107'>      fortunes of the most illustrious citizens; but they never</a>
<a id='line_108'>      presumed to stand forward in the front of empire, 4 or to profane</a>
<a id='line_109'>      the public honors of the state. Eutropius was the first of his</a>
<a id='line_110'>      artificial sex, who dared to assume the character of a Roman</a>
<a id='line_111'>      magistrate and general. Sometimes, in the presence of the</a>
<a id='line_112'>      blushing senate, he ascended the tribunal to pronounce judgment,</a>
<a id='line_113'>      or to repeat elaborate harangues; and, sometimes, appeared on</a>
<a id='line_114'>      horseback, at the head of his troops, in the dress and armor of a</a>
<a id='line_115'>      hero. The disregard of custom and decency always betrays a weak</a>
<a id='line_116'>      and ill-regulated mind; nor does Eutropius seem to have</a>
<a id='line_117'>      compensated for the folly of the design by any superior merit or</a>
<a id='line_118'>      ability in the execution. His former habits of life had not</a>
<a id='line_119'>      introduced him to the study of the laws, or the exercises of the</a>
<a id='line_120'>      field; his awkward and unsuccessful attempts provoked the secret</a>
<a id='line_121'>      contempt of the spectators; the Goths expressed their wish that</a>
<a id='line_122'>      such a general might always command the armies of Rome; and the</a>
<a id='line_123'>      name of the minister was branded with ridicule, more pernicious,</a>
<a id='line_124'>      perhaps, than hatred, to a public character. The subjects of</a>
<a id='line_125'>      Arcadius were exasperated by the recollection, that this deformed</a>
<a id='line_126'>      and decrepit eunuch, 6 who so perversely mimicked the actions of</a>
<a id='line_127'>      a man, was born in the most abject condition of servitude; that</a>
<a id='line_128'>      before he entered the Imperial palace, he had been successively</a>
<a id='line_129'>      sold and purchased by a hundred masters, who had exhausted his</a>
<a id='line_130'>      youthful strength in every mean and infamous office, and at</a>
<a id='line_131'>      length dismissed him, in his old age, to freedom and poverty. 7</a>
<a id='line_132'>      While these disgraceful stories were circulated, and perhaps</a>
<a id='line_133'>      exaggerated, in private conversation, the vanity of the favorite</a>
<a id='line_134'>      was flattered with the most extraordinary honors. In the senate,</a>
<a id='line_135'>      in the capital, in the provinces, the statues of Eutropius were</a>
<a id='line_136'>      erected, in brass, or marble, decorated with the symbols of his</a>
<a id='line_137'>      civil and military virtues, and inscribed with the pompous title</a>
<a id='line_138'>      of the third founder of Constantinople. He was promoted to the</a>
<a id='line_139'>      rank of patrician, which began to signify in a popular, and even</a>
<a id='line_140'>      legal, acceptation, the father of the emperor; and the last year</a>
<a id='line_141'>      of the fourth century was polluted by the consulship of a eunuch</a>
<a id='line_142'>      and a slave. This strange and inexpiable prodigy 8 awakened,</a>
<a id='line_143'>      however, the prejudices of the Romans. The effeminate consul was</a>
<a id='line_144'>      rejected by the West, as an indelible stain to the annals of the</a>
<a id='line_145'>      republic; and without invoking the shades of Brutus and Camillus,</a>
<a id='line_146'>      the colleague of Eutropius, a learned and respectable magistrate,</a>
<a id='line_147'>      9 sufficiently represented the different maxims of the two</a>
<a id='line_148'>      administrations.</a>

<a id='line_153'>      other productions, (Baillet Jugemens des Savans, tom. iv. p.</a>
<a id='line_154'>      227.) They are indeed a very elegant and spirited satire; and</a>
<a id='line_155'>      would be more valuable in an historical light, if the invective</a>
<a id='line_156'>      were less vague and more temperate.]</a>

<a id='line_158'>      4 (return) [ After lamenting the progress of the eunuchs in the</a>
<a id='line_159'>      Roman palace, and defining their proper functions, Claudian adds,</a>

<a id='line_182'>      paint was washed away the face of Eutropius appeared more ugly</a>
<a id='line_183'>      and wrinkled than that of an old woman. Claudian remarks, (i.</a>
<a id='line_184'>      469,) and the remark must have been founded on experience, that</a>
<a id='line_185'>      there was scarcely an interval between the youth and the decrepit</a>

<a id='line_190'>      describes, were these: 1. He spent many years as the catamite of</a>
<a id='line_191'>      Ptolemy, a groom or soldier of the Imperial stables. 2. Ptolemy</a>
<a id='line_192'>      gave him to the old general Arintheus, for whom he very skilfully</a>

<a id='line_211'>      elegant panegyric.]</a>
<a id='line_212'></a>
<a id='line_213'>      The bold and vigorous mind of Rufinus seems to have been actuated</a>
<a id='line_214'>      by a more sanguinary and revengeful spirit; but the avarice of</a>
<a id='line_215'>      the eunuch was not less insatiate than that of the præfect. 10</a>
<a id='line_216'>      As long as he despoiled the oppressors, who had enriched</a>
<a id='line_217'>      themselves with the plunder of the people, Eutropius might</a>
<a id='line_218'>      gratify his covetous disposition without much envy or injustice:</a>
<a id='line_219'>      but the progress of his rapine soon invaded the wealth which had</a>
<a id='line_220'>      been acquired by lawful inheritance, or laudable industry. The</a>
<a id='line_221'>      usual methods of extortion were practised and improved; and</a>
<a id='line_222'>      Claudian has sketched a lively and original picture of the public</a>
<a id='line_223'>      auction of the state. “The impotence of the eunuch,” says that</a>
<a id='line_224'>      agreeable satirist, “has served only to stimulate his avarice:</a>
<a id='line_225'>      the same hand which in his servile condition, was exercised in</a>
<a id='line_226'>      petty thefts, to unlock the coffers of his master, now grasps the</a>
<a id='line_227'>      riches of the world; and this infamous broker of the empire</a>
<a id='line_228'>      appreciates and divides the Roman provinces from Mount Haemus to</a>
<a id='line_229'>      the Tigris. One man, at the expense of his villa, is made</a>
<a id='line_230'>      proconsul of Asia; a second purchases Syria with his wife’s</a>
<a id='line_231'>      jewels; and a third laments that he has exchanged his paternal</a>
<a id='line_232'>      estate for the government of Bithynia. In the antechamber of</a>
<a id='line_233'>      Eutropius, a large tablet is exposed to public view, which marks</a>
<a id='line_234'>      the respective prices of the provinces. The different value of</a>
<a id='line_235'>      Pontus, of Galatia, of Lydia, is accurately distinguished. Lycia</a>
<a id='line_236'>      may be obtained for so many thousand pieces of gold; but the</a>
<a id='line_237'>      opulence of Phrygia will require a more considerable sum. The</a>
<a id='line_238'>      eunuch wishes to obliterate, by the general disgrace, his</a>
<a id='line_239'>      personal ignominy; and as he has been sold himself, he is</a>
<a id='line_240'>      desirous of selling the rest of mankind. In the eager contention,</a>
<a id='line_241'>      the balance, which contains the fate and fortunes of the</a>
<a id='line_242'>      province, often trembles on the beam; and till one of the scales</a>
<a id='line_243'>      is inclined, by a superior weight, the mind of the impartial</a>
<a id='line_244'>      judge remains in anxious suspense. Such,” continues the indignant</a>
<a id='line_245'>      poet, “are the fruits of Roman valor, of the defeat of Antiochus,</a>
<a id='line_246'>      and of the triumph of Pompey.” This venal prostitution of public</a>
<a id='line_247'>      honors secured the impunity of future crimes; but the riches,</a>
<a id='line_248'>      which Eutropius derived from confiscation, were already stained</a>
<a id='line_249'>      with injustice; since it was decent to accuse, and to condemn,</a>
<a id='line_250'>      the proprietors of the wealth, which he was impatient to</a>
<a id='line_251'>      confiscate. Some noble blood was shed by the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_252'>      executioner; and the most inhospitable extremities of the empire</a>
<a id='line_253'>      were filled with innocent and illustrious exiles. Among the</a>
<a id='line_254'>      generals and consuls of the East, Abundantius 12 had reason to</a>
<a id='line_255'>      dread the first effects of the resentment of Eutropius. He had</a>
<a id='line_256'>      been guilty of the unpardonable crime of introducing that abject</a>
<a id='line_257'>      slave to the palace of Constantinople; and some degree of praise</a>
<a id='line_258'>      must be allowed to a powerful and ungrateful favorite, who was</a>
<a id='line_259'>      satisfied with the disgrace of his benefactor. Abundantius was</a>
<a id='line_260'>      stripped of his ample fortunes by an Imperial rescript, and</a>
<a id='line_261'>      banished to Pityus, on the Euxine, the last frontier of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_262'>      world; where he subsisted by the precarious mercy of the</a>
<a id='line_263'>      Barbarians, till he could obtain, after the fall of Eutropius, a</a>
<a id='line_264'>      milder exile at Sidon, in Phoenicia. The destruction of Timasius</a>
<a id='line_265'>      13 required a more serious and regular mode of attack. That great</a>
<a id='line_266'>      officer, the master-general of the armies of Theodosius, had</a>
<a id='line_267'>      signalized his valor by a decisive victory, which he obtained</a>
<a id='line_268'>      over the Goths of Thessaly; but he was too prone, after the</a>
<a id='line_269'>      example of his sovereign, to enjoy the luxury of peace, and to</a>
<a id='line_270'>      abandon his confidence to wicked and designing flatterers.</a>
<a id='line_271'>      Timasius had despised the public clamor, by promoting an infamous</a>
<a id='line_272'>      dependant to the command of a cohort; and he deserved to feel the</a>
<a id='line_273'>      ingratitude of Bargus, who was secretly instigated by the</a>
<a id='line_274'>      favorite to accuse his patron of a treasonable conspiracy. The</a>
<a id='line_275'>      general was arraigned before the tribunal of Arcadius himself;</a>
<a id='line_276'>      and the principal eunuch stood by the side of the throne to</a>
<a id='line_277'>      suggest the questions and answers of his sovereign. But as this</a>
<a id='line_278'>      form of trial might be deemed partial and arbitrary, the further</a>
<a id='line_279'>      inquiry into the crimes of Timasius was delegated to Saturninus</a>
<a id='line_280'>      and Procopius; the former of consular rank, the latter still</a>
<a id='line_281'>      respected as the father-in-law of the emperor Valens. The</a>
<a id='line_282'>      appearances of a fair and legal proceeding were maintained by the</a>
<a id='line_283'>      blunt honesty of Procopius; and he yielded with reluctance to the</a>
<a id='line_284'>      obsequious dexterity of his colleague, who pronounced a sentence</a>
<a id='line_285'>      of condemnation against the unfortunate Timasius. His immense</a>
<a id='line_286'>      riches were confiscated in the name of the emperor, and for the</a>
<a id='line_287'>      benefit of the favorite; and he was doomed to perpetual exile a</a>
<a id='line_288'>      Oasis, a solitary spot in the midst of the sandy deserts of</a>
<a id='line_289'>      Libya. 14 Secluded from all human converse, the master-general of</a>
<a id='line_290'>      the Roman armies was lost forever to the world; but the</a>
<a id='line_291'>      circumstances of his fate have been related in a various and</a>
<a id='line_292'>      contradictory manner. It is insinuated that Eutropius despatched</a>
<a id='line_293'>      a private order for his secret execution. 15 It was reported,</a>
<a id='line_294'>      that, in attempting to escape from Oasis, he perished in the</a>
<a id='line_295'>      desert, of thirst and hunger; and that his dead body was found on</a>
<a id='line_296'>      the sands of Libya. 16 It has been asserted, with more</a>
<a id='line_297'>      confidence, that his son Syagrius, after successfully eluding the</a>
<a id='line_298'>      pursuit of the agents and emissaries of the court, collected a</a>
<a id='line_299'>      band of African robbers; that he rescued Timasius from the place</a>
<a id='line_300'>      of his exile; and that both the father and the son disappeared</a>
<a id='line_301'>      from the knowledge of mankind. 17 But the ungrateful Bargus,</a>
<a id='line_302'>      instead of being suffered to possess the reward of guilt was soon</a>
<a id='line_303'>      after circumvented and destroyed, by the more powerful villany of</a>
<a id='line_304'>      the minister himself, who retained sense and spirit enough to</a>

<a id='line_370'>      and metaphorical treason is extended to protect, not only the</a>
<a id='line_371'>      illustrious officers of the state and army, who were admitted</a>

<a id='line_375'>      and indefinite list, which, under the successors of Constantine,</a>
<a id='line_376'>      included an obscure and numerous train of subordinate ministers.</a>
<a id='line_377'>      II. This extreme severity might perhaps be justified, had it been</a>
<a id='line_378'>      only directed to secure the representatives of the sovereign from</a>
<a id='line_379'>      any actual violence in the execution of their office. But the</a>
<a id='line_380'>      whole body of Imperial dependants claimed a privilege, or rather</a>
<a id='line_381'>      impunity, which screened them, in the loosest moments of their</a>
<a id='line_382'>      lives, from the hasty, perhaps the justifiable, resentment of</a>
<a id='line_383'>      their fellow-citizens; and, by a strange perversion of the laws,</a>
<a id='line_384'>      the same degree of guilt and punishment was applied to a private</a>
<a id='line_385'>      quarrel, and to a deliberate conspiracy against the emperor and</a>
<a id='line_386'>      the empire. The edicts of Arcadius most positively and most</a>
<a id='line_387'>      absurdly declares, that in such cases of treason, thoughts and</a>
<a id='line_388'>      actions ought to be punished with equal severity; that the</a>
<a id='line_389'>      knowledge of a mischievous intention, unless it be instantly</a>
<a id='line_390'>      revealed, becomes equally criminal with the intention itself; 19</a>
<a id='line_391'>      and that those rash men, who shall presume to solicit the pardon</a>
<a id='line_392'>      of traitors, shall themselves be branded with public and</a>
<a id='line_393'>      perpetual infamy. III. “With regard to the sons of the traitors,”</a>
<a id='line_394'>      (continues the emperor,) “although they ought to share the</a>
<a id='line_395'>      punishment, since they will probably imitate the guilt, of their</a>
<a id='line_396'>      parents, yet, by the special effect of our Imperial lenity, we</a>
<a id='line_397'>      grant them their lives; but, at the same time, we declare them</a>
<a id='line_398'>      incapable of inheriting, either on the father’s or on the</a>
<a id='line_399'>      mother’s side, or of receiving any gift or legacy, from the</a>
<a id='line_400'>      testament either of kinsmen or of strangers. Stigmatized with</a>
<a id='line_401'>      hereditary infamy, excluded from the hopes of honors or fortune,</a>
<a id='line_402'>      let them endure the pangs of poverty and contempt, till they</a>
<a id='line_403'>      shall consider life as a calamity, and death as a comfort and</a>
<a id='line_404'>      relief.” In such words, so well adapted to insult the feelings of</a>
<a id='line_405'>      mankind, did the emperor, or rather his favorite eunuch, applaud</a>
<a id='line_406'>      the moderation of a law, which transferred the same unjust and</a>
<a id='line_407'>      inhuman penalties to the children of all those who had seconded,</a>

<a id='line_447'>      as a personal affront, his own ungracious reception in the palace</a>
<a id='line_448'>      of Constantinople. A soft and wealthy province, in the heart of</a>
<a id='line_449'>      the empire, was astonished by the sound of war; and the faithful</a>
<a id='line_450'>      vassal who had been disregarded or oppressed, was again</a>
<a id='line_451'>      respected, as soon as he resumed the hostile character of a</a>
<a id='line_452'>      Barbarian. The vineyards and fruitful fields, between the rapid</a>
<a id='line_453'>      Marsyas and the winding Maeander, 23 were consumed with fire; the</a>
<a id='line_454'>      decayed walls of the cities crumbled into dust, at the first</a>
<a id='line_455'>      stroke of an enemy; the trembling inhabitants escaped from a</a>
<a id='line_456'>      bloody massacre to the shores of the Hellespont; and a</a>
<a id='line_457'>      considerable part of Asia Minor was desolated by the rebellion of</a>
<a id='line_458'>      Tribigild. His rapid progress was checked by the resistance of</a>
<a id='line_459'>      the peasants of Pamphylia; and the Ostrogoths, attacked in a</a>
<a id='line_460'>      narrow pass, between the city of Selgae, 24 a deep morass, and</a>
<a id='line_461'>      the craggy cliffs of Mount Taurus, were defeated with the loss of</a>
<a id='line_462'>      their bravest troops. But the spirit of their chief was not</a>
<a id='line_463'>      daunted by misfortune; and his army was continually recruited by</a>
<a id='line_464'>      swarms of Barbarians and outlaws, who were desirous of exercising</a>
<a id='line_465'>      the profession of robbery, under the more honorable names of war</a>
<a id='line_466'>      and conquest. The rumors of the success of Tribigild might for</a>
<a id='line_467'>      some time be suppressed by fear, or disguised by flattery; yet</a>
<a id='line_468'>      they gradually alarmed both the court and the capital. Every</a>
<a id='line_469'>      misfortune was exaggerated in dark and doubtful hints; and the</a>
<a id='line_470'>      future designs of the rebels became the subject of anxious</a>
<a id='line_471'>      conjecture. Whenever Tribigild advanced into the inland country,</a>
<a id='line_472'>      the Romans were inclined to suppose that he meditated the passage</a>
<a id='line_473'>      of Mount Taurus, and the invasion of Syria. If he descended</a>
<a id='line_474'>      towards the sea, they imputed, and perhaps suggested, to the</a>
<a id='line_475'>      Gothic chief, the more dangerous project of arming a fleet in the</a>
<a id='line_476'>      harbors of Ionia, and of extending his depredations along the</a>
<a id='line_477'>      maritime coast, from the mouth of the Nile to the port of</a>
<a id='line_478'>      Constantinople. The approach of danger, and the obstinacy of</a>
<a id='line_479'>      Tribigild, who refused all terms of accommodation, compelled</a>
<a id='line_480'>      Eutropius to summon a council of war. 25 After claiming for</a>
<a id='line_481'>      himself the privilege of a veteran soldier, the eunuch intrusted</a>
<a id='line_482'>      the guard of Thrace and the Hellespont to Gainas the Goth, and</a>
<a id='line_483'>      the command of the Asiatic army to his favorite, Leo; two</a>
<a id='line_484'>      generals, who differently, but effectually, promoted the cause of</a>
<a id='line_485'>      the rebels. Leo, 26 who, from the bulk of his body, and the</a>
<a id='line_486'>      dulness of his mind, was surnamed the Ajax of the East, had</a>
<a id='line_487'>      deserted his original trade of a woolcomber, to exercise, with</a>
<a id='line_488'>      much less skill and success, the military profession; and his</a>
<a id='line_489'>      uncertain operations were capriciously framed and executed, with</a>
<a id='line_490'>      an ignorance of real difficulties, and a timorous neglect of</a>
<a id='line_491'>      every favorable opportunity. The rashness of the Ostrogoths had</a>
<a id='line_492'>      drawn them into a disadvantageous position between the Rivers</a>
<a id='line_493'>      Melas and Eurymedon, where they were almost besieged by the</a>
<a id='line_494'>      peasants of Pamphylia; but the arrival of an Imperial army,</a>
<a id='line_495'>      instead of completing their destruction, afforded the means of</a>
<a id='line_496'>      safety and victory. Tribigild surprised the unguarded camp of the</a>
<a id='line_497'>      Romans, in the darkness of the night; seduced the faith of the</a>
<a id='line_498'>      greater part of the Barbarian auxiliaries, and dissipated,</a>

<a id='line_582'>      justice for some real or imaginary insult, which she imputed to</a>

<a id='line_588'>      the soldiers and people, who reproached his crimes, and pressed</a>

<a id='line_598'>      discourse on the forgiveness of injuries, and the instability of</a>
<a id='line_599'>      human greatness. The agonies of the pale and affrighted wretch,</a>
<a id='line_600'>      who lay grovelling under the table of the altar, exhibited a</a>
<a id='line_601'>      solemn and instructive spectacle; and the orator, who was</a>
<a id='line_602'>      afterwards accused of insulting the misfortunes of Eutropius,</a>
<a id='line_603'>      labored to excite the contempt, that he might assuage the fury,</a>
<a id='line_604'>      of the people. 29 The powers of humanity, of superstition, and of</a>
<a id='line_605'>      eloquence, prevailed. The empress Eudoxia was restrained by her</a>
<a id='line_606'>      own prejudices, or by those of her subjects, from violating the</a>
<a id='line_607'>      sanctuary of the church; and Eutropius was tempted to capitulate,</a>
<a id='line_608'>      by the milder arts of persuasion, and by an oath, that his life</a>
<a id='line_609'>      should be spared. 30 Careless of the dignity of their sovereign,</a>
<a id='line_610'>      the new ministers of the palace immediately published an edict to</a>
<a id='line_611'>      declare, that his late favorite had disgraced the names of consul</a>
<a id='line_612'>      and patrician, to abolish his statues, to confiscate his wealth,</a>
<a id='line_613'>      and to inflict a perpetual exile in the Island of Cyprus. 31 A</a>
<a id='line_614'>      despicable and decrepit eunuch could no longer alarm the fears of</a>
<a id='line_615'>      his enemies; nor was he capable of enjoying what yet remained,</a>
<a id='line_616'>      the comforts of peace, of solitude, and of a happy climate. But</a>
<a id='line_617'>      their implacable revenge still envied him the last moments of a</a>
<a id='line_618'>      miserable life, and Eutropius had no sooner touched the shores of</a>
<a id='line_619'>      Cyprus, than he was hastily recalled. The vain hope of eluding,</a>
<a id='line_620'>      by a change of place, the obligation of an oath, engaged the</a>
<a id='line_621'>      empress to transfer the scene of his trial and execution from</a>

<a id='line_669'>      to prevent the loss of his Asiatic dominions, by resigning his</a>
<a id='line_670'>      authority and his person to the faith of the Barbarians. The</a>
<a id='line_671'>      church of the holy martyr Euphemia, situate on a lofty eminence</a>
<a id='line_672'>      near Chalcedon, 34 was chosen for the place of the interview.</a>
<a id='line_673'>      Gainas bowed with reverence at the feet of the emperor, whilst he</a>
<a id='line_674'>      required the sacrifice of Aurelian and Saturninus, two ministers</a>
<a id='line_675'>      of consular rank; and their naked necks were exposed, by the</a>
<a id='line_676'>      haughty rebel, to the edge of the sword, till he condescended to</a>
<a id='line_677'>      grant them a precarious and disgraceful respite. The Goths,</a>
<a id='line_678'>      according to the terms of the agreement, were immediately</a>
<a id='line_679'>      transported from Asia into Europe; and their victorious chief,</a>
<a id='line_680'>      who accepted the title of master-general of the Roman armies,</a>
<a id='line_681'>      soon filled Constantinople with his troops, and distributed among</a>
<a id='line_682'>      his dependants the honors and rewards of the empire. In his early</a>
<a id='line_683'>      youth, Gainas had passed the Danube as a suppliant and a</a>
<a id='line_684'>      fugitive: his elevation had been the work of valor and fortune;</a>
<a id='line_685'>      and his indiscreet or perfidious conduct was the cause of his</a>
<a id='line_686'>      rapid downfall. Notwithstanding the vigorous opposition of the</a>
<a id='line_687'>      archbishop, he importunately claimed for his Arian sectaries the</a>
<a id='line_688'>      possession of a peculiar church; and the pride of the Catholics</a>
<a id='line_689'>      was offended by the public toleration of heresy. 35 Every quarter</a>
<a id='line_690'>      of Constantinople was filled with tumult and disorder; and the</a>
<a id='line_691'>      Barbarians gazed with such ardor on the rich shops of the</a>
<a id='line_692'>      jewellers, and the tables of the bankers, which were covered with</a>
<a id='line_693'>      gold and silver, that it was judged prudent to remove those</a>
<a id='line_694'>      dangerous temptations from their sight. They resented the</a>
<a id='line_695'>      injurious precaution; and some alarming attempts were made,</a>
<a id='line_696'>      during the night, to attack and destroy with fire the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_697'>      palace. 36 In this state of mutual and suspicious hostility, the</a>
<a id='line_698'>      guards and the people of Constantinople shut the gates, and rose</a>
<a id='line_699'>      in arms to prevent or to punish the conspiracy of the Goths.</a>
<a id='line_700'>      During the absence of Gainas, his troops were surprised and</a>
<a id='line_701'>      oppressed; seven thousand Barbarians perished in this bloody</a>
<a id='line_702'>      massacre. In the fury of the pursuit, the Catholics uncovered the</a>
<a id='line_703'>      roof, and continued to throw down flaming logs of wood, till they</a>
<a id='line_704'>      overwhelmed their adversaries, who had retreated to the church or</a>
<a id='line_705'>      conventicle of the Arians. Gainas was either innocent of the</a>
<a id='line_706'>      design, or too confident of his success; he was astonished by the</a>
<a id='line_707'>      intelligence that the flower of his army had been ingloriously</a>
<a id='line_708'>      destroyed; that he himself was declared a public enemy; and that</a>
<a id='line_709'>      his countryman, Fravitta, a brave and loyal confederate, had</a>
<a id='line_710'>      assumed the management of the war by sea and land. The</a>
<a id='line_711'>      enterprises of the rebel, against the cities of Thrace, were</a>
<a id='line_712'>      encountered by a firm and well-ordered defence; his hungry</a>
<a id='line_713'>      soldiers were soon reduced to the grass that grew on the margin</a>
<a id='line_714'>      of the fortifications; and Gainas, who vainly regretted the</a>
<a id='line_715'>      wealth and luxury of Asia, embraced a desperate resolution of</a>
<a id='line_716'>      forcing the passage of the Hellespont. He was destitute of</a>
<a id='line_717'>      vessels; but the woods of the Chersonesus afforded materials for</a>
<a id='line_718'>      rafts, and his intrepid Barbarians did not refuse to trust</a>
<a id='line_719'>      themselves to the waves. But Fravitta attentively watched the</a>
<a id='line_720'>      progress of their undertaking. As soon as they had gained the</a>
<a id='line_721'>      middle of the stream, the Roman galleys, 37 impelled by the full</a>
<a id='line_722'>      force of oars, of the current, and of a favorable wind, rushed</a>
<a id='line_723'>      forwards in compact order, and with irresistible weight; and the</a>
<a id='line_724'>      Hellespont was covered with the fragments of the Gothic</a>
<a id='line_725'>      shipwreck. After the destruction of his hopes, and the loss of</a>
<a id='line_726'>      many thousands of his bravest soldiers, Gainas, who could no</a>
<a id='line_727'>      longer aspire to govern or to subdue the Romans, determined to</a>
<a id='line_728'>      resume the independence of a savage life. A light and active body</a>
<a id='line_729'>      of Barbarian horse, disengaged from their infantry and baggage,</a>
<a id='line_730'>      might perform in eight or ten days a march of three hundred miles</a>
<a id='line_731'>      from the Hellespont to the Danube; 38 the garrisons of that</a>
<a id='line_732'>      important frontier had been gradually annihilated; the river, in</a>
<a id='line_733'>      the month of December, would be deeply frozen; and the unbounded</a>
<a id='line_734'>      prospect of Scythia was opened to the ambition of Gainas. This</a>
<a id='line_735'>      design was secretly communicated to the national troops, who</a>
<a id='line_736'>      devoted themselves to the fortunes of their leader; and before</a>
<a id='line_737'>      the signal of departure was given, a great number of provincial</a>
<a id='line_738'>      auxiliaries, whom he suspected of an attachment to their native</a>
<a id='line_739'>      country, were perfidiously massacred. The Goths advanced, by</a>
<a id='line_740'>      rapid marches, through the plains of Thrace; and they were soon</a>
<a id='line_741'>      delivered from the fear of a pursuit, by the vanity of Fravitta,</a>
<a id='line_742'>      3811 who, instead of extinguishing the war, hastened to enjoy the</a>
<a id='line_743'>      popular applause, and to assume the peaceful honors of the</a>
<a id='line_744'>      consulship. But a formidable ally appeared in arms to vindicate</a>
<a id='line_745'>      the majesty of the empire, and to guard the peace and liberty of</a>
<a id='line_746'>      Scythia. 39 The superior forces of Uldin, king of the Huns,</a>
<a id='line_747'>      opposed the progress of Gainas; a hostile and ruined country</a>
<a id='line_748'>      prohibited his retreat; he disdained to capitulate; and after</a>
<a id='line_749'>      repeatedly attempting to cut his way through the ranks of the</a>

<a id='line_833'>      41 A private order was despatched to the governor of Syria; and</a>
<a id='line_834'>      as the people might be unwilling to resign their favorite</a>
<a id='line_835'>      preacher, he was transported, with speed and secrecy in a</a>
<a id='line_836'>      post-chariot, from Antioch to Constantinople. The unanimous and</a>
<a id='line_837'>      unsolicited consent of the court, the clergy, and the people,</a>
<a id='line_838'>      ratified the choice of the minister; and, both as a saint and as</a>
<a id='line_839'>      an orator, the new archbishop surpassed the sanguine expectations</a>
<a id='line_840'>      of the public. Born of a noble and opulent family, in the capital</a>
<a id='line_841'>      of Syria, Chrysostom had been educated, by the care of a tender</a>
<a id='line_842'>      mother, under the tuition of the most skilful masters. He studied</a>
<a id='line_843'>      the art of rhetoric in the school of Libanius; and that</a>
<a id='line_844'>      celebrated sophist, who soon discovered the talents of his</a>
<a id='line_845'>      disciple, ingenuously confessed that John would have deserved to</a>
<a id='line_846'>      succeed him, had he not been stolen away by the Christians. His</a>
<a id='line_847'>      piety soon disposed him to receive the sacrament of baptism; to</a>
<a id='line_848'>      renounce the lucrative and honorable profession of the law; and</a>
<a id='line_849'>      to bury himself in the adjacent desert, where he subdued the</a>
<a id='line_850'>      lusts of the flesh by an austere penance of six years. His</a>
<a id='line_851'>      infirmities compelled him to return to the society of mankind;</a>
<a id='line_852'>      and the authority of Meletius devoted his talents to the service</a>
<a id='line_853'>      of the church: but in the midst of his family, and afterwards on</a>
<a id='line_854'>      the archiepiscopal throne, Chrysostom still persevered in the</a>
<a id='line_855'>      practice of the monastic virtues. The ample revenues, which his</a>
<a id='line_856'>      predecessors had consumed in pomp and luxury, he diligently</a>
<a id='line_857'>      applied to the establishment of hospitals; and the multitudes,</a>
<a id='line_858'>      who were supported by his charity, preferred the eloquent and</a>
<a id='line_859'>      edifying discourses of their archbishop to the amusements of the</a>

<a id='line_861'>      admired near twenty years at Antioch and Constantinople, have</a>
<a id='line_862'>      been carefully preserved; and the possession of near one thousand</a>
<a id='line_863'>      sermons, or homilies has authorized the critics 42 of succeeding</a>
<a id='line_864'>      times to appreciate the genuine merit of Chrysostom. They</a>
<a id='line_865'>      unanimously attribute to the Christian orator the free command of</a>
<a id='line_866'>      an elegant and copious language; the judgment to conceal the</a>
<a id='line_867'>      advantages which he derived from the knowledge of rhetoric and</a>

<a id='line_904'></a>
<a id='line_905'>      The pastoral labors of the archbishop of Constantinople provoked,</a>
<a id='line_906'>      and gradually united against him, two sorts of enemies; the</a>
<a id='line_907'>      aspiring clergy, who envied his success, and the obstinate</a>
<a id='line_908'>      sinners, who were offended by his reproofs. When Chrysostom</a>
<a id='line_909'>      thundered, from the pulpit of St. Sophia, against the degeneracy</a>
<a id='line_910'>      of the Christians, his shafts were spent among the crowd, without</a>
<a id='line_911'>      wounding, or even marking, the character of any individual. When</a>
<a id='line_912'>      he declaimed against the peculiar vices of the rich, poverty</a>
<a id='line_913'>      might obtain a transient consolation from his invectives; but the</a>
<a id='line_914'>      guilty were still sheltered by their numbers; and the reproach</a>
<a id='line_915'>      itself was dignified by some ideas of superiority and enjoyment.</a>
<a id='line_916'>      But as the pyramid rose towards the summit, it insensibly</a>
<a id='line_917'>      diminished to a point; and the magistrates, the ministers, the</a>
<a id='line_918'>      favorite eunuchs, the ladies of the court, 43 the empress Eudoxia</a>
<a id='line_919'>      herself, had a much larger share of guilt to divide among a</a>
<a id='line_920'>      smaller proportion of criminals. The personal applications of the</a>
<a id='line_921'>      audience were anticipated, or confirmed, by the testimony of</a>
<a id='line_922'>      their own conscience; and the intrepid preacher assumed the</a>
<a id='line_923'>      dangerous right of exposing both the offence and the offender to</a>
<a id='line_924'>      the public abhorrence. The secret resentment of the court</a>
<a id='line_925'>      encouraged the discontent of the clergy and monks of</a>
<a id='line_926'>      Constantinople, who were too hastily reformed by the fervent zeal</a>
<a id='line_927'>      of their archbishop. He had condemned, from the pulpit, the</a>
<a id='line_928'>      domestic females of the clergy of Constantinople, who, under the</a>
<a id='line_929'>      name of servants, or sisters, afforded a perpetual occasion</a>
<a id='line_930'>      either of sin or of scandal. The silent and solitary ascetics,</a>
<a id='line_931'>      who had secluded themselves from the world, were entitled to the</a>
<a id='line_932'>      warmest approbation of Chrysostom; but he despised and</a>
<a id='line_933'>      stigmatized, as the disgrace of their holy profession, the crowd</a>
<a id='line_934'>      of degenerate monks, who, from some unworthy motives of pleasure</a>
<a id='line_935'>      or profit, so frequently infested the streets of the capital. To</a>
<a id='line_936'>      the voice of persuasion, the archbishop was obliged to add the</a>
<a id='line_937'>      terrors of authority; and his ardor, in the exercise of</a>
<a id='line_938'>      ecclesiastical jurisdiction, was not always exempt from passion;</a>
<a id='line_939'>      nor was it always guided by prudence. Chrysostom was naturally of</a>
<a id='line_940'>      a choleric disposition. 44 Although he struggled, according to</a>
<a id='line_941'>      the precepts of the gospel, to love his private enemies, he</a>
<a id='line_942'>      indulged himself in the privilege of hating the enemies of God</a>
<a id='line_943'>      and of the church; and his sentiments were sometimes delivered</a>
<a id='line_944'>      with too much energy of countenance and expression. He still</a>
<a id='line_945'>      maintained, from some considerations of health or abstinence, his</a>
<a id='line_946'>      former habits of taking his repasts alone; and this inhospitable</a>
<a id='line_947'>      custom, 45 which his enemies imputed to pride, contributed, at</a>
<a id='line_948'>      least, to nourish the infirmity of a morose and unsocial humor.</a>
<a id='line_949'>      Separated from that familiar intercourse, which facilitates the</a>
<a id='line_950'>      knowledge and the despatch of business, he reposed an</a>
<a id='line_951'>      unsuspecting confidence in his deacon Serapion; and seldom</a>
<a id='line_952'>      applied his speculative knowledge of human nature to the</a>
<a id='line_953'>      particular character, either of his dependants, or of his equals.</a>
<a id='line_954'></a>
<a id='line_955'>      Conscious of the purity of his intentions, and perhaps of the</a>
<a id='line_956'>      superiority of his genius, the archbishop of Constantinople</a>
<a id='line_957'>      extended the jurisdiction of the Imperial city, that he might</a>
<a id='line_958'>      enlarge the sphere of his pastoral labors; and the conduct which</a>
<a id='line_959'>      the profane imputed to an ambitious motive, appeared to</a>
<a id='line_960'>      Chrysostom himself in the light of a sacred and indispensable</a>
<a id='line_961'>      duty. In his visitation through the Asiatic provinces, he deposed</a>
<a id='line_962'>      thirteen bishops of Lydia and Phrygia; and indiscreetly declared</a>
<a id='line_963'>      that a deep corruption of simony and licentiousness had infected</a>
<a id='line_964'>      the whole episcopal order. 46 If those bishops were innocent,</a>
<a id='line_965'>      such a rash and unjust condemnation must excite a well-grounded</a>
<a id='line_966'>      discontent. If they were guilty, the numerous associates of their</a>
<a id='line_967'>      guilt would soon discover that their own safety depended on the</a>

<a id='line_1011'>      secure, by their voices, the majority of a synod. The synod 49</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      was convened in the suburb of Chalcedon, surnamed the Oak, where</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      Rufinus had erected a stately church and monastery; and their</a>

<a id='line_1016'>      the frivolous or improbable nature of the forty-seven articles</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      which they presented against him, may justly be considered as a</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      fair and unexceptional panegyric. Four successive summons were</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      signified to Chrysostom; but he still refused to trust either his</a>

<a id='line_1021'>      who, prudently declining the examination of any particular</a>

<a id='line_1386'>      the saints who had forgotten the distinction of sexes, were</a>
<a id='line_1387'>      scrupulously excluded from the holy threshold. Pulcheria, her two</a>

<a id='line_1390'>      interrupted, by frequent fasts, their simple and frugal diet;</a>

<a id='line_1392'>      devoted several hours of the day and night to the exercises of</a>

<a id='line_1397'>      foundations for the benefit of strangers and the poor; the ample</a>
<a id='line_1398'>      donations which she assigned for the perpetual maintenance of</a>
<a id='line_1399'>      monastic societies; and the active severity with which she</a>
<a id='line_1400'>      labored to suppress the opposite heresies of Nestorius and</a>
<a id='line_1401'>      Eutyches. Such virtues were supposed to deserve the peculiar</a>
<a id='line_1402'>      favor of the Deity: and the relics of martyrs, as well as the</a>
<a id='line_1403'>      knowledge of future events, were communicated in visions and</a>

<a id='line_1547'>      permitted to behold the Athenian virgin: the modest youth</a>

<a id='line_1554'>      fruitfulness by the birth of a daughter, who espoused, fifteen</a>
<a id='line_1555'>      years afterwards, the emperor of the West. The brothers of</a>
<a id='line_1556'>      Eudocia obeyed, with some anxiety, her Imperial summons; but as</a>

<a id='line_1570'>      was not abated by time and possession; and Eudocia, after the</a>
<a id='line_1571'>      marriage of her daughter, was permitted to discharge her grateful</a>

<a id='line_1578'>      baths, and accepted the statues, which were decreed by the</a>
<a id='line_1579'>      gratitude of Antioch. In the Holy Land, her alms and pious</a>

<a id='line_1581'>      though the public treasure might be impoverished by this</a>
<a id='line_1582'>      excessive liberality, she enjoyed the conscious satisfaction of</a>

<a id='line_1584'>      right arm of St. Stephen, and an undoubted picture of the Virgin,</a>
<a id='line_1585'>      painted by St. Luke. 76 But this pilgrimage was the fatal term of</a>
<a id='line_1586'>      the glories of Eudocia. Satiated with empty pomp, and unmindful,</a>
<a id='line_1587'>      perhaps, of her obligations to Pulcheria, she ambitiously aspired</a>
<a id='line_1588'>      to the government of the Eastern empire; the palace was</a>
<a id='line_1589'>      distracted by female discord; but the victory was at last</a>
<a id='line_1590'>      decided, by the superior ascendant of the sister of Theodosius.</a>
<a id='line_1591'>      The execution of Paulinus, master of the offices, and the</a>
<a id='line_1592'>      disgrace of Cyrus, Prætorian præfect of the East, convinced the</a>
<a id='line_1593'>      public that the favor of Eudocia was insufficient to protect her</a>
<a id='line_1594'>      most faithful friends; and the uncommon beauty of Paulinus</a>
<a id='line_1595'>      encouraged the secret rumor, that his guilt was that of a</a>
<a id='line_1596'>      successful lover. 77 As soon as the empress perceived that the</a>
<a id='line_1597'>      affection of Theodosius was irretrievably lost, she requested the</a>
<a id='line_1598'>      permission of retiring to the distant solitude of Jerusalem. She</a>
<a id='line_1599'>      obtained her request; but the jealousy of Theodosius, or the</a>
<a id='line_1600'>      vindictive spirit of Pulcheria, pursued her in her last retreat;</a>
<a id='line_1601'>      and Saturninus, count of the domestics, was directed to punish</a>
<a id='line_1602'>      with death two ecclesiastics, her most favored servants. Eudocia</a>
<a id='line_1603'>      instantly revenged them by the assassination of the count; the</a>
<a id='line_1604'>      furious passions which she indulged on this suspicious occasion,</a>

<a id='line_1607'>      disgraced, perhaps unjustly, in the eyes of the world. The</a>
<a id='line_1608'>      remainder of the life of Eudocia, about sixteen years, was spent</a>

<a id='line_1681'>      Mesopotamia, were filled with hostile armies; but the operations</a>
<a id='line_1682'>      of two successive campaigns were not productive of any decisive</a>
<a id='line_1683'>      or memorable events. Some engagements were fought, some towns</a>

<a id='line_1688'>      pointed his thundering engine in the name of St. Thomas the</a>

<a id='line_1690'>      the messenger Palladius repeatedly announced to the palace of</a>
<a id='line_1691'>      Constantinople, were celebrated with festivals and panegyrics.</a>
<a id='line_1692'>      From these panegyrics the historians 81 of the age might borrow</a>

<a id='line_1740'>      appeared to preponderate. But the royal race of Arsaces</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      impatiently submitted to the house of Sassan; the turbulent</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      nobles asserted, or betrayed, their hereditary independence; and</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      the nation was still attached to the Christian princes of</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      Constantinople. In the beginning of the fifth century, Armenia</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      was divided by the progress of war and faction; 83 and the</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      unnatural division precipitated the downfall of that ancient</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      monarchy. Chosroes, the Persian vassal, reigned over the Eastern</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      and most extensive portion of the country; while the Western</a>
<a id='line_1749'>      province acknowledged the jurisdiction of Arsaces, and the</a>
<a id='line_1750'>      supremacy of the emperor Arcadius. 8111 After the death of</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      Arsaces, the Romans suppressed the regal government, and imposed</a>
<a id='line_1752'>      on their allies the condition of subjects. The military command</a>
<a id='line_1753'>      was delegated to the count of the Armenian frontier; the city of</a>
<a id='line_1754'>      Theodosiopolis 84 was built and fortified in a strong situation,</a>
<a id='line_1755'>      on a fertile and lofty ground, near the sources of the Euphrates;</a>
<a id='line_1756'>      and the dependent territories were ruled by five satraps, whose</a>
<a id='line_1757'>      dignity was marked by a peculiar habit of gold and purple. The</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      less fortunate nobles, who lamented the loss of their king, and</a>
<a id='line_1759'>      envied the honors of their equals, were provoked to negotiate</a>
<a id='line_1760'>      their peace and pardon at the Persian court; and returning, with</a>
<a id='line_1761'>      their followers, to the palace of Artaxata, acknowledged Chosroes</a>
<a id='line_1762'>      8411 for their lawful sovereign. About thirty years afterwards,</a>
<a id='line_1763'>      Artasires, the nephew and successor of Chosroes, fell under the</a>
<a id='line_1764'>      displeasure of the haughty and capricious nobles of Armenia; and</a>
<a id='line_1765'>      they unanimously desired a Persian governor in the room of an</a>
<a id='line_1766'>      unworthy king. The answer of the archbishop Isaac, whose sanction</a>
<a id='line_1767'>      they earnestly solicited, is expressive of the character of a</a>
<a id='line_1768'>      superstitious people. He deplored the manifest and inexcusable</a>
<a id='line_1769'>      vices of Artasires; and declared, that he should not hesitate to</a>
<a id='line_1770'>      accuse him before the tribunal of a Christian emperor, who would</a>
<a id='line_1771'>      punish, without destroying, the sinner. “Our king,” continued</a>
<a id='line_1772'>      Isaac, “is too much addicted to licentious pleasures, but he has</a>
<a id='line_1773'>      been purified in the holy waters of baptism. He is a lover of</a>
<a id='line_1774'>      women, but he does not adore the fire or the elements. He may</a>
<a id='line_1775'>      deserve the reproach of lewdness, but he is an undoubted</a>
<a id='line_1776'>      Catholic; and his faith is pure, though his manners are</a>
<a id='line_1777'>      flagitious. I will never consent to abandon my sheep to the rage</a>
<a id='line_1778'>      of devouring wolves; and you would soon repent your rash exchange</a>
<a id='line_1779'>      of the infirmities of a believer, for the specious virtues of a</a>
<a id='line_1780'>      heathen.” 85 Exasperated by the firmness of Isaac, the factious</a>
<a id='line_1781'>      nobles accused both the king and the archbishop as the secret</a>
<a id='line_1782'>      adherents of the emperor; and absurdly rejoiced in the sentence</a>
<a id='line_1783'>      of condemnation, which, after a partial hearing, was solemnly</a>
<a id='line_1784'>      pronounced by Bahram himself. The descendants of Arsaces were</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      degraded from the royal dignity, 86 which they had possessed</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      above five hundred and sixty years; 87 and the dominions of the</a>
<a id='line_1787'>      unfortunate Artasires, 8711 under the new and significant</a>
<a id='line_1788'>      appellation of Persarmenia, were reduced into the form of a</a>
<a id='line_1789'>      province. This usurpation excited the jealousy of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1790'>      government; but the rising disputes were soon terminated by an</a>
<a id='line_1791'>      amicable, though unequal, partition of the ancient kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_1792'>      Armenia: 8712 and a territorial acquisition, which Augustus might</a>
<a id='line_1793'>      have despised, reflected some lustre on the declining empire of</a>
