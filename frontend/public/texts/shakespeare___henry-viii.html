<a id='line_43'></a>
<a id='line_44'>    I come no more to make you laugh; things now</a>
<a id='line_45'>    That bear a weighty and a serious brow,</a>
<a id='line_46'>    Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,</a>
<a id='line_47'>    Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,</a>
<a id='line_48'>    We now present. Those that can pity here</a>
<a id='line_49'>    May, if they think it well, let fall a tear:</a>
<a id='line_50'>    The subject will deserve it. Such as give</a>
<a id='line_51'>    Their money out of hope they may believe</a>
<a id='line_52'>    May here find truth too. Those that come to see</a>
<a id='line_53'>    Only a show or two, and so agree</a>
<a id='line_54'>    The play may pass, if they be still and willing,</a>
<a id='line_55'>    I'll undertake may see away their shilling</a>
<a id='line_56'>    Richly in two short hours. Only they</a>
<a id='line_57'>    That come to hear a merry bawdy play,</a>
<a id='line_58'>    A noise of targets, or to see a fellow</a>
<a id='line_59'>    In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,</a>
<a id='line_60'>    Will be deceiv'd; for, gentle hearers, know,</a>
<a id='line_61'>    To rank our chosen truth with such a show</a>
<a id='line_62'>    As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting</a>
<a id='line_63'>    Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring</a>
<a id='line_64'>    To make that only true we now intend,</a>
<a id='line_65'>    Will leave us never an understanding friend.</a>
<a id='line_66'>    Therefore, for goodness sake, and as you are known</a>
<a id='line_67'>    The first and happiest hearers of the town,</a>
<a id='line_68'>    Be sad, as we would make ye. Think ye see</a>
<a id='line_69'>    The very persons of our noble story</a>
<a id='line_70'>    As they were living; think you see them great,</a>
<a id='line_71'>    And follow'd with the general throng and sweat</a>
<a id='line_72'>    Of thousand friends; then, in a moment, see</a>
<a id='line_73'>    How soon this mightiness meets misery.</a>

<a id='line_77'>ACT I. SCENE 1.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>London. The palace</a>
<a id='line_80'></a>
<a id='line_81'>Enter the DUKE OF NORFOLK at one door; at the other, the DUKE OF</a>
<a id='line_82'>BUCKINGHAM and the LORD ABERGAVENNY</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>  BUCKINGHAM. Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done</a>
<a id='line_85'>    Since last we saw in France?</a>
<a id='line_86'>  NORFOLK. I thank your Grace,</a>
<a id='line_87'>    Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer</a>
<a id='line_88'>    Of what I saw there.</a>
<a id='line_89'>  BUCKINGHAM. An untimely ague</a>
<a id='line_90'>    Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when</a>
<a id='line_91'>    Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,</a>
<a id='line_92'>    Met in the vale of Andren.</a>
<a id='line_93'>  NORFOLK. 'Twixt Guynes and Arde-</a>
<a id='line_94'>    I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;</a>
<a id='line_95'>    Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung</a>
<a id='line_96'>    In their embracement, as they grew together;</a>
<a id='line_97'>    Which had they, what four thron'd ones could have weigh'd</a>
<a id='line_98'>    Such a compounded one?</a>
<a id='line_99'>  BUCKINGHAM. All the whole time</a>
<a id='line_100'>    I was my chamber's prisoner.</a>
<a id='line_101'>  NORFOLK. Then you lost</a>
<a id='line_102'>    The view of earthly glory; men might say,</a>
<a id='line_103'>    Till this time pomp was single, but now married</a>
<a id='line_104'>    To one above itself. Each following day</a>
<a id='line_105'>    Became the next day's master, till the last</a>
<a id='line_106'>    Made former wonders its. To-day the French,</a>
<a id='line_107'>    All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,</a>
<a id='line_108'>    Shone down the English; and to-morrow they</a>
<a id='line_109'>    Made Britain India: every man that stood</a>
<a id='line_110'>    Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were</a>
<a id='line_111'>    As cherubins, an gilt; the madams too,</a>
<a id='line_112'>    Not us'd to toil, did almost sweat to bear</a>
<a id='line_113'>    The pride upon them, that their very labour</a>
<a id='line_114'>    Was to them as a painting. Now this masque</a>
<a id='line_115'>    Was cried incomparable; and th' ensuing night</a>
<a id='line_116'>    Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,</a>
<a id='line_117'>    Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,</a>
<a id='line_118'>    As presence did present them: him in eye</a>
<a id='line_119'>    still him in praise; and being present both,</a>
<a id='line_120'>    'Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner</a>
<a id='line_121'>    Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns-</a>
<a id='line_122'>    For so they phrase 'em-by their heralds challeng'd</a>
<a id='line_123'>    The noble spirits to arms, they did perform</a>
<a id='line_124'>    Beyond thought's compass, that former fabulous story,</a>
<a id='line_125'>    Being now seen possible enough, got credit,</a>
<a id='line_126'>    That Bevis was believ'd.</a>
<a id='line_127'>  BUCKINGHAM. O, you go far!</a>
<a id='line_128'>  NORFOLK. As I belong to worship, and affect</a>
<a id='line_129'>    In honour honesty, the tract of ev'rything</a>
<a id='line_130'>    Would by a good discourser lose some life</a>
<a id='line_131'>    Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal:</a>
<a id='line_132'>    To the disposing of it nought rebell'd;</a>
<a id='line_133'>    Order gave each thing view. The office did</a>
<a id='line_134'>    Distinctly his full function.</a>
<a id='line_135'>  BUCKINGHAM. Who did guide-</a>
<a id='line_136'>    I mean, who set the body and the limbs</a>
<a id='line_137'>    Of this great sport together, as you guess?</a>
<a id='line_138'>  NORFOLK. One, certes, that promises no element</a>
<a id='line_139'>    In such a business.</a>
<a id='line_140'>  BUCKINGHAM. I pray you, who, my lord?</a>
<a id='line_141'>  NORFOLK. All this was ord'red by the good discretion</a>
<a id='line_142'>    Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.</a>
<a id='line_143'>  BUCKINGHAM. The devil speed him! No man's pie is freed</a>
<a id='line_144'>    From his ambitious finger. What had he</a>
<a id='line_145'>    To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder</a>
<a id='line_146'>    That such a keech can with his very bulk</a>
<a id='line_147'>    Take up the rays o' th' beneficial sun,</a>
<a id='line_148'>    And keep it from the earth.</a>
<a id='line_149'>  NORFOLK. Surely, sir,</a>
<a id='line_150'>    There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;</a>
<a id='line_151'>    For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace</a>
<a id='line_152'>    Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon</a>
<a id='line_153'>    For high feats done to th' crown, neither allied</a>
<a id='line_154'>    To eminent assistants, but spider-like,</a>
<a id='line_155'>    Out of his self-drawing web, 'a gives us note</a>
<a id='line_156'>    The force of his own merit makes his way-</a>
<a id='line_157'>    A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys</a>
<a id='line_158'>    A place next to the King.</a>
<a id='line_159'>  ABERGAVENNY. I cannot tell</a>
<a id='line_160'>    What heaven hath given him-let some graver eye</a>
<a id='line_161'>    Pierce into that; but I can see his pride</a>
<a id='line_162'>    Peep through each part of him. Whence has he that?</a>
<a id='line_163'>    If not from hell, the devil is a niggard</a>
<a id='line_164'>    Or has given all before, and he begins</a>
<a id='line_165'>    A new hell in himself.</a>
<a id='line_166'>  BUCKINGHAM. Why the devil,</a>
<a id='line_167'>    Upon this French going out, took he upon him-</a>
<a id='line_168'>    Without the privity o' th' King-t' appoint</a>
<a id='line_169'>    Who should attend on him? He makes up the file</a>
<a id='line_170'>    Of all the gentry; for the most part such</a>
<a id='line_171'>    To whom as great a charge as little honour</a>
<a id='line_172'>    He meant to lay upon; and his own letter,</a>
<a id='line_173'>    The honourable board of council out,</a>
<a id='line_174'>    Must fetch him in he papers.</a>
<a id='line_175'>  ABERGAVENNY. I do know</a>
<a id='line_176'>    Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have</a>
<a id='line_177'>    By this so sicken'd their estates that never</a>
<a id='line_178'>    They shall abound as formerly.</a>
<a id='line_179'>  BUCKINGHAM. O, many</a>
<a id='line_180'>    Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em</a>
<a id='line_181'>    For this great journey. What did this vanity</a>
<a id='line_182'>    But minister communication of</a>
<a id='line_183'>    A most poor issue?</a>
<a id='line_184'>  NORFOLK. Grievingly I think</a>
<a id='line_185'>    The peace between the French and us not values</a>
<a id='line_186'>    The cost that did conclude it.</a>
<a id='line_187'>  BUCKINGHAM. Every man,</a>
<a id='line_188'>    After the hideous storm that follow'd, was</a>
<a id='line_189'>    A thing inspir'd, and, not consulting, broke</a>
<a id='line_190'>    Into a general prophecy-that this tempest,</a>
<a id='line_191'>    Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded</a>
<a id='line_192'>    The sudden breach on't.</a>
<a id='line_193'>  NORFOLK. Which is budded out;</a>
<a id='line_194'>    For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd</a>
<a id='line_195'>    Our merchants' goods at Bordeaux.</a>
<a id='line_196'>  ABERGAVENNY. Is it therefore</a>
<a id='line_197'>    Th' ambassador is silenc'd?</a>
<a id='line_198'>  NORFOLK. Marry, is't.</a>
<a id='line_199'>  ABERGAVENNY. A proper tide of a peace, and purchas'd</a>
<a id='line_200'>    At a superfluous rate!</a>
<a id='line_201'>  BUCKINGHAM. Why, all this business</a>
<a id='line_202'>    Our reverend Cardinal carried.</a>
<a id='line_203'>  NORFOLK. Like it your Grace,</a>
<a id='line_204'>    The state takes notice of the private difference</a>
<a id='line_205'>    Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you-</a>
<a id='line_206'>    And take it from a heart that wishes towards you</a>
<a id='line_207'>    Honour and plenteous safety-that you read</a>
<a id='line_208'>    The Cardinal's malice and his potency</a>
<a id='line_209'>    Together; to consider further, that</a>
<a id='line_210'>    What his high hatred would effect wants not</a>
<a id='line_211'>    A minister in his power. You know his nature,</a>
<a id='line_212'>    That he's revengeful; and I know his sword</a>
<a id='line_213'>    Hath a sharp edge-it's long and't may be said</a>
<a id='line_214'>    It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,</a>
<a id='line_215'>    Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel</a>
<a id='line_216'>    You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock</a>
<a id='line_217'>    That I advise your shunning.</a>
<a id='line_218'></a>
<a id='line_219'>      Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before him, certain of the</a>
<a id='line_220'>      guard, and two SECRETARIES with papers. The CARDINAL in his</a>
<a id='line_221'>      passage fixeth his eye on BUCKINGHAM, and BUCKINGHAM on him, both</a>
<a id='line_222'>      full of disdain</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>  WOLSEY. The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor? Ha!</a>
<a id='line_225'>    Where's his examination?</a>
<a id='line_226'>  SECRETARY. Here, so please you.</a>
<a id='line_227'>  WOLSEY. Is he in person ready?</a>
<a id='line_228'>  SECRETARY. Ay, please your Grace.</a>
<a id='line_229'>  WOLSEY. Well, we shall then know more, and Buckingham</a>
<a id='line_230'>    shall lessen this big look.</a>
<a id='line_231'>                                          Exeunt WOLSEY and his train</a>
<a id='line_232'>  BUCKINGHAM. This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I</a>
<a id='line_233'>    Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best</a>
<a id='line_234'>    Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book</a>
<a id='line_235'>    Outworths a noble's blood.</a>
<a id='line_236'>  NORFOLK. What, are you chaf'd?</a>
<a id='line_237'>    Ask God for temp'rance; that's th' appliance only</a>
<a id='line_238'>    Which your disease requires.</a>
<a id='line_239'>  BUCKINGHAM. I read in's looks</a>
<a id='line_240'>    Matter against me, and his eye revil'd</a>
<a id='line_241'>    Me as his abject object. At this instant</a>
<a id='line_242'>    He bores me with some trick. He's gone to th' King;</a>
<a id='line_243'>    I'll follow, and outstare him.</a>
<a id='line_244'>  NORFOLK. Stay, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_245'>    And let your reason with your choler question</a>
<a id='line_246'>    What 'tis you go about. To climb steep hills</a>
<a id='line_247'>    Requires slow pace at first. Anger is like</a>
<a id='line_248'>    A full hot horse, who being allow'd his way,</a>
<a id='line_249'>    Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England</a>
<a id='line_250'>    Can advise me like you; be to yourself</a>
<a id='line_251'>    As you would to your friend.</a>
<a id='line_252'>  BUCKINGHAM. I'll to the King,</a>
<a id='line_253'>    And from a mouth of honour quite cry down</a>
<a id='line_254'>    This Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim</a>
<a id='line_255'>    There's difference in no persons.</a>
<a id='line_256'>  NORFOLK. Be advis'd:</a>
<a id='line_257'>    Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot</a>
<a id='line_258'>    That it do singe yourself. We may outrun</a>
<a id='line_259'>    By violent swiftness that which we run at,</a>
<a id='line_260'>    And lose by over-running. Know you not</a>
<a id='line_261'>    The fire that mounts the liquor till't run o'er</a>
<a id='line_262'>    In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advis'd.</a>
<a id='line_263'>    I say again there is no English soul</a>
<a id='line_264'>    More stronger to direct you than yourself,</a>
<a id='line_265'>    If with the sap of reason you would quench</a>
<a id='line_266'>    Or but allay the fire of passion.</a>
<a id='line_267'>  BUCKINGHAM. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_268'>    I am thankful to you, and I'll go along</a>
<a id='line_269'>    By your prescription; but this top-proud fellow-</a>
<a id='line_270'>    Whom from the flow of gan I name not, but</a>
<a id='line_271'>    From sincere motions, by intelligence,</a>
<a id='line_272'>    And proofs as clear as founts in July when</a>
<a id='line_273'>    We see each grain of gravel-I do know</a>
<a id='line_274'>    To be corrupt and treasonous.</a>
<a id='line_275'>  NORFOLK. Say not treasonous.</a>
<a id='line_276'>  BUCKINGHAM. To th' King I'll say't, and make my vouch as strong</a>
<a id='line_277'>    As shore of rock. Attend: this holy fox,</a>
<a id='line_278'>    Or wolf, or both-for he is equal rav'nous</a>
<a id='line_279'>    As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief</a>
<a id='line_280'>    As able to perform't, his mind and place</a>
<a id='line_281'>    Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally-</a>
<a id='line_282'>    Only to show his pomp as well in France</a>
<a id='line_283'>    As here at home, suggests the King our master</a>
<a id='line_284'>    To this last costly treaty, th' interview</a>
<a id='line_285'>    That swallowed so much treasure and like a glass</a>
<a id='line_286'>    Did break i' th' wrenching.</a>
<a id='line_287'>  NORFOLK. Faith, and so it did.</a>
<a id='line_288'>  BUCKINGHAM. Pray, give me favour, sir; this cunning cardinal</a>
<a id='line_289'>    The articles o' th' combination drew</a>
<a id='line_290'>    As himself pleas'd; and they were ratified</a>
<a id='line_291'>    As he cried 'Thus let be' to as much end</a>
<a id='line_292'>    As give a crutch to th' dead. But our Count-Cardinal</a>
<a id='line_293'>    Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,</a>
<a id='line_294'>    Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,</a>
<a id='line_295'>    Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy</a>
<a id='line_296'>    To th' old dam treason: Charles the Emperor,</a>
<a id='line_297'>    Under pretence to see the Queen his aunt-</a>
<a id='line_298'>    For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came</a>
<a id='line_299'>    To whisper Wolsey-here makes visitation-</a>
<a id='line_300'>    His fears were that the interview betwixt</a>
<a id='line_301'>    England and France might through their amity</a>
<a id='line_302'>    Breed him some prejudice; for from this league</a>

<a id='line_312'>    Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,</a>
<a id='line_313'>    And for his own advantage.</a>
<a id='line_314'>  NORFOLK. I am sorry</a>

<a id='line_317'>  BUCKINGHAM. No, not a syllable:</a>
<a id='line_318'>    I do pronounce him in that very shape</a>

<a id='line_324'>  BRANDON. Your office, sergeant: execute it.</a>

<a id='line_333'>  BRANDON. I am sorry</a>

<a id='line_336'>    You shall to th' Tower.</a>
<a id='line_337'>  BUCKINGHAM. It will help nothing</a>
<a id='line_338'>    To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me</a>

<a id='line_369'>Cornets. Enter KING HENRY, leaning on the CARDINAL'S shoulder, the</a>
<a id='line_370'>NOBLES, and SIR THOMAS LOVELL, with others. The CARDINAL places himself</a>
<a id='line_371'>under the KING'S feet on his right side</a>
<a id='line_372'></a>
<a id='line_373'>  KING. My life itself, and the best heart of it,</a>
<a id='line_374'>    Thanks you for this great care; I stood i' th' level</a>
<a id='line_375'>    Of a full-charg'd confederacy, and give thanks</a>

<a id='line_377'>    That gentleman of Buckingham's. In person</a>

<a id='line_383'>      usher'd by the DUKES OF NORFOLK and SUFFOLK; she kneels. The KING</a>
<a id='line_384'>      riseth from his state, takes her up, kisses and placeth her by</a>
<a id='line_385'>      him</a>

<a id='line_391'>    Repeat your will, and take it.</a>
<a id='line_392'>  QUEEN KATHARINE. Thank your Majesty.</a>

<a id='line_396'>    Of my petition.</a>
<a id='line_397'>  KING. Lady mine, proceed.</a>
<a id='line_398'>  QUEEN KATHARINE. I am solicited, not by a few,</a>
<a id='line_399'>    And those of true condition, that your subjects</a>
<a id='line_400'>    Are in great grievance: there have been commissions</a>
<a id='line_401'>    Sent down among 'em which hath flaw'd the heart</a>
<a id='line_402'>    Of all their loyalties; wherein, although,</a>
<a id='line_403'>    My good Lord Cardinal, they vent reproaches</a>
<a id='line_404'>    Most bitterly on you as putter-on</a>
<a id='line_405'>    Of these exactions, yet the King our master-</a>
<a id='line_406'>    Whose honour Heaven shield from soil!-even he escapes not</a>
<a id='line_407'>    Language unmannerly; yea, such which breaks</a>
<a id='line_408'>    The sides of loyalty, and almost appears</a>
<a id='line_409'>    In loud rebellion.</a>
<a id='line_410'>  NORFOLK. Not almost appears-</a>
<a id='line_411'>    It doth appear; for, upon these taxations,</a>
<a id='line_412'>    The clothiers all, not able to maintain</a>
<a id='line_413'>    The many to them 'longing, have put of</a>
<a id='line_414'>    The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who</a>
<a id='line_415'>    Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger</a>
<a id='line_416'>    And lack of other means, in desperate manner</a>
<a id='line_417'>    Daring th' event to th' teeth, are all in uproar,</a>
<a id='line_418'>    And danger serves among them.</a>
<a id='line_419'>  KING. Taxation!</a>
<a id='line_420'>    Wherein? and what taxation? My Lord Cardinal,</a>
<a id='line_421'>    You that are blam'd for it alike with us,</a>
<a id='line_422'>    Know you of this taxation?</a>
<a id='line_423'>  WOLSEY. Please you, sir,</a>
<a id='line_424'>    I know but of a single part in aught</a>
<a id='line_425'>    Pertains to th' state, and front but in that file</a>
<a id='line_426'>    Where others tell steps with me.</a>
<a id='line_427'>  QUEEN KATHARINE. No, my lord!</a>
<a id='line_428'>    You know no more than others! But you frame</a>
<a id='line_429'>    Things that are known alike, which are not wholesome</a>
<a id='line_430'>    To those which would not know them, and yet must</a>
<a id='line_431'>    Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,</a>
<a id='line_432'>    Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are</a>
<a id='line_433'>    Most pestilent to th' hearing; and to bear 'em</a>
<a id='line_434'>    The back is sacrifice to th' load. They say</a>
<a id='line_435'>    They are devis'd by you, or else you suffer</a>
<a id='line_436'>    Too hard an exclamation.</a>
<a id='line_437'>  KING. Still exaction!</a>
<a id='line_438'>    The nature of it? In what kind, let's know,</a>
<a id='line_439'>    Is this exaction?</a>
<a id='line_440'>  QUEEN KATHARINE. I am much too venturous</a>
<a id='line_441'>    In tempting of your patience, but am bold'ned</a>
<a id='line_442'>    Under your promis'd pardon. The subjects' grief</a>
<a id='line_443'>    Comes through commissions, which compels from each</a>
<a id='line_444'>    The sixth part of his substance, to be levied</a>
<a id='line_445'>    Without delay; and the pretence for this</a>
<a id='line_446'>    Is nam'd your wars in France. This makes bold mouths;</a>
<a id='line_447'>    Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze</a>
<a id='line_448'>    Allegiance in them; their curses now</a>
<a id='line_449'>    Live where their prayers did; and it's come to pass</a>
<a id='line_450'>    This tractable obedience is a slave</a>
<a id='line_451'>    To each incensed will. I would your Highness</a>
<a id='line_452'>    Would give it quick consideration, for</a>
<a id='line_453'>    There is no primer business.</a>
<a id='line_454'>  KING. By my life,</a>
<a id='line_455'>    This is against our pleasure.</a>
<a id='line_456'>  WOLSEY. And for me,</a>
<a id='line_457'>    I have no further gone in this than by</a>
<a id='line_458'>    A single voice; and that not pass'd me but</a>
<a id='line_459'>    By learned approbation of the judges. If I am</a>
<a id='line_460'>    Traduc'd by ignorant tongues, which neither know</a>
<a id='line_461'>    My faculties nor person, yet will be</a>
<a id='line_462'>    The chronicles of my doing, let me say</a>
<a id='line_463'>    'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake</a>
<a id='line_464'>    That virtue must go through. We must not stint</a>
<a id='line_465'>    Our necessary actions in the fear</a>
<a id='line_466'>    To cope malicious censurers, which ever</a>
<a id='line_467'>    As rav'nous fishes do a vessel follow</a>
<a id='line_468'>    That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further</a>
<a id='line_469'>    Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,</a>
<a id='line_470'>    By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is</a>
<a id='line_471'>    Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft</a>
<a id='line_472'>    Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up</a>
<a id='line_473'>    For our best act. If we shall stand still,</a>
<a id='line_474'>    In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,</a>
<a id='line_475'>    We should take root here where we sit, or sit</a>
<a id='line_476'>    State-statues only.</a>
<a id='line_477'>  KING. Things done well</a>
<a id='line_478'>    And with a care exempt themselves from fear:</a>
<a id='line_479'>    Things done without example, in their issue</a>
<a id='line_480'>    Are to be fear'd. Have you a precedent</a>
<a id='line_481'>    Of this commission? I believe, not any.</a>
<a id='line_482'>    We must not rend our subjects from our laws,</a>
<a id='line_483'>    And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?</a>
<a id='line_484'>    A trembling contribution! Why, we take</a>
<a id='line_485'>    From every tree lop, bark, and part o' th' timber;</a>
<a id='line_486'>    And though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,</a>
<a id='line_487'>    The air will drink the sap. To every county</a>
<a id='line_488'>    Where this is question'd send our letters with</a>
<a id='line_489'>    Free pardon to each man that has denied</a>
<a id='line_490'>    The force of this commission. Pray, look tot;</a>
<a id='line_491'>    I put it to your care.</a>
<a id='line_492'>  WOLSEY. [Aside to the SECRETARY]  A word with you.</a>
<a id='line_493'>    Let there be letters writ to every shire</a>
<a id='line_494'>    Of the King's grace and pardon. The grieved commons</a>
<a id='line_495'>    Hardly conceive of me-let it be nois'd</a>
<a id='line_496'>    That through our intercession this revokement</a>
<a id='line_497'>    And pardon comes. I shall anon advise you</a>
<a id='line_498'>    Further in the proceeding.                         Exit SECRETARY</a>
<a id='line_499'></a>
<a id='line_500'>                    Enter SURVEYOR</a>
<a id='line_501'></a>
<a id='line_502'>  QUEEN KATHARINE. I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham</a>
<a id='line_503'>    Is run in your displeasure.</a>
<a id='line_504'>  KING. It grieves many.</a>
<a id='line_505'>    The gentleman is learn'd and a most rare speaker;</a>
<a id='line_506'>    To nature none more bound; his training such</a>
<a id='line_507'>    That he may furnish and instruct great teachers</a>
<a id='line_508'>    And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,</a>
<a id='line_509'>    When these so noble benefits shall prove</a>
<a id='line_510'>    Not well dispos'd, the mind growing once corrupt,</a>
<a id='line_511'>    They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly</a>
<a id='line_512'>    Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,</a>
<a id='line_513'>    Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we,</a>
<a id='line_514'>    Almost with ravish'd list'ning, could not find</a>
<a id='line_515'>    His hour of speech a minute-he, my lady,</a>
<a id='line_516'>    Hath into monstrous habits put the graces</a>
<a id='line_517'>    That once were his, and is become as black</a>
<a id='line_518'>    As if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear-</a>
<a id='line_519'>    This was his gentleman in trust-of him</a>
<a id='line_520'>    Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount</a>
<a id='line_521'>    The fore-recited practices, whereof</a>
<a id='line_522'>    We cannot feel too little, hear too much.</a>
<a id='line_523'>  WOLSEY. Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,</a>
<a id='line_524'>    Most like a careful subject, have collected</a>
<a id='line_525'>    Out of the Duke of Buckingham.</a>
<a id='line_526'>  KING. Speak freely.</a>
<a id='line_527'>  SURVEYOR. First, it was usual with him-every day</a>
<a id='line_528'>    It would infect his speech-that if the King</a>
<a id='line_529'>    Should without issue die, he'll carry it so</a>
<a id='line_530'>    To make the sceptre his. These very words</a>
<a id='line_531'>    I've heard him utter to his son-in-law,</a>
<a id='line_532'>    Lord Aberga'ny, to whom by oath he menac'd</a>
<a id='line_533'>    Revenge upon the Cardinal.</a>
<a id='line_534'>  WOLSEY. Please your Highness, note</a>
<a id='line_535'>    This dangerous conception in this point:</a>
<a id='line_536'>    Not friended by his wish, to your high person</a>
<a id='line_537'>    His will is most malignant, and it stretches</a>
<a id='line_538'>    Beyond you to your friends.</a>
<a id='line_539'>  QUEEN KATHARINE. My learn'd Lord Cardinal,</a>
<a id='line_540'>    Deliver all with charity.</a>
<a id='line_541'>  KING. Speak on.</a>
<a id='line_542'>    How grounded he his title to the crown</a>
<a id='line_543'>    Upon our fail? To this point hast thou heard him</a>
<a id='line_544'>    At any time speak aught?</a>
<a id='line_545'>  SURVEYOR. He was brought to this</a>
<a id='line_546'>    By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Henton.</a>
<a id='line_547'>  KING. What was that Henton?</a>
<a id='line_548'>  SURVEYOR. Sir, a Chartreux friar,</a>
<a id='line_549'>    His confessor, who fed him every minute</a>
<a id='line_550'>    With words of sovereignty.</a>
<a id='line_551'>  KING. How know'st thou this?</a>
<a id='line_552'>  SURVEYOR. Not long before your Highness sped to France,</a>
<a id='line_553'>    The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish</a>
<a id='line_554'>    Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand</a>
<a id='line_555'>    What was the speech among the Londoners</a>
<a id='line_556'>    Concerning the French journey. I replied</a>
<a id='line_557'>    Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious,</a>
<a id='line_558'>    To the King's danger. Presently the Duke</a>
<a id='line_559'>    Said 'twas the fear indeed and that he doubted</a>
<a id='line_560'>    'Twould prove the verity of certain words</a>
<a id='line_561'>    Spoke by a holy monk 'that oft' says he</a>
<a id='line_562'>    'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit</a>
<a id='line_563'>    John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour</a>
<a id='line_564'>    To hear from him a matter of some moment;</a>
<a id='line_565'>    Whom after under the confession's seal</a>
<a id='line_566'>    He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke</a>
<a id='line_567'>    My chaplain to no creature living but</a>
<a id='line_568'>    To me should utter, with demure confidence</a>
<a id='line_569'>    This pausingly ensu'd: "Neither the King nor's heirs,</a>
<a id='line_570'>    Tell you the Duke, shall prosper; bid him strive</a>
<a id='line_571'>    To gain the love o' th' commonalty; the Duke</a>
<a id='line_572'>    Shall govern England."'</a>
<a id='line_573'>  QUEEN KATHARINE. If I know you well,</a>
<a id='line_574'>    You were the Duke's surveyor, and lost your office</a>
<a id='line_575'>    On the complaint o' th' tenants. Take good heed</a>
<a id='line_576'>    You charge not in your spleen a noble person</a>
<a id='line_577'>    And spoil your nobler soul. I say, take heed;</a>
<a id='line_578'>    Yes, heartily beseech you.</a>
<a id='line_579'>  KING. Let him on.</a>
<a id='line_580'>    Go forward.</a>
<a id='line_581'>  SURVEYOR. On my soul, I'll speak but truth.</a>
<a id='line_582'>    I told my lord the Duke, by th' devil's illusions</a>
<a id='line_583'>    The monk might be deceiv'd, and that 'twas dangerous</a>
<a id='line_584'>      for him</a>
<a id='line_585'>    To ruminate on this so far, until</a>
<a id='line_586'>    It forg'd him some design, which, being believ'd,</a>
<a id='line_587'>    It was much like to do. He answer'd 'Tush,</a>
<a id='line_588'>    It can do me no damage'; adding further</a>
<a id='line_589'>    That, had the King in his last sickness fail'd,</a>
<a id='line_590'>    The Cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads</a>
<a id='line_591'>    Should have gone off.</a>
<a id='line_592'>  KING. Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!</a>
<a id='line_593'>    There's mischief in this man. Canst thou say further?</a>
<a id='line_594'>  SURVEYOR. I can, my liege.</a>
<a id='line_595'>  KING. Proceed.</a>
<a id='line_596'>  SURVEYOR. Being at Greenwich,</a>
<a id='line_597'>    After your Highness had reprov'd the Duke</a>
<a id='line_598'>    About Sir William Bulmer-</a>
<a id='line_599'>  KING. I remember</a>
<a id='line_600'>    Of such a time: being my sworn servant,</a>
<a id='line_601'>    The Duke retain'd him his. But on: what hence?</a>
<a id='line_602'>  SURVEYOR. 'If' quoth he 'I for this had been committed-</a>

<a id='line_906'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Were you there?</a>
<a id='line_907'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes, indeed, was I.</a>
<a id='line_908'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Pray, speak what has happen'd.</a>
<a id='line_909'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. You may guess quickly what.</a>
<a id='line_910'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Is he found guilty?</a>
<a id='line_911'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.</a>
<a id='line_912'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I am sorry for't.</a>
<a id='line_913'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. So are a number more.</a>
<a id='line_914'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. But, pray, how pass'd it?</a>
<a id='line_915'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I'll tell you in a little. The great Duke.</a>
<a id='line_916'>    Came to the bar; where to his accusations</a>
<a id='line_917'>    He pleaded still not guilty, and alleged</a>
<a id='line_918'>    Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.</a>
<a id='line_919'>    The King's attorney, on the contrary,</a>
<a id='line_920'>    Urg'd on the examinations, proofs, confessions,</a>
<a id='line_921'>    Of divers witnesses; which the Duke desir'd</a>
<a id='line_922'>    To have brought, viva voce, to his face;</a>
<a id='line_923'>    At which appear'd against him his surveyor,</a>
<a id='line_924'>    Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor, and John Car,</a>
<a id='line_925'>    Confessor to him, with that devil-monk,</a>
<a id='line_926'>    Hopkins, that made this mischief.</a>
<a id='line_927'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. That was he</a>
<a id='line_928'>    That fed him with his prophecies?</a>
<a id='line_929'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. The same.</a>
<a id='line_930'>    All these accus'd him strongly, which he fain</a>
<a id='line_931'>    Would have flung from him; but indeed he could not;</a>
<a id='line_932'>    And so his peers, upon this evidence,</a>
<a id='line_933'>    Have found him guilty of high treason. Much</a>
<a id='line_934'>    He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all</a>
<a id='line_935'>    Was either pitied in him or forgotten.</a>
<a id='line_936'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. After all this, how did he bear him-self</a>
<a id='line_937'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. When he was brought again to th' bar to hear</a>
<a id='line_938'>    His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd</a>
<a id='line_939'>    With such an agony he sweat extremely,</a>
<a id='line_940'>    And something spoke in choler, ill and hasty;</a>
<a id='line_941'>    But he fell to himself again, and sweetly</a>
<a id='line_942'>    In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.</a>
<a id='line_943'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I do not think he fears death.</a>
<a id='line_944'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Sure, he does not;</a>
<a id='line_945'>    He never was so womanish; the cause</a>
<a id='line_946'>    He may a little grieve at.</a>
<a id='line_947'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Certainly</a>
<a id='line_948'>    The Cardinal is the end of this.</a>
<a id='line_949'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. 'Tis likely,</a>
<a id='line_950'>    By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder,</a>
<a id='line_951'>    Then deputy of Ireland, who remov'd,</a>
<a id='line_952'>    Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,</a>
<a id='line_953'>    Lest he should help his father.</a>
<a id='line_954'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. That trick of state</a>
<a id='line_955'>    Was a deep envious one.</a>
<a id='line_956'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. At his return</a>
<a id='line_957'>    No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,</a>
<a id='line_958'>    And generally: whoever the King favours</a>
<a id='line_959'>    The Cardinal instantly will find employment,</a>
<a id='line_960'>    And far enough from court too.</a>
<a id='line_961'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. All the commons</a>
<a id='line_962'>    Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,</a>
<a id='line_963'>    Wish him ten fathom deep: this Duke as much</a>
<a id='line_964'>    They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,</a>
<a id='line_965'>    The mirror of all courtesy-</a>
<a id='line_966'></a>
<a id='line_967'>      Enter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment, tip-staves</a>
<a id='line_968'>      before him; the axe with the edge towards him; halberds</a>
<a id='line_969'>      on each side; accompanied with SIR THOMAS</a>
<a id='line_970'>      LOVELL, SIR NICHOLAS VAUX, SIR WILLIAM SANDYS,</a>
<a id='line_971'>      and common people, etc.</a>
<a id='line_972'></a>
<a id='line_973'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Stay there, sir,</a>
<a id='line_974'>    And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.</a>
<a id='line_975'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Let's stand close, and behold him.</a>
<a id='line_976'>  BUCKINGHAM. All good people,</a>
<a id='line_977'>    You that thus far have come to pity me,</a>
<a id='line_978'>    Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.</a>
<a id='line_979'>    I have this day receiv'd a traitor's judgment,</a>
<a id='line_980'>    And by that name must die; yet, heaven bear witness,</a>
<a id='line_981'>    And if I have a conscience, let it sink me</a>
<a id='line_982'>    Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!</a>
<a id='line_983'>    The law I bear no malice for my death:</a>
<a id='line_984'>    'T has done, upon the premises, but justice.</a>
<a id='line_985'>    But those that sought it I could wish more Christians.</a>
<a id='line_986'>    Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em;</a>
<a id='line_987'>    Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief</a>
<a id='line_988'>    Nor build their evils on the graves of great men,</a>
<a id='line_989'>    For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.</a>
<a id='line_990'>    For further life in this world I ne'er hope</a>
<a id='line_991'>    Nor will I sue, although the King have mercies</a>
<a id='line_992'>    More than I dare make faults. You few that lov'd me</a>
<a id='line_993'>    And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,</a>
<a id='line_994'>    His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave</a>
<a id='line_995'>    Is only bitter to him, only dying,</a>
<a id='line_996'>    Go with me like good angels to my end;</a>
<a id='line_997'>    And as the long divorce of steel falls on me</a>
<a id='line_998'>    Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,</a>
<a id='line_999'>    And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, a God's name.</a>
<a id='line_1000'>  LOVELL. I do beseech your Grace, for charity,</a>
<a id='line_1001'>    If ever any malice in your heart</a>
<a id='line_1002'>    Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.</a>
<a id='line_1003'>  BUCKINGHAM. Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you</a>
<a id='line_1004'>    As I would be forgiven. I forgive all.</a>
<a id='line_1005'>    There cannot be those numberless offences</a>
<a id='line_1006'>    'Gainst me that I cannot take peace with. No black envy</a>
<a id='line_1007'>    Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his Grace;</a>
<a id='line_1008'>    And if he speak of Buckingham, pray tell him</a>
<a id='line_1009'>    You met him half in heaven. My vows and prayers</a>
<a id='line_1010'>    Yet are the King's, and, till my soul forsake,</a>
<a id='line_1011'>    Shall cry for blessings on him. May he live</a>
<a id='line_1012'>    Longer than I have time to tell his years;</a>
<a id='line_1013'>    Ever belov'd and loving may his rule be;</a>
<a id='line_1014'>    And when old time Shall lead him to his end,</a>
<a id='line_1015'>    Goodness and he fill up one monument!</a>
<a id='line_1016'>  LOVELL. To th' water side I must conduct your Grace;</a>
<a id='line_1017'>    Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,</a>
<a id='line_1018'>    Who undertakes you to your end.</a>
<a id='line_1019'>  VAUX. Prepare there;</a>
<a id='line_1020'>    The Duke is coming; see the barge be ready;</a>
<a id='line_1021'>    And fit it with such furniture as suits</a>
<a id='line_1022'>    The greatness of his person.</a>
<a id='line_1023'>  BUCKINGHAM. Nay, Sir Nicholas,</a>
<a id='line_1024'>    Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.</a>
<a id='line_1025'>    When I came hither I was Lord High Constable</a>
<a id='line_1026'>    And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.</a>
<a id='line_1027'>    Yet I am richer than my base accusers</a>
<a id='line_1028'>    That never knew what truth meant; I now seal it;</a>
<a id='line_1029'>    And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort.</a>
<a id='line_1030'>    My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,</a>
<a id='line_1031'>    Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard,</a>
<a id='line_1032'>    Flying for succour to his servant Banister,</a>
<a id='line_1033'>    Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd</a>
<a id='line_1034'>    And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!</a>
<a id='line_1035'>    Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying</a>
<a id='line_1036'>    My father's loss, like a most royal prince,</a>
<a id='line_1037'>    Restor'd me to my honours, and out of ruins</a>
<a id='line_1038'>    Made my name once more noble. Now his son,</a>
<a id='line_1039'>    Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all</a>
<a id='line_1040'>    That made me happy, at one stroke has taken</a>
<a id='line_1041'>    For ever from the world. I had my trial,</a>
<a id='line_1042'>    And must needs say a noble one; which makes me</a>
<a id='line_1043'>    A little happier than my wretched father;</a>
<a id='line_1044'>    Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both</a>
<a id='line_1045'>    Fell by our servants, by those men we lov'd most-</a>
<a id='line_1046'>    A most unnatural and faithless service.</a>
<a id='line_1047'>    Heaven has an end in all. Yet, you that hear me,</a>
<a id='line_1048'>    This from a dying man receive as certain:</a>
<a id='line_1049'>    Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,</a>
<a id='line_1050'>    Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends</a>
<a id='line_1051'>    And give your hearts to, when they once perceive</a>
<a id='line_1052'>    The least rub in your fortunes, fall away</a>
<a id='line_1053'>    Like water from ye, never found again</a>
<a id='line_1054'>    But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,</a>
<a id='line_1055'>    Pray for me! I must now forsake ye; the last hour</a>
<a id='line_1056'>    Of my long weary life is come upon me.</a>
<a id='line_1057'>    Farewell;</a>
<a id='line_1058'>    And when you would say something that is sad,</a>
<a id='line_1059'>    Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!</a>
<a id='line_1060'>                                          Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and train</a>
<a id='line_1061'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,</a>
<a id='line_1062'>    I fear, too many curses on their heads</a>
<a id='line_1063'>    That were the authors.</a>
<a id='line_1064'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. If the Duke be guiltless,</a>
<a id='line_1065'>    'Tis full of woe; yet I can give you inkling</a>
<a id='line_1066'>    Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,</a>
<a id='line_1067'>    Greater than this.</a>
<a id='line_1068'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Good angels keep it from us!</a>
<a id='line_1069'>    What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?</a>
<a id='line_1070'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. This secret is so weighty, 'twill require</a>
<a id='line_1071'>    A strong faith to conceal it.</a>
<a id='line_1072'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Let me have it;</a>
<a id='line_1073'>    I do not talk much.</a>
<a id='line_1074'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I am confident.</a>
<a id='line_1075'>    You shall, sir. Did you not of late days hear</a>
<a id='line_1076'>    A buzzing of a separation</a>
<a id='line_1077'>    Between the King and Katharine?</a>
<a id='line_1078'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes, but it held not;</a>
<a id='line_1079'>    For when the King once heard it, out of anger</a>
<a id='line_1080'>    He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight</a>
<a id='line_1081'>    To stop the rumour and allay those tongues</a>
<a id='line_1082'>    That durst disperse it.</a>
<a id='line_1083'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. But that slander, sir,</a>
<a id='line_1084'>    Is found a truth now; for it grows again</a>
<a id='line_1085'>    Fresher than e'er it was, and held for certain</a>
<a id='line_1086'>    The King will venture at it. Either the Cardinal</a>
<a id='line_1087'>    Or some about him near have, out of malice</a>
<a id='line_1088'>    To the good Queen, possess'd him with a scruple</a>
<a id='line_1089'>    That will undo her. To confirm this too,</a>
<a id='line_1090'>    Cardinal Campeius is arriv'd and lately;</a>
<a id='line_1091'>    As all think, for this business.</a>
<a id='line_1092'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. 'Tis the Cardinal;</a>
<a id='line_1093'>    And merely to revenge him on the Emperor</a>
<a id='line_1094'>    For not bestowing on him at his asking</a>
<a id='line_1095'>    The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purpos'd.</a>
<a id='line_1096'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I think you have hit the mark; but is't</a>
<a id='line_1097'>        not cruel</a>
<a id='line_1098'>    That she should feel the smart of this? The Cardinal</a>
<a id='line_1099'>    Will have his will, and she must fall.</a>
<a id='line_1100'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. 'Tis woeful.</a>
<a id='line_1101'>    We are too open here to argue this;</a>
<a id='line_1102'>    Let's think in private more.                               Exeunt</a>

<a id='line_1104'>ACT II. SCENE 2.</a>
<a id='line_1105'></a>
<a id='line_1106'>London. The palace</a>
<a id='line_1107'></a>
<a id='line_1108'>Enter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN reading this letter</a>
<a id='line_1109'></a>
<a id='line_1110'>  CHAMBERLAIN. 'My lord,</a>
<a id='line_1111'>    'The horses your lordship sent for, with all the care</a>
<a id='line_1112'>    had, I saw well chosen, ridden, and furnish'd. They were</a>
<a id='line_1113'>    young and handsome, and of the best breed in the north.</a>
<a id='line_1114'>    When they were ready to set out for London, a man of</a>
<a id='line_1115'>    my Lord Cardinal's, by commission, and main power, took</a>
<a id='line_1116'>    'em from me, with this reason: his master would be serv'd</a>
<a id='line_1117'>    before a subject, if not before the King; which stopp'd</a>
<a id='line_1118'>    our mouths, sir.'</a>
<a id='line_1119'></a>
<a id='line_1120'>    I fear he will indeed. Well, let him have them.</a>
<a id='line_1121'>    He will have all, I think.</a>
<a id='line_1122'></a>
<a id='line_1123'>    Enter to the LORD CHAMBERLAIN the DUKES OF NORFOLK and SUFFOLK</a>
<a id='line_1124'></a>
<a id='line_1125'>  NORFOLK. Well met, my Lord Chamberlain.</a>
<a id='line_1126'>  CHAMBERLAIN. Good day to both your Graces.</a>
<a id='line_1127'>  SUFFOLK. How is the King employ'd?</a>
<a id='line_1128'>  CHAMBERLAIN. I left him private,</a>
<a id='line_1129'>    Full of sad thoughts and troubles.</a>
<a id='line_1130'>  NORFOLK. What's the cause?</a>
<a id='line_1131'>  CHAMBERLAIN. It seems the marriage with his brother's wife</a>
<a id='line_1132'>    Has crept too near his conscience.</a>
<a id='line_1133'>  SUFFOLK. No, his conscience</a>
<a id='line_1134'>    Has crept too near another lady.</a>
<a id='line_1135'>  NORFOLK. 'Tis so;</a>
<a id='line_1136'>    This is the Cardinal's doing; the King-Cardinal,</a>
<a id='line_1137'>    That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune,</a>
<a id='line_1138'>    Turns what he list. The King will know him one day.</a>
<a id='line_1139'>  SUFFOLK. Pray God he do! He'll never know himself else.</a>
<a id='line_1140'>  NORFOLK. How holily he works in all his business!</a>
<a id='line_1141'>    And with what zeal! For, now he has crack'd the league</a>
<a id='line_1142'>    Between us and the Emperor, the Queen's great nephew,</a>
<a id='line_1143'>    He dives into the King's soul and there scatters</a>
<a id='line_1144'>    Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,</a>
<a id='line_1145'>    Fears, and despairs-and all these for his marriage;</a>
<a id='line_1146'>    And out of all these to restore the King,</a>
<a id='line_1147'>    He counsels a divorce, a loss of her</a>
<a id='line_1148'>    That like a jewel has hung twenty years</a>
<a id='line_1149'>    About his neck, yet never lost her lustre;</a>
<a id='line_1150'>    Of her that loves him with that excellence</a>
<a id='line_1151'>    That angels love good men with; even of her</a>
<a id='line_1152'>    That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,</a>
<a id='line_1153'>    Will bless the King-and is not this course pious?</a>
<a id='line_1154'>  CHAMBERLAIN. Heaven keep me from such counsel! 'Tis most true</a>
<a id='line_1155'>    These news are everywhere; every tongue speaks 'em,</a>
<a id='line_1156'>    And every true heart weeps for 't. All that dare</a>
<a id='line_1157'>    Look into these affairs see this main end-</a>
<a id='line_1158'>    The French King's sister. Heaven will one day open</a>
<a id='line_1159'>    The King's eyes, that so long have slept upon</a>
<a id='line_1160'>    This bold bad man.</a>
<a id='line_1161'>  SUFFOLK. And free us from his slavery.</a>
<a id='line_1162'>  NORFOLK. We had need pray, and heartily, for our deliverance;</a>
<a id='line_1163'>    Or this imperious man will work us an</a>
<a id='line_1164'>    From princes into pages. All men's honours</a>
<a id='line_1165'>    Lie like one lump before him, to be fashion'd</a>
<a id='line_1166'>    Into what pitch he please.</a>
<a id='line_1167'>  SUFFOLK. For me, my lords,</a>
<a id='line_1168'>    I love him not, nor fear him-there's my creed;</a>
<a id='line_1169'>    As I am made without him, so I'll stand,</a>
<a id='line_1170'>    If the King please; his curses and his blessings</a>
<a id='line_1171'>    Touch me alike; th' are breath I not believe in.</a>
<a id='line_1172'>    I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him</a>
<a id='line_1173'>    To him that made him proud-the Pope.</a>
<a id='line_1174'>  NORFOLK. Let's in;</a>
<a id='line_1175'>    And with some other business put the King</a>
<a id='line_1176'>    From these sad thoughts that work too much upon him.</a>
<a id='line_1177'>    My lord, you'll bear us company?</a>
<a id='line_1178'>  CHAMBERLAIN. Excuse me,</a>
<a id='line_1179'>    The King has sent me otherwhere; besides,</a>
<a id='line_1180'>    You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him.</a>
<a id='line_1181'>    Health to your lordships!</a>
<a id='line_1182'>  NORFOLK. Thanks, my good Lord Chamberlain.</a>
<a id='line_1183'>                            Exit LORD CHAMBERLAIN; and the KING draws</a>
<a id='line_1184'>                               the curtain and sits reading pensively</a>
<a id='line_1185'>  SUFFOLK. How sad he looks; sure, he is much afflicted.</a>
<a id='line_1186'>  KING. Who's there, ha?</a>
<a id='line_1187'>  NORFOLK. Pray God he be not angry.</a>
<a id='line_1188'>  KING HENRY. Who's there, I say? How dare you thrust yourselves</a>
<a id='line_1189'>    Into my private meditations?</a>
<a id='line_1190'>    Who am I, ha?</a>
<a id='line_1191'>  NORFOLK. A gracious king that pardons all offences</a>

<a id='line_1523'>  QUEEN KATHARINE. Lord Cardinal,</a>

<a id='line_1526'>  QUEEN KATHARINE. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_1527'>    I am about to weep; but, thinking that</a>
<a id='line_1528'>    We are a queen, or long have dream'd so, certain</a>
<a id='line_1529'>    The daughter of a king, my drops of tears</a>
<a id='line_1530'>    I'll turn to sparks of fire.</a>
<a id='line_1531'>  WOLSEY. Be patient yet.</a>
<a id='line_1532'>  QUEEN KATHARINE. I Will, when you are humble; nay, before</a>
<a id='line_1533'>    Or God will punish me. I do believe,</a>
<a id='line_1534'>    Induc'd by potent circumstances, that</a>
<a id='line_1535'>    You are mine enemy, and make my challenge</a>
<a id='line_1536'>    You shall not be my judge; for it is you</a>
<a id='line_1537'>    Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me-</a>
<a id='line_1538'>    Which God's dew quench! Therefore I say again,</a>
<a id='line_1539'>    I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul</a>
<a id='line_1540'>    Refuse you for my judge, whom yet once more</a>
<a id='line_1541'>    I hold my most malicious foe and think not</a>
<a id='line_1542'>    At all a friend to truth.</a>
<a id='line_1543'>  WOLSEY. I do profess</a>
<a id='line_1544'>    You speak not like yourself, who ever yet</a>
<a id='line_1545'>    Have stood to charity and display'd th' effects</a>
<a id='line_1546'>    Of disposition gentle and of wisdom</a>
<a id='line_1547'>    O'ertopping woman's pow'r. Madam, you do me wrong:</a>
<a id='line_1548'>    I have no spleen against you, nor injustice</a>
<a id='line_1549'>    For you or any; how far I have proceeded,</a>
<a id='line_1550'>    Or how far further shall, is warranted</a>
<a id='line_1551'>    By a commission from the Consistory,</a>
<a id='line_1552'>    Yea, the whole Consistory of Rome. You charge me</a>
<a id='line_1553'>    That I have blown this coal: I do deny it.</a>
<a id='line_1554'>    The King is present; if it be known to him</a>
<a id='line_1555'>    That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,</a>
<a id='line_1556'>    And worthily, my falsehood! Yea, as much</a>
<a id='line_1557'>    As you have done my truth. If he know</a>
<a id='line_1558'>    That I am free of your report, he knows</a>
<a id='line_1559'>    I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him</a>
<a id='line_1560'>    It lies to cure me, and the cure is to</a>
<a id='line_1561'>    Remove these thoughts from you; the which before</a>
<a id='line_1562'>    His Highness shall speak in, I do beseech</a>
<a id='line_1563'>    You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking</a>
<a id='line_1564'>    And to say so no more.</a>
<a id='line_1565'>  QUEEN KATHARINE. My lord, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_1566'>    I am a simple woman, much too weak</a>
<a id='line_1567'>    T' oppose your cunning. Y'are meek and humble-mouth'd;</a>
<a id='line_1568'>    You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,</a>
<a id='line_1569'>    With meekness and humility; but your heart</a>
<a id='line_1570'>    Is cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.</a>
<a id='line_1571'>    You have, by fortune and his Highness' favours,</a>
<a id='line_1572'>    Gone slightly o'er low steps, and now are mounted</a>

<a id='line_1575'>    Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you</a>
<a id='line_1576'>    You tender more your person's honour than</a>
<a id='line_1577'>    Your high profession spiritual; that again</a>
<a id='line_1578'>    I do refuse you for my judge and here,</a>
<a id='line_1579'>    Before you all, appeal unto the Pope,</a>
<a id='line_1580'>    To bring my whole cause 'fore his Holiness</a>

<a id='line_1607'>  WOLSEY. Most gracious sir,</a>
<a id='line_1608'>    In humblest manner I require your Highness</a>
<a id='line_1609'>    That it shall please you to declare in hearing</a>
<a id='line_1610'>    Of all these ears-for where I am robb'd and bound,</a>
<a id='line_1611'>    There must I be unloos'd, although not there</a>
<a id='line_1612'>    At once and fully satisfied-whether ever I</a>
<a id='line_1613'>    Did broach this business to your Highness, or</a>
<a id='line_1614'>    Laid any scruple in your way which might</a>
<a id='line_1615'>    Induce you to the question on't, or ever</a>
<a id='line_1616'>    Have to you, but with thanks to God for such</a>
<a id='line_1617'>    A royal lady, spake one the least word that might</a>
<a id='line_1618'>    Be to the prejudice of her present state,</a>
<a id='line_1619'>    Or touch of her good person?</a>
<a id='line_1620'>  KING. My Lord Cardinal,</a>
<a id='line_1621'>    I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,</a>
<a id='line_1622'>    I free you from't. You are not to be taught</a>
<a id='line_1623'>    That you have many enemies that know not</a>
<a id='line_1624'>    Why they are so, but, like to village curs,</a>
<a id='line_1625'>    Bark when their fellows do. By some of these</a>
<a id='line_1626'>    The Queen is put in anger. Y'are excus'd.</a>
<a id='line_1627'>    But will you be more justified? You ever</a>
<a id='line_1628'>    Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desir'd</a>
<a id='line_1629'>    It to be stirr'd; but oft have hind'red, oft,</a>
<a id='line_1630'>    The passages made toward it. On my honour,</a>
<a id='line_1631'>    I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point,</a>
<a id='line_1632'>    And thus far clear him. Now, what mov'd me to't,</a>
<a id='line_1633'>    I will be bold with time and your attention.</a>
<a id='line_1634'>    Then mark th' inducement. Thus it came-give heed to't:</a>
<a id='line_1635'>    My conscience first receiv'd a tenderness,</a>
<a id='line_1636'>    Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd</a>
<a id='line_1637'>    By th' Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador,</a>
<a id='line_1638'>    Who had been hither sent on the debating</a>
<a id='line_1639'>    A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and</a>
<a id='line_1640'>    Our daughter Mary. I' th' progress of this business,</a>
<a id='line_1641'>    Ere a determinate resolution, he-</a>
<a id='line_1642'>    I mean the Bishop-did require a respite</a>
<a id='line_1643'>    Wherein he might the King his lord advertise</a>
<a id='line_1644'>    Whether our daughter were legitimate,</a>
<a id='line_1645'>    Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,</a>
<a id='line_1646'>    Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook</a>
<a id='line_1647'>    The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,</a>
<a id='line_1648'>    Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble</a>
<a id='line_1649'>    The region of my breast, which forc'd such way</a>
<a id='line_1650'>    That many maz'd considerings did throng</a>
<a id='line_1651'>    And press'd in with this caution. First, methought</a>
<a id='line_1652'>    I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had</a>
<a id='line_1653'>    Commanded nature that my lady's womb,</a>
<a id='line_1654'>    If it conceiv'd a male child by me, should</a>
<a id='line_1655'>    Do no more offices of life to't than</a>
<a id='line_1656'>    The grave does to the dead; for her male issue</a>
<a id='line_1657'>    Or died where they were made, or shortly after</a>
<a id='line_1658'>    This world had air'd them. Hence I took a thought</a>
<a id='line_1659'>    This was a judgment on me, that my kingdom,</a>
<a id='line_1660'>    Well worthy the best heir o' th' world, should not</a>
<a id='line_1661'>    Be gladded in't by me. Then follows that</a>
<a id='line_1662'>    I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in</a>
<a id='line_1663'>    By this my issue's fail, and that gave to me</a>
<a id='line_1664'>    Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in</a>
<a id='line_1665'>    The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer</a>
<a id='line_1666'>    Toward this remedy, whereupon we are</a>
<a id='line_1667'>    Now present here together; that's to say</a>
<a id='line_1668'>    I meant to rectify my conscience, which</a>
<a id='line_1669'>    I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,</a>
<a id='line_1670'>    By all the reverend fathers of the land</a>
<a id='line_1671'>    And doctors learn'd. First, I began in private</a>
<a id='line_1672'>    With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember</a>
<a id='line_1673'>    How under my oppression I did reek,</a>
<a id='line_1674'>    When I first mov'd you.</a>
<a id='line_1675'>  LINCOLN. Very well, my liege.</a>
<a id='line_1676'>  KING. I have spoke long; be pleas'd yourself to say</a>
<a id='line_1677'>    How far you satisfied me.</a>
<a id='line_1678'>  LINCOLN. So please your Highness,</a>
<a id='line_1679'>    The question did at first so stagger me-</a>
<a id='line_1680'>    Bearing a state of mighty moment in't</a>
<a id='line_1681'>    And consequence of dread-that I committed</a>
<a id='line_1682'>    The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt,</a>
<a id='line_1683'>    And did entreat your Highness to this course</a>
<a id='line_1684'>    Which you are running here.</a>
<a id='line_1685'>  KING. I then mov'd you,</a>
<a id='line_1686'>    My Lord of Canterbury, and got your leave</a>
<a id='line_1687'>    To make this present summons. Unsolicited</a>
<a id='line_1688'>    I left no reverend person in this court,</a>
<a id='line_1689'>    But by particular consent proceeded</a>
<a id='line_1690'>    Under your hands and seals; therefore, go on,</a>
<a id='line_1691'>    For no dislike i' th' world against the person</a>
<a id='line_1692'>    Of the good Queen, but the sharp thorny points</a>
<a id='line_1693'>    Of my alleged reasons, drives this forward.</a>
<a id='line_1694'>    Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life</a>
<a id='line_1695'>    And kingly dignity, we are contented</a>
<a id='line_1696'>    To wear our moral state to come with her,</a>
<a id='line_1697'>    Katharine our queen, before the primest creature</a>
<a id='line_1698'>    That's paragon'd o' th' world.</a>
<a id='line_1699'>  CAMPEIUS. So please your Highness,</a>
<a id='line_1700'>    The Queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness</a>
<a id='line_1701'>    That we adjourn this court till further day;</a>

<a id='line_1852'>  WOLSEY. Madam, this is a mere distraction;</a>
<a id='line_1853'>    You turn the good we offer into envy.</a>
<a id='line_1854'>  QUEEN KATHARINE. Ye turn me into nothing. Woe upon ye,</a>

<a id='line_1859'>    Alas! has banish'd me his bed already,</a>

<a id='line_1865'>  CAMPEIUS. Your fears are worse.</a>
<a id='line_1866'>  QUEEN KATHARINE. Have I liv'd thus long-let me speak myself,</a>

<a id='line_1882'>    Your master wed me to: nothing but death</a>

<a id='line_1887'>    Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts.</a>
<a id='line_1888'>    What will become of me now, wretched lady?</a>
<a id='line_1889'>    I am the most unhappy woman living.</a>

<a id='line_1909'>    I know you have a gentle, noble temper,</a>

<a id='line_1912'>  CAMPEIUS. Madam, you'll find it so. You wrong your virtues</a>

<a id='line_1952'>    Out of himself?</a>
<a id='line_1953'>  CHAMBERLAIN. My lords, you speak your pleasures.</a>

<a id='line_1974'>  SUFFOLK. Most Strangely.</a>
<a id='line_1975'>  SURREY. O, how, how?</a>
<a id='line_1976'>  SUFFOLK. The Cardinal's letters to the Pope miscarried,</a>
<a id='line_1977'>    And came to th' eye o' th' King; wherein was read</a>
<a id='line_1978'>    How that the Cardinal did entreat his Holiness</a>
<a id='line_1979'>    To stay the judgment o' th' divorce; for if</a>
<a id='line_1980'>    It did take place, 'I do' quoth he 'perceive</a>

<a id='line_1984'>  SUFFOLK. Believe it.</a>
<a id='line_1985'>  SURREY. Will this work?</a>
<a id='line_1986'>  CHAMBERLAIN. The King in this perceives him how he coasts</a>

<a id='line_1988'>    All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic</a>

<a id='line_2010'>    There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose</a>

<a id='line_2016'>    The King cried 'Ha!' at this.</a>
<a id='line_2017'>  CHAMBERLAIN. Now, God incense him,</a>

<a id='line_2019'>  NORFOLK. But, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_2020'>    When returns Cranmer?</a>
<a id='line_2021'>  SUFFOLK. He is return'd in his opinions; which</a>
<a id='line_2022'>    Have satisfied the King for his divorce,</a>
<a id='line_2023'>    Together with all famous colleges</a>
<a id='line_2024'>    Almost in Christendom. Shortly, I believe,</a>
<a id='line_2025'>    His second marriage shall be publish'd, and</a>

<a id='line_2347'>    I will not taint my mouth with.</a>
<a id='line_2348'>  CHAMBERLAIN. O my lord,</a>
<a id='line_2349'>    Press not a falling man too far! 'Tis virtue.</a>
<a id='line_2350'>    His faults lie open to the laws; let them,</a>
<a id='line_2351'>    Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him</a>
<a id='line_2352'>    So little of his great self.</a>
<a id='line_2353'>  SURREY. I forgive him.</a>
<a id='line_2354'>  SUFFOLK. Lord Cardinal, the King's further pleasure is-</a>
<a id='line_2355'>    Because all those things you have done of late,</a>
<a id='line_2356'>    By your power legatine within this kingdom,</a>
<a id='line_2357'>    Fall into th' compass of a praemunire-</a>
<a id='line_2358'>    That therefore such a writ be sued against you:</a>
<a id='line_2359'>    To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,</a>
<a id='line_2360'>    Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be</a>
<a id='line_2361'>    Out of the King's protection. This is my charge.</a>
<a id='line_2362'>  NORFOLK. And so we'll leave you to your meditations</a>
<a id='line_2363'>    How to live better. For your stubborn answer</a>
<a id='line_2364'>    About the giving back the great seal to us,</a>
<a id='line_2365'>    The King shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.</a>
<a id='line_2366'>    So fare you well, my little good Lord Cardinal.</a>
<a id='line_2367'>                                                Exeunt all but WOLSEY</a>
<a id='line_2368'>  WOLSEY. So farewell to the little good you bear me.</a>
<a id='line_2369'>    Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness!</a>
<a id='line_2370'>    This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth</a>
<a id='line_2371'>    The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms</a>
<a id='line_2372'>    And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;</a>
<a id='line_2373'>    The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,</a>
<a id='line_2374'>    And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely</a>
<a id='line_2375'>    His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,</a>
<a id='line_2376'>    And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur'd,</a>
<a id='line_2377'>    Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,</a>
<a id='line_2378'>    This many summers in a sea of glory;</a>
<a id='line_2379'>    But far beyond my depth. My high-blown pride</a>
<a id='line_2380'>    At length broke under me, and now has left me,</a>
<a id='line_2381'>    Weary and old with service, to the mercy</a>
<a id='line_2382'>    Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.</a>
<a id='line_2383'>    Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye;</a>
<a id='line_2384'>    I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched</a>
<a id='line_2385'>    Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!</a>
<a id='line_2386'>    There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,</a>
<a id='line_2387'>    That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin</a>
<a id='line_2388'>    More pangs and fears than wars or women have;</a>
<a id='line_2389'>    And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,</a>
<a id='line_2390'>    Never to hope again.</a>
<a id='line_2391'></a>
<a id='line_2392'>         Enter CROMWELL, standing amazed</a>
<a id='line_2393'></a>
<a id='line_2394'>    Why, how now, Cromwell!</a>
<a id='line_2395'>  CROMWELL. I have no power to speak, sir.</a>
<a id='line_2396'>  WOLSEY. What, amaz'd</a>
<a id='line_2397'>    At my misfortunes? Can thy spirit wonder</a>
<a id='line_2398'>    A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,</a>
<a id='line_2399'>    I am fall'n indeed.</a>
<a id='line_2400'>  CROMWELL. How does your Grace?</a>
<a id='line_2401'>  WOLSEY. Why, well;</a>
<a id='line_2402'>    Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.</a>
<a id='line_2403'>    I know myself now, and I feel within me</a>
<a id='line_2404'>    A peace above all earthly dignities,</a>
<a id='line_2405'>    A still and quiet conscience. The King has cur'd me,</a>
<a id='line_2406'>    I humbly thank his Grace; and from these shoulders,</a>
<a id='line_2407'>    These ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken</a>
<a id='line_2408'>    A load would sink a navy-too much honour.</a>
<a id='line_2409'>    O, 'tis a burden, Cromwell, 'tis a burden</a>
<a id='line_2410'>    Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!</a>
<a id='line_2411'>  CROMWELL. I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it.</a>
<a id='line_2412'>  WOLSEY. I hope I have. I am able now, methinks,</a>
<a id='line_2413'>    Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,</a>
<a id='line_2414'>    To endure more miseries and greater far</a>
<a id='line_2415'>    Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.</a>
<a id='line_2416'>    What news abroad?</a>
<a id='line_2417'>  CROMWELL. The heaviest and the worst</a>
<a id='line_2418'>    Is your displeasure with the King.</a>
<a id='line_2419'>  WOLSEY. God bless him!</a>
<a id='line_2420'>  CROMWELL. The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen</a>
<a id='line_2421'>    Lord Chancellor in your place.</a>
<a id='line_2422'>  WOLSEY. That's somewhat sudden.</a>
<a id='line_2423'>    But he's a learned man. May he continue</a>
<a id='line_2424'>    Long in his Highness' favour, and do justice</a>
<a id='line_2425'>    For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones</a>
<a id='line_2426'>    When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,</a>
<a id='line_2427'>    May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on him!</a>
<a id='line_2428'>    What more?</a>
<a id='line_2429'>  CROMWELL. That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,</a>
<a id='line_2430'>    Install'd Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.</a>
<a id='line_2431'>  WOLSEY. That's news indeed.</a>
<a id='line_2432'>  CROMWELL. Last, that the Lady Anne,</a>
<a id='line_2433'>    Whom the King hath in secrecy long married,</a>
<a id='line_2434'>    This day was view'd in open as his queen,</a>
<a id='line_2435'>    Going to chapel; and the voice is now</a>
<a id='line_2436'>    Only about her coronation.</a>
<a id='line_2437'>  WOLSEY. There was the weight that pull'd me down.</a>
<a id='line_2438'>      O Cromwell,</a>
<a id='line_2439'>    The King has gone beyond me. All my glories</a>
<a id='line_2440'>    In that one woman I have lost for ever.</a>
<a id='line_2441'>    No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,</a>
<a id='line_2442'>    Or gild again the noble troops that waited</a>
<a id='line_2443'>    Upon my smiles. Go get thee from me, Cromwell;</a>
<a id='line_2444'>    I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now</a>
<a id='line_2445'>    To be thy lord and master. Seek the King;</a>
<a id='line_2446'>    That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him</a>
<a id='line_2447'>    What and how true thou art. He will advance thee;</a>
<a id='line_2448'>    Some little memory of me will stir him-</a>
<a id='line_2449'>    I know his noble nature-not to let</a>
<a id='line_2450'>    Thy hopeful service perish too. Good Cromwell,</a>
<a id='line_2451'>    Neglect him not; make use now, and provide</a>
<a id='line_2452'>    For thine own future safety.</a>
<a id='line_2453'>  CROMWELL. O my lord,</a>
<a id='line_2454'>    Must I then leave you? Must I needs forgo</a>
<a id='line_2455'>    So good, so noble, and so true a master?</a>
<a id='line_2456'>    Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,</a>
<a id='line_2457'>    With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.</a>
<a id='line_2458'>    The King shall have my service; but my prayers</a>
<a id='line_2459'>    For ever and for ever shall be yours.</a>
<a id='line_2460'>  WOLSEY. Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear</a>
<a id='line_2461'>    In all my miseries; but thou hast forc'd me,</a>
<a id='line_2462'>    Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.</a>
<a id='line_2463'>    Let's dry our eyes; and thus far hear me, Cromwell,</a>
<a id='line_2464'>    And when I am forgotten, as I shall be,</a>
<a id='line_2465'>    And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention</a>
<a id='line_2466'>    Of me more must be heard of, say I taught thee-</a>
<a id='line_2467'>    Say Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,</a>
<a id='line_2468'>    And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,</a>
<a id='line_2469'>    Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in-</a>
<a id='line_2470'>    A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.</a>
<a id='line_2471'>    Mark but my fall and that that ruin'd me.</a>
<a id='line_2472'>    Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:</a>
<a id='line_2473'>    By that sin fell the angels. How can man then,</a>
<a id='line_2474'>    The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?</a>
<a id='line_2475'>    Love thyself last; cherish those hearts that hate thee;</a>
<a id='line_2476'>    Corruption wins not more than honesty.</a>
<a id='line_2477'>    Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace</a>
<a id='line_2478'>    To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not;</a>
<a id='line_2479'>    Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,</a>
<a id='line_2480'>    Thy God's, and truth's; then, if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,</a>
<a id='line_2481'>    Thou fall'st a blessed martyr!</a>
<a id='line_2482'>    Serve the King, and-prithee lead me in.</a>
<a id='line_2483'>    There take an inventory of all I have</a>
<a id='line_2484'>    To the last penny; 'tis the King's. My robe,</a>
<a id='line_2485'>    And my integrity to heaven, is all</a>
<a id='line_2486'>    I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!</a>
<a id='line_2487'>    Had I but serv'd my God with half the zeal</a>
<a id='line_2488'>    I serv'd my King, he would not in mine age</a>
<a id='line_2489'>    Have left me naked to mine enemies.</a>
<a id='line_2490'>  CROMWELL. Good sir, have patience.</a>
<a id='line_2491'>  WOLSEY. So I have. Farewell</a>
<a id='line_2492'>    The hopes of court! My hopes in heaven do dwell.           Exeunt</a>

<a id='line_2498'>Enter two GENTLEMEN, meeting one another</a>

<a id='line_2501'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. So are you.</a>
<a id='line_2502'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. You come to take your stand here, and</a>
<a id='line_2503'>      behold</a>
<a id='line_2504'>    The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?</a>
<a id='line_2505'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis all my business. At our last encounter</a>
<a id='line_2506'>    The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.</a>
<a id='line_2507'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. 'Tis very true. But that time offer'd</a>
<a id='line_2508'>      sorrow;</a>
<a id='line_2509'>    This, general joy.</a>
<a id='line_2510'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis well. The citizens,</a>
<a id='line_2511'>    I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds-</a>
<a id='line_2512'>    As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward-</a>
<a id='line_2513'>    In celebration of this day with shows,</a>
<a id='line_2514'>    Pageants, and sights of honour.</a>
<a id='line_2515'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Never greater,</a>
<a id='line_2516'>    Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.</a>
<a id='line_2517'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. May I be bold to ask what that contains,</a>
<a id='line_2518'>    That paper in your hand?</a>
<a id='line_2519'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes; 'tis the list</a>
<a id='line_2520'>    Of those that claim their offices this day,</a>
<a id='line_2521'>    By custom of the coronation.</a>
<a id='line_2522'>    The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims</a>
<a id='line_2523'>    To be High Steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,</a>
<a id='line_2524'>    He to be Earl Marshal. You may read the rest.</a>
<a id='line_2525'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I thank you, sir; had I not known</a>
<a id='line_2526'>      those customs,</a>
<a id='line_2527'>    I should have been beholding to your paper.</a>
<a id='line_2528'>    But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine,</a>
<a id='line_2529'>    The Princess Dowager? How goes her business?</a>
<a id='line_2530'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. That I can tell you too. The Archbishop</a>
<a id='line_2531'>    Of Canterbury, accompanied with other</a>
<a id='line_2532'>    Learned and reverend fathers of his order,</a>
<a id='line_2533'>    Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles of</a>
<a id='line_2534'>    From Ampthill, where the Princess lay; to which</a>
<a id='line_2535'>    She was often cited by them, but appear'd not.</a>
<a id='line_2536'>    And, to be short, for not appearance and</a>
<a id='line_2537'>    The King's late scruple, by the main assent</a>
<a id='line_2538'>    Of all these learned men, she was divorc'd,</a>
<a id='line_2539'>    And the late marriage made of none effect;</a>
<a id='line_2540'>    Since which she was removed to Kimbolton,</a>
<a id='line_2541'>    Where she remains now sick.</a>

<a id='line_2552'>    5. MAYOR OF LONDON, bearing the mace. Then GARTER, in</a>

<a id='line_2598'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. It is; and all the rest are countesses.</a>
<a id='line_2599'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed,</a>

<a id='line_2601'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. No more of that.</a>

<a id='line_2615'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Good sir, speak it to us.</a>

<a id='line_2620'>    To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,</a>
<a id='line_2621'>    In a rich chair of state, opposing freely</a>
<a id='line_2622'>    The beauty of her person to the people.</a>
<a id='line_2623'>    Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman</a>
<a id='line_2624'>    That ever lay by man; which when the people</a>

<a id='line_2626'>    As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,</a>
<a id='line_2627'>    As loud, and to as many tunes; hats, cloaks-</a>
<a id='line_2628'>    Doublets, I think-flew up, and had their faces</a>

<a id='line_2630'>    I never saw before. Great-bellied women,</a>
<a id='line_2631'>    That had not half a week to go, like rams</a>
<a id='line_2632'>    In the old time of war, would shake the press,</a>
<a id='line_2633'>    And make 'em reel before 'em. No man living</a>
<a id='line_2634'>    Could say 'This is my wife' there, all were woven</a>
<a id='line_2635'>    So strangely in one piece.</a>
<a id='line_2636'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. But what follow'd?</a>
<a id='line_2637'>  THIRD GENTLEMAN. At length her Grace rose, and with</a>
<a id='line_2638'>      modest paces</a>
<a id='line_2639'>    Came to the altar, where she kneel'd, and saintlike</a>
<a id='line_2640'>    Cast her fair eyes to heaven, and pray'd devoutly.</a>
<a id='line_2641'>    Then rose again, and bow'd her to the people;</a>
<a id='line_2642'>    When by the Archbishop of Canterbury</a>
<a id='line_2643'>    She had all the royal makings of a queen:</a>
<a id='line_2644'>    As holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown,</a>
<a id='line_2645'>    The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems</a>
<a id='line_2646'>    Laid nobly on her; which perform'd, the choir,</a>
<a id='line_2647'>    With all the choicest music of the kingdom,</a>
<a id='line_2648'>    Together sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted,</a>
<a id='line_2649'>    And with the same full state pac'd back again</a>
<a id='line_2650'>    To York Place, where the feast is held.</a>
<a id='line_2651'>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_2652'>    You must no more call it York Place: that's past:</a>
<a id='line_2653'>    For since the Cardinal fell that title's lost.</a>
<a id='line_2654'>    'Tis now the King's, and called Whitehall.</a>
<a id='line_2655'>  THIRD GENTLEMAN. I know it;</a>
<a id='line_2656'>    But 'tis so lately alter'd that the old name</a>
<a id='line_2657'>    Is fresh about me.</a>
<a id='line_2658'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. What two reverend bishops</a>
<a id='line_2659'>    Were those that went on each side of the Queen?</a>
<a id='line_2660'>  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Stokesly and Gardiner: the one of Winchester,</a>
<a id='line_2661'>    Newly preferr'd from the King's secretary;</a>
<a id='line_2662'>    The other, London.</a>
<a id='line_2663'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. He of Winchester</a>
<a id='line_2664'>    Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop's,</a>
<a id='line_2665'>    The virtuous Cranmer.</a>
<a id='line_2666'>  THIRD GENTLEMAN. All the land knows that;</a>
<a id='line_2667'>    However, yet there is no great breach. When it comes,</a>
<a id='line_2668'>    Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.</a>
<a id='line_2669'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Who may that be, I pray you?</a>
<a id='line_2670'>  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Thomas Cromwell,</a>
<a id='line_2671'>    A man in much esteem with th' King, and truly</a>
<a id='line_2672'>    A worthy friend. The King has made him Master</a>

<a id='line_2674'>    And one, already, of the Privy Council.</a>
<a id='line_2675'>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. He will deserve more.</a>

<a id='line_2691'>  KATHARINE. O Griffith, sick to death!</a>
<a id='line_2692'>    My legs like loaden branches bow to th' earth,</a>
<a id='line_2693'>    Willing to leave their burden. Reach a chair.</a>
<a id='line_2694'>    So-now, methinks, I feel a little ease.</a>
<a id='line_2695'>    Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,</a>
<a id='line_2696'>    That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey,</a>
<a id='line_2697'>    Was dead?</a>
<a id='line_2698'>  GRIFFITH. Yes, madam; but I think your Grace,</a>
<a id='line_2699'>    Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.</a>
<a id='line_2700'>  KATHARINE. Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died.</a>
<a id='line_2701'>    If well, he stepp'd before me, happily,</a>
<a id='line_2702'>    For my example.</a>
<a id='line_2703'>  GRIFFITH. Well, the voice goes, madam;</a>
<a id='line_2704'>    For after the stout Earl Northumberland</a>
<a id='line_2705'>    Arrested him at York and brought him forward,</a>
<a id='line_2706'>    As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,</a>
<a id='line_2707'>    He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill</a>
<a id='line_2708'>    He could not sit his mule.</a>
<a id='line_2709'>  KATHARINE. Alas, poor man!</a>
<a id='line_2710'>  GRIFFITH. At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,</a>
<a id='line_2711'>    Lodg'd in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,</a>
<a id='line_2712'>    With all his covent, honourably receiv'd him;</a>
<a id='line_2713'>    To whom he gave these words: 'O father Abbot,</a>
<a id='line_2714'>    An old man, broken with the storms of state,</a>
<a id='line_2715'>    Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;</a>
<a id='line_2716'>    Give him a little earth for charity!'</a>
<a id='line_2717'>    So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness</a>
<a id='line_2718'>    Pursu'd him still And three nights after this,</a>
<a id='line_2719'>    About the hour of eight-which he himself</a>
<a id='line_2720'>    Foretold should be his last-full of repentance,</a>
<a id='line_2721'>    Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,</a>
<a id='line_2722'>    He gave his honours to the world again,</a>
<a id='line_2723'>    His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.</a>
<a id='line_2724'>  KATHARINE. So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!</a>
<a id='line_2725'>    Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,</a>
<a id='line_2726'>    And yet with charity. He was a man</a>
<a id='line_2727'>    Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking</a>
<a id='line_2728'>    Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,</a>
<a id='line_2729'>    Tied all the kingdom. Simony was fair play;</a>
<a id='line_2730'>    His own opinion was his law. I' th' presence</a>
<a id='line_2731'>    He would say untruths, and be ever double</a>
<a id='line_2732'>    Both in his words and meaning. He was never,</a>
<a id='line_2733'>    But where he meant to ruin, pitiful.</a>
<a id='line_2734'>    His promises were, as he then was, mighty;</a>
<a id='line_2735'>    But his performance, as he is now, nothing.</a>
<a id='line_2736'>    Of his own body he was ill, and gave</a>
<a id='line_2737'>    The clergy ill example.</a>
<a id='line_2738'>  GRIFFITH. Noble madam,</a>
<a id='line_2739'>    Men's evil manners live in brass: their virtues</a>
<a id='line_2740'>    We write in water. May it please your Highness</a>
<a id='line_2741'>    To hear me speak his good now?</a>
<a id='line_2742'>  KATHARINE. Yes, good Griffith;</a>
<a id='line_2743'>    I were malicious else.</a>
<a id='line_2744'>  GRIFFITH. This Cardinal,</a>
<a id='line_2745'>    Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly</a>
<a id='line_2746'>    Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.</a>
<a id='line_2747'>    He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;</a>
<a id='line_2748'>    Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading;</a>
<a id='line_2749'>    Lofty and sour to them that lov'd him not,</a>
<a id='line_2750'>    But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.</a>
<a id='line_2751'>    And though he were unsatisfied in getting-</a>
<a id='line_2752'>    Which was a sin-yet in bestowing, madam,</a>
<a id='line_2753'>    He was most princely: ever witness for him</a>
<a id='line_2754'>    Those twins of learning that he rais'd in you,</a>
<a id='line_2755'>    Ipswich and Oxford! One of which fell with him,</a>
<a id='line_2756'>    Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;</a>
<a id='line_2757'>    The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous,</a>
<a id='line_2758'>    So excellent in art, and still so rising,</a>
<a id='line_2759'>    That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.</a>
<a id='line_2760'>    His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;</a>
<a id='line_2761'>    For then, and not till then, he felt himself,</a>
<a id='line_2762'>    And found the blessedness of being little.</a>
<a id='line_2763'>    And, to add greater honours to his age</a>
<a id='line_2764'>    Than man could give him, he died fearing God.</a>
<a id='line_2765'>  KATHARINE. After my death I wish no other herald,</a>
<a id='line_2766'>    No other speaker of my living actions,</a>
<a id='line_2767'>    To keep mine honour from corruption,</a>
<a id='line_2768'>    But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.</a>
<a id='line_2769'>    Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,</a>
<a id='line_2770'>    With thy religious truth and modesty,</a>

<a id='line_2785'>      golden vizards on their faces; branches of bays or palm in their</a>

<a id='line_2787'>      changes, the first two hold a spare garland over her head, at</a>
<a id='line_2788'>      which the other four make reverent curtsies. Then the two that</a>
<a id='line_2789'>      held the garland deliver the same to the other next two, who</a>
<a id='line_2790'>      observe the same order in their changes, and holding the garland</a>
<a id='line_2791'>      over her head; which done, they deliver the same garland to the</a>
<a id='line_2792'>      last two, who likewise observe the same order; at which, as it</a>
<a id='line_2793'>      were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep signs of rejoicing,</a>
<a id='line_2794'>      and holdeth up her hands to heaven. And so in their dancing</a>
<a id='line_2795'>      vanish, carrying the garland with them. The music continues</a>

<a id='line_3204'>the state. Enter LORD CHANCELLOR, places himself at the upper end of</a>
<a id='line_3205'>the table on the left band, a seat being left void above him, as for</a>
<a id='line_3206'>Canterbury's seat. DUKE OF SUFFOLK, DUKE OF NORFOLK, SURREY, LORD</a>
<a id='line_3207'>CHAMBERLAIN, GARDINER, seat themselves in order on each side; CROMWELL</a>
<a id='line_3208'>at lower end, as secretary. KEEPER at the door</a>

<a id='line_3210'>  CHANCELLOR. Speak to the business, master secretary;</a>
<a id='line_3211'>    Why are we met in council?</a>
<a id='line_3212'>  CROMWELL. Please your honours,</a>
<a id='line_3213'>    The chief cause concerns his Grace of Canterbury.</a>
<a id='line_3214'>  GARDINER. Has he had knowledge of it?</a>
<a id='line_3215'>  CROMWELL. Yes.</a>
<a id='line_3216'>  NORFOLK. Who waits there?</a>
<a id='line_3217'>  KEEPER. Without, my noble lords?</a>
<a id='line_3218'>  GARDINER. Yes.</a>
<a id='line_3219'>  KEEPER. My Lord Archbishop;</a>
<a id='line_3220'>    And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.</a>
<a id='line_3221'>  CHANCELLOR. Let him come in.</a>
<a id='line_3222'>  KEEPER. Your Grace may enter now.</a>

<a id='line_3224'>      CRANMER approaches the Council table</a>
<a id='line_3225'></a>
<a id='line_3226'>  CHANCELLOR. My good Lord Archbishop, I am very sorry</a>
<a id='line_3227'>    To sit here at this present, and behold</a>
<a id='line_3228'>    That chair stand empty; but we all are men,</a>
<a id='line_3229'>    In our own natures frail and capable</a>
<a id='line_3230'>    Of our flesh; few are angels; out of which frailty</a>
<a id='line_3231'>    And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,</a>
<a id='line_3232'>    Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a little,</a>
<a id='line_3233'>    Toward the King first, then his laws, in filling</a>
<a id='line_3234'>    The whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains-</a>
<a id='line_3235'>    For so we are inform'd-with new opinions,</a>
<a id='line_3236'>    Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,</a>
<a id='line_3237'>    And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.</a>
<a id='line_3238'>  GARDINER. Which reformation must be sudden too,</a>
<a id='line_3239'>    My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses</a>
<a id='line_3240'>    Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle,</a>
<a id='line_3241'>    But stop their mouth with stubborn bits and spur 'em</a>
<a id='line_3242'>    Till they obey the manage. If we suffer,</a>
<a id='line_3243'>    Out of our easiness and childish pity</a>
<a id='line_3244'>    To one man's honour, this contagious sickness,</a>
<a id='line_3245'>    Farewell all physic; and what follows then?</a>
<a id='line_3246'>    Commotions, uproars, with a general taint</a>
<a id='line_3247'>    Of the whole state; as of late days our neighbours,</a>
<a id='line_3248'>    The upper Germany, can dearly witness,</a>
<a id='line_3249'>    Yet freshly pitied in our memories.</a>
<a id='line_3250'>  CRANMER. My good lords, hitherto in all the progress</a>
<a id='line_3251'>    Both of my life and office, I have labour'd,</a>
<a id='line_3252'>    And with no little study, that my teaching</a>
<a id='line_3253'>    And the strong course of my authority</a>
<a id='line_3254'>    Might go one way, and safely; and the end</a>
<a id='line_3255'>    Was ever to do well. Nor is there living-</a>
<a id='line_3256'>    I speak it with a single heart, my lords-</a>
<a id='line_3257'>    A man that more detests, more stirs against,</a>
<a id='line_3258'>    Both in his private conscience and his place,</a>
<a id='line_3259'>    Defacers of a public peace than I do.</a>
<a id='line_3260'>    Pray heaven the King may never find a heart</a>
<a id='line_3261'>    With less allegiance in it! Men that make</a>
<a id='line_3262'>    Envy and crooked malice nourishment</a>
<a id='line_3263'>    Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships</a>
<a id='line_3264'>    That, in this case of justice, my accusers,</a>
<a id='line_3265'>    Be what they will, may stand forth face to face</a>
<a id='line_3266'>    And freely urge against me.</a>
<a id='line_3267'>  SUFFOLK. Nay, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_3268'>    That cannot be; you are a councillor,</a>
<a id='line_3269'>    And by that virtue no man dare accuse you.</a>
<a id='line_3270'>  GARDINER. My lord, because we have business of more moment,</a>
<a id='line_3271'>    We will be short with you. 'Tis his Highness' pleasure</a>
<a id='line_3272'>    And our consent, for better trial of you,</a>
<a id='line_3273'>    From hence you be committed to the Tower;</a>
<a id='line_3274'>    Where, being but a private man again,</a>
<a id='line_3275'>    You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,</a>
<a id='line_3276'>    More than, I fear, you are provided for.</a>
<a id='line_3277'>  CRANMER. Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you;</a>
<a id='line_3278'>    You are always my good friend; if your will pass,</a>
<a id='line_3279'>    I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,</a>
<a id='line_3280'>    You are so merciful. I see your end-</a>
<a id='line_3281'>    'Tis my undoing. Love and meekness, lord,</a>
<a id='line_3282'>    Become a churchman better than ambition;</a>
<a id='line_3283'>    Win straying souls with modesty again,</a>
<a id='line_3284'>    Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,</a>
<a id='line_3285'>    Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,</a>
<a id='line_3286'>    I make as little doubt as you do conscience</a>
<a id='line_3287'>    In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,</a>
<a id='line_3288'>    But reverence to your calling makes me modest.</a>
<a id='line_3289'>  GARDINER. My lord, my lord, you are a sectary;</a>
<a id='line_3290'>    That's the plain truth. Your painted gloss discovers,</a>
<a id='line_3291'>    To men that understand you, words and weakness.</a>
<a id='line_3292'>  CROMWELL. My Lord of Winchester, y'are a little,</a>
<a id='line_3293'>    By your good favour, too sharp; men so noble,</a>
<a id='line_3294'>    However faulty, yet should find respect</a>
<a id='line_3295'>    For what they have been; 'tis a cruelty</a>
<a id='line_3296'>    To load a falling man.</a>
<a id='line_3297'>  GARDINER. Good Master Secretary,</a>
<a id='line_3298'>    I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst</a>
<a id='line_3299'>    Of all this table, say so.</a>
<a id='line_3300'>  CROMWELL. Why, my lord?</a>
<a id='line_3301'>  GARDINER. Do not I know you for a favourer</a>
<a id='line_3302'>    Of this new sect? Ye are not sound.</a>
<a id='line_3303'>  CROMWELL. Not sound?</a>
<a id='line_3304'>  GARDINER. Not sound, I say.</a>
<a id='line_3305'>  CROMWELL. Would you were half so honest!</a>
<a id='line_3306'>    Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.</a>
<a id='line_3307'>  GARDINER. I shall remember this bold language.</a>
<a id='line_3308'>  CROMWELL. Do.</a>
<a id='line_3309'>    Remember your bold life too.</a>
<a id='line_3310'>  CHANCELLOR. This is too much;</a>
<a id='line_3311'>    Forbear, for shame, my lords.</a>
<a id='line_3312'>  GARDINER. I have done.</a>
<a id='line_3313'>  CROMWELL. And I.</a>
<a id='line_3314'>  CHANCELLOR. Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,</a>
<a id='line_3315'>    I take it, by all voices, that forthwith</a>
<a id='line_3316'>    You be convey'd to th' Tower a prisoner;</a>
<a id='line_3317'>    There to remain till the King's further pleasure</a>
<a id='line_3318'>    Be known unto us. Are you all agreed, lords?</a>
<a id='line_3319'>  ALL. We are.</a>
<a id='line_3320'>  CRANMER. Is there no other way of mercy,</a>
<a id='line_3321'>    But I must needs to th' Tower, my lords?</a>
<a id='line_3322'>  GARDINER. What other</a>
<a id='line_3323'>    Would you expect? You are strangely troublesome.</a>
<a id='line_3324'>    Let some o' th' guard be ready there.</a>
<a id='line_3325'></a>
<a id='line_3326'>           Enter the guard</a>
<a id='line_3327'></a>
<a id='line_3328'>  CRANMER. For me?</a>
<a id='line_3329'>    Must I go like a traitor thither?</a>
<a id='line_3330'>  GARDINER. Receive him,</a>
<a id='line_3331'>    And see him safe i' th' Tower.</a>
<a id='line_3332'>  CRANMER. Stay, good my lords,</a>
<a id='line_3333'>    I have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords;</a>
<a id='line_3334'>    By virtue of that ring I take my cause</a>
<a id='line_3335'>    Out of the gripes of cruel men and give it</a>
<a id='line_3336'>    To a most noble judge, the King my master.</a>
<a id='line_3337'>  CHAMBERLAIN. This is the King's ring.</a>
<a id='line_3338'>  SURREY. 'Tis no counterfeit.</a>
<a id='line_3339'>  SUFFOLK. 'Tis the right ring, by heav'n. I told ye all,</a>
<a id='line_3340'>    When we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,</a>
<a id='line_3341'>    'Twould fall upon ourselves.</a>
<a id='line_3342'>  NORFOLK. Do you think, my lords,</a>
<a id='line_3343'>    The King will suffer but the little finger</a>
<a id='line_3344'>    Of this man to be vex'd?</a>
<a id='line_3345'>  CHAMBERLAIN. 'Tis now too certain;</a>
<a id='line_3346'>    How much more is his life in value with him!</a>
<a id='line_3347'>    Would I were fairly out on't!</a>
<a id='line_3348'>  CROMWELL. My mind gave me,</a>
<a id='line_3349'>    In seeking tales and informations</a>
<a id='line_3350'>    Against this man-whose honesty the devil</a>
<a id='line_3351'>    And his disciples only envy at-</a>
<a id='line_3352'>    Ye blew the fire that burns ye. Now have at ye!</a>
<a id='line_3353'></a>
<a id='line_3354'>      Enter the KING frowning on them; he takes his seat</a>
<a id='line_3355'></a>
<a id='line_3356'>  GARDINER. Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven</a>
<a id='line_3357'>    In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince;</a>
<a id='line_3358'>    Not only good and wise but most religious;</a>
<a id='line_3359'>    One that in all obedience makes the church</a>
<a id='line_3360'>    The chief aim of his honour and, to strengthen</a>
<a id='line_3361'>    That holy duty, out of dear respect,</a>
<a id='line_3362'>    His royal self in judgment comes to hear</a>
<a id='line_3363'>    The cause betwixt her and this great offender.</a>
<a id='line_3364'>  KING. You were ever good at sudden commendations,</a>
<a id='line_3365'>    Bishop of Winchester. But know I come not</a>
<a id='line_3366'>    To hear such flattery now, and in my presence</a>
<a id='line_3367'>    They are too thin and bare to hide offences.</a>
<a id='line_3368'>    To me you cannot reach you play the spaniel,</a>
<a id='line_3369'>    And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;</a>
<a id='line_3370'>    But whatsoe'er thou tak'st me for, I'm sure</a>
<a id='line_3371'>    Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.</a>
<a id='line_3372'>    [To CRANMER]  Good man, sit down. Now let me see the proudest</a>
<a id='line_3373'>    He that dares most but wag his finger at thee.</a>
<a id='line_3374'>    By all that's holy, he had better starve</a>
<a id='line_3375'>    Than but once think this place becomes thee not.</a>
<a id='line_3376'>  SURREY. May it please your Grace-</a>
<a id='line_3377'>  KING. No, sir, it does not please me.</a>
<a id='line_3378'>    I had thought I had had men of some understanding</a>
<a id='line_3379'>    And wisdom of my Council; but I find none.</a>
<a id='line_3380'>    Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,</a>
<a id='line_3381'>    This good man-few of you deserve that title-</a>
<a id='line_3382'>    This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy</a>
<a id='line_3383'>    At chamber door? and one as great as you are?</a>
<a id='line_3384'>    Why, what a shame was this! Did my commission</a>
<a id='line_3385'>    Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye</a>
<a id='line_3386'>    Power as he was a councillor to try him,</a>
<a id='line_3387'>    Not as a groom. There's some of ye, I see,</a>
<a id='line_3388'>    More out of malice than integrity,</a>
<a id='line_3389'>    Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean;</a>
<a id='line_3390'>    Which ye shall never have while I live.</a>
<a id='line_3391'>  CHANCELLOR. Thus far,</a>
<a id='line_3392'>    My most dread sovereign, may it like your Grace</a>
<a id='line_3393'>    To let my tongue excuse all. What was purpos'd</a>
<a id='line_3394'>    concerning his imprisonment was rather-</a>
<a id='line_3395'>    If there be faith in men-meant for his trial</a>
<a id='line_3396'>    And fair purgation to the world, than malice,</a>
<a id='line_3397'>    I'm sure, in me.</a>
<a id='line_3398'>  KING. Well, well, my lords, respect him;</a>
<a id='line_3399'>    Take him, and use him well, he's worthy of it.</a>
<a id='line_3400'>    I will say thus much for him: if a prince</a>
<a id='line_3401'>    May be beholding to a subject,</a>
<a id='line_3402'>    Am for his love and service so to him.</a>
<a id='line_3403'>    Make me no more ado, but all embrace him;</a>
<a id='line_3404'>    Be friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of Canterbury,</a>
<a id='line_3405'>    I have a suit which you must not deny me:</a>
<a id='line_3406'>    That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism;</a>
<a id='line_3407'>    You must be godfather, and answer for her.</a>
<a id='line_3408'>  CRANMER. The greatest monarch now alive may glory</a>
<a id='line_3409'>    In such an honour; how may I deserve it,</a>
<a id='line_3410'>    That am a poor and humble subject to you?</a>
<a id='line_3411'>  KING. Come, come, my lord, you'd spare your spoons. You</a>
<a id='line_3412'>      shall have</a>
<a id='line_3413'>    Two noble partners with you: the old Duchess of Norfolk</a>
<a id='line_3414'>    And Lady Marquis Dorset. Will these please you?</a>
<a id='line_3415'>    Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,</a>
<a id='line_3416'>    Embrace and love this man.</a>
<a id='line_3417'>  GARDINER. With a true heart</a>
<a id='line_3418'>    And brother-love I do it.</a>
<a id='line_3419'>  CRANMER. And let heaven</a>
<a id='line_3420'>    Witness how dear I hold this confirmation.</a>
<a id='line_3421'>  KING. Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart.</a>
<a id='line_3422'>    The common voice, I see, is verified</a>
<a id='line_3423'>    Of thee, which says thus: 'Do my Lord of Canterbury</a>

<a id='line_3476'>    reign in's nose; all that stand about him are under the line,</a>
<a id='line_3477'>    they need no other penance. That fire-drake did I hit three</a>
<a id='line_3478'>    times on the head, and three times was his nose discharged</a>

<a id='line_3484'>    when I might see from far some forty truncheoners draw</a>
<a id='line_3485'>    to her succour, which were the hope o' th' Strand, where</a>
<a id='line_3486'>    she was quartered. They fell on; I made good my place.</a>
<a id='line_3487'>    At length they came to th' broomstaff to me; I defied 'em</a>
<a id='line_3488'>    still; when suddenly a file of boys behind 'em, loose shot,</a>
<a id='line_3489'>    deliver'd such a show'r of pebbles that I was fain to draw</a>

<a id='line_3567'>    This royal infant-heaven still move about her!-</a>
<a id='line_3568'>    Though in her cradle, yet now promises</a>
<a id='line_3569'>    Upon this land a thousand blessings,</a>

<a id='line_3577'>    With all the virtues that attend the good,</a>

<a id='line_3579'>    Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her;</a>
