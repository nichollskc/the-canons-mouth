                    <a id='line_0'>Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs.—Part I.</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'>     The Conquest Of Persia, Syria, Egypt, Africa, And Spain, By The</a>
<a id='line_3'>     Arabs Or Saracens.—Empire Of The Caliphs, Or Successors Of</a>
<a id='line_4'>     Mahomet.—State Of The Christians, &c., Under Their Government.</a>
<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'>      The revolution of Arabia had not changed the character of the</a>
<a id='line_7'>      Arabs: the death of Mahomet was the signal of independence; and</a>
<a id='line_8'>      the hasty structure of his power and religion tottered to its</a>
<a id='line_9'>      foundations. A small and faithful band of his primitive disciples</a>
<a id='line_10'>      had listened to his eloquence, and shared his distress; had fled</a>
<a id='line_11'>      with the apostle from the persecution of Mecca, or had received</a>
<a id='line_12'>      the fugitive in the walls of Medina. The increasing myriads, who</a>
<a id='line_13'>      acknowledged Mahomet as their king and prophet, had been</a>
<a id='line_14'>      compelled by his arms, or allured by his prosperity. The</a>
<a id='line_15'>      polytheists were confounded by the simple idea of a solitary and</a>
<a id='line_16'>      invisible God; the pride of the Christians and Jews disdained the</a>
<a id='line_17'>      yoke of a mortal and contemporary legislator. The habits of faith</a>
<a id='line_18'>      and obedience were not sufficiently confirmed; and many of the</a>
<a id='line_19'>      new converts regretted the venerable antiquity of the law of</a>
<a id='line_20'>      Moses, or the rites and mysteries of the Catholic church; or the</a>
<a id='line_21'>      idols, the sacrifices, the joyous festivals, of their Pagan</a>
<a id='line_22'>      ancestors. The jarring interests and hereditary feuds of the</a>
<a id='line_23'>      Arabian tribes had not yet coalesced in a system of union and</a>
<a id='line_24'>      subordination; and the Barbarians were impatient of the mildest</a>
<a id='line_25'>      and most salutary laws that curbed their passions, or violated</a>
<a id='line_26'>      their customs. They submitted with reluctance to the religious</a>
<a id='line_27'>      precepts of the Koran, the abstinence from wine, the fast of the</a>
<a id='line_28'>      Ramadan, and the daily repetition of five prayers; and the alms</a>
<a id='line_29'>      and tithes, which were collected for the treasury of Medina,</a>
<a id='line_30'>      could be distinguished only by a name from the payment of a</a>
<a id='line_31'>      perpetual and ignominious tribute. The example of Mahomet had</a>
<a id='line_32'>      excited a spirit of fanaticism or imposture, and several of his</a>
<a id='line_33'>      rivals presumed to imitate the conduct, and defy the authority,</a>
<a id='line_34'>      of the living prophet. At the head of the fugitives and</a>
<a id='line_35'>      auxiliaries, the first caliph was reduced to the cities of Mecca,</a>
<a id='line_36'>      Medina, and Tayef; and perhaps the Koreish would have restored</a>
<a id='line_37'>      the idols of the Caaba, if their levity had not been checked by a</a>
<a id='line_38'>      seasonable reproof. “Ye men of Mecca, will ye be the last to</a>
<a id='line_39'>      embrace, and the first to abandon, the religion of Islam?” After</a>
<a id='line_40'>      exhorting the Moslems to confide in the aid of God and his</a>
<a id='line_41'>      apostle, Abubeker resolved, by a vigorous attack, to prevent the</a>
<a id='line_42'>      junction of the rebels. The women and children were safely lodged</a>
<a id='line_43'>      in the cavities of the mountains: the warriors, marching under</a>
<a id='line_44'>      eleven banners, diffused the terror of their arms; and the</a>
<a id='line_45'>      appearance of a military force revived and confirmed the loyalty</a>
<a id='line_46'>      of the faithful. The inconstant tribes accepted, with humble</a>
<a id='line_47'>      repentance, the duties of prayer, and fasting, and alms; and,</a>
<a id='line_48'>      after some examples of success and severity, the most daring</a>
<a id='line_49'>      apostates fell prostrate before the sword of the Lord and of</a>
<a id='line_50'>      Caled. In the fertile province of Yemanah, 1 between the Red Sea</a>
<a id='line_51'>      and the Gulf of Persia, in a city not inferior to Medina itself,</a>
<a id='line_52'>      a powerful chief (his name was Moseilama) had assumed the</a>
<a id='line_53'>      character of a prophet, and the tribe of Hanifa listened to his</a>
<a id='line_54'>      voice. A female prophetess 1111 was attracted by his reputation;</a>
<a id='line_55'>      the decencies of words and actions were spurned by these</a>
<a id='line_56'>      favorites of Heaven; 2 and they employed several days in mystic</a>
<a id='line_57'>      and amorous converse. An obscure sentence of his Koran, or book,</a>
<a id='line_58'>      is yet extant; 3 and in the pride of his mission, Moseilama</a>
<a id='line_59'>      condescended to offer a partition of the earth. The proposal was</a>
<a id='line_60'>      answered by Mahomet with contempt; but the rapid progress of the</a>
<a id='line_61'>      impostor awakened the fears of his successor: forty thousand</a>
<a id='line_62'>      Moslems were assembled under the standard of Caled; and the</a>
<a id='line_63'>      existence of their faith was resigned to the event of a decisive</a>
<a id='line_64'>      battle. 3111 In the first action they were repulsed by the loss</a>
<a id='line_65'>      of twelve hundred men; but the skill and perseverance of their</a>
<a id='line_66'>      general prevailed; their defeat was avenged by the slaughter of</a>
<a id='line_67'>      ten thousand infidels; and Moseilama himself was pierced by an</a>
<a id='line_68'>      Aethiopian slave with the same javelin which had mortally wounded</a>
<a id='line_69'>      the uncle of Mahomet. The various rebels of Arabia without a</a>
<a id='line_70'>      chief or a cause, were speedily suppressed by the power and</a>
<a id='line_71'>      discipline of the rising monarchy; and the whole nation again</a>
<a id='line_72'>      professed, and more steadfastly held, the religion of the Koran.</a>
<a id='line_73'>      The ambition of the caliphs provided an immediate exercise for</a>
<a id='line_74'>      the restless spirit of the Saracens: their valor was united in</a>
<a id='line_75'>      the prosecution of a holy war; and their enthusiasm was equally</a>
<a id='line_76'>      confirmed by opposition and victory.</a>

<a id='line_118'></a>
<a id='line_119'>      From the rapid conquests of the Saracens a presumption will</a>
<a id='line_120'>      naturally arise, that the caliphs 311 commanded in person the</a>
<a id='line_121'>      armies of the faithful, and sought the crown of martyrdom in the</a>
<a id='line_122'>      foremost ranks of the battle. The courage of Abubeker, 4 Omar, 5</a>
<a id='line_123'>      and Othman, 6 had indeed been tried in the persecution and wars</a>
<a id='line_124'>      of the prophet; and the personal assurance of paradise must have</a>
<a id='line_125'>      taught them to despise the pleasures and dangers of the present</a>
<a id='line_126'>      world. But they ascended the throne in a venerable or mature age;</a>
<a id='line_127'>      and esteemed the domestic cares of religion and justice the most</a>
<a id='line_128'>      important duties of a sovereign. Except the presence of Omar at</a>
<a id='line_129'>      the siege of Jerusalem, their longest expeditions were the</a>
<a id='line_130'>      frequent pilgrimage from Medina to Mecca; and they calmly</a>
<a id='line_131'>      received the tidings of victory as they prayed or preached before</a>
<a id='line_132'>      the sepulchre of the prophet. The austere and frugal measure of</a>
<a id='line_133'>      their lives was the effect of virtue or habit, and the pride of</a>
<a id='line_134'>      their simplicity insulted the vain magnificence of the kings of</a>
<a id='line_135'>      the earth. When Abubeker assumed the office of caliph, he</a>
<a id='line_136'>      enjoined his daughter Ayesha to take a strict account of his</a>
<a id='line_137'>      private patrimony, that it might be evident whether he were</a>
<a id='line_138'>      enriched or impoverished by the service of the state. He thought</a>
<a id='line_139'>      himself entitled to a stipend of three pieces of gold, with the</a>
<a id='line_140'>      sufficient maintenance of a single camel and a black slave; but</a>
<a id='line_141'>      on the Friday of each week he distributed the residue of his own</a>
<a id='line_142'>      and the public money, first to the most worthy, and then to the</a>
<a id='line_143'>      most indigent, of the Moslems. The remains of his wealth, a</a>
<a id='line_144'>      coarse garment, and five pieces of gold, were delivered to his</a>
<a id='line_145'>      successor, who lamented with a modest sigh his own inability to</a>
<a id='line_146'>      equal such an admirable model. Yet the abstinence and humility of</a>
<a id='line_147'>      Omar were not inferior to the virtues of Abubeker: his food</a>
<a id='line_148'>      consisted of barley bread or dates; his drink was water; he</a>
<a id='line_149'>      preached in a gown that was torn or tattered in twelve places;</a>
<a id='line_150'>      and the Persian satrap, who paid his homage to the conqueror,</a>
<a id='line_151'>      found him asleep among the beggars on the steps of the mosch of</a>
<a id='line_152'>      Medina. Oeeconomy is the source of liberality, and the increase</a>
<a id='line_153'>      of the revenue enabled Omar to establish a just and perpetual</a>
<a id='line_154'>      reward for the past and present services of the faithful.</a>
<a id='line_155'>      Careless of his own emolument, he assigned to Abbas, the uncle of</a>
<a id='line_156'>      the prophet, the first and most ample allowance of twenty-five</a>
<a id='line_157'>      thousand drachms or pieces of silver. Five thousand were allotted</a>
<a id='line_158'>      to each of the aged warriors, the relics of the field of Beder;</a>
<a id='line_159'>      and the last and meanest of the companions of Mahomet was</a>
<a id='line_160'>      distinguished by the annual reward of three thousand pieces. One</a>
<a id='line_161'>      thousand was the stipend of the veterans who had fought in the</a>
<a id='line_162'>      first battles against the Greeks and Persians; and the decreasing</a>
<a id='line_163'>      pay, as low as fifty pieces of silver, was adapted to the</a>
<a id='line_164'>      respective merit and seniority of the soldiers of Omar. Under his</a>
<a id='line_165'>      reign, and that of his predecessor, the conquerors of the East</a>
<a id='line_166'>      were the trusty servants of God and the people; the mass of the</a>
<a id='line_167'>      public treasure was consecrated to the expenses of peace and war;</a>
<a id='line_168'>      a prudent mixture of justice and bounty maintained the discipline</a>
<a id='line_169'>      of the Saracens, and they united, by a rare felicity, the</a>
<a id='line_170'>      despatch and execution of despotism with the equal and frugal</a>
<a id='line_171'>      maxims of a republican government. The heroic courage of Ali, 7</a>
<a id='line_172'>      the consummate prudence of Moawiyah, 8 excited the emulation of</a>
<a id='line_173'>      their subjects; and the talents which had been exercised in the</a>
<a id='line_174'>      school of civil discord were more usefully applied to propagate</a>
<a id='line_175'>      the faith and dominion of the prophet. In the sloth and vanity of</a>
<a id='line_176'>      the palace of Damascus, the succeeding princes of the house of</a>
<a id='line_177'>      Ommiyah were alike destitute of the qualifications of statesmen</a>
<a id='line_178'>      and of saints. 9 Yet the spoils of unknown nations were</a>
<a id='line_179'>      continually laid at the foot of their throne, and the uniform</a>
<a id='line_180'>      ascent of the Arabian greatness must be ascribed to the spirit of</a>
<a id='line_181'>      the nation rather than the abilities of their chiefs. A large</a>
<a id='line_182'>      deduction must be allowed for the weakness of their enemies. The</a>
<a id='line_183'>      birth of Mahomet was fortunately placed in the most degenerate</a>
<a id='line_184'>      and disorderly period of the Persians, the Romans, and the</a>
<a id='line_185'>      Barbarians of Europe: the empires of Trajan, or even of</a>
<a id='line_186'>      Constantine or Charlemagne, would have repelled the assault of</a>
<a id='line_187'>      the naked Saracens, and the torrent of fanaticism might have been</a>
<a id='line_188'>      obscurely lost in the sands of Arabia.</a>

<a id='line_213'>      In the victorious days of the Roman republic, it had been the aim</a>
<a id='line_214'>      of the senate to confine their councils and legions to a single</a>
<a id='line_215'>      war, and completely to suppress a first enemy before they</a>
<a id='line_216'>      provoked the hostilities of a second. These timid maxims of</a>
<a id='line_217'>      policy were disdained by the magnanimity or enthusiasm of the</a>
<a id='line_218'>      Arabian caliphs. With the same vigor and success they invaded the</a>
<a id='line_219'>      successors of Augustus and those of Artaxerxes; and the rival</a>
<a id='line_220'>      monarchies at the same instant became the prey of an enemy whom</a>
<a id='line_221'>      they had been so long accustomed to despise. In the ten years of</a>
<a id='line_222'>      the administration of Omar, the Saracens reduced to his obedience</a>
<a id='line_223'>      thirty-six thousand cities or castles, destroyed four thousand</a>
<a id='line_224'>      churches or temples of the unbelievers, and edified fourteen</a>
<a id='line_225'>      hundred moschs for the exercise of the religion of Mahomet. One</a>
<a id='line_226'>      hundred years after his flight from Mecca, the arms and the reign</a>
<a id='line_227'>      of his successors extended from India to the Atlantic Ocean, over</a>
<a id='line_228'>      the various and distant provinces, which may be comprised under</a>
<a id='line_229'>      the names of, I. Persia; II. Syria; III. Egypt; IV. Africa; and,</a>
<a id='line_230'>      V. Spain. Under this general division, I shall proceed to unfold</a>
<a id='line_231'>      these memorable transactions; despatching with brevity the remote</a>
<a id='line_232'>      and less interesting conquests of the East, and reserving a</a>
<a id='line_233'>      fuller narrative for those domestic countries which had been</a>
<a id='line_234'>      included within the pale of the Roman empire. Yet I must excuse</a>
<a id='line_235'>      my own defects by a just complaint of the blindness and</a>
<a id='line_236'>      insufficiency of my guides. The Greeks, so loquacious in</a>
<a id='line_237'>      controversy, have not been anxious to celebrate the triumphs of</a>
<a id='line_238'>      their enemies. 10 After a century of ignorance, the first annals</a>
<a id='line_239'>      of the Mussulmans were collected in a great measure from the</a>
<a id='line_240'>      voice of tradition. 11 Among the numerous productions of Arabic</a>
<a id='line_241'>      and Persian literature, 12 our interpreters have selected the</a>
<a id='line_242'>      imperfect sketches of a more recent age. 13 The art and genius of</a>
<a id='line_243'>      history have ever been unknown to the Asiatics; 14 they are</a>
<a id='line_244'>      ignorant of the laws of criticism; and our monkish chronicle of</a>
<a id='line_245'>      the same period may be compared to their most popular works,</a>

<a id='line_389'>      formed of cavalry and archers; and the engagement, which was</a>
<a id='line_390'>      often interrupted and often renewed by single combats and flying</a>
<a id='line_391'>      skirmishes, might be protracted without any decisive event to the</a>
<a id='line_392'>      continuance of several days. The periods of the battle of Cadesia</a>
<a id='line_393'>      were distinguished by their peculiar appellations. The first,</a>
<a id='line_394'>      from the well-timed appearance of six thousand of the Syrian</a>
<a id='line_395'>      brethren, was denominated the day of succor. The day of</a>
<a id='line_396'>      concussion might express the disorder of one, or perhaps of both,</a>
<a id='line_397'>      of the contending armies. The third, a nocturnal tumult, received</a>
<a id='line_398'>      the whimsical name of the night of barking, from the discordant</a>
<a id='line_399'>      clamors, which were compared to the inarticulate sounds of the</a>
<a id='line_400'>      fiercest animals. The morning of the succeeding day 2011</a>
<a id='line_401'>      determined the fate of Persia; and a seasonable whirlwind drove a</a>
<a id='line_402'>      cloud of dust against the faces of the unbelievers. The clangor</a>
<a id='line_403'>      of arms was reechoed to the tent of Rustam, who, far unlike the</a>
<a id='line_404'>      ancient hero of his name, was gently reclining in a cool and</a>
<a id='line_405'>      tranquil shade, amidst the baggage of his camp, and the train of</a>
<a id='line_406'>      mules that were laden with gold and silver. On the sound of</a>
<a id='line_407'>      danger he started from his couch; but his flight was overtaken by</a>
<a id='line_408'>      a valiant Arab, who caught him by the foot, struck off his head,</a>
<a id='line_409'>      hoisted it on a lance, and instantly returning to the field of</a>
<a id='line_410'>      battle, carried slaughter and dismay among the thickest ranks of</a>
<a id='line_411'>      the Persians. The Saracens confess a loss of seven thousand five</a>
<a id='line_412'>      hundred men; 2012 and the battle of Cadesia is justly described</a>
<a id='line_413'>      by the epithets of obstinate and atrocious. 21 The standard of</a>
<a id='line_414'>      the monarchy was overthrown and captured in the field—a leathern</a>
<a id='line_415'>      apron of a blacksmith, who in ancient times had arisen the</a>
<a id='line_416'>      deliverer of Persia; but this badge of heroic poverty was</a>

<a id='line_496'></a>
<a id='line_497'>      After the defeat of Cadesia, a country intersected by rivers and</a>
<a id='line_498'>      canals might have opposed an insuperable barrier to the</a>
<a id='line_499'>      victorious cavalry; and the walls of Ctesiphon or Madayn, which</a>
<a id='line_500'>      had resisted the battering-rams of the Romans, would not have</a>
<a id='line_501'>      yielded to the darts of the Saracens. But the flying Persians</a>
<a id='line_502'>      were overcome by the belief, that the last day of their religion</a>
<a id='line_503'>      and empire was at hand; the strongest posts were abandoned by</a>
<a id='line_504'>      treachery or cowardice; and the king, with a part of his family</a>
<a id='line_505'>      and treasures, escaped to Holwan at the foot of the Median hills.</a>
<a id='line_506'></a>
<a id='line_507'>      In the third month after the battle, Said, the lieutenant of</a>
<a id='line_508'>      Omar, passed the Tigris without opposition; the capital was taken</a>
<a id='line_509'>      by assault; and the disorderly resistance of the people gave a</a>
<a id='line_510'>      keener edge to the sabres of the Moslems, who shouted with</a>
<a id='line_511'>      religious transport, “This is the white palace of Chosroes; this</a>
<a id='line_512'>      is the promise of the apostle of God!” The naked robbers of the</a>
<a id='line_513'>      desert were suddenly enriched beyond the measure of their hope or</a>
<a id='line_514'>      knowledge. Each chamber revealed a new treasure secreted with</a>
<a id='line_515'>      art, or ostentatiously displayed; the gold and silver, the</a>
<a id='line_516'>      various wardrobes and precious furniture, surpassed (says</a>
<a id='line_517'>      Abulfeda) the estimate of fancy or numbers; and another historian</a>
<a id='line_518'>      defines the untold and almost infinite mass, by the fabulous</a>
<a id='line_519'>      computation of three thousands of thousands of thousands of</a>
<a id='line_520'>      pieces of gold. 24 Some minute though curious facts represent the</a>
<a id='line_521'>      contrast of riches and ignorance. From the remote islands of the</a>
<a id='line_522'>      Indian Ocean a large provision of camphire 25 had been imported,</a>
<a id='line_523'>      which is employed with a mixture of wax to illuminate the palaces</a>
<a id='line_524'>      of the East. Strangers to the name and properties of that</a>
<a id='line_525'>      odoriferous gum, the Saracens, mistaking it for salt, mingled the</a>
<a id='line_526'>      camphire in their bread, and were astonished at the bitterness of</a>
<a id='line_527'>      the taste. One of the apartments of the palace was decorated with</a>
<a id='line_528'>      a carpet of silk, sixty cubits in length, and as many in breadth:</a>
<a id='line_529'>      a paradise or garden was depictured on the ground: the flowers,</a>
<a id='line_530'>      fruits, and shrubs, were imitated by the figures of the gold</a>
<a id='line_531'>      embroidery, and the colors of the precious stones; and the ample</a>
<a id='line_532'>      square was encircled by a variegated and verdant border. 251 The</a>
<a id='line_533'>      Arabian general persuaded his soldiers to relinquish their claim,</a>
<a id='line_534'>      in the reasonable hope that the eyes of the caliph would be</a>
<a id='line_535'>      delighted with the splendid workmanship of nature and industry.</a>
<a id='line_536'>      Regardless of the merit of art, and the pomp of royalty, the</a>
<a id='line_537'>      rigid Omar divided the prize among his brethren of Medina: the</a>
<a id='line_538'>      picture was destroyed; but such was the intrinsic value of the</a>
<a id='line_539'>      materials, that the share of Ali alone was sold for twenty</a>
<a id='line_540'>      thousand drams. A mule that carried away the tiara and cuirass,</a>
<a id='line_541'>      the belt and bracelets of Chosroes, was overtaken by the</a>
<a id='line_542'>      pursuers; the gorgeous trophy was presented to the commander of</a>
<a id='line_543'>      the faithful; and the gravest of the companions condescended to</a>
<a id='line_544'>      smile when they beheld the white beard, the hairy arms, and</a>
<a id='line_545'>      uncouth figure of the veteran, who was invested with the spoils</a>
<a id='line_546'>      of the Great King. 26 The sack of Ctesiphon was followed by its</a>
<a id='line_547'>      desertion and gradual decay. The Saracens disliked the air and</a>
<a id='line_548'>      situation of the place, and Omar was advised by his general to</a>
<a id='line_549'>      remove the seat of government to the western side of the</a>
<a id='line_550'>      Euphrates. In every age, the foundation and ruin of the Assyrian</a>
<a id='line_551'>      cities has been easy and rapid: the country is destitute of stone</a>
<a id='line_552'>      and timber; and the most solid structures 27 are composed of</a>
<a id='line_553'>      bricks baked in the sun, and joined by a cement of the native</a>
<a id='line_554'>      bitumen. The name of Cufa 28 describes a habitation of reeds and</a>
<a id='line_555'>      earth; but the importance of the new capital was supported by the</a>
<a id='line_556'>      numbers, wealth, and spirit, of a colony of veterans; and their</a>
<a id='line_557'>      licentiousness was indulged by the wisest caliphs, who were</a>
<a id='line_558'>      apprehensive of provoking the revolt of a hundred thousand</a>
<a id='line_559'>      swords: “Ye men of Cufa,” said Ali, who solicited their aid, “you</a>
<a id='line_560'>      have been always conspicuous by your valor. You conquered the</a>
<a id='line_561'>      Persian king, and scattered his forces, till you had taken</a>
<a id='line_562'>      possession of his inheritance.” This mighty conquest was achieved</a>
<a id='line_563'>      by the battles of Jalula and Nehavend. After the loss of the</a>
<a id='line_564'>      former, Yezdegerd fled from Holwan, and concealed his shame and</a>
<a id='line_565'>      despair in the mountains of Farsistan, from whence Cyrus had</a>
<a id='line_566'>      descended with his equal and valiant companions. The courage of</a>
<a id='line_567'>      the nation survived that of the monarch: among the hills to the</a>
<a id='line_568'>      south of Ecbatana or Hamadan, one hundred and fifty thousand</a>
<a id='line_569'>      Persians made a third and final stand for their religion and</a>

<a id='line_571'>      Arabs the victory of victories. If it be true that the flying</a>

<a id='line_627'>      towards the West and the Roman empire, they repassed the Tigris</a>
<a id='line_628'>      over the bridge of Mosul, and, in the captive provinces of</a>

<a id='line_640'>      is insensible of fatigue: the Arabs divided their forces in the</a>
<a id='line_641'>      pursuit of a timorous enemy; and the caliph Othman promised the</a>
<a id='line_642'>      government of Chorasan to the first general who should enter that</a>
<a id='line_643'>      large and populous country, the kingdom of the ancient Bactrians.</a>
<a id='line_644'>      The condition was accepted; the prize was deserved; the standard</a>
<a id='line_645'>      of Mahomet was planted on the walls of Herat, Merou, and Balch;</a>
<a id='line_646'>      and the successful leader neither halted nor reposed till his</a>

<a id='line_648'>      anarchy, the independent governors of the cities and castles</a>
<a id='line_649'>      obtained their separate capitulations: the terms were granted or</a>
<a id='line_650'>      imposed by the esteem, the prudence, or the compassion, of the</a>
<a id='line_651'>      victors; and a simple profession of faith established the</a>
<a id='line_652'>      distinction between a brother and a slave. After a noble defence,</a>
<a id='line_653'>      Harmozan, the prince or satrap of Ahwaz and Susa, was compelled</a>
<a id='line_654'>      to surrender his person and his state to the discretion of the</a>
<a id='line_655'>      caliph; and their interview exhibits a portrait of the Arabian</a>
<a id='line_656'>      manners. In the presence, and by the command, of Omar, the gay</a>
<a id='line_657'>      Barbarian was despoiled of his silken robes embroidered with</a>
<a id='line_658'>      gold, and of his tiara bedecked with rubies and emeralds: “Are</a>
<a id='line_659'>      you now sensible,” said the conqueror to his naked captive—“are</a>
<a id='line_660'>      you now sensible of the judgment of God, and of the different</a>
<a id='line_661'>      rewards of infidelity and obedience?” “Alas!” replied Harmozan,</a>
<a id='line_662'>      “I feel them too deeply. In the days of our common ignorance, we</a>
<a id='line_663'>      fought with the weapons of the flesh, and my nation was superior.</a>
<a id='line_664'>      God was then neuter: since he has espoused your quarrel, you have</a>
<a id='line_665'>      subverted our kingdom and religion.” Oppressed by this painful</a>
<a id='line_666'>      dialogue, the Persian complained of intolerable thirst, but</a>
<a id='line_667'>      discovered some apprehension lest he should be killed whilst he</a>
<a id='line_668'>      was drinking a cup of water. “Be of good courage,” said the</a>
<a id='line_669'>      caliph; “your life is safe till you have drunk this water:” the</a>
<a id='line_670'>      crafty satrap accepted the assurance, and instantly dashed the</a>
<a id='line_671'>      vase against the ground. Omar would have avenged the deceit, but</a>
<a id='line_672'>      his companions represented the sanctity of an oath; and the</a>
<a id='line_673'>      speedy conversion of Harmozan entitled him not only to a free</a>

<a id='line_908'>      severely prohibited among the Arabs: in the tumult of a camp, the</a>

<a id='line_913'>      the fervor of their primitive zeal, many secret sinners revealed</a>

<a id='line_981'>      Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs.—Part III.</a>
<a id='line_982'></a>
<a id='line_983'>      One of the fifteen provinces of Syria, the cultivated lands to</a>
<a id='line_984'>      the eastward of the Jordan, had been decorated by Roman vanity</a>
<a id='line_985'>      with the name of _Arabia_; and the first arms of the Saracens</a>
<a id='line_986'>      were justified by the semblance of a national right. The country</a>
<a id='line_987'>      was enriched by the various benefits of trade; by the vigilance</a>
<a id='line_988'>      of the emperors it was covered with a line of forts; and the</a>
<a id='line_989'>      populous cities of Gerasa, Philadelphia, and Bosra, were secure,</a>
<a id='line_990'>      at least from a surprise, by the solid structure of their walls.</a>
<a id='line_991'>      The last of these cities was the eighteenth station from Medina:</a>
<a id='line_992'>      the road was familiar to the caravans of Hejaz and Irak, who</a>
<a id='line_993'>      annually visited this plenteous market of the province and the</a>
<a id='line_994'>      desert: the perpetual jealousy of the Arabs had trained the</a>
<a id='line_995'>      inhabitants to arms; and twelve thousand horse could sally from</a>
<a id='line_996'>      the gates of Bosra, an appellation which signifies, in the Syriac</a>
<a id='line_997'>      language, a strong tower of defence. Encouraged by their first</a>
<a id='line_998'>      success against the open towns and flying parties of the borders,</a>
<a id='line_999'>      a detachment of four thousand Moslems presumed to summon and</a>
<a id='line_1000'>      attack the fortress of Bosra. They were oppressed by the numbers</a>
<a id='line_1001'>      of the Syrians; they were saved by the presence of Caled, with</a>
<a id='line_1002'>      fifteen hundred horse: he blamed the enterprise, restored the</a>
<a id='line_1003'>      battle, and rescued his friend, the venerable Serjabil, who had</a>
<a id='line_1004'>      vainly invoked the unity of God and the promises of the apostle.</a>
<a id='line_1005'>      After a short repose, the Moslems performed their ablutions with</a>
<a id='line_1006'>      sand instead of water; and the morning prayer was recited by</a>
<a id='line_1007'>      Caled before they mounted on horseback. Confident in their</a>
<a id='line_1008'>      strength, the people of Bosra threw open their gates, drew their</a>
<a id='line_1009'>      forces into the plain, and swore to die in the defence of their</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      religion. But a religion of peace was incapable of withstanding</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      the fanatic cry of “Fight, fight! Paradise, paradise!” that</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      reechoed in the ranks of the Saracens; and the uproar of the</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      town, the ringing of bells, and the exclamations of the priests</a>
<a id='line_1014'>      and monks increased the dismay and disorder of the Christians.</a>
<a id='line_1015'>      With the loss of two hundred and thirty men, the Arabs remained</a>
<a id='line_1016'>      masters of the field; and the ramparts of Bosra, in expectation</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      of human or divine aid, were crowded with holy crosses and</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      consecrated banners. The governor Romanus had recommended an</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      early submission: despised by the people, and degraded from his</a>
<a id='line_1020'>      office, he still retained the desire and opportunity of revenge.</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      In a nocturnal interview, he informed the enemy of a</a>
<a id='line_1022'>      subterraneous passage from his house under the wall of the city;</a>
<a id='line_1023'>      the son of the caliph, with a hundred volunteers, were committed</a>
<a id='line_1024'>      to the faith of this new ally, and their successful intrepidity</a>
<a id='line_1025'>      gave an easy entrance to their companions. After Caled had</a>
<a id='line_1026'>      imposed the terms of servitude and tribute, the apostate or</a>
<a id='line_1027'>      convert avowed in the assembly of the people his meritorious</a>
<a id='line_1028'>      treason: “I renounce your society,” said Romanus, “both in this</a>
<a id='line_1029'>      world and the world to come. And I deny him that was crucified,</a>
<a id='line_1030'>      and whosoever worships him. And I choose God for my Lord, Islam</a>
<a id='line_1031'>      for my faith, Mecca for my temple, the Moslems for my brethren,</a>
<a id='line_1032'>      and Mahomet for my prophet; who was sent to lead us into the</a>
<a id='line_1033'>      right way, and to exalt the true religion in spite of those who</a>
<a id='line_1034'>      join partners with God.”</a>
<a id='line_1035'></a>
<a id='line_1036'>      The conquest of Bosra, four days’ journey from Damascus,</a>
<a id='line_1037'>      encouraged the Arabs to besiege the ancient capital of Syria. At</a>
<a id='line_1038'>      some distance from the walls, they encamped among the groves and</a>
<a id='line_1039'>      fountains of that delicious territory, and the usual option of</a>
<a id='line_1040'>      the Mahometan faith, of tribute or of war, was proposed to the</a>
<a id='line_1041'>      resolute citizens, who had been lately strengthened by a</a>
<a id='line_1042'>      reenforcement of five thousand Greeks. In the decline, as in the</a>
<a id='line_1043'>      infancy, of the military art, a hostile defiance was frequently</a>
<a id='line_1044'>      offered and accepted by the generals themselves: many a lance was</a>
<a id='line_1045'>      shivered in the plain of Damascus, and the personal prowess of</a>
<a id='line_1046'>      Caled was signalized in the first sally of the besieged. After an</a>
<a id='line_1047'>      obstinate combat, he had overthrown and made prisoner one of the</a>
<a id='line_1048'>      Christian leaders, a stout and worthy antagonist. He instantly</a>
<a id='line_1049'>      mounted a fresh horse, the gift of the governor of Palmyra, and</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      pushed forwards to the front of the battle. “Repose yourself for</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      a moment,” said his friend Derar, “and permit me to supply your</a>
<a id='line_1052'>      place: you are fatigued with fighting with this dog.” “O Dear!”</a>
<a id='line_1053'>      replied the indefatigable Saracen, “we shall rest in the world to</a>
<a id='line_1054'>      come. He that labors to-day shall rest to-morrow.” With the same</a>
<a id='line_1055'>      unabated ardor, Caled answered, encountered, and vanquished a</a>
<a id='line_1056'>      second champion; and the heads of his two captives who refused to</a>
<a id='line_1057'>      abandon their religion were indignantly hurled into the midst of</a>
<a id='line_1058'>      the city. The event of some general and partial actions reduced</a>
<a id='line_1059'>      the Damascenes to a closer defence: but a messenger, whom they</a>
<a id='line_1060'>      dropped from the walls, returned with the promise of speedy and</a>
<a id='line_1061'>      powerful succor, and their tumultuous joy conveyed the</a>
<a id='line_1062'>      intelligence to the camp of the Arabs. After some debate, it was</a>
<a id='line_1063'>      resolved by the generals to raise, or rather to suspend, the</a>
<a id='line_1064'>      siege of Damascus, till they had given battle to the forces of</a>
<a id='line_1065'>      the emperor. In the retreat, Caled would have chosen the more</a>
<a id='line_1066'>      perilous station of the rear-guard; he modestly yielded to the</a>
<a id='line_1067'>      wishes of Abu Obeidah. But in the hour of danger he flew to the</a>
<a id='line_1068'>      rescue of his companion, who was rudely pressed by a sally of six</a>
<a id='line_1069'>      thousand horse and ten thousand foot, and few among the</a>
<a id='line_1070'>      Christians could relate at Damascus the circumstances of their</a>
<a id='line_1071'>      defeat. The importance of the contest required the junction of</a>
<a id='line_1072'>      the Saracens, who were dispersed on the frontiers of Syria and</a>
<a id='line_1073'>      Palestine; and I shall transcribe one of the circular mandates</a>
<a id='line_1074'>      which was addressed to Amrou, the future conqueror of Egypt. “In</a>
<a id='line_1075'>      the name of the most merciful God: from Caled to Amrou, health</a>
<a id='line_1076'>      and happiness. Know that thy brethren the Moslems design to march</a>
<a id='line_1077'>      to Aiznadin, where there is an army of seventy thousand Greeks,</a>
<a id='line_1078'>      who purpose to come against us, _that they may extinguish the</a>
<a id='line_1079'>      light of God with their mouths; but God preserveth his light in</a>
<a id='line_1080'>      spite of the infidels_. As soon therefore as this letter of mine</a>
<a id='line_1081'>      shall be delivered to thy hands, come with those that are with</a>
<a id='line_1082'>      thee to Aiznadin, where thou shalt find us if it please the most</a>
<a id='line_1083'>      high God.” The summons was cheerfully obeyed, and the forty-five</a>
<a id='line_1084'>      thousand Moslems, who met on the same day, on the same spot</a>
<a id='line_1085'>      ascribed to the blessing of Providence the effects of their</a>
<a id='line_1086'>      activity and zeal.</a>
<a id='line_1087'></a>
<a id='line_1088'>      About four years after the triumph of the Persian war, the repose</a>
<a id='line_1089'>      of Heraclius and the empire was again disturbed by a new enemy,</a>
<a id='line_1090'>      the power of whose religion was more strongly felt, than it was</a>
<a id='line_1091'>      clearly understood, by the Christians of the East. In his palace</a>
<a id='line_1092'>      of Constantinople or Antioch, he was awakened by the invasion of</a>
<a id='line_1093'>      Syria, the loss of Bosra, and the danger of Damascus. An army of</a>
<a id='line_1094'>      seventy thousand veterans, or new levies, was assembled at Hems</a>
<a id='line_1095'>      or Emesa, under the command of his general Werdan: and these</a>
<a id='line_1096'>      troops consisting chiefly of cavalry, might be indifferently</a>
<a id='line_1097'>      styled either Syrians, or Greeks, or Romans: _Syrians_, from the</a>
<a id='line_1098'>      place of their birth or warfare; _Greeks_ from the religion and</a>
<a id='line_1099'>      language of their sovereign; and _Romans_, from the proud</a>
<a id='line_1100'>      appellation which was still profaned by the successors of</a>
<a id='line_1101'>      Constantine. On the plain of Aiznadin, as Werdan rode on a white</a>
<a id='line_1102'>      mule decorated with gold chains, and surrounded with ensigns and</a>
<a id='line_1103'>      standards, he was surprised by the near approach of a fierce and</a>
<a id='line_1104'>      naked warrior, who had undertaken to view the state of the enemy.</a>
<a id='line_1105'>      The adventurous valor of Derar was inspired, and has perhaps been</a>
<a id='line_1106'>      adorned, by the enthusiasm of his age and country. The hatred of</a>
<a id='line_1107'>      the Christians, the love of spoil, and the contempt of danger,</a>
<a id='line_1108'>      were the ruling passions of the audacious Saracen; and the</a>
<a id='line_1109'>      prospect of instant death could never shake his religious</a>
<a id='line_1110'>      confidence, or ruffle the calmness of his resolution, or even</a>
<a id='line_1111'>      suspend the frank and martial pleasantry of his humor. In the</a>
<a id='line_1112'>      most hopeless enterprises, he was bold, and prudent, and</a>
<a id='line_1113'>      fortunate: after innumerable hazards, after being thrice a</a>
<a id='line_1114'>      prisoner in the hands of the infidels, he still survived to</a>
<a id='line_1115'>      relate the achievements, and to enjoy the rewards, of the Syrian</a>
<a id='line_1116'>      conquest. On this occasion, his single lance maintained a flying</a>
<a id='line_1117'>      fight against thirty Romans, who were detached by Werdan; and,</a>
<a id='line_1118'>      after killing or unhorsing seventeen of their number, Derar</a>
<a id='line_1119'>      returned in safety to his applauding brethren. When his rashness</a>
<a id='line_1120'>      was mildly censured by the general, he excused himself with the</a>
<a id='line_1121'>      simplicity of a soldier. “Nay,” said Derar, “I did not begin</a>
<a id='line_1122'>      first: but they came out to take me, and I was afraid that God</a>
<a id='line_1123'>      should see me turn my back: and indeed I fought in good earnest,</a>
<a id='line_1124'>      and without doubt God assisted me against them; and had I not</a>
<a id='line_1125'>      been apprehensive of disobeying your orders, I should not have</a>
<a id='line_1126'>      come away as I did; and I perceive already that they will fall</a>
<a id='line_1127'>      into our hands.” In the presence of both armies, a venerable</a>
<a id='line_1128'>      Greek advanced from the ranks with a liberal offer of peace; and</a>
<a id='line_1129'>      the departure of the Saracens would have been purchased by a gift</a>
<a id='line_1130'>      to each soldier, of a turban, a robe, and a piece of gold; ten</a>
<a id='line_1131'>      robes and a hundred pieces to their leader; one hundred robes and</a>
<a id='line_1132'>      a thousand pieces to the caliph. A smile of indignation expressed</a>
<a id='line_1133'>      the refusal of Caled. “Ye Christian dogs, you know your option;</a>
<a id='line_1134'>      the Koran, the tribute, or the sword. We are a people whose</a>
<a id='line_1135'>      delight is in war, rather than in peace: and we despise your</a>
<a id='line_1136'>      pitiful alms, since we shall be speedily masters of your wealth,</a>
<a id='line_1137'>      your families, and your persons.” Notwithstanding this apparent</a>
<a id='line_1138'>      disdain, he was deeply conscious of the public danger: those who</a>
<a id='line_1139'>      had been in Persia, and had seen the armies of Chosroes confessed</a>
<a id='line_1140'>      that they never beheld a more formidable array. From the</a>
<a id='line_1141'>      superiority of the enemy, the artful Saracen derived a fresh</a>
<a id='line_1142'>      incentive of courage: “You see before you,” said he, “the united</a>
<a id='line_1143'>      force of the Romans; you cannot hope to escape, but you may</a>
<a id='line_1144'>      conquer Syria in a single day. The event depends on your</a>
<a id='line_1145'>      discipline and patience. Reserve yourselves till the evening. It</a>
<a id='line_1146'>      was in the evening that the Prophet was accustomed to vanquish.”</a>
<a id='line_1147'>      During two successive engagements, his temperate firmness</a>
<a id='line_1148'>      sustained the darts of the enemy, and the murmurs of his troops.</a>
<a id='line_1149'>      At length, when the spirits and quivers of the adverse line were</a>
<a id='line_1150'>      almost exhausted, Caled gave the signal of onset and victory. The</a>
<a id='line_1151'>      remains of the Imperial army fled to Antioch, or Cæsarea, or</a>
<a id='line_1152'>      Damascus; and the death of four hundred and seventy Moslems was</a>
<a id='line_1153'>      compensated by the opinion that they had sent to hell above fifty</a>
<a id='line_1154'>      thousand of the infidels. The spoil was inestimable; many banners</a>
<a id='line_1155'>      and crosses of gold and silver, precious stones, silver and gold</a>
<a id='line_1156'>      chains, and innumerable suits of the richest armor and apparel.</a>
<a id='line_1157'>      The general distribution was postponed till Damascus should be</a>
<a id='line_1158'>      taken; but the seasonable supply of arms became the instrument of</a>
<a id='line_1159'>      new victories. The glorious intelligence was transmitted to the</a>
<a id='line_1160'>      throne of the caliph; and the Arabian tribes, the coldest or most</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      hostile to the prophet’s mission, were eager and importunate to</a>
<a id='line_1162'>      share the harvest of Syria.</a>
<a id='line_1163'></a>
<a id='line_1164'>      The sad tidings were carried to Damascus by the speed of grief</a>
<a id='line_1165'>      and terror; and the inhabitants beheld from their walls the</a>
<a id='line_1166'>      return of the heroes of Aiznadin. Amrou led the van at the head</a>
<a id='line_1167'>      of nine thousand horse: the bands of the Saracens succeeded each</a>
<a id='line_1168'>      other in formidable review; and the rear was closed by Caled in</a>
<a id='line_1169'>      person, with the standard of the black eagle. To the activity of</a>
<a id='line_1170'>      Derar he intrusted the commission of patrolling round the city</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      with two thousand horse, of scouring the plain, and of</a>
<a id='line_1172'>      intercepting all succor or intelligence. The rest of the Arabian</a>
<a id='line_1173'>      chiefs were fixed in their respective stations before the seven</a>
<a id='line_1174'>      gates of Damascus; and the siege was renewed with fresh vigor and</a>
<a id='line_1175'>      confidence. The art, the labor, the military engines, of the</a>
<a id='line_1176'>      Greeks and Romans are seldom to be found in the simple, though</a>
<a id='line_1177'>      successful, operations of the Saracens: it was sufficient for</a>
<a id='line_1178'>      them to invest a city with arms, rather than with trenches; to</a>
<a id='line_1179'>      repel the allies of the besieged; to attempt a stratagem or an</a>
<a id='line_1180'>      assault; or to expect the progress of famine and discontent.</a>
<a id='line_1181'>      Damascus would have acquiesced in the trial of Aiznadin, as a</a>
<a id='line_1182'>      final and peremptory sentence between the emperor and the caliph;</a>
<a id='line_1183'>      her courage was rekindled by the example and authority of Thomas,</a>
<a id='line_1184'>      a noble Greek, illustrious in a private condition by the alliance</a>
<a id='line_1185'>      of Heraclius. The tumult and illumination of the night proclaimed</a>
<a id='line_1186'>      the design of the morning sally; and the Christian hero, who</a>
<a id='line_1187'>      affected to despise the enthusiasm of the Arabs, employed the</a>
<a id='line_1188'>      resource of a similar superstition. At the principal gate, in the</a>
<a id='line_1189'>      sight of both armies, a lofty crucifix was erected; the bishop,</a>
<a id='line_1190'>      with his clergy, accompanied the march, and laid the volume of</a>
<a id='line_1191'>      the New Testament before the image of Jesus; and the contending</a>
<a id='line_1192'>      parties were scandalized or edified by a prayer that the Son of</a>
<a id='line_1193'>      God would defend his servants and vindicate his truth. The battle</a>
<a id='line_1194'>      raged with incessant fury; and the dexterity of Thomas, an</a>
<a id='line_1195'>      incomparable archer, was fatal to the boldest Saracens, till</a>
<a id='line_1196'>      their death was revenged by a female heroine. The wife of Aban,</a>
<a id='line_1197'>      who had followed him to the holy war, embraced her expiring</a>
<a id='line_1198'>      husband. “Happy,” said she, “happy art thou, my dear: thou art</a>
<a id='line_1199'>      gone to thy Lord, who first joined us together, and then parted</a>
<a id='line_1200'>      us asunder. I will revenge thy death, and endeavor to the utmost</a>
<a id='line_1201'>      of my power to come to the place where thou art, because I love</a>
<a id='line_1202'>      thee. Henceforth shall no man ever touch me more, for I have</a>
<a id='line_1203'>      dedicated myself to the service of God.” Without a groan, without</a>
<a id='line_1204'>      a tear, she washed the corpse of her husband, and buried him with</a>
<a id='line_1205'>      the usual rites. Then grasping the manly weapons, which in her</a>
<a id='line_1206'>      native land she was accustomed to wield, the intrepid widow of</a>
<a id='line_1207'>      Aban sought the place where his murderer fought in the thickest</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      of the battle. Her first arrow pierced the hand of his</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      standard-bearer; her second wounded Thomas in the eye; and the</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      fainting Christians no longer beheld their ensign or their</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      leader. Yet the generous champion of Damascus refused to withdraw</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      to his palace: his wound was dressed on the rampart; the fight</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      was continued till the evening; and the Syrians rested on their</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      arms. In the silence of the night, the signal was given by a</a>
<a id='line_1215'>      stroke on the great bell; the gates were thrown open, and each</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      gate discharged an impetuous column on the sleeping camp of the</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      Saracens. Caled was the first in arms: at the head of four</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      hundred horse he flew to the post of danger, and the tears</a>
<a id='line_1219'>      trickled down his iron cheeks, as he uttered a fervent</a>
<a id='line_1220'>      ejaculation; “O God, who never sleepest, look upon they servants,</a>
<a id='line_1221'>      and do not deliver them into the hands of their enemies.” The</a>
<a id='line_1222'>      valor and victory of Thomas were arrested by the presence of the</a>
<a id='line_1223'>      _Sword of God_; with the knowledge of the peril, the Moslems</a>
<a id='line_1224'>      recovered their ranks, and charged the assailants in the flank</a>
<a id='line_1225'>      and rear. After the loss of thousands, the Christian general</a>
<a id='line_1226'>      retreated with a sigh of despair, and the pursuit of the Saracens</a>
<a id='line_1227'>      was checked by the military engines of the rampart.</a>
<a id='line_1228'></a>
<a id='line_1229'>      After a siege of seventy days, the patience, and perhaps the</a>
<a id='line_1230'>      provisions, of the Damascenes were exhausted; and the bravest of</a>
<a id='line_1231'>      their chiefs submitted to the hard dictates of necessity. In the</a>
<a id='line_1232'>      occurrences of peace and war, they had been taught to dread the</a>
<a id='line_1233'>      fierceness of Caled, and to revere the mild virtues of Abu</a>
<a id='line_1234'>      Obeidah. At the hour of midnight, one hundred chosen deputies of</a>
<a id='line_1235'>      the clergy and people were introduced to the tent of that</a>
<a id='line_1236'>      venerable commander. He received and dismissed them with</a>
<a id='line_1237'>      courtesy. They returned with a written agreement, on the faith of</a>
<a id='line_1238'>      a companion of Mahomet, that all hostilities should cease; that</a>
<a id='line_1239'>      the voluntary emigrants might depart in safety, with as much as</a>
<a id='line_1240'>      they could carry away of their effects; and that the tributary</a>
<a id='line_1241'>      subjects of the caliph should enjoy their lands and houses, with</a>
<a id='line_1242'>      the use and possession of seven churches. On these terms, the</a>
<a id='line_1243'>      most respectable hostages, and the gate nearest to his camp, were</a>
<a id='line_1244'>      delivered into his hands: his soldiers imitated the moderation of</a>
<a id='line_1245'>      their chief; and he enjoyed the submissive gratitude of a people</a>
<a id='line_1246'>      whom he had rescued from destruction. But the success of the</a>
<a id='line_1247'>      treaty had relaxed their vigilance, and in the same moment the</a>
<a id='line_1248'>      opposite quarter of the city was betrayed and taken by assault. A</a>
<a id='line_1249'>      party of a hundred Arabs had opened the eastern gate to a more</a>
<a id='line_1250'>      inexorable foe. “No quarter,” cried the rapacious and sanguinary</a>
<a id='line_1251'>      Caled, “no quarter to the enemies of the Lord:” his trumpets</a>
<a id='line_1252'>      sounded, and a torrent of Christian blood was poured down the</a>
<a id='line_1253'>      streets of Damascus. When he reached the church of St. Mary, he</a>
<a id='line_1254'>      was astonished and provoked by the peaceful aspect of his</a>
<a id='line_1255'>      companions; their swords were in the scabbard, and they were</a>
<a id='line_1256'>      surrounded by a multitude of priests and monks. Abu Obeidah</a>
<a id='line_1257'>      saluted the general: “God,” said he, “has delivered the city into</a>
<a id='line_1258'>      my hands by way of surrender, and has saved the believers the</a>
<a id='line_1259'>      trouble of fighting.” “And am I not,” replied the indignant</a>
<a id='line_1260'>      Caled, “am I not the lieutenant of the commander of the faithful?</a>
<a id='line_1261'>      Have I not taken the city by storm? The unbelievers shall perish</a>
<a id='line_1262'>      by the sword. Fall on.” The hungry and cruel Arabs would have</a>
<a id='line_1263'>      obeyed the welcome command; and Damascus was lost, if the</a>
<a id='line_1264'>      benevolence of Abu Obeidah had not been supported by a decent and</a>
<a id='line_1265'>      dignified firmness. Throwing himself between the trembling</a>
<a id='line_1266'>      citizens and the most eager of the Barbarians, he adjured them,</a>
<a id='line_1267'>      by the holy name of God, to respect his promise, to suspend their</a>
<a id='line_1268'>      fury, and to wait the determination of their chiefs. The chiefs</a>
<a id='line_1269'>      retired into the church of St. Mary; and after a vehement debate,</a>
<a id='line_1270'>      Caled submitted in some measure to the reason and authority of</a>
<a id='line_1271'>      his colleague; who urged the sanctity of a covenant, the</a>
<a id='line_1272'>      advantage as well as the honor which the Moslems would derive</a>
<a id='line_1273'>      from the punctual performance of their word, and the obstinate</a>
<a id='line_1274'>      resistance which they must encounter from the distrust and</a>
<a id='line_1275'>      despair of the rest of the Syrian cities. It was agreed that the</a>
<a id='line_1276'>      sword should be sheathed, that the part of Damascus which had</a>
<a id='line_1277'>      surrendered to Abu Obeidah, should be immediately entitled to the</a>
<a id='line_1278'>      benefit of his capitulation, and that the final decision should</a>
<a id='line_1279'>      be referred to the justice and wisdom of the caliph. A large</a>
<a id='line_1280'>      majority of the people accepted the terms of toleration and</a>
<a id='line_1281'>      tribute; and Damascus is still peopled by twenty thousand</a>
<a id='line_1282'>      Christians. But the valiant Thomas, and the free-born patriots</a>
<a id='line_1283'>      who had fought under his banner, embraced the alternative of</a>
<a id='line_1284'>      poverty and exile. In the adjacent meadow, a numerous encampment</a>
<a id='line_1285'>      was formed of priests and laymen, of soldiers and citizens, of</a>
<a id='line_1286'>      women and children: they collected, with haste and terror, their</a>
<a id='line_1287'>      most precious movables; and abandoned, with loud lamentations, or</a>
<a id='line_1288'>      silent anguish, their native homes, and the pleasant banks of the</a>
<a id='line_1289'>      Pharpar. The inflexible soul of Caled was not touched by the</a>
<a id='line_1290'>      spectacle of their distress: he disputed with the Damascenes the</a>
<a id='line_1291'>      property of a magazine of corn; endeavored to exclude the</a>
<a id='line_1292'>      garrison from the benefit of the treaty; consented, with</a>
<a id='line_1293'>      reluctance, that each of the fugitives should arm himself with a</a>
<a id='line_1294'>      sword, or a lance, or a bow; and sternly declared, that, after a</a>
<a id='line_1295'>      respite of three days, they might be pursued and treated as the</a>
<a id='line_1296'>      enemies of the Moslems.</a>
<a id='line_1297'></a>
<a id='line_1298'>      The passion of a Syrian youth completed the ruin of the exiles of</a>
<a id='line_1299'>      Damascus. A nobleman of the city, of the name of Jonas, was</a>
<a id='line_1300'>      betrothed to a wealthy maiden; but her parents delayed the</a>
<a id='line_1301'>      consummation of his nuptials, and their daughter was persuaded to</a>
<a id='line_1302'>      escape with the man whom she had chosen. They corrupted the</a>
<a id='line_1303'>      nightly watchmen of the gate Keisan; the lover, who led the way,</a>
<a id='line_1304'>      was encompassed by a squadron of Arabs; but his exclamation in</a>
<a id='line_1305'>      the Greek tongue, “The bird is taken,” admonished his mistress to</a>
<a id='line_1306'>      hasten her return. In the presence of Caled, and of death, the</a>
<a id='line_1307'>      unfortunate Jonas professed his belief in one God and his apostle</a>
<a id='line_1308'>      Mahomet; and continued, till the season of his martyrdom, to</a>
<a id='line_1309'>      discharge the duties of a brave and sincere Mussulman. When the</a>
<a id='line_1310'>      city was taken, he flew to the monastery, where Eudocia had taken</a>
<a id='line_1311'>      refuge; but the lover was forgotten; the apostate was scorned;</a>
<a id='line_1312'>      she preferred her religion to her country; and the justice of</a>
<a id='line_1313'>      Caled, though deaf to mercy, refused to detain by force a male or</a>
<a id='line_1314'>      female inhabitant of Damascus. Four days was the general confined</a>
<a id='line_1315'>      to the city by the obligation of the treaty, and the urgent cares</a>
<a id='line_1316'>      of his new conquest. His appetite for blood and rapine would have</a>
<a id='line_1317'>      been extinguished by the hopeless computation of time and</a>
<a id='line_1318'>      distance; but he listened to the importunities of Jonas, who</a>
<a id='line_1319'>      assured him that the weary fugitives might yet be overtaken. At</a>
<a id='line_1320'>      the head of four thousand horse, in the disguise of Christian</a>
<a id='line_1321'>      Arabs, Caled undertook the pursuit. They halted only for the</a>
<a id='line_1322'>      moments of prayer; and their guide had a perfect knowledge of the</a>
<a id='line_1323'>      country. For a long way the footsteps of the Damascenes were</a>
<a id='line_1324'>      plain and conspicuous: they vanished on a sudden; but the</a>
<a id='line_1325'>      Saracens were comforted by the assurance that the caravan had</a>
<a id='line_1326'>      turned aside into the mountains, and must speedily fall into</a>
<a id='line_1327'>      their hands. In traversing the ridges of the Libanus, they</a>
<a id='line_1328'>      endured intolerable hardships, and the sinking spirits of the</a>
<a id='line_1329'>      veteran fanatics were supported and cheered by the unconquerable</a>
<a id='line_1330'>      ardor of a lover. From a peasant of the country, they were</a>
<a id='line_1331'>      informed that the emperor had sent orders to the colony of exiles</a>
<a id='line_1332'>      to pursue without delay the road of the sea-coast, and of</a>
<a id='line_1333'>      Constantinople, apprehensive, perhaps, that the soldiers and</a>
<a id='line_1334'>      people of Antioch might be discouraged by the sight and the story</a>
<a id='line_1335'>      of their sufferings. The Saracens were conducted through the</a>
<a id='line_1336'>      territories of Gabala and Laodicea, at a cautious distance from</a>
<a id='line_1337'>      the walls of the cities; the rain was incessant, the night was</a>
<a id='line_1338'>      dark, a single mountain separated them from the Roman army; and</a>
<a id='line_1339'>      Caled, ever anxious for the safety of his brethren, whispered an</a>
<a id='line_1340'>      ominous dream in the ear of his companion. With the dawn of day,</a>
<a id='line_1341'>      the prospect again cleared, and they saw before them, in a</a>
<a id='line_1342'>      pleasant valley, the tents of Damascus. After a short interval of</a>
<a id='line_1343'>      repose and prayer, Caled divided his cavalry into four squadrons,</a>
<a id='line_1344'>      committing the first to his faithful Derar, and reserving the</a>
<a id='line_1345'>      last for himself. They successively rushed on the promiscuous</a>
<a id='line_1346'>      multitude, insufficiently provided with arms, and already</a>
<a id='line_1347'>      vanquished by sorrow and fatigue. Except a captive, who was</a>
<a id='line_1348'>      pardoned and dismissed, the Arabs enjoyed the satisfaction of</a>
<a id='line_1349'>      believing that not a Christian of either sex escaped the edge of</a>
<a id='line_1350'>      their cimeters. The gold and silver of Damascus was scattered</a>
<a id='line_1351'>      over the camp, and a royal wardrobe of three hundred load of silk</a>
<a id='line_1352'>      might clothe an army of naked Barbarians. In the tumult of the</a>
<a id='line_1353'>      battle, Jonas sought and found the object of his pursuit: but her</a>
<a id='line_1354'>      resentment was inflamed by the last act of his perfidy; and as</a>
<a id='line_1355'>      Eudocia struggled in his hateful embraces, she struck a dagger to</a>
<a id='line_1356'>      her heart. Another female, the widow of Thomas, and the real or</a>
<a id='line_1357'>      supposed daughter of Heraclius, was spared and released without a</a>
<a id='line_1358'>      ransom; but the generosity of Caled was the effect of his</a>
<a id='line_1359'>      contempt; and the haughty Saracen insulted, by a message of</a>
<a id='line_1360'>      defiance, the throne of the Cæsars. Caled had penetrated above a</a>
<a id='line_1361'>      hundred and fifty miles into the heart of the Roman province: he</a>
<a id='line_1362'>      returned to Damascus with the same secrecy and speed On the</a>
<a id='line_1363'>      accession of Omar, the _Sword of God_ was removed from the</a>
<a id='line_1364'>      command; but the caliph, who blamed the rashness, was compelled</a>
<a id='line_1365'>      to applaud the vigor and conduct, of the enterprise.</a>
<a id='line_1366'></a>
<a id='line_1367'>      Another expedition of the conquerors of Damascus will equally</a>
<a id='line_1368'>      display their avidity and their contempt for the riches of the</a>
<a id='line_1369'>      present world. They were informed that the produce and</a>
<a id='line_1370'>      manufactures of the country were annually collected in the fair</a>
<a id='line_1371'>      of Abyla, 64 about thirty miles from the city; that the cell of a</a>
<a id='line_1372'>      devout hermit was visited at the same time by a multitude of</a>
<a id='line_1373'>      pilgrims; and that the festival of trade and superstition would</a>
<a id='line_1374'>      be ennobled by the nuptials of the daughter of the governor of</a>
<a id='line_1375'>      Tripoli. Abdallah, the son of Jaafar, a glorious and holy martyr,</a>
<a id='line_1376'>      undertook, with a banner of five hundred horse, the pious and</a>
<a id='line_1377'>      profitable commission of despoiling the infidels. As he</a>
<a id='line_1378'>      approached the fair of Abyla, he was astonished by the report of</a>
<a id='line_1379'>      this mighty concourse of Jews and Christians, Greeks, and</a>
<a id='line_1380'>      Armenians, of natives of Syria and of strangers of Egypt, to the</a>
<a id='line_1381'>      number of ten thousand, besides a guard of five thousand horse</a>
<a id='line_1382'>      that attended the person of the bride. The Saracens paused: “For</a>
<a id='line_1383'>      my own part,” said Abdallah, “I dare not go back: our foes are</a>
<a id='line_1384'>      many, our danger is great, but our reward is splendid and secure,</a>
<a id='line_1385'>      either in this life or in the life to come. Let every man,</a>
<a id='line_1386'>      according to his inclination, advance or retire.” Not a Mussulman</a>
<a id='line_1387'>      deserted his standard. “Lead the way,” said Abdallah to his</a>
<a id='line_1388'>      Christian guide, “and you shall see what the companions of the</a>
<a id='line_1389'>      prophet can perform.” They charged in five squadrons; but after</a>
<a id='line_1390'>      the first advantage of the surprise, they were encompassed and</a>
<a id='line_1391'>      almost overwhelmed by the multitude of their enemies; and their</a>
<a id='line_1392'>      valiant band is fancifully compared to a white spot in the skin</a>
<a id='line_1393'>      of a black camel. 65 About the hour of sunset, when their weapons</a>
<a id='line_1394'>      dropped from their hands, when they panted on the verge of</a>
<a id='line_1395'>      eternity, they discovered an approaching cloud of dust; they</a>
<a id='line_1396'>      heard the welcome sound of the tecbir, 66 and they soon perceived</a>
<a id='line_1397'>      the standard of Caled, who flew to their relief with the utmost</a>
<a id='line_1398'>      speed of his cavalry. The Christians were broken by his attack,</a>
<a id='line_1399'>      and slaughtered in their flight, as far as the river of Tripoli.</a>
<a id='line_1400'>      They left behind them the various riches of the fair; the</a>
<a id='line_1401'>      merchandises that were exposed for sale, the money that was</a>
<a id='line_1402'>      brought for purchase, the gay decorations of the nuptials, and</a>

<a id='line_1406'>      jewels, were diligently laden on the backs of horses, asses, and</a>

<a id='line_1408'>      hermit, after a short and angry controversy with Caled, declined</a>
<a id='line_1409'>      the crown of martyrdom, and was left alive in the solitary scene</a>

<a id='line_1436'>      Syria, 67 one of the countries that have been improved by the</a>
<a id='line_1437'>      most early cultivation, is not unworthy of the preference. 68 The</a>
<a id='line_1438'>      heat of the climate is tempered by the vicinity of the sea and</a>
<a id='line_1439'>      mountains, by the plenty of wood and water; and the produce of a</a>
<a id='line_1440'>      fertile soil affords the subsistence, and encourages the</a>
<a id='line_1441'>      propagation, of men and animals. From the age of David to that of</a>
<a id='line_1442'>      Heraclius, the country was overspread with ancient and</a>
<a id='line_1443'>      flourishing cities: the inhabitants were numerous and wealthy;</a>
<a id='line_1444'>      and, after the slow ravage of despotism and superstition, after</a>
<a id='line_1445'>      the recent calamities of the Persian war, Syria could still</a>
<a id='line_1446'>      attract and reward the rapacious tribes of the desert. A plain,</a>
<a id='line_1447'>      of ten days’ journey, from Damascus to Aleppo and Antioch, is</a>
<a id='line_1448'>      watered, on the western side, by the winding course of the</a>
<a id='line_1449'>      Orontes. The hills of Libanus and Anti-Libanus are planted from</a>
<a id='line_1450'>      north to south, between the Orontes and the Mediterranean; and</a>
<a id='line_1451'>      the epithet of hollow (Coelesyria) was applied to a long and</a>
<a id='line_1452'>      fruitful valley, which is confined in the same direction, by the</a>
<a id='line_1453'>      two ridges of snowy mountains. 69 Among the cities, which are</a>
<a id='line_1454'>      enumerated by Greek and Oriental names in the geography and</a>
<a id='line_1455'>      conquest of Syria, we may distinguish Emesa or Hems, Heliopolis</a>
<a id='line_1456'>      or Baalbec, the former as the metropolis of the plain, the latter</a>
<a id='line_1457'>      as the capital of the valley. Under the last of the Caesars, they</a>
<a id='line_1458'>      were strong and populous; the turrets glittered from afar: an</a>
<a id='line_1459'>      ample space was covered with public and private buildings; and</a>
<a id='line_1460'>      the citizens were illustrious by their spirit, or at least by</a>
<a id='line_1461'>      their pride; by their riches, or at least by their luxury. In the</a>
<a id='line_1462'>      days of Paganism, both Emesa and Heliopolis were addicted to the</a>
<a id='line_1463'>      worship of Baal, or the sun; but the decline of their</a>
<a id='line_1464'>      superstition and splendor has been marked by a singular variety</a>
<a id='line_1465'>      of fortune. Not a vestige remains of the temple of Emesa, which</a>
<a id='line_1466'>      was equalled in poetic style to the summits of Mount Libanus, 70</a>
<a id='line_1467'>      while the ruins of Baalbec, invisible to the writers of</a>
<a id='line_1468'>      antiquity, excite the curiosity and wonder of the European</a>
<a id='line_1469'>      traveller. 71 The measure of the temple is two hundred feet in</a>
<a id='line_1470'>      length, and one hundred in breadth: the front is adorned with a</a>
<a id='line_1471'>      double portico of eight columns; fourteen may be counted on</a>
<a id='line_1472'>      either side; and each column, forty-five feet in height, is</a>
<a id='line_1473'>      composed of three massy blocks of stone or marble. The</a>
<a id='line_1474'>      proportions and ornaments of the Corinthian order express the</a>
<a id='line_1475'>      architecture of the Greeks: but as Baalbec has never been the</a>
<a id='line_1476'>      seat of a monarch, we are at a loss to conceive how the expense</a>
<a id='line_1477'>      of these magnificent structures could be supplied by private or</a>
<a id='line_1478'>      municipal liberality. 72 From the conquest of Damascus the</a>

<a id='line_1480'>      the repetition of the sallies and combats which have been already</a>
<a id='line_1481'>      shown on a larger scale. In the prosecution of the war, their</a>
<a id='line_1482'>      policy was not less effectual than their sword. By short and</a>
<a id='line_1483'>      separate truces they dissolved the union of the enemy; accustomed</a>
<a id='line_1484'>      the Syrians to compare their friendship with their enmity;</a>
<a id='line_1485'>      familiarized the idea of their language, religion, and manners;</a>
<a id='line_1486'>      and exhausted, by clandestine purchase, the magazines and</a>
<a id='line_1487'>      arsenals of the cities which they returned to besiege. They</a>
<a id='line_1488'>      aggravated the ransom of the more wealthy, or the more obstinate;</a>
<a id='line_1489'>      and Chalcis alone was taxed at five thousand ounces of gold, five</a>
<a id='line_1490'>      thousand ounces of silver, two thousand robes of silk, and as</a>
<a id='line_1491'>      many figs and olives as would load five thousand asses. But the</a>
<a id='line_1492'>      terms of truce or capitulation were faithfully observed; and the</a>
<a id='line_1493'>      lieutenant of the caliph, who had promised not to enter the walls</a>
<a id='line_1494'>      of the captive Baalbec, remained tranquil and immovable in his</a>
<a id='line_1495'>      tent till the jarring factions solicited the interposition of a</a>
<a id='line_1496'>      foreign master. The conquest of the plain and valley of Syria was</a>
<a id='line_1497'>      achieved in less than two years. Yet the commander of the</a>
<a id='line_1498'>      faithful reproved the slowness of their progress; and the</a>
<a id='line_1499'>      Saracens, bewailing their fault with tears of rage and</a>
<a id='line_1500'>      repentance, called aloud on their chiefs to lead them forth to</a>

<a id='line_1502'>      walls of Emesa, an Arabian youth, the cousin of Caled, was heard</a>
<a id='line_1503'>      aloud to exclaim, “Methinks I see the black-eyed girls looking</a>

<a id='line_1601'>      a long and bloody encounter. 7411 On this momentous occasion, the</a>
<a id='line_1602'>      public voice, and the modesty of Abu Obeidah, restored the</a>
<a id='line_1603'>      command to the most deserving of the Moslems. Caled assumed his</a>
<a id='line_1604'>      station in the front, his colleague was posted in the rear, that</a>
<a id='line_1605'>      the disorder of the fugitive might be checked by his venerable</a>
<a id='line_1606'>      aspect, and the sight of the yellow banner which Mahomet had</a>
<a id='line_1607'>      displayed before the walls of Chaibar. The last line was occupied</a>
<a id='line_1608'>      by the sister of Derar, with the Arabian women who had enlisted</a>
<a id='line_1609'>      in this holy war, who were accustomed to wield the bow and the</a>
<a id='line_1610'>      lance, and who in a moment of captivity had defended, against the</a>
<a id='line_1611'>      uncircumcised ravishers, their chastity and religion. 75 The</a>
<a id='line_1612'>      exhortation of the generals was brief and forcible: “Paradise is</a>
<a id='line_1613'>      before you, the devil and hell-fire in your rear.” Yet such was</a>
<a id='line_1614'>      the weight of the Roman cavalry, that the right wing of the Arabs</a>
<a id='line_1615'>      was broken and separated from the main body. Thrice did they</a>
<a id='line_1616'>      retreat in disorder, and thrice were they driven back to the</a>
<a id='line_1617'>      charge by the reproaches and blows of the women. In the intervals</a>
<a id='line_1618'>      of action, Abu Obeidah visited the tents of his brethren,</a>
<a id='line_1619'>      prolonged their repose by repeating at once the prayers of two</a>
<a id='line_1620'>      different hours, bound up their wounds with his own hands, and</a>
<a id='line_1621'>      administered the comfortable reflection, that the infidels</a>
<a id='line_1622'>      partook of their sufferings without partaking of their reward.</a>
<a id='line_1623'>      Four thousand and thirty of the Moslems were buried in the field</a>
<a id='line_1624'>      of battle; and the skill of the Armenian archers enabled seven</a>
<a id='line_1625'>      hundred to boast that they had lost an eye in that meritorious</a>
<a id='line_1626'>      service. The veterans of the Syrian war acknowledged that it was</a>
<a id='line_1627'>      the hardest and most doubtful of the days which they had seen.</a>
<a id='line_1628'>      But it was likewise the most decisive: many thousands of the</a>
<a id='line_1629'>      Greeks and Syrians fell by the swords of the Arabs; many were</a>
<a id='line_1630'>      slaughtered, after the defeat, in the woods and mountains; many,</a>
<a id='line_1631'>      by mistaking the ford, were drowned in the waters of the Yermuk;</a>

<a id='line_1721'>      bravest of the fugitives of Yermuk had stopped in the nearest</a>

<a id='line_1723'>      the natives and strangers might feel some sparks of the</a>
<a id='line_1724'>      enthusiasm, which so fiercely glowed in the bosoms of the</a>

<a id='line_1726'>      was lost without some action of sally or assault; the military</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      engines incessantly played from the ramparts; and the inclemency</a>
<a id='line_1728'>      of the winter was still more painful and destructive to the</a>
<a id='line_1729'>      Arabs. The Christians yielded at length to the perseverance of</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      the besiegers. The patriarch Sophronius appeared on the walls,</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      and by the voice of an interpreter demanded a conference. 7911</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      After a vain attempt to dissuade the lieutenant of the caliph</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      from his impious enterprise, he proposed, in the name of the</a>
<a id='line_1734'>      people, a fair capitulation, with this extraordinary clause, that</a>
<a id='line_1735'>      the articles of security should be ratified by the authority and</a>
<a id='line_1736'>      presence of Omar himself. The question was debated in the council</a>
<a id='line_1737'>      of Medina; the sanctity of the place, and the advice of Ali,</a>
<a id='line_1738'>      persuaded the caliph to gratify the wishes of his soldiers and</a>
<a id='line_1739'>      enemies; and the simplicity of his journey is more illustrious</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      than the royal pageants of vanity and oppression. The conqueror</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      of Persia and Syria was mounted on a red camel, which carried,</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      besides his person, a bag of corn, a bag of dates, a wooden dish,</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      and a leathern bottle of water. Wherever he halted, the company,</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      without distinction, was invited to partake of his homely fare,</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      and the repast was consecrated by the prayer and exhortation of</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      the commander of the faithful. 80 But in this expedition or</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      pilgrimage, his power was exercised in the administration of</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      justice: he reformed the licentious polygamy of the Arabs,</a>
<a id='line_1749'>      relieved the tributaries from extortion and cruelty, and</a>
<a id='line_1750'>      chastised the luxury of the Saracens, by despoiling them of their</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      rich silks, and dragging them on their faces in the dirt. When he</a>
<a id='line_1752'>      came within sight of Jerusalem, the caliph cried with a loud</a>
<a id='line_1753'>      voice, “God is victorious. O Lord, give us an easy conquest!”</a>
<a id='line_1754'>      and, pitching his tent of coarse hair, calmly seated himself on</a>
<a id='line_1755'>      the ground. After signing the capitulation, he entered the city</a>
<a id='line_1756'>      without fear or precaution; and courteously discoursed with the</a>
<a id='line_1757'>      patriarch concerning its religious antiquities. 81 Sophronius</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      bowed before his new master, and secretly muttered, in the words</a>
<a id='line_1759'>      of Daniel, “The abomination of desolation is in the holy place.”</a>
<a id='line_1760'>      82 At the hour of prayer they stood together in the church of the</a>
<a id='line_1761'>      resurrection; but the caliph refused to perform his devotions,</a>
<a id='line_1762'>      and contented himself with praying on the steps of the church of</a>
<a id='line_1763'>      Constantine. To the patriarch he disclosed his prudent and</a>
<a id='line_1764'>      honorable motive. “Had I yielded,” said Omar, “to your request,</a>
<a id='line_1765'>      the Moslems of a future age would have infringed the treaty under</a>
<a id='line_1766'>      color of imitating my example.” By his command the ground of the</a>
<a id='line_1767'>      temple of Solomon was prepared for the foundation of a mosch; 83</a>
<a id='line_1768'>      and, during a residence of ten days, he regulated the present and</a>

<a id='line_1816'>      the castle of Aleppo, 85 distinct from the city, stood erect on a</a>
<a id='line_1817'>      lofty artificial mound; the sides were sharpened to a precipice,</a>
<a id='line_1818'>      and faced with free-stone; and the breadth of the ditch might be</a>

<a id='line_1825'>      wounded: their removal to the distance of a mile could not seduce</a>
<a id='line_1826'>      the vigilance of Youkinna; nor could the Christians be terrified</a>
<a id='line_1827'>      by the execution of three hundred captives, whom they beheaded</a>

<a id='line_1830'>      and patience were consumed at the foot of this impregnable</a>
<a id='line_1831'>      fortress. “I am variously affected,” replied Omar, “by the</a>
<a id='line_1832'>      difference of your success; but I charge you by no means to raise</a>
<a id='line_1833'>      the siege of the castle. Your retreat would diminish the</a>

<a id='line_1836'>      the event, and forage with your horse round the adjacent</a>

<a id='line_1838'>      fortified by a supply of volunteers from all the tribes of</a>
<a id='line_1839'>      Arabia, who arrived in the camp on horses or camels. Among these</a>
<a id='line_1840'>      was Dames, of a servile birth, but of gigantic size and intrepid</a>
<a id='line_1841'>      resolution. The forty-seventh day of his service he proposed,</a>
<a id='line_1842'>      with only thirty men, to make an attempt on the castle. The</a>
<a id='line_1843'>      experience and testimony of Caled recommended his offer; and Abu</a>
<a id='line_1844'>      Obeidah admonished his brethren not to despise the baser origin</a>
<a id='line_1845'>      of Dames, since he himself, could he relinquish the public care,</a>
<a id='line_1846'>      would cheerfully serve under the banner of the slave. His design</a>
<a id='line_1847'>      was covered by the appearance of a retreat; and the camp of the</a>
<a id='line_1848'>      Saracens was pitched about a league from Aleppo. The thirty</a>
<a id='line_1849'>      adventurers lay in ambush at the foot of the hill; and Dames at</a>
<a id='line_1850'>      length succeeded in his inquiries, though he was provoked by the</a>
<a id='line_1851'>      ignorance of his Greek captives. “God curse these dogs,” said the</a>
<a id='line_1852'>      illiterate Arab; “what a strange barbarous language they speak!”</a>
<a id='line_1853'>      At the darkest hour of the night, he scaled the most accessible</a>
<a id='line_1854'>      height, which he had diligently surveyed, a place where the</a>
<a id='line_1855'>      stones were less entire, or the slope less perpendicular, or the</a>
<a id='line_1856'>      guard less vigilant. Seven of the stoutest Saracens mounted on</a>
<a id='line_1857'>      each other’s shoulders, and the weight of the column was</a>
<a id='line_1858'>      sustained on the broad and sinewy back of the gigantic slave. The</a>
<a id='line_1859'>      foremost in this painful ascent could grasp and climb the lowest</a>
<a id='line_1860'>      part of the battlements; they silently stabbed and cast down the</a>
<a id='line_1861'>      sentinels; and the thirty brethren, repeating a pious</a>
<a id='line_1862'>      ejaculation, “O apostle of God, help and deliver us!” were</a>
<a id='line_1863'>      successively drawn up by the long folds of their turbans. With</a>
<a id='line_1864'>      bold and cautious footsteps, Dames explored the palace of the</a>
<a id='line_1865'>      governor, who celebrated, in riotous merriment, the festival of</a>
<a id='line_1866'>      his deliverance. From thence, returning to his companions, he</a>
<a id='line_1867'>      assaulted on the inside the entrance of the castle. They</a>
<a id='line_1868'>      overpowered the guard, unbolted the gate, let down the</a>
<a id='line_1869'>      drawbridge, and defended the narrow pass, till the arrival of</a>
<a id='line_1870'>      Caled, with the dawn of day, relieved their danger and assured</a>
<a id='line_1871'>      their conquest. Youkinna, a formidable foe, became an active and</a>
<a id='line_1872'>      useful proselyte; and the general of the Saracens expressed his</a>
<a id='line_1873'>      regard for the most humble merit, by detaining the army at Aleppo</a>
<a id='line_1874'>      till Dames was cured of his honorable wounds. The capital of</a>
<a id='line_1875'>      Syria was still covered by the castle of Aazaz and the iron</a>
<a id='line_1876'>      bridge of the Orontes. After the loss of those important posts,</a>
<a id='line_1877'>      and the defeat of the last of the Roman armies, the luxury of</a>

<a id='line_2141'>      when the meanest of the brethren was exalted above his nature by</a>

<a id='line_2148'>      against the person and doctrine of Mahomet; his dexterity was</a>
<a id='line_2149'>      employed by the reigning faction to pursue the religious exiles</a>
<a id='line_2150'>      who had taken refuge in the court of the Aethiopian king. 97 Yet</a>
<a id='line_2151'>      he returned from this embassy a secret proselyte; his reason or</a>
<a id='line_2152'>      his interest determined him to renounce the worship of idols; he</a>
<a id='line_2153'>      escaped from Mecca with his friend Caled; and the prophet of</a>
<a id='line_2154'>      Medina enjoyed at the same moment the satisfaction of embracing</a>
<a id='line_2155'>      the two firmest champions of his cause. The impatience of Amrou</a>
<a id='line_2156'>      to lead the armies of the faithful was checked by the reproof of</a>
<a id='line_2157'>      Omar, who advised him not to seek power and dominion, since he</a>
<a id='line_2158'>      who is a subject to-day, may be a prince to-morrow. Yet his merit</a>
<a id='line_2159'>      was not overlooked by the two first successors of Mahomet; they</a>
<a id='line_2160'>      were indebted to his arms for the conquest of Palestine; and in</a>
<a id='line_2161'>      all the battles and sieges of Syria, he united with the temper of</a>
<a id='line_2162'>      a chief the valor of an adventurous soldier. In a visit to</a>
<a id='line_2163'>      Medina, the caliph expressed a wish to survey the sword which had</a>
<a id='line_2164'>      cut down so many Christian warriors; the son of Aasi unsheathed a</a>
<a id='line_2165'>      short and ordinary cimeter; and as he perceived the surprise of</a>
<a id='line_2166'>      Omar, “Alas,” said the modest Saracen, “the sword itself, without</a>
<a id='line_2167'>      the arm of its master, is neither sharper nor more weighty than</a>
<a id='line_2168'>      the sword of Pharezdak the poet.” 98 After the conquest of Egypt,</a>
<a id='line_2169'>      he was recalled by the jealousy of the caliph Othman; but in the</a>
<a id='line_2170'>      subsequent troubles, the ambition of a soldier, a statesman, and</a>

<a id='line_2254'>      numbered among the greatest and most populous of the provincial</a>
<a id='line_2255'>      cities. 101 The banks of the Nile, in this place of the breadth</a>

<a id='line_2266'>      be imputed to the art and labor of his Syrian allies. Yet the</a>
<a id='line_2267'>      siege was protracted to seven months; and the rash invaders were</a>
<a id='line_2268'>      encompassed and threatened by the inundation of the Nile. 103</a>
<a id='line_2269'>      Their last assault was bold and successful: they passed the</a>

<a id='line_2344'>      a sect into a nation, and alienated Egypt from their religion and</a>
<a id='line_2345'>      government. The Saracens were received as the deliverers of the</a>
<a id='line_2346'>      Jacobite church; and a secret and effectual treaty was opened</a>
<a id='line_2347'>      during the siege of Memphis between a victorious army and a</a>
<a id='line_2348'>      people of slaves. A rich and noble Egyptian, of the name of</a>
<a id='line_2349'>      Mokawkas, had dissembled his faith to obtain the administration</a>
<a id='line_2350'>      of his province: in the disorders of the Persian war he aspired</a>
<a id='line_2351'>      to independence: the embassy of Mahomet ranked him among princes;</a>
<a id='line_2352'>      but he declined, with rich gifts and ambiguous compliments, the</a>
<a id='line_2353'>      proposal of a new religion. 108 The abuse of his trust exposed</a>
<a id='line_2354'>      him to the resentment of Heraclius: his submission was delayed by</a>
<a id='line_2355'>      arrogance and fear; and his conscience was prompted by interest</a>
<a id='line_2356'>      to throw himself on the favor of the nation and the support of</a>
<a id='line_2357'>      the Saracens. In his first conference with Amrou, he heard</a>
<a id='line_2358'>      without indignation the usual option of the Koran, the tribute,</a>
<a id='line_2359'>      or the sword. “The Greeks,” replied Mokawkas, “are determined to</a>
<a id='line_2360'>      abide the determination of the sword; but with the Greeks I</a>
<a id='line_2361'>      desire no communion, either in this world or in the next, and I</a>

<a id='line_2366'>      your prophet; but we are desirous of peace, and cheerfully submit</a>
<a id='line_2367'>      to pay tribute and obedience to his temporal successors.” The</a>
<a id='line_2368'>      tribute was ascertained at two pieces of gold for the head of</a>
<a id='line_2369'>      every Christian; but old men, monks, women, and children, of both</a>
<a id='line_2370'>      sexes, under sixteen years of age, were exempted from this</a>
<a id='line_2371'>      personal assessment: the Copts above and below Memphis swore</a>
<a id='line_2372'>      allegiance to the caliph, and promised a hospitable entertainment</a>
<a id='line_2373'>      of three days to every Mussulman who should travel through their</a>
<a id='line_2374'>      country. By this charter of security, the ecclesiastical and</a>
<a id='line_2375'>      civil tyranny of the Melchites was destroyed: 109 the anathemas</a>
<a id='line_2376'>      of St. Cyril were thundered from every pulpit; and the sacred</a>
<a id='line_2377'>      edifices, with the patrimony of the church, were restored to the</a>
<a id='line_2378'>      national communion of the Jacobites, who enjoyed without</a>
<a id='line_2379'>      moderation the moment of triumph and revenge. At the pressing</a>
<a id='line_2380'>      summons of Amrou, their patriarch Benjamin emerged from his</a>
<a id='line_2381'>      desert; and after the first interview, the courteous Arab</a>
<a id='line_2382'>      affected to declare that he had never conversed with a Christian</a>

<a id='line_2425'>      By the retreat of the Greeks from the provinces of Upper Egypt, a</a>
<a id='line_2426'>      considerable force was collected in the Island of Delta; the</a>
<a id='line_2427'>      natural and artificial channels of the Nile afforded a succession</a>
<a id='line_2428'>      of strong and defensible posts; and the road to Alexandria was</a>
<a id='line_2429'>      laboriously cleared by the victory of the Saracens in</a>
<a id='line_2430'>      two-and-twenty days of general or partial combat. In their annals</a>
<a id='line_2431'>      of conquest, the siege of Alexandria 111 is perhaps the most</a>
<a id='line_2432'>      arduous and important enterprise. The first trading city in the</a>
<a id='line_2433'>      world was abundantly replenished with the means of subsistence</a>
<a id='line_2434'>      and defence. Her numerous inhabitants fought for the dearest of</a>
<a id='line_2435'>      human rights, religion and property; and the enmity of the</a>
<a id='line_2436'>      natives seemed to exclude them from the common benefit of peace</a>
<a id='line_2437'>      and toleration. The sea was continually open; and if Heraclius</a>
<a id='line_2438'>      had been awake to the public distress, fresh armies of Romans and</a>
<a id='line_2439'>      Barbarians might have been poured into the harbor to save the</a>
<a id='line_2440'>      second capital of the empire. A circumference of ten miles would</a>
<a id='line_2441'>      have scattered the forces of the Greeks, and favored the</a>
<a id='line_2442'>      stratagems of an active enemy; but the two sides of an oblong</a>
<a id='line_2443'>      square were covered by the sea and the Lake Maraeotis, and each</a>
<a id='line_2444'>      of the narrow ends exposed a front of no more than ten furlongs.</a>
<a id='line_2445'>      The efforts of the Arabs were not inadequate to the difficulty of</a>
<a id='line_2446'>      the attempt and the value of the prize. From the throne of</a>
<a id='line_2447'>      Medina, the eyes of Omar were fixed on the camp and city: his</a>
<a id='line_2448'>      voice excited to arms the Arabian tribes and the veterans of</a>
<a id='line_2449'>      Syria; and the merit of a holy war was recommended by the</a>
<a id='line_2450'>      peculiar fame and fertility of Egypt. Anxious for the ruin or</a>
<a id='line_2451'>      expulsion of their tyrants, the faithful natives devoted their</a>
<a id='line_2452'>      labors to the service of Amrou: some sparks of martial spirit</a>
<a id='line_2453'>      were perhaps rekindled by the example of their allies; and the</a>
<a id='line_2454'>      sanguine hopes of Mokawkas had fixed his sepulchre in the church</a>
<a id='line_2455'>      of St. John of Alexandria. Eutychius the patriarch observes, that</a>
<a id='line_2456'>      the Saracens fought with the courage of lions: they repulsed the</a>
<a id='line_2457'>      frequent and almost daily sallies of the besieged, and soon</a>
<a id='line_2458'>      assaulted in their turn the walls and towers of the city. In</a>
<a id='line_2459'>      every attack, the sword, the banner of Amrou, glittered in the</a>
<a id='line_2460'>      van of the Moslems. On a memorable day, he was betrayed by his</a>
<a id='line_2461'>      imprudent valor: his followers who had entered the citadel were</a>
<a id='line_2462'>      driven back; and the general, with a friend and slave, remained a</a>
<a id='line_2463'>      prisoner in the hands of the Christians. When Amrou was conducted</a>
<a id='line_2464'>      before the praefect, he remembered his dignity, and forgot his</a>
<a id='line_2465'>      situation: a lofty demeanor, and resolute language, revealed the</a>
<a id='line_2466'>      lieutenant of the caliph, and the battle-axe of a soldier was</a>
<a id='line_2467'>      already raised to strike off the head of the audacious captive.</a>
<a id='line_2468'>      His life was saved by the readiness of his slave, who instantly</a>
<a id='line_2469'>      gave his master a blow on the face, and commanded him, with an</a>
<a id='line_2470'>      angry tone, to be silent in the presence of his superiors. The</a>
<a id='line_2471'>      credulous Greek was deceived: he listened to the offer of a</a>
<a id='line_2472'>      treaty, and his prisoners were dismissed in the hope of a more</a>
<a id='line_2473'>      respectable embassy, till the joyful acclamations of the camp</a>
<a id='line_2474'>      announced the return of their general, and insulted the folly of</a>
<a id='line_2475'>      the infidels. At length, after a siege of fourteen months, 112</a>
<a id='line_2476'>      and the loss of three-and-twenty thousand men, the Saracens</a>
<a id='line_2477'>      prevailed: the Greeks embarked their dispirited and diminished</a>
<a id='line_2478'>      numbers, and the standard of Mahomet was planted on the walls of</a>
<a id='line_2479'>      the capital of Egypt. “I have taken,” said Amrou to the caliph,</a>
<a id='line_2480'>      “the great city of the West. It is impossible for me to enumerate</a>
<a id='line_2481'>      the variety of its riches and beauty; and I shall content myself</a>
<a id='line_2482'>      with observing, that it contains four thousand palaces, four</a>
<a id='line_2483'>      thousand baths, four hundred theatres or places of amusement,</a>
<a id='line_2484'>      twelve thousand shops for the sale of vegetable food, and forty</a>
<a id='line_2485'>      thousand tributary Jews. The town has been subdued by force of</a>
<a id='line_2486'>      arms, without treaty or capitulation, and the Moslems are</a>
<a id='line_2487'>      impatient to seize the fruits of their victory.” 113 The</a>
<a id='line_2488'>      commander of the faithful rejected with firmness the idea of</a>
<a id='line_2489'>      pillage, and directed his lieutenant to reserve the wealth and</a>
<a id='line_2490'>      revenue of Alexandria for the public service and the propagation</a>
<a id='line_2491'>      of the faith: the inhabitants were numbered; a tribute was</a>
<a id='line_2492'>      imposed, the zeal and resentment of the Jacobites were curbed,</a>
<a id='line_2493'>      and the Melchites who submitted to the Arabian yoke were indulged</a>
<a id='line_2494'>      in the obscure but tranquil exercise of their worship. The</a>
<a id='line_2495'>      intelligence of this disgraceful and calamitous event afflicted</a>
<a id='line_2496'>      the declining health of the emperor; and Heraclius died of a</a>
<a id='line_2497'>      dropsy about seven weeks after the loss of Alexandria. 114 Under</a>
<a id='line_2498'>      the minority of his grandson, the clamors of a people, deprived</a>
<a id='line_2499'>      of their daily sustenance, compelled the Byzantine court to</a>
<a id='line_2500'>      undertake the recovery of the capital of Egypt. In the space of</a>
<a id='line_2501'>      four years, the harbor and fortifications of Alexandria were</a>
<a id='line_2502'>      twice occupied by a fleet and army of Romans. They were twice</a>
<a id='line_2503'>      expelled by the valor of Amrou, who was recalled by the domestic</a>

<a id='line_2505'>      facility of the attempt, the repetition of the insult, and the</a>
<a id='line_2506'>      obstinacy of the resistance, provoked him to swear, that if a</a>

<a id='line_2554'>      hours, the Arabian chief was pleased with the conversation of</a>

<a id='line_2556'>      of Philoponus from his laborious studies of grammar and</a>
<a id='line_2557'>      philosophy. 115 Emboldened by this familiar intercourse,</a>
<a id='line_2558'>      Philoponus presumed to solicit a gift, inestimable in his</a>
<a id='line_2559'>      opinion, contemptible in that of the Barbarians—the royal</a>
<a id='line_2560'>      library, which alone, among the spoils of Alexandria, had not</a>
<a id='line_2561'>      been appropriated by the visit and the seal of the conqueror.</a>
<a id='line_2562'></a>
<a id='line_2563'>      Amrou was inclined to gratify the wish of the grammarian, but his</a>
<a id='line_2564'>      rigid integrity refused to alienate the minutest object without</a>
<a id='line_2565'>      the consent of the caliph; and the well-known answer of Omar was</a>
<a id='line_2566'>      inspired by the ignorance of a fanatic. “If these writings of the</a>
<a id='line_2567'>      Greeks agree with the book of God, they are useless, and need not</a>
<a id='line_2568'>      be preserved: if they disagree, they are pernicious, and ought to</a>
<a id='line_2569'>      be destroyed.” The sentence was executed with blind obedience:</a>
<a id='line_2570'>      the volumes of paper or parchment were distributed to the four</a>
<a id='line_2571'>      thousand baths of the city; and such was their incredible</a>
<a id='line_2572'>      multitude, that six months were barely sufficient for the</a>
<a id='line_2573'>      consumption of this precious fuel. Since the Dynasties of</a>
<a id='line_2574'>      Abulpharagius 116 have been given to the world in a Latin</a>
<a id='line_2575'>      version, the tale has been repeatedly transcribed; and every</a>

<a id='line_2577'>      shipwreck of the learning, the arts, and the genius, of</a>
<a id='line_2578'>      antiquity. For my own part, I am strongly tempted to deny both</a>
<a id='line_2579'>      the fact and the consequences. 1161 The fact is indeed</a>
<a id='line_2580'>      marvellous. “Read and wonder!” says the historian himself: and</a>
<a id='line_2581'>      the solitary report of a stranger who wrote at the end of six</a>
<a id='line_2582'>      hundred years on the confines of Media, is overbalanced by the</a>
<a id='line_2583'>      silence of two annalist of a more early date, both Christians,</a>
<a id='line_2584'>      both natives of Egypt, and the most ancient of whom, the</a>
<a id='line_2585'>      patriarch Eutychius, has amply described the conquest of</a>
<a id='line_2586'>      Alexandria. 117 The rigid sentence of Omar is repugnant to the</a>
<a id='line_2587'>      sound and orthodox precept of the Mahometan casuists they</a>
<a id='line_2588'>      expressly declare, that the religious books of the Jews and</a>
<a id='line_2589'>      Christians, which are acquired by the right of war, should never</a>
<a id='line_2590'>      be committed to the flames; and that the works of profane</a>
<a id='line_2591'>      science, historians or poets, physicians or philosophers, may be</a>
<a id='line_2592'>      lawfully applied to the use of the faithful. 118 A more</a>
<a id='line_2593'>      destructive zeal may perhaps be attributed to the first</a>
<a id='line_2594'>      successors of Mahomet; yet in this instance, the conflagration</a>
<a id='line_2595'>      would have speedily expired in the deficiency of materials. I</a>
<a id='line_2596'>      should not recapitulate the disasters of the Alexandrian library,</a>
<a id='line_2597'>      the involuntary flame that was kindled by Caesar in his own</a>

<a id='line_2604'>      volumes, which had been assembled by the curiosity and</a>
<a id='line_2605'>      magnificence of the Ptolemies. 121 Perhaps the church and seat of</a>
<a id='line_2606'>      the patriarchs might be enriched with a repository of books; but</a>
<a id='line_2607'>      if the ponderous mass of Arian and Monophysite controversy were</a>
<a id='line_2608'>      indeed consumed in the public baths, 122 a philosopher may allow,</a>

<a id='line_2921'>      The pious design was approved by the companions of Mahomet and</a>
<a id='line_2922'>      the chiefs of the tribes; and twenty thousand Arabs marched from</a>

<a id='line_2924'>      faithful. They were joined in the camp of Memphis by twenty</a>

<a id='line_2926'>      intrusted to Abdallah, 139 the son of Said and the foster-brother</a>
<a id='line_2927'>      of the caliph, who had lately supplanted the conqueror and</a>

<a id='line_2929'>      of his favorite, could not obliterate the guilt of his apostasy.</a>
<a id='line_2930'>      The early conversion of Abdallah, and his skilful pen, had</a>
<a id='line_2931'>      recommended him to the important office of transcribing the</a>
<a id='line_2932'>      sheets of the Koran: he betrayed his trust, corrupted the text,</a>
<a id='line_2933'>      derided the errors which he had made, and fled to Mecca to escape</a>
<a id='line_2934'>      the justice, and expose the ignorance, of the apostle. After the</a>
<a id='line_2935'>      conquest of Mecca, he fell prostrate at the feet of Mahomet; his</a>
<a id='line_2936'>      tears, and the entreaties of Othman, extorted a reluctant pardon;</a>
<a id='line_2937'>      but the prophet declared that he had so long hesitated, to allow</a>
<a id='line_2938'>      time for some zealous disciple to avenge his injury in the blood</a>
<a id='line_2939'>      of the apostate. With apparent fidelity and effective merit, he</a>
<a id='line_2940'>      served the religion which it was no longer his interest to</a>
<a id='line_2941'>      desert: his birth and talents gave him an honorable rank among</a>
<a id='line_2942'>      the Koreish; and, in a nation of cavalry, Abdallah was renowned</a>
<a id='line_2943'>      as the boldest and most dexterous horseman of Arabia. At the head</a>
<a id='line_2944'>      of forty thousand Moslems, he advanced from Egypt into the</a>
<a id='line_2945'>      unknown countries of the West. The sands of Barca might be</a>
<a id='line_2946'>      impervious to a Roman legion but the Arabs were attended by their</a>
<a id='line_2947'>      faithful camels; and the natives of the desert beheld without</a>
<a id='line_2948'>      terror the familiar aspect of the soil and climate. After a</a>

<a id='line_2953'>      reenforcement of Greeks was surprised and cut in pieces on the</a>
<a id='line_2954'>      sea-shore; but the fortifications of Tripoli resisted the first</a>

<a id='line_2957'>      the perils and the hopes of a decisive action. If his standard</a>

<a id='line_3869'>      On the intelligence of this rapid success, the applause of Musa</a>
<a id='line_3870'>      degenerated into envy; and he began, not to complain, but to</a>
<a id='line_3871'>      fear, that Tarik would leave him nothing to subdue. At the head</a>
<a id='line_3872'>      of ten thousand Arabs and eight thousand Africans, he passed over</a>
<a id='line_3873'>      in person from Mauritania to Spain: the first of his companions</a>
<a id='line_3874'>      were the noblest of the Koreish; his eldest son was left in the</a>
<a id='line_3875'>      command of Africa; the three younger brethren were of an age and</a>
<a id='line_3876'>      spirit to second the boldest enterprises of their father. At his</a>
<a id='line_3877'>      landing in Algezire, he was respectfully entertained by Count</a>
<a id='line_3878'>      Julian, who stifled his inward remorse, and testified, both in</a>
<a id='line_3879'>      words and actions, that the victory of the Arabs had not impaired</a>
<a id='line_3880'>      his attachment to their cause. Some enemies yet remained for the</a>
<a id='line_3881'>      sword of Musa. The tardy repentance of the Goths had compared</a>
<a id='line_3882'>      their own numbers and those of the invaders; the cities from</a>
<a id='line_3883'>      which the march of Tarik had declined considered themselves as</a>
<a id='line_3884'>      impregnable; and the bravest patriots defended the fortifications</a>
<a id='line_3885'>      of Seville and Merida. They were successively besieged and</a>
<a id='line_3886'>      reduced by the labor of Musa, who transported his camp from the</a>
<a id='line_3887'>      Boetis to the Anas, from the Guadalquivir to the Guadiana. When</a>
<a id='line_3888'>      he beheld the works of Roman magnificence, the bridge, the</a>
<a id='line_3889'>      aqueducts, the triumphal arches, and the theatre, of the ancient</a>
<a id='line_3890'>      metropolis of Lusitania, “I should imagine,” said he to his four</a>
<a id='line_3891'>      companions, “that the human race must have united their art and</a>
<a id='line_3892'>      power in the foundation of this city: happy is the man who shall</a>
<a id='line_3893'>      become its master!” He aspired to that happiness, but the</a>
<a id='line_3894'>      Emeritans sustained on this occasion the honor of their descent</a>
<a id='line_3895'>      from the veteran legionaries of Augustus 183 Disdaining the</a>
<a id='line_3896'>      confinement of their walls, they gave battle to the Arabs on the</a>
<a id='line_3897'>      plain; but an ambuscade rising from the shelter of a quarry, or a</a>
<a id='line_3898'>      ruin, chastised their indiscretion, and intercepted their return.</a>
<a id='line_3899'></a>
<a id='line_3900'>      The wooden turrets of assault were rolled forwards to the foot of</a>
<a id='line_3901'>      the rampart; but the defence of Merida was obstinate and long;</a>
<a id='line_3902'>      and the castle of the martyrs was a perpetual testimony of the</a>
<a id='line_3903'>      losses of the Moslems. The constancy of the besieged was at</a>
<a id='line_3904'>      length subdued by famine and despair; and the prudent victor</a>
<a id='line_3905'>      disguised his impatience under the names of clemency and esteem.</a>
<a id='line_3906'>      The alternative of exile or tribute was allowed; the churches</a>
<a id='line_3907'>      were divided between the two religions; and the wealth of those</a>
<a id='line_3908'>      who had fallen in the siege, or retired to Gallicia, was</a>
<a id='line_3909'>      confiscated as the reward of the faithful. In the midway between</a>
<a id='line_3910'>      Merida and Toledo, the lieutenant of Musa saluted the vicegerent</a>
<a id='line_3911'>      of the caliph, and conducted him to the palace of the Gothic</a>
<a id='line_3912'>      kings. Their first interview was cold and formal: a rigid account</a>
<a id='line_3913'>      was exacted of the treasures of Spain: the character of Tarik was</a>
<a id='line_3914'>      exposed to suspicion and obloquy; and the hero was imprisoned,</a>
<a id='line_3915'>      reviled, and ignominiously scourged by the hand, or the command,</a>
<a id='line_3916'>      of Musa. Yet so strict was the discipline, so pure the zeal, or</a>
<a id='line_3917'>      so tame the spirit, of the primitive Moslems, that, after this</a>
<a id='line_3918'>      public indignity, Tarik could serve and be trusted in the</a>
<a id='line_3919'>      reduction of the Tarragonest province. A mosch was erected at</a>
<a id='line_3920'>      Saragossa, by the liberality of the Koreish: the port of</a>
<a id='line_3921'>      Barcelona was opened to the vessels of Syria; and the Goths were</a>
<a id='line_3922'>      pursued beyond the Pyrenaean mountains into their Gallic province</a>
<a id='line_3923'>      of Septimania or Languedoc. 184 In the church of St. Mary at</a>
<a id='line_3924'>      Carcassone, Musa found, but it is improbable that he left, seven</a>
<a id='line_3925'>      equestrian statues of massy silver; and from his term or column</a>
<a id='line_3926'>      of Narbonne, he returned on his footsteps to the Gallician and</a>
<a id='line_3927'>      Lusitanian shores of the ocean. During the absence of the father,</a>
<a id='line_3928'>      his son Abdelaziz chastised the insurgents of Seville, and</a>
<a id='line_3929'>      reduced, from Malaga to Valentia, the sea-coast of the</a>
<a id='line_3930'>      Mediterranean: his original treaty with the discreet and valiant</a>
<a id='line_3931'>      Theodemir 185 will represent the manners and policy of the times.</a>
<a id='line_3932'>      “The conditions of peace agreed and sworn between Abdelaziz, the</a>

<a id='line_3935'>      peace on these conditions: that Theodemir shall not be disturbed</a>

<a id='line_3944'>      one piece of gold, four measures of wheat, as many of barley,</a>
<a id='line_3945'>      with a certain proportion of honey, oil, and vinegar; and that</a>

<a id='line_3947'>      imposition. Given the fourth of Regeb, in the year of the Hegira</a>
<a id='line_3948'>      ninety-four, and subscribed with the names of four Mussulman</a>
<a id='line_3949'>      witnesses.” 186 Theodemir and his subjects were treated with</a>
<a id='line_3950'>      uncommon lenity; but the rate of tribute appears to have</a>
<a id='line_3951'>      fluctuated from a tenth to a fifth, according to the submission</a>
<a id='line_3952'>      or obstinacy of the Christians. 187 In this revolution, many</a>
<a id='line_3953'>      partial calamities were inflicted by the carnal or religious</a>
<a id='line_3954'>      passions of the enthusiasts: some churches were profaned by the</a>
<a id='line_3955'>      new worship: some relics or images were confounded with idols:</a>
<a id='line_3956'>      the rebels were put to the sword; and one town (an obscure place</a>
<a id='line_3957'>      between Cordova and Seville) was razed to its foundations. Yet if</a>
<a id='line_3958'>      we compare the invasion of Spain by the Goths, or its recovery by</a>
<a id='line_3959'>      the kings of Castile and Arragon, we must applaud the moderation</a>

<a id='line_4012'>      The exploits of Musa were performed in the evening of life,</a>
<a id='line_4013'>      though he affected to disguise his age by coloring with a red</a>
<a id='line_4014'>      powder the whiteness of his beard. But in the love of action and</a>
<a id='line_4015'>      glory, his breast was still fired with the ardor of youth; and</a>
<a id='line_4016'>      the possession of Spain was considered only as the first step to</a>
<a id='line_4017'>      the monarchy of Europe. With a powerful armament by sea and land,</a>
<a id='line_4018'>      he was preparing to repass the Pyrenees, to extinguish in Gaul</a>
<a id='line_4019'>      and Italy the declining kingdoms of the Franks and Lombards, and</a>
<a id='line_4020'>      to preach the unity of God on the altar of the Vatican. From</a>
<a id='line_4021'>      thence, subduing the Barbarians of Germany, he proposed to follow</a>
<a id='line_4022'>      the course of the Danube from its source to the Euxine Sea, to</a>
<a id='line_4023'>      overthrow the Greek or Roman empire of Constantinople, and</a>
<a id='line_4024'>      returning from Europe to Asia, to unite his new acquisitions with</a>
<a id='line_4025'>      Antioch and the provinces of Syria. 188 But his vast enterprise,</a>
<a id='line_4026'>      perhaps of easy execution, must have seemed extravagant to vulgar</a>
<a id='line_4027'>      minds; and the visionary conqueror was soon reminded of his</a>
<a id='line_4028'>      dependence and servitude. The friends of Tarik had effectually</a>
<a id='line_4029'>      stated his services and wrongs: at the court of Damascus, the</a>
<a id='line_4030'>      proceedings of Musa were blamed, his intentions were suspected,</a>
<a id='line_4031'>      and his delay in complying with the first invitation was</a>
<a id='line_4032'>      chastised by a harsher and more peremptory summons. An intrepid</a>
<a id='line_4033'>      messenger of the caliph entered his camp at Lugo in Gallicia, and</a>
<a id='line_4034'>      in the presence of the Saracens and Christians arrested the</a>
<a id='line_4035'>      bridle of his horse. His own loyalty, or that of his troops,</a>
<a id='line_4036'>      inculcated the duty of obedience: and his disgrace was alleviated</a>
<a id='line_4037'>      by the recall of his rival, and the permission of investing with</a>
<a id='line_4038'>      his two governments his two sons, Abdallah and Abdelaziz. His</a>
<a id='line_4039'>      long triumph from Ceuta to Damascus displayed the spoils of</a>
<a id='line_4040'>      Africa and the treasures of Spain: four hundred Gothic nobles,</a>
<a id='line_4041'>      with gold coronets and girdles, were distinguished in his train;</a>
<a id='line_4042'>      and the number of male and female captives, selected for their</a>
<a id='line_4043'>      birth or beauty, was computed at eighteen, or even at thirty,</a>
<a id='line_4044'>      thousand persons. As soon as he reached Tiberias in Palestine, he</a>
<a id='line_4045'>      was apprised of the sickness and danger of the caliph, by a</a>
<a id='line_4046'>      private message from Soliman, his brother and presumptive heir;</a>
<a id='line_4047'>      who wished to reserve for his own reign the spectacle of victory.</a>
<a id='line_4048'></a>
<a id='line_4049'>      Had Walid recovered, the delay of Musa would have been criminal:</a>
<a id='line_4050'>      he pursued his march, and found an enemy on the throne. In his</a>
<a id='line_4051'>      trial before a partial judge against a popular antagonist, he was</a>
<a id='line_4052'>      convicted of vanity and falsehood; and a fine of two hundred</a>
<a id='line_4053'>      thousand pieces of gold either exhausted his poverty or proved</a>
<a id='line_4054'>      his rapaciousness. The unworthy treatment of Tarik was revenged</a>
<a id='line_4055'>      by a similar indignity; and the veteran commander, after a public</a>
<a id='line_4056'>      whipping, stood a whole day in the sun before the palace gate,</a>
<a id='line_4057'>      till he obtained a decent exile, under the pious name of a</a>
<a id='line_4058'>      pilgrimage to Mecca. The resentment of the caliph might have been</a>
<a id='line_4059'>      satiated with the ruin of Musa; but his fears demanded the</a>
<a id='line_4060'>      extirpation of a potent and injured family. A sentence of death</a>
<a id='line_4061'>      was intimated with secrecy and speed to the trusty servants of</a>
<a id='line_4062'>      the throne both in Africa and Spain; and the forms, if not the</a>
<a id='line_4063'>      substance, of justice were superseded in this bloody execution.</a>
<a id='line_4064'>      In the mosch or palace of Cordova, Abdelaziz was slain by the</a>
<a id='line_4065'>      swords of the conspirators; they accused their governor of</a>
<a id='line_4066'>      claiming the honors of royalty; and his scandalous marriage with</a>
<a id='line_4067'>      Egilona, the widow of Roderic, offended the prejudices both of</a>
<a id='line_4068'>      the Christians and Moslems. By a refinement of cruelty, the head</a>
<a id='line_4069'>      of the son was presented to the father, with an insulting</a>
<a id='line_4070'>      question, whether he acknowledged the features of the rebel? “I</a>
<a id='line_4071'>      know his features,” he exclaimed with indignation: “I assert his</a>
<a id='line_4072'>      innocence; and I imprecate the same, a juster fate, against the</a>
<a id='line_4073'>      authors of his death.” The age and despair of Musa raised him</a>
<a id='line_4074'>      above the power of kings; and he expired at Mecca of the anguish</a>
<a id='line_4075'>      of a broken heart. His rival was more favorably treated: his</a>
<a id='line_4076'>      services were forgiven; and Tarik was permitted to mingle with</a>
<a id='line_4077'>      the crowd of slaves. 189 I am ignorant whether Count Julian was</a>
<a id='line_4078'>      rewarded with the death which he deserved indeed, though not from</a>
<a id='line_4079'>      the hands of the Saracens; but the tale of their ingratitude to</a>
<a id='line_4080'>      the sons of Witiza is disproved by the most unquestionable</a>
<a id='line_4081'>      evidence. The two royal youths were reinstated in the private</a>
<a id='line_4082'>      patrimony of their father; but on the decease of Eba, the elder,</a>
<a id='line_4083'>      his daughter was unjustly despoiled of her portion by the</a>
<a id='line_4084'>      violence of her uncle Sigebut. The Gothic maid pleaded her cause</a>
<a id='line_4085'>      before the caliph Hashem, and obtained the restitution of her</a>
<a id='line_4086'>      inheritance; but she was given in marriage to a noble Arabian,</a>
<a id='line_4087'>      and their two sons, Isaac and Ibrahim, were received in Spain</a>
<a id='line_4088'>      with the consideration that was due to their origin and riches.</a>
