<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi,</a>
<a id='line_4'>the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the</a>
<a id='line_5'>days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>1:2 I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the</a>
<a id='line_8'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_9'></a>
<a id='line_10'>1:3 I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the</a>
<a id='line_11'>heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with the</a>
<a id='line_12'>wicked: and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_13'></a>
<a id='line_14'>1:4 I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the</a>
<a id='line_15'>inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from</a>
<a id='line_16'>this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests; 1:5 And</a>
<a id='line_17'>them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that</a>
<a id='line_18'>worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham; 1:6 And</a>
<a id='line_19'>them that are turned back from the LORD; and those that have not</a>
<a id='line_20'>sought the LORD, nor enquired for him.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>1:7 Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the</a>
<a id='line_23'>LORD is at hand: for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid</a>
<a id='line_24'>his guests.</a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'>1:8 And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD’s sacrifice, that</a>
<a id='line_27'>I will punish the princes, and the king’s children, and all such as</a>
<a id='line_28'>are clothed with strange apparel.</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>1:9 In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the</a>
<a id='line_31'>threshold, which fill their masters’ houses with violence and deceit.</a>
<a id='line_32'></a>
<a id='line_33'>1:10 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that there</a>
<a id='line_34'>shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from</a>
<a id='line_35'>the second, and a great crashing from the hills.</a>
<a id='line_36'></a>
<a id='line_37'>1:11 Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are</a>
<a id='line_38'>cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.</a>
<a id='line_39'></a>
<a id='line_40'>1:12 And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search</a>
<a id='line_41'>Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their</a>
<a id='line_42'>lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will</a>
<a id='line_43'>he do evil.</a>
<a id='line_44'></a>
<a id='line_45'>1:13 Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a</a>
<a id='line_46'>desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and</a>
<a id='line_47'>they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.</a>
<a id='line_48'></a>
<a id='line_49'>1:14 The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth</a>
<a id='line_50'>greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall</a>
<a id='line_51'>cry there bitterly.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>1:15 That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day</a>
<a id='line_54'>of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day</a>
<a id='line_55'>of clouds and thick darkness, 1:16 A day of the trumpet and alarm</a>
<a id='line_56'>against the fenced cities, and against the high towers.</a>
<a id='line_57'></a>
<a id='line_58'>1:17 And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like</a>
<a id='line_59'>blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood</a>
<a id='line_60'>shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>1:18 Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them</a>
<a id='line_63'>in the day of the LORD’s wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured</a>
<a id='line_64'>by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance</a>
<a id='line_65'>of all them that dwell in the land.</a>
<a id='line_66'></a>
<a id='line_67'>2:1 Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not</a>
<a id='line_68'>desired; 2:2 Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the</a>
<a id='line_69'>chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you, before the</a>
<a id='line_70'>day of the LORD’s anger come upon you.</a>
<a id='line_71'></a>
<a id='line_72'>2:3 Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his</a>
<a id='line_73'>judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid</a>
<a id='line_74'>in the day of the LORD’s anger.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>2:4 For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall</a>
<a id='line_77'>drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>2:5 Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the</a>
<a id='line_80'>Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, the land</a>
<a id='line_81'>of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no</a>
<a id='line_82'>inhabitant.</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>2:6 And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds,</a>
<a id='line_85'>and folds for flocks.</a>
<a id='line_86'></a>
<a id='line_87'>2:7 And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they</a>
<a id='line_88'>shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in</a>
<a id='line_89'>the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away</a>
<a id='line_90'>their captivity.</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>2:8 I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the</a>
<a id='line_93'>children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and</a>
<a id='line_94'>magnified themselves against their border.</a>
<a id='line_95'></a>
<a id='line_96'>2:9 Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_97'>Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah,</a>
<a id='line_98'>even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual</a>
<a id='line_99'>desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant</a>
<a id='line_100'>of my people shall possess them.</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>2:10 This shall they have for their pride, because they have</a>
<a id='line_103'>reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the LORD of</a>
<a id='line_104'>hosts.</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>2:11 The LORD will be terrible unto them: for he will famish all the</a>
<a id='line_107'>gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his</a>
<a id='line_108'>place, even all the isles of the heathen.</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>
<a id='line_110'>2:12 Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'>2:13 And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy</a>
<a id='line_113'>Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like a</a>
<a id='line_114'>wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_115'></a>
<a id='line_116'>2:14 And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of</a>
<a id='line_117'>the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the</a>
<a id='line_118'>upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation</a>
<a id='line_119'>shall be in the thresholds; for he shall uncover the cedar work.</a>
<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>2:15 This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in</a>
<a id='line_122'>her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a</a>
<a id='line_123'>desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth</a>
<a id='line_124'>by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.</a>
<a id='line_125'></a>
<a id='line_126'>3:1 Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!</a>
<a id='line_127'>3:2 She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted</a>
<a id='line_128'>not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.</a>
<a id='line_129'></a>
<a id='line_130'>3:3 Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening</a>
<a id='line_131'>wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.</a>
<a id='line_132'></a>
<a id='line_133'>3:4 Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have</a>
<a id='line_134'>polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>3:5 The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity:</a>
<a id='line_137'>every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but</a>
<a id='line_138'>the unjust knoweth no shame.</a>
<a id='line_139'></a>
<a id='line_140'>3:6 I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made</a>
<a id='line_141'>their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed,</a>
<a id='line_142'>so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.</a>
<a id='line_143'></a>
<a id='line_144'>3:7 I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction;</a>
<a id='line_145'>so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them:</a>
<a id='line_146'>but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>3:8 Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I</a>
<a id='line_149'>rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations,</a>
<a id='line_150'>that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation,</a>
<a id='line_151'>even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the</a>
<a id='line_152'>fire of my jealousy.</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>3:9 For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may</a>
<a id='line_155'>all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>3:10 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the</a>
<a id='line_158'>daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.</a>
<a id='line_159'></a>
<a id='line_160'>3:11 In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein</a>
<a id='line_161'>thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of</a>
<a id='line_162'>the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no</a>
<a id='line_163'>more be haughty because of my holy mountain.</a>
<a id='line_164'></a>
<a id='line_165'>3:12 I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor</a>
<a id='line_166'>people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_167'></a>
<a id='line_168'>3:13 The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies;</a>
<a id='line_169'>neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they</a>
<a id='line_170'>shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>3:14 Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice</a>
<a id='line_173'>with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>3:15 The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine</a>
<a id='line_176'>enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee:</a>
<a id='line_177'>thou shalt not see evil any more.</a>
<a id='line_178'></a>
<a id='line_179'>3:16 In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to</a>
<a id='line_180'>Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.</a>
<a id='line_181'></a>
<a id='line_182'>3:17 The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he</a>
<a id='line_183'>will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy</a>
<a id='line_184'>over thee with singing.</a>
<a id='line_185'></a>
<a id='line_186'>3:18 I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly,</a>
<a id='line_187'>who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>3:19 Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I</a>
<a id='line_190'>will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I</a>
<a id='line_191'>will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put</a>
<a id='line_192'>to shame.</a>
<a id='line_193'></a>
<a id='line_194'>3:20 At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I</a>
<a id='line_195'>gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people</a>
<a id='line_196'>of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes,</a>
<a id='line_197'>saith the LORD.</a>
