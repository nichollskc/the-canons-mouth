<a id='line_1'>      Monarchy.—Part I.</a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>     Of The State Of Persia After The Restoration Of The Monarchy By</a>
<a id='line_4'>     Artaxerxes.</a>
<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'>      Whenever Tacitus indulges himself in those beautiful episodes, in</a>
<a id='line_7'>      which he relates some domestic transaction of the Germans or of</a>
<a id='line_8'>      the Parthians, his principal object is to relieve the attention</a>
<a id='line_9'>      of the reader from a uniform scene of vice and misery. From the</a>
<a id='line_10'>      reign of Augustus to the time of Alexander Severus, the enemies</a>
<a id='line_11'>      of Rome were in her bosom—the tyrants and the soldiers; and her</a>
<a id='line_12'>      prosperity had a very distant and feeble interest in the</a>
<a id='line_13'>      revolutions that might happen beyond the Rhine and the Euphrates.</a>
<a id='line_14'>      But when the military order had levelled, in wild anarchy, the</a>
<a id='line_15'>      power of the prince, the laws of the senate, and even the</a>
<a id='line_16'>      discipline of the camp, the barbarians of the North and of the</a>
<a id='line_17'>      East, who had long hovered on the frontier, boldly attacked the</a>
<a id='line_18'>      provinces of a declining monarchy. Their vexatious inroads were</a>
<a id='line_19'>      changed into formidable irruptions, and, after a long vicissitude</a>
<a id='line_20'>      of mutual calamities, many tribes of the victorious invaders</a>
<a id='line_21'>      established themselves in the provinces of the Roman Empire. To</a>
<a id='line_22'>      obtain a clearer knowledge of these great events, we shall</a>
<a id='line_23'>      endeavor to form a previous idea of the character, forces, and</a>
<a id='line_24'>      designs of those nations who avenged the cause of Hannibal and</a>
<a id='line_25'>      Mithridates.</a>
<a id='line_26'></a>
<a id='line_27'>      In the more early ages of the world, whilst the forest that</a>
<a id='line_28'>      covered Europe afforded a retreat to a few wandering savages, the</a>
<a id='line_29'>      inhabitants of Asia were already collected into populous cities,</a>
<a id='line_30'>      and reduced under extensive empires the seat of the arts, of</a>
<a id='line_31'>      luxury, and of despotism. The Assyrians reigned over the East, 1</a>
<a id='line_32'>      till the sceptre of Ninus and Semiramis dropped from the hands of</a>
<a id='line_33'>      their enervated successors. The Medes and the Babylonians divided</a>
<a id='line_34'>      their power, and were themselves swallowed up in the monarchy of</a>
<a id='line_35'>      the Persians, whose arms could not be confined within the narrow</a>
<a id='line_36'>      limits of Asia. Followed, as it is said, by two millions of</a>
<a id='line_37'>      _men_, Xerxes, the descendant of Cyrus, invaded Greece.</a>
<a id='line_38'></a>
<a id='line_39'>      Thirty thousand _soldiers_, under the command of Alexander, the</a>
<a id='line_40'>      son of Philip, who was intrusted by the Greeks with their glory</a>
<a id='line_41'>      and revenge, were sufficient to subdue Persia. The princes of the</a>
<a id='line_42'>      house of Seleucus usurped and lost the Macedonian command over</a>
<a id='line_43'>      the East. About the same time, that, by an ignominious treaty,</a>
<a id='line_44'>      they resigned to the Romans the country on this side Mount Tarus,</a>
<a id='line_45'>      they were driven by the Parthians, 1001 an obscure horde of</a>
<a id='line_46'>      Scythian origin, from all the provinces of Upper Asia. The</a>
<a id='line_47'>      formidable power of the Parthians, which spread from India to the</a>
<a id='line_48'>      frontiers of Syria, was in its turn subverted by Ardshir, or</a>
<a id='line_49'>      Artaxerxes; the founder of a new dynasty, which, under the name</a>
<a id='line_50'>      of Sassanides, governed Persia till the invasion of the Arabs.</a>
<a id='line_51'>      This great revolution, whose fatal influence was soon experienced</a>
<a id='line_52'>      by the Romans, happened in the fourth year of Alexander Severus,</a>
<a id='line_53'>      two hundred and twenty-six years after the Christian era. 2 201</a>

<a id='line_102'>      Artaxerxes had served with great reputation in the armies of</a>
<a id='line_103'>      Artaban, the last king of the Parthians, and it appears that he</a>
<a id='line_104'>      was driven into exile and rebellion by royal ingratitude, the</a>
<a id='line_105'>      customary reward for superior merit. His birth was obscure, and</a>
<a id='line_106'>      the obscurity equally gave room to the aspersions of his enemies,</a>
<a id='line_107'>      and the flattery of his adherents. If we credit the scandal of</a>
<a id='line_108'>      the former, Artaxerxes sprang from the illegitimate commerce of a</a>
<a id='line_109'>      tanner’s wife with a common soldier. 3 The latter represent him</a>
<a id='line_110'>      as descended from a branch of the ancient kings of Persian,</a>
<a id='line_111'>      though time and misfortune had gradually reduced his ancestors to</a>
<a id='line_112'>      the humble station of private citizens. 4 As the lineal heir of</a>
<a id='line_113'>      the monarchy, he asserted his right to the throne, and challenged</a>
<a id='line_114'>      the noble task of delivering the Persians from the oppression</a>
<a id='line_115'>      under which they groaned above five centuries since the death of</a>
<a id='line_116'>      Darius. The Parthians were defeated in three great battles. 401</a>
<a id='line_117'>      In the last of these their king Artaban was slain, and the spirit</a>
<a id='line_118'>      of the nation was forever broken. 5 The authority of Artaxerxes</a>
<a id='line_119'>      was solemnly acknowledged in a great assembly held at Balch in</a>
<a id='line_120'>      Khorasan. 501 Two younger branches of the royal house of Arsaces</a>
<a id='line_121'>      were confounded among the prostrate satraps. A third, more</a>
<a id='line_122'>      mindful of ancient grandeur than of present necessity, attempted</a>
<a id='line_123'>      to retire, with a numerous train of vessels, towards their</a>

<a id='line_126'>      6 who boldly assumed the double diadem, and the title of King of</a>

<a id='line_128'>      pompous titles, instead of gratifying the vanity of the Persian,</a>
<a id='line_129'>      served only to admonish him of his duty, and to inflame in his</a>

<a id='line_152'>      I. During the long servitude of Persia under the Macedonian and</a>
<a id='line_153'>      the Parthian yoke, the nations of Europe and Asia had mutually</a>
<a id='line_154'>      adopted and corrupted each other’s superstitions. The Arsacides,</a>
<a id='line_155'>      indeed, practised the worship of the Magi; but they disgraced and</a>
<a id='line_156'>      polluted it with a various mixture of foreign idolatry. 601 The</a>
<a id='line_157'>      memory of Zoroaster, the ancient prophet and philosopher of the</a>
<a id='line_158'>      Persians, 7 was still revered in the East; but the obsolete and</a>
<a id='line_159'>      mysterious language, in which the Zendavesta was composed, 8</a>
<a id='line_160'>      opened a field of dispute to seventy sects, who variously</a>
<a id='line_161'>      explained the fundamental doctrines of their religion, and were</a>
<a id='line_162'>      all indifferently devided by a crowd of infidels, who rejected</a>
<a id='line_163'>      the divine mission and miracles of the prophet. To suppress the</a>
<a id='line_164'>      idolaters, reunite the schismatics, and confute the unbelievers,</a>
<a id='line_165'>      by the infallible decision of a general council, the pious</a>
<a id='line_166'>      Artaxerxes summoned the Magi from all parts of his dominions.</a>
<a id='line_167'>      These priests, who had so long sighed in contempt and obscurity</a>
<a id='line_168'>      obeyed the welcome summons; and, on the appointed day, appeared,</a>
<a id='line_169'>      to the number of about eighty thousand. But as the debates of so</a>
<a id='line_170'>      tumultuous an assembly could not have been directed by the</a>
<a id='line_171'>      authority of reason, or influenced by the art of policy, the</a>
<a id='line_172'>      Persian synod was reduced, by successive operations, to forty</a>
<a id='line_173'>      thousand, to four thousand, to four hundred, to forty, and at</a>
<a id='line_174'>      last to seven Magi, the most respected for their learning and</a>
<a id='line_175'>      piety. One of these, Erdaviraph, a young but holy prelate,</a>
<a id='line_176'>      received from the hands of his brethren three cups of</a>
<a id='line_177'>      soporiferous wine. He drank them off, and instantly fell into a</a>
<a id='line_178'>      long and profound sleep. As soon as he waked, he related to the</a>
<a id='line_179'>      king and to the believing multitude, his journey to heaven, and</a>
<a id='line_180'>      his intimate conferences with the Deity. Every doubt was silenced</a>
<a id='line_181'>      by this supernatural evidence; and the articles of the faith of</a>

<a id='line_245'>      added to those of Anquetil and the Abbé Foucher, has proved that</a>
<a id='line_246'>      the Zend was a living and spoken language.—G. Sir W. Jones</a>

<a id='line_252'>      Sanskrit. The antiquity of the Zendavesta has likewise been</a>
<a id='line_253'>      asserted by Rask, the great Danish linguist, who, according to</a>
<a id='line_254'>      Malcolm, brought back from the East fresh transcripts and</a>
<a id='line_255'>      additions to those published by Anquetil. According to Rask, the</a>
<a id='line_256'>      Zend and Sanskrit are sister dialects; the one the parent of the</a>
<a id='line_257'>      Persian, the other of the Indian family of languages.—G. and</a>

<a id='line_261'>      According to Bopp, the Zend is, in some respects, of a more</a>
<a id='line_262'>      remarkable structure than the Sanskrit. Parts of the Zendavesta</a>

<a id='line_265'>      of the countries bordering on Assyria, and probably of Assyria</a>
<a id='line_266'>      itself. Pehlvi signifies valor, heroism; the Pehlvi, therefore,</a>
<a id='line_267'>      was the language of the ancient heroes and kings of Persia, the</a>
<a id='line_268'>      valiant. (Mr. Erskine prefers the derivation from Pehla, a</a>
<a id='line_269'>      border.—M.) It contains a number of Aramaic roots. Anquetil</a>
<a id='line_270'>      considered it formed from the Zend. Kleuker does not adopt this</a>
<a id='line_271'>      opinion. The Pehlvi, he says, is much more flowing, and less</a>
<a id='line_272'>      overcharged with vowels, than the Zend. The books of Zoroaster,</a>
<a id='line_273'>      first written in Zend, were afterwards translated into Pehlvi and</a>
<a id='line_274'>      Parsi. The Pehlvi had fallen into disuse under the dynasty of the</a>
<a id='line_275'>      Sassanides, but the learned still wrote it. The Parsi, the</a>

<a id='line_763'>      neighboring states, who, during the long slumber of his</a>
<a id='line_764'>      predecessors, had insulted Persia with impunity. He obtained some</a>
<a id='line_765'>      easy victories over the wild Scythians and the effeminate</a>

<a id='line_768'>      arms. A forty years’ tranquillity, the fruit of valor and</a>

<a id='line_770'>      period that elapsed from the accession of Marcus to the reign of</a>
<a id='line_771'>      Alexander, the Roman and the Parthian empires were twice engaged</a>

<a id='line_773'>      contended with a part only of the forces of Rome, the event was</a>
<a id='line_774'>      most commonly in favor of the latter. Macrinus, indeed, prompted</a>

<a id='line_790'>      Grecian colony, arts, military virtue, and the love of freedom.</a>
<a id='line_791'>      The independent republic was governed by a senate of three</a>
<a id='line_792'>      hundred nobles; the people consisted of six hundred thousand</a>

<a id='line_794'>      among the several orders of the state, they viewed with contempt</a>

<a id='line_796'>      sometimes provoked to implore the dangerous aid of the common</a>

<a id='line_798'>      Parthian monarchs, like the Mogul sovereigns of Hindostan,</a>
<a id='line_799'>      delighted in the pastoral life of their Scythian ancestors; and</a>
<a id='line_800'>      the Imperial camp was frequently pitched in the plain of</a>
<a id='line_801'>      Ctesiphon, on the eastern bank of the Tigris, at the distance of</a>
<a id='line_802'>      only three miles from Seleucia. 40 The innumerable attendants on</a>
<a id='line_803'>      luxury and despotism resorted to the court, and the little</a>
<a id='line_804'>      village of Ctesiphon insensibly swelled into a great city. 41</a>
<a id='line_805'>      Under the reign of Marcus, the Roman generals penetrated as far</a>

<a id='line_807'>      Greek colony; they attacked as enemies the seat of the Parthian</a>
<a id='line_808'>      kings; yet both cities experienced the same treatment. The sack</a>
<a id='line_809'>      and conflagration of Seleucia, with the massacre of three hundred</a>
<a id='line_810'>      thousand of the inhabitants, tarnished the glory of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_811'>      triumph. 42 Seleucia, already exhausted by the neighborhood of a</a>
<a id='line_812'>      too powerful rival, sunk under the fatal blow; but Ctesiphon, in</a>
<a id='line_813'>      about thirty-three years, had sufficiently recovered its strength</a>

<a id='line_818'>      Notwithstanding these misfortunes, Ctesiphon succeeded to Babylon</a>

<a id='line_1006'>      mother’s counsels, and perhaps by his own fears, deserted the</a>

<a id='line_1009'>      led back to Antioch an army diminished by sickness, and provoked</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      by disappointment. The behavior of Artaxerxes had been very</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      different. Flying with rapidity from the hills of Media to the</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      marshes of the Euphrates, he had everywhere opposed the invaders</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      in person; and in either fortune had united with the ablest</a>
<a id='line_1014'>      conduct the most undaunted resolution. But in several obstinate</a>
<a id='line_1015'>      engagements against the veteran legions of Rome, the Persian</a>
<a id='line_1016'>      monarch had lost the flower of his troops. Even his victories had</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      weakened his power. The favorable opportunities of the absence of</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      Alexander, and of the confusions that followed that emperor’s</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      death, presented themselves in vain to his ambition. Instead of</a>
<a id='line_1020'>      expelling the Romans, as he pretended, from the continent of</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      Asia, he found himself unable to wrest from their hands the</a>

<a id='line_1046'>      into the constitution of government. “The authority of the</a>

<a id='line_1050'>      except under the protection of justice and moderation.” 55</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      Artaxerxes bequeathed his new empire, and his ambitious designs</a>

<a id='line_1073'>      the East. Those disciplined evolutions which harmonize and</a>

<a id='line_1075'>      were equally unskilled in the arts of constructing, besieging, or</a>
<a id='line_1076'>      defending regular fortifications. They trusted more to their</a>
