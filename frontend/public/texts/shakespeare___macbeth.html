<a id='line_139'>MALCOLM.</a>

<a id='line_146'>SOLDIER.</a>
<a id='line_147'>Doubtful it stood;</a>
<a id='line_148'>As two spent swimmers that do cling together</a>
<a id='line_149'>And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald</a>
<a id='line_150'>(Worthy to be a rebel, for to that</a>
<a id='line_151'>The multiplying villainies of nature</a>
<a id='line_152'>Do swarm upon him) from the Western Isles</a>
<a id='line_153'>Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;</a>
<a id='line_154'>And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,</a>
<a id='line_155'>Show’d like a rebel’s whore. But all’s too weak;</a>
<a id='line_156'>For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),</a>
<a id='line_157'>Disdaining Fortune, with his brandish’d steel,</a>
<a id='line_158'>Which smok’d with bloody execution,</a>
<a id='line_159'>Like Valour’s minion, carv’d out his passage,</a>
<a id='line_160'>Till he fac’d the slave;</a>
<a id='line_161'>Which ne’er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,</a>
<a id='line_162'>Till he unseam’d him from the nave to the chops,</a>

<a id='line_169'>As whence the sun ’gins his reflection</a>
<a id='line_170'>Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break,</a>
<a id='line_171'>So from that spring, whence comfort seem’d to come</a>
<a id='line_172'>Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark:</a>
<a id='line_173'>No sooner justice had, with valour arm’d,</a>
<a id='line_174'>Compell’d these skipping kerns to trust their heels,</a>
<a id='line_175'>But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,</a>
<a id='line_176'>With furbish’d arms and new supplies of men,</a>
<a id='line_177'>Began a fresh assault.</a>

<a id='line_182'></a>
<a id='line_183'>SOLDIER.</a>
<a id='line_184'>Yes;</a>
<a id='line_185'>As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.</a>
<a id='line_186'>If I say sooth, I must report they were</a>
<a id='line_187'>As cannons overcharg’d with double cracks;</a>
<a id='line_188'>So they</a>
<a id='line_189'>Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:</a>
<a id='line_190'>Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,</a>
<a id='line_191'>Or memorize another Golgotha,</a>
<a id='line_192'>I cannot tell—</a>

<a id='line_195'>DUNCAN.</a>
<a id='line_196'>So well thy words become thee as thy wounds:</a>
<a id='line_197'>They smack of honour both.—Go, get him surgeons.</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'> [_Exit Captain, attended._]</a>

<a id='line_212'>ROSS.</a>
<a id='line_213'>God save the King!</a>
<a id='line_214'></a>

<a id='line_217'></a>
<a id='line_218'>ROSS.</a>
<a id='line_219'>From Fife, great King,</a>
<a id='line_220'>Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky</a>
<a id='line_221'>And fan our people cold.</a>
<a id='line_222'>Norway himself, with terrible numbers,</a>
<a id='line_223'>Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,</a>
<a id='line_224'>The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;</a>
<a id='line_225'>Till that Bellona’s bridegroom, lapp’d in proof,</a>
<a id='line_226'>Confronted him with self-comparisons,</a>
<a id='line_227'>Point against point, rebellious arm ’gainst arm,</a>
<a id='line_228'>Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,</a>
<a id='line_229'>The victory fell on us.</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>DUNCAN.</a>
<a id='line_232'>Great happiness!</a>
<a id='line_233'></a>
<a id='line_234'>ROSS.</a>
<a id='line_235'>That now</a>
<a id='line_236'>Sweno, the Norways’ king, craves composition;</a>
<a id='line_237'>Nor would we deign him burial of his men</a>
<a id='line_238'>Till he disbursed at Saint Colme’s Inch</a>
<a id='line_239'>Ten thousand dollars to our general use.</a>
<a id='line_240'></a>
<a id='line_241'>DUNCAN.</a>
<a id='line_242'>No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive</a>
<a id='line_243'>Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,</a>
<a id='line_244'>And with his former title greet Macbeth.</a>
<a id='line_245'></a>
<a id='line_246'>ROSS.</a>
<a id='line_247'>I’ll see it done.</a>

<a id='line_785'>All our service,</a>
<a id='line_786'>In every point twice done, and then done double,</a>
<a id='line_787'>Were poor and single business to contend</a>

<a id='line_795'>We cours’d him at the heels, and had a purpose</a>
<a id='line_796'>To be his purveyor: but he rides well;</a>
<a id='line_797'>And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him</a>
<a id='line_798'>To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,</a>

<a id='line_835'>Who should against his murderer shut the door,</a>
<a id='line_836'>Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan</a>

<a id='line_847'>Vaulting ambition, which o’erleaps itself</a>

<a id='line_871'>Was the hope drunk</a>

<a id='line_873'>And wakes it now, to look so green and pale</a>

<a id='line_890'>That made you break this enterprise to me?</a>
<a id='line_891'>When you durst do it, then you were a man;</a>
<a id='line_892'>And, to be more than what you were, you would</a>
<a id='line_893'>Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place</a>
<a id='line_894'>Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:</a>
<a id='line_895'>They have made themselves, and that their fitness now</a>
<a id='line_896'>Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know</a>
<a id='line_897'>How tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me:</a>
<a id='line_898'>I would, while it was smiling in my face,</a>
<a id='line_899'>Have pluck’d my nipple from his boneless gums</a>
<a id='line_900'>And dash’d the brains out, had I so sworn as you</a>

<a id='line_916'>Their drenched natures lie as in a death,</a>
<a id='line_917'>What cannot you and I perform upon</a>
<a id='line_918'>Th’ unguarded Duncan? what not put upon</a>
<a id='line_919'>His spongy officers; who shall bear the guilt</a>

<a id='line_3052'>I speak not as in absolute fear of you.</a>
<a id='line_3053'>I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;</a>
<a id='line_3054'>It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash</a>
<a id='line_3055'>Is added to her wounds. I think, withal,</a>
<a id='line_3056'>There would be hands uplifted in my right;</a>
<a id='line_3057'>And here, from gracious England, have I offer</a>

<a id='line_3068'>MALCOLM.</a>
<a id='line_3069'>It is myself I mean; in whom I know</a>
<a id='line_3070'>All the particulars of vice so grafted</a>
<a id='line_3071'>That, when they shall be open’d, black Macbeth</a>
<a id='line_3072'>Will seem as pure as snow; and the poor state</a>

<a id='line_3088'>The cistern of my lust; and my desire</a>
<a id='line_3089'>All continent impediments would o’erbear,</a>

<a id='line_3130'>Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,</a>
<a id='line_3131'>I have no relish of them; but abound</a>
<a id='line_3132'>In the division of each several crime,</a>

<a id='line_3175'>At no time broke my faith; would not betray</a>
<a id='line_3176'>The devil to his fellow; and delight</a>
<a id='line_3177'>No less in truth than life: my first false speaking</a>
<a id='line_3178'>Was this upon myself. What I am truly,</a>
