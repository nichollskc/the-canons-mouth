<a id='line_95'>[Footnote A: Compare two references to Mary Wordsworth in 'The Prelude':</a>
<a id='line_96'></a>
<a id='line_97'>    'Another maid there was, who also shed</a>
<a id='line_98'>  A gladness o'er that season, then to me,</a>
<a id='line_99'>  By her exulting outside look of youth</a>
<a id='line_100'>  And placid under-countenance, first endeared;'</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>(Book vi. l. 224).</a>
<a id='line_103'></a>
<a id='line_104'>  'She came, no more a phantom to adorn</a>
<a id='line_105'>  A moment, but an inmate of the heart,</a>
<a id='line_106'>  And yet a spirit, there for me enshrined</a>
<a id='line_107'>  To penetrate the lofty and the low;'</a>
<a id='line_108'></a>
<a id='line_109'>(Book xiv, l. 268).--Ed.]</a>
<a id='line_110'></a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'></a>
<a id='line_113'>It is not easy to say what were the "four lines composed as a part of</a>
<a id='line_114'>the verses on the 'Highland Girl'" which the Fenwick note tells us was</a>
<a id='line_115'>"the germ of this poem." They may be lines now incorporated in those 'To</a>
<a id='line_116'>a Highland Girl', vol. ii. p. 389, or they may be lines in the present</a>
<a id='line_117'>poem, which Wordsworth wrote at first for the 'Highland Girl', but</a>
<a id='line_118'>afterwards transferred to this one. They _may_ have been the first four</a>
<a id='line_119'>lines of the later poem. The two should be read consecutively, and</a>
<a id='line_120'>compared.</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>After Wordsworth's death, a writer in the 'Daily News', January</a>
<a id='line_123'>1859--then understood to be Miss Harriet Martineau--wrote thus:</a>
<a id='line_124'></a>
<a id='line_125'>  "In the 'Memoirs', by the nephew of the poet, it is said that these</a>
<a id='line_126'>  verses refer to Mrs. Wordsworth; but for half of Wordsworth's life it</a>
<a id='line_127'>  was always understood that they referred to some other phantom which</a>
<a id='line_128'>  'gleamed upon his sight' before Mary Hutchinson."</a>
<a id='line_129'></a>
<a id='line_130'>This statement is much more than improbable; it is, I think, disproved</a>
<a id='line_131'>by the Fenwick note. They cannot refer to the "Lucy" of the Goslar</a>
<a id='line_132'>poems; and Wordsworth indicates, as plainly as he chose, to whom they</a>
<a id='line_133'>actually do refer. Compare the Hon. Justice Coleridge's account of a</a>
<a id='line_134'>conversation with Wordsworth ('Memoirs', vol. ii. p. 306), in which the</a>
<a id='line_135'>poet expressly said that the lines were written on his wife. The</a>
<a id='line_136'>question was, however, set at rest in a conversation of Wordsworth with</a>
<a id='line_137'>Henry Crabb Robinson, who wrote in his 'Diary' on</a>
<a id='line_138'></a>
<a id='line_139'>  "May 12 (1842).--Wordsworth said that the poems 'Our walk was far</a>
<a id='line_140'>  among the ancient trees' [vol. ii. p. 167], then 'She was a Phantom of</a>
<a id='line_141'>  delight,' [B] and finally the two sonnets 'To a Painter', should be</a>
<a id='line_142'>  read in succession as exhibiting the different phases of his affection</a>
<a id='line_143'>  to his wife."</a>
<a id='line_144'></a>

<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>The use of the word "machine," in the third stanza of the poem, has been</a>
<a id='line_149'>much criticised, but for a similar use of the term, see the sequel to</a>
<a id='line_150'>'The Waggoner' (p. 107):</a>
<a id='line_151'></a>
<a id='line_152'>  'Forgive me, then; for I had been</a>

<a id='line_267'>The following is from Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal, under date,</a>
<a id='line_268'>Thursday, April 15, 1802:</a>
<a id='line_269'></a>
<a id='line_270'>  "When we were in the woods beyond Gowbarrow Park, we saw a few</a>
<a id='line_271'>  daffodils close to the water side. We fancied that the sea had floated</a>
<a id='line_272'>  the seeds ashore, and that the little colony had so sprung up. But as</a>
<a id='line_273'>  we went along there were more, and yet more; and, at last, under the</a>
<a id='line_274'>  boughs of the trees, we saw that there was a long belt of them along</a>
<a id='line_275'>  the shore, about the breadth of a country turnpike road. I never saw</a>
<a id='line_276'>  daffodils so beautiful. They grew among the mossy stones, about and</a>
<a id='line_277'>  above them; some rested their heads upon these stones, as on a pillow</a>
<a id='line_278'>  for weariness; and the rest tossed and reeled and danced, and seemed</a>
<a id='line_279'>  as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the</a>
<a id='line_280'>  lake. They looked so gay, ever glancing, ever changing. This wind blew</a>
<a id='line_281'>  directly over the lake to them. There was here and there a little</a>
<a id='line_282'>  knot, and a few stragglers higher up; but they were so few as not to</a>
<a id='line_283'>  disturb the simplicity, unity, and life of that one busy highway. We</a>
<a id='line_284'>  rested again and again. The bays were stormy, and we heard the waves</a>
<a id='line_285'>  at different distances, and in the middle of the water, like the</a>
<a id='line_286'>  sea...."</a>
<a id='line_287'></a>
<a id='line_288'>In the edition of 1815 there is a footnote to the lines</a>
<a id='line_289'></a>
<a id='line_290'>  'They flash upon that inward eye</a>
<a id='line_291'>  Which is the bliss of solitude'</a>
<a id='line_292'></a>
<a id='line_293'>to the following effect:</a>
<a id='line_294'></a>
<a id='line_295'>  "The subject of these Stanzas is rather an elementary feeling and</a>
<a id='line_296'>  simple impression (approaching to the nature of an ocular spectrum)</a>
<a id='line_297'>  upon the imaginative faculty, than an exertion of it. The one which</a>
<a id='line_298'>  follows [A] is strictly a Reverie; and neither that, nor the next</a>
<a id='line_299'>  after it in succession, 'Power of Music', would have been placed here</a>
<a id='line_300'>  except for the reason given in the foregoing note."</a>
<a id='line_301'></a>
<a id='line_302'>The being "placed here" refers to its being included among the "Poems of</a>
<a id='line_303'>the Imagination." The "foregoing note" is the note appended to 'The Horn</a>
<a id='line_304'>of Egremont Castle'; and the "reason given" in it is "to avoid a</a>
<a id='line_305'>needless multiplication of the Classes" into which Wordsworth divided</a>
<a id='line_306'>his poems. This note of 181? [B], is reprinted mainly to show the</a>
<a id='line_307'>difficulties to which Wordsworth was reduced by the artificial method of</a>
<a id='line_308'>arrangement referred to. The following letter to Mr. Wrangham is a more</a>
<a id='line_309'>appropriate illustration of the poem of "The Daffodils." It was written,</a>
<a id='line_310'>the late Bishop of Lincoln says, "sometime afterwards." (See 'Memoirs of</a>
<a id='line_311'>Wordsworth', vol. i. pp. 183, 184); and, for the whole of the letter,</a>
<a id='line_312'>see a subsequent volume of this edition.</a>
<a id='line_313'></a>
<a id='line_314'>  "GRASMERE, Nov. 4.</a>
<a id='line_315'></a>
<a id='line_316'>  "MY DEAR WRANGHAM,--I am indeed much pleased that Mrs. Wrangham and</a>
<a id='line_317'>  yourself have been gratified by these breathings of simple nature. You</a>
<a id='line_318'>  mention Butler, Montagu's friend; not Tom Butler, but the conveyancer:</a>
<a id='line_319'>  when I was in town in spring, he happened to see the volumes lying on</a>
<a id='line_320'>  Montagu's mantelpiece, and to glance his eye upon the very poem of</a>
<a id='line_321'>  'The Daffodils.' 'Aye,' says he, 'a fine morsel this for the</a>
<a id='line_322'>  Reviewers.' When this was told me (for I was not present) I observed</a>
<a id='line_323'>  that there were 'two lines' in that little poem which, if thoroughly</a>
<a id='line_324'>  felt, would annihilate nine-tenths of the reviews of the kingdom, as</a>
<a id='line_325'>  they would find no readers. The lines I alluded to were these:</a>
<a id='line_326'></a>
<a id='line_327'>    'They flash upon that inward eye</a>
<a id='line_328'>    Which is the bliss of solitude.'"</a>
<a id='line_329'></a>
<a id='line_330'>These two lines were composed by Mrs. Wordsworth. In 1877 the daffodils</a>
<a id='line_331'>were still growing in abundance on the shore of Ullswater, below</a>
<a id='line_332'>Gowbarrow Park.</a>

<a id='line_529'>charge which the piece beginning, "Lyre! though such power do in thy</a>

<a id='line_534'>tone and unmitigated fury of such streams among the Alps as are fed all</a>

<a id='line_1349'>  O happy time of youthful lovers (thus</a>
<a id='line_1350'>  My story may begin) O balmy time,</a>
<a id='line_1351'>  In which a love-knot on a lady's brow</a>
<a id='line_1352'>  Is fairer than the fairest star in heaven!</a>
<a id='line_1353'>  To such inheritance of blessed fancy                              5</a>

<a id='line_1356'>  The high-born Vaudracour was brought, by years</a>
<a id='line_1357'>  Whose progress had a little overstepped</a>
<a id='line_1358'>  His stripling prime. A town of small repute,                     10</a>
<a id='line_1359'>  Among the vine-clad mountains of Auvergne,</a>
<a id='line_1360'>  Was the Youth's birth-place. There he wooed a Maid</a>
<a id='line_1361'>  Who heard the heart-felt music of his suit</a>
<a id='line_1362'>  With answering vows. Plebeian was the stock,</a>
<a id='line_1363'>  Plebeian, though ingenuous, the stock,                           15</a>
<a id='line_1364'>  From which her graces and her honours sprung:</a>
<a id='line_1365'>  And hence the father of the enamoured Youth,</a>
<a id='line_1366'>  With haughty indignation, spurned the thought</a>
<a id='line_1367'>  Of such alliance.--From their cradles up,</a>
<a id='line_1368'>  With but a step between their several homes,                     20</a>
<a id='line_1369'>  Twins had they been in pleasure; after strife</a>
<a id='line_1370'>  And petty quarrels, had grown fond again;</a>
<a id='line_1371'>  Each other's advocate, each other's stay;</a>
<a id='line_1372'>  And, in their happiest moments, not content,</a>
<a id='line_1373'>  If more divided than a sportive pair [1]                         25</a>
<a id='line_1374'>  Of sea-fowl, conscious both that they are hovering</a>
<a id='line_1375'>  Within the eddy of a common blast,</a>
<a id='line_1376'>  Or hidden only by the concave depth</a>
<a id='line_1377'>  Of neighbouring billows from each other's sight.</a>
<a id='line_1378'></a>
<a id='line_1379'>    Thus, not without concurrence of an age                        30</a>
<a id='line_1380'>  Unknown to memory, was an earnest given</a>
<a id='line_1381'>  By ready nature for a life of love,</a>
<a id='line_1382'>  For endless constancy, and placid truth;</a>
<a id='line_1383'>  But whatsoe'er of such rare treasure lay</a>
<a id='line_1384'>  Reserved, had fate permitted, for support                        35</a>
<a id='line_1385'>  Of their maturer years, his present mind</a>
<a id='line_1386'>  Was under fascination;--he beheld</a>
<a id='line_1387'>  A vision, and adored the thing he saw.</a>
<a id='line_1388'>  Arabian fiction never filled the world</a>
<a id='line_1389'>  With half the wonders that were wrought for him.                 40</a>
<a id='line_1390'>  Earth breathed in one great presence of the spring;</a>
<a id='line_1391'>  Life turned the meanest of her implements,</a>
<a id='line_1392'>  Before his eyes, to price above all gold;</a>
<a id='line_1393'>  The house she dwelt in was a sainted shrine;</a>
<a id='line_1394'>  Her chamber-window did surpass in glory                          45</a>
<a id='line_1395'>  The portals of the dawn; all paradise</a>
<a id='line_1396'>  Could, by the simple opening of a door,</a>
<a id='line_1397'>  Let itself in upon him:--pathways, walks,</a>
<a id='line_1398'>  Swarmed with enchantment, till his spirit sank,</a>
<a id='line_1399'>  Surcharged, within him, overblest to move                        50</a>
<a id='line_1400'>  Beneath a sun that wakes a weary world</a>
<a id='line_1401'>  To its dull round of ordinary cares;</a>
<a id='line_1402'>  A man too happy for mortality!</a>
<a id='line_1403'></a>
<a id='line_1404'>    So passed the time, till whether through effect</a>
<a id='line_1405'>  Of some unguarded moment that dissolved                          55</a>
<a id='line_1406'>  Virtuous restraint--ah, speak it, think it, not!</a>
<a id='line_1407'>  Deem rather that the fervent Youth, who saw</a>
<a id='line_1408'>  So many bars between his present state</a>
<a id='line_1409'>  And the dear haven where he wished to be</a>
<a id='line_1410'>  In honourable wedlock with his Love,                             60</a>
<a id='line_1411'>  Was in his judgment tempted to decline</a>
<a id='line_1412'>  To perilous weakness, [2] and entrust his cause</a>
<a id='line_1413'>  To nature for a happy end of all;</a>
<a id='line_1414'>  Deem that by such fond hope the Youth was swayed,</a>
<a id='line_1415'>  And bear with their transgression, when I add                    65</a>
<a id='line_1416'>  That Julia, wanting yet the name of wife,</a>
<a id='line_1417'>  Carried about her for a secret grief</a>
<a id='line_1418'>  The promise of a mother.</a>
<a id='line_1419'>                               To conceal</a>
<a id='line_1420'>  The threatened shame, the parents of the Maid                    70</a>
<a id='line_1421'>  Found means to hurry her away by night,</a>
<a id='line_1422'>  And unforewarned, that in some distant spot</a>
<a id='line_1423'>  She might remain shrouded in privacy,</a>
<a id='line_1424'>  Until the babe was born. When morning came,</a>
<a id='line_1425'>  The Lover, thus bereft, stung with his loss,                     75</a>
<a id='line_1426'>  And all uncertain whither he should turn,</a>
<a id='line_1427'>  Chafed like a wild beast in the toils; but soon</a>
<a id='line_1428'>  Discovering traces of the fugitives,</a>
<a id='line_1429'>  Their steps he followed to the Maid's retreat.</a>
<a id='line_1430'>  Easily may the sequel be divined--[3]                            80</a>
<a id='line_1431'>  Walks to and fro--watchings at every hour;</a>
<a id='line_1432'>  And the fair Captive, who, whene'er she may,</a>
<a id='line_1433'>  Is busy at her casement as the swallow</a>
<a id='line_1434'>  Fluttering its pinions, almost within reach,</a>
<a id='line_1435'>  About the pendent nest, did thus espy                            85</a>
<a id='line_1436'>  Her Lover!--thence a stolen interview,</a>
<a id='line_1437'>  Accomplished under friendly shade of night.</a>
<a id='line_1438'></a>
<a id='line_1439'>    I pass the raptures of the pair;--such theme</a>
<a id='line_1440'>  Is, by innumerable poets, touched</a>
<a id='line_1441'>  In more delightful verse than skill of mine                      90</a>
<a id='line_1442'>  Could fashion; chiefly by that darling bard</a>
<a id='line_1443'>  Who told of Juliet and her Romeo,</a>
<a id='line_1444'>  And of the lark's note heard before its time,</a>
<a id='line_1445'>  And of the streaks that laced the severing clouds</a>
<a id='line_1446'>  In the unrelenting east.--Through all her courts                 95</a>
<a id='line_1447'>  The vacant city slept; the busy winds,</a>
<a id='line_1448'>  That keep no certain intervals of rest,</a>
<a id='line_1449'>  Moved not; meanwhile the galaxy displayed</a>
<a id='line_1450'>  Her fires, that like mysterious pulses beat</a>
<a id='line_1451'>  Aloft;--momentous but uneasy bliss!                             100</a>
<a id='line_1452'>  To their full hearts the universe seemed hung</a>
<a id='line_1453'>  On that brief meeting's slender filament!</a>
<a id='line_1454'></a>
<a id='line_1455'>    They parted; and the generous Vaudracour</a>
<a id='line_1456'>  Reached speedily the native threshold, bent</a>
<a id='line_1457'>  On making (so the Lovers had agreed)                            105</a>
<a id='line_1458'>  A sacrifice of birthright to attain</a>
<a id='line_1459'>  A final portion from his father's hand;</a>
<a id='line_1460'>  Which granted, Bride and Bridegroom then would flee</a>
<a id='line_1461'>  To some remote and solitary place,</a>
<a id='line_1462'>  Shady as night, and beautiful as heaven,                        110</a>
<a id='line_1463'>  Where they may live, with no one to behold</a>
<a id='line_1464'>  Their happiness, or to disturb their love.</a>
<a id='line_1465'>  But _now_ of this no whisper; not the less,</a>
<a id='line_1466'>  If ever an obtrusive word were dropped</a>
<a id='line_1467'>  Touching the matter of his passion, still,                      115</a>
<a id='line_1468'>  In his stern father's hearing, Vaudracour</a>
<a id='line_1469'>  Persisted openly that death alone</a>
<a id='line_1470'>  Should abrogate his human privilege</a>
<a id='line_1471'>  Divine, of swearing everlasting truth,</a>
<a id='line_1472'>  Upon the altar, to the Maid he loved.                           120</a>
<a id='line_1473'></a>
<a id='line_1474'>    "You shall be baffled in your mad intent</a>
<a id='line_1475'>  If there be justice in the court of France,"</a>
<a id='line_1476'>  Muttered the Father.--From these words the Youth [4]</a>
<a id='line_1477'>  Conceived a terror; and, by night or day,</a>
<a id='line_1478'>  Stirred nowhere without weapons, that full soon                 125</a>
<a id='line_1479'>  Found dreadful provocation: for at night [5]</a>
<a id='line_1480'>  When to his chamber he retired, attempt</a>
<a id='line_1481'>  Was made to seize him by three armèd men,</a>
<a id='line_1482'>  Acting, in furtherance of the father's will,</a>
<a id='line_1483'>  Under a private signet of the State.                            130</a>
<a id='line_1484'>  One the rash Youth's ungovernable hand</a>
<a id='line_1485'>  Slew, and as quickly to a second gave [6]</a>
<a id='line_1486'>  A perilous wound--he shuddered to behold</a>
<a id='line_1487'>  The breathless corse; then peacefully resigned</a>
<a id='line_1488'>  His person to the law, was lodged in prison,                    135</a>
<a id='line_1489'>  And wore the fetters of a criminal.</a>
<a id='line_1490'></a>
<a id='line_1491'>    Have you observed [7] a tuft of wingèd seed</a>
<a id='line_1492'>  That, from the dandelion's naked stalk,</a>
<a id='line_1493'>  Mounted aloft, is suffered not to use</a>
<a id='line_1494'>  Its natural gifts for purposes of rest,                         140</a>
<a id='line_1495'>  Driven by the autumnal whirlwind to and fro</a>
<a id='line_1496'>  Through the wide element? or have you marked</a>
<a id='line_1497'>  The heavier substance of a leaf-clad bough,</a>
<a id='line_1498'>  Within the vortex of a foaming flood,</a>
<a id='line_1499'>  Tormented? by such aid you may conceive                         145</a>
<a id='line_1500'>  The perturbation that ensued; [8]--ah, no!</a>
<a id='line_1501'>  Desperate the Maid--the Youth is stained with blood;</a>
<a id='line_1502'>  Unmatchable on earth is their disquiet! [9]</a>
<a id='line_1503'>  Yet [10] as the troubled seed and tortured bough</a>
<a id='line_1504'>  Is Man, subjected to despotic sway.                             150</a>
<a id='line_1505'></a>
<a id='line_1506'>    For him, by private influence with the Court,</a>
<a id='line_1507'>  Was pardon gained, and liberty procured;</a>
<a id='line_1508'>  But not without exaction of a pledge,</a>
<a id='line_1509'>  Which liberty and love dispersed in air.</a>
<a id='line_1510'>  He flew to her from whom they would divide him--155</a>
<a id='line_1511'>  He clove to her who could not give him peace--</a>
<a id='line_1512'>  Yea, his first word of greeting was,--"All right</a>
<a id='line_1513'>  Is gone from me; my lately-towering hopes,</a>
<a id='line_1514'>  To the least fibre of their lowest root,</a>
<a id='line_1515'>  Are withered; thou no longer canst be mine,                     160</a>
<a id='line_1516'>  I thine--the conscience-stricken must not woo</a>
<a id='line_1517'>  The unruffled Innocent,--I see thy face,</a>
<a id='line_1518'>  Behold thee, and my misery is complete!"</a>
<a id='line_1519'></a>
<a id='line_1520'>    "One, are we not?" exclaimed the Maiden--"One,</a>
<a id='line_1521'>  For innocence and youth, for weal and woe?"                     165</a>
<a id='line_1522'>  Then with the father's name she coupled words</a>
<a id='line_1523'>  Of vehement indignation; but the Youth</a>
<a id='line_1524'>  Checked her with filial meekness; for no thought</a>
<a id='line_1525'>  Uncharitable crossed his mind, no sense</a>
<a id='line_1526'>  Of hasty anger rising in the eclipse [11]                       170</a>
<a id='line_1527'>  Of true domestic loyalty, did e'er</a>
<a id='line_1528'>  Find place within his bosom.--Once again</a>
<a id='line_1529'>  The persevering wedge of tyranny</a>
<a id='line_1530'>  Achieved their separation: and once more</a>
<a id='line_1531'>  Were they united,--to be yet again                              175</a>
<a id='line_1532'>  Disparted, pitiable lot! But here</a>
<a id='line_1533'>  A portion of the tale may well be left</a>
<a id='line_1534'>  In silence, though my memory could add</a>
<a id='line_1535'>  Much how the Youth, in scanty space of time,</a>
<a id='line_1536'>  Was traversed from without; much, too, of thoughts              180</a>
<a id='line_1537'>  That occupied his days in solitude</a>
<a id='line_1538'>  Under privation and restraint; and what,</a>
<a id='line_1539'>  Through dark and shapeless fear of things to come,</a>
<a id='line_1540'>  And what, through strong compunction for the past,</a>
<a id='line_1541'>  He suffered--breaking down in heart and mind!                   185</a>
<a id='line_1542'></a>
<a id='line_1543'>    Doomed to a third and last captivity,</a>
<a id='line_1544'>  His freedom he recovered on the eve</a>
<a id='line_1545'>  Of Julia's travail. When the babe was born,</a>
<a id='line_1546'>  Its presence tempted him to cherish schemes</a>
<a id='line_1547'>  Of future happiness. "You shall return,                         190</a>
<a id='line_1548'>  Julia," said he, "and to your father's house</a>
<a id='line_1549'>  Go with the child.--You have been wretched; yet</a>
<a id='line_1550'>  The silver shower, whose reckless burthen weighs</a>
<a id='line_1551'>  Too heavily upon the lily's head,</a>
<a id='line_1552'>  Oft leaves a saving moisture at its root.                       195</a>
<a id='line_1553'>  Malice, beholding you, will melt away.</a>
<a id='line_1554'>  Go!--'tis a town where both of us were born;</a>
<a id='line_1555'>  None will reproach you, for our truth is known;</a>
<a id='line_1556'>  And if, amid those once-bright bowers, our fate</a>

<a id='line_1561'>  Till no one can resist him.--Now, even now,</a>
<a id='line_1562'>  I see him sporting on the sunny lawn;                           205</a>
<a id='line_1563'>  My father from the window sees him too;</a>
<a id='line_1564'>  Startled, as if some new-created thing</a>
<a id='line_1565'>  Enriched the earth, or Faery of the woods</a>
<a id='line_1566'>  Bounded before him;--but the unweeting Child</a>
<a id='line_1567'>  Shall by his beauty win his grandsire's heart                   210</a>
<a id='line_1568'>  So that it shall be softened, and our loves</a>

<a id='line_1570'></a>
<a id='line_1571'>                                These gleams</a>

<a id='line_1573'>  Propping a pale and melancholy face                             215</a>
<a id='line_1574'>  Upon the Mother's bosom; resting thus</a>
<a id='line_1575'>  His head upon one breast, while from the other</a>
<a id='line_1576'>  The Babe was drawing in its quiet food.</a>
<a id='line_1577'>--That pillow is no longer to be thine,</a>
<a id='line_1578'>  Fond Youth! that mournful solace now must pass                  220</a>

<a id='line_1589'>  Of even the least emotion. Noting this,</a>
<a id='line_1590'>  When the impatient object of his love</a>
