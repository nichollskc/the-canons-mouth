<a id='line_36'></a>
<a id='line_37'>[Enter the King Henry, Westmoreland, Sir Walter Blunt, and others.]</a>
<a id='line_38'></a>
<a id='line_39'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_40'>So shaken as we are, so wan with care,</a>
<a id='line_41'>Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,</a>
<a id='line_42'>And breathe short-winded accents of new broils</a>
<a id='line_43'>To be commenced in strands afar remote.</a>
<a id='line_44'>No more the thirsty entrance of this soil</a>
<a id='line_45'>Shall daub her lips with her own children’s blood;</a>
<a id='line_46'>No more shall trenching war channel her fields,</a>
<a id='line_47'>Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs</a>
<a id='line_48'>Of hostile paces:  those opposed eyes,</a>
<a id='line_49'>Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,</a>
<a id='line_50'>All of one nature, of one substance bred,</a>
<a id='line_51'>Did lately meet in the intestine shock</a>
<a id='line_52'>And furious close of civil butchery,</a>
<a id='line_53'>Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,</a>
<a id='line_54'>March all one way, and be no more opposed</a>
<a id='line_55'>Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies:</a>
<a id='line_56'>The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,</a>
<a id='line_57'>No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,</a>
<a id='line_58'>As far as to the sepulchre of Christ—</a>
<a id='line_59'>Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross</a>
<a id='line_60'>We are impressed and engaged to fight—</a>
<a id='line_61'>Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,</a>
<a id='line_62'>To chase these pagans in those holy fields</a>
<a id='line_63'>Over whose acres walk’d those blessed feet</a>
<a id='line_64'>Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail’d</a>
<a id='line_65'>For our advantage on the bitter cross.</a>
<a id='line_66'>But this our purpose now is twelvemonth old,</a>
<a id='line_67'>And bootless ’tis to tell you we will go:</a>
<a id='line_68'>Therefore we meet not now.—Then let me hear</a>
<a id='line_69'>Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,</a>
<a id='line_70'>What yesternight our Council did decree</a>
<a id='line_71'>In forwarding this dear expedience.</a>
<a id='line_72'></a>
<a id='line_73'>WESTMORELAND.</a>
<a id='line_74'>My liege, this haste was hot in question,</a>
<a id='line_75'>And many limits of the charge set down</a>
<a id='line_76'>But yesternight; when, all athwart, there came</a>
<a id='line_77'>A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;</a>
<a id='line_78'>Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,</a>
<a id='line_79'>Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight</a>
<a id='line_80'>Against th’ irregular and wild Glendower,</a>
<a id='line_81'>Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken;</a>
<a id='line_82'>A thousand of his people butchered,</a>
<a id='line_83'>Upon whose dead corpse’ there was such misuse,</a>
<a id='line_84'>Such beastly, shameless transformation,</a>
<a id='line_85'>By those Welshwomen done, as may not be</a>
<a id='line_86'>Without much shame re-told or spoken of.</a>
<a id='line_87'></a>
<a id='line_88'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_89'>It seems, then, that the tidings of this broil</a>
<a id='line_90'>Brake off our business for the Holy Land.</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>WESTMORELAND.</a>
<a id='line_93'>This, match’d with other, did, my gracious lord;</a>
<a id='line_94'>For more uneven and unwelcome news</a>
<a id='line_95'>Came from the North, and thus it did import:</a>
<a id='line_96'>On Holy-rood day the gallant Hotspur there,</a>
<a id='line_97'>Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,</a>
<a id='line_98'>That ever-valiant and approved Scot,</a>
<a id='line_99'>At Holmedon met;</a>
<a id='line_100'>Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,</a>
<a id='line_101'>As by discharge of their artillery,</a>
<a id='line_102'>And shape of likelihood, the news was told;</a>
<a id='line_103'>For he that brought them, in the very heat</a>
<a id='line_104'>And pride of their contention did take horse,</a>
<a id='line_105'>Uncertain of the issue any way.</a>
<a id='line_106'></a>
<a id='line_107'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_108'>Here is a dear and true-industrious friend,</a>
<a id='line_109'>Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse,</a>
<a id='line_110'>Stain’d with the variation of each soil</a>
<a id='line_111'>Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;</a>
<a id='line_112'>And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.</a>
<a id='line_113'>The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:</a>
<a id='line_114'>Ten thousand bold Scots, two-and-twenty knights,</a>
<a id='line_115'>Balk’d in their own blood, did Sir Walter see</a>
<a id='line_116'>On Holmedon’s plains:  of prisoners, Hotspur took</a>
<a id='line_117'>Mordake the Earl of Fife and eldest son</a>
<a id='line_118'>To beaten Douglas; and the Earls of Athol,</a>
<a id='line_119'>Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.</a>
<a id='line_120'>And is not this an honourable spoil,</a>
<a id='line_121'>A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?</a>
<a id='line_122'></a>
<a id='line_123'>WESTMORELAND.</a>
<a id='line_124'>Faith, ’tis a conquest for a prince to boast of.</a>
<a id='line_125'></a>
<a id='line_126'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_127'>Yea, there thou makest me sad, and makest me sin</a>
<a id='line_128'>In envy that my Lord Northumberland</a>
<a id='line_129'>Should be the father to so blest a son,—</a>
<a id='line_130'>A son who is the theme of honour’s tongue;</a>
<a id='line_131'>Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;</a>
<a id='line_132'>Who is sweet Fortune’s minion and her pride:</a>
<a id='line_133'>Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,</a>
<a id='line_134'>See riot and dishonour stain the brow</a>
<a id='line_135'>Of my young Harry. O, that it could be proved</a>
<a id='line_136'>That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged</a>
<a id='line_137'>In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,</a>
<a id='line_138'>And call’d mine Percy, his Plantagenet!</a>
<a id='line_139'>Then would I have his Harry, and he mine:</a>
<a id='line_140'>But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,</a>
<a id='line_141'>Of this young Percy’s pride? the prisoners,</a>
<a id='line_142'>Which he in this adventure hath surprised,</a>
<a id='line_143'>To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,</a>
<a id='line_144'>I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.</a>
<a id='line_145'></a>
<a id='line_146'>WESTMORELAND.</a>
<a id='line_147'>This is his uncle’s teaching, this is Worcester,</a>
<a id='line_148'>Malevolent to you in all aspects;</a>
<a id='line_149'>Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up</a>
<a id='line_150'>The crest of youth against your dignity.</a>
<a id='line_151'></a>
<a id='line_152'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_153'>But I have sent for him to answer this;</a>
<a id='line_154'>And for this cause awhile we must neglect</a>
<a id='line_155'>Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_156'>Cousin, on Wednesday next our Council we</a>
<a id='line_157'>Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:</a>
<a id='line_158'>But come yourself with speed to us again;</a>
<a id='line_159'>For more is to be said and to be done</a>
<a id='line_160'>Than out of anger can be uttered.</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>WESTMORELAND.</a>
<a id='line_163'>I will, my liege.</a>
<a id='line_164'></a>
<a id='line_165'>[Exeunt.]</a>
<a id='line_166'></a>
<a id='line_167'>SCENE II. The same. An Apartment of Prince Henry’s.</a>
<a id='line_168'></a>
<a id='line_169'>[Enter Prince Henry and Falstaff.]</a>
<a id='line_170'></a>
<a id='line_171'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_172'>Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?</a>
<a id='line_173'></a>
<a id='line_174'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_175'>Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee</a>
<a id='line_176'>after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast</a>
<a id='line_177'>forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know. What a</a>
<a id='line_178'>devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? unless hours were cups</a>
<a id='line_179'>of sack, and minutes capons, and the blessed Sun himself a fair hot</a>
<a id='line_180'>wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no reason why thou shouldst be</a>
<a id='line_181'>so superfluous to demand the time of the day.</a>
<a id='line_182'></a>
<a id='line_183'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_184'>Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take purses go by the</a>
<a id='line_185'>Moon and the seven stars, and not by Phoebus,—he, that wandering knight</a>
<a id='line_186'>so fair. And I pr’ythee, sweet wag, when thou art king,—as, God save</a>
<a id='line_187'>thy Grace—Majesty I should say, for grace thou wilt have none,—</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_190'>What, none?</a>
<a id='line_191'></a>
<a id='line_192'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_193'>No, by my troth; not so much as will serve to be prologue to an egg and</a>
<a id='line_194'>butter.</a>
<a id='line_195'></a>
<a id='line_196'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_197'>Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_200'>Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that are squires</a>
<a id='line_201'>of the night’s body be called thieves of the day’s beauty:  let us be</a>
<a id='line_202'>Diana’s foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the Moon; and let</a>
<a id='line_203'>men say we be men of good government, being governed, as the sea is, by</a>
<a id='line_204'>our noble and chaste mistress the Moon, under whose countenance we</a>
<a id='line_205'>steal.</a>
<a id='line_206'></a>
<a id='line_207'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_208'>Thou say’st well, and it holds well too; for the fortune of us that are</a>
<a id='line_209'>the Moon’s men doth ebb and flow like the sea, being governed, as the</a>
<a id='line_210'>sea is, by the Moon. As, for proof, now: A purse of gold most</a>
<a id='line_211'>resolutely snatch’d on Monday night, and most dissolutely spent on</a>
<a id='line_212'>Tuesday morning; got with swearing Lay by, and spent with crying Bring</a>
<a id='line_213'>in; now ill as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder, and by-and-by in</a>
<a id='line_214'>as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.</a>
<a id='line_215'></a>
<a id='line_216'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_217'>By the Lord, thou say’st true, lad.  And is not my hostess of the</a>
<a id='line_218'>tavern a most sweet wench?</a>
<a id='line_219'></a>
<a id='line_220'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_221'>As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle.  And is not a buff</a>
<a id='line_222'>jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_225'>How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and thy quiddities? what</a>
<a id='line_226'>a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin?</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_229'>Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_232'>Well, thou hast call’d her to a reckoning many a time and oft.</a>
<a id='line_233'></a>
<a id='line_234'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_235'>Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_238'>No; I’ll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_241'>Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch; and where it would</a>
<a id='line_242'>not, I have used my credit.</a>
<a id='line_243'></a>
<a id='line_244'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_245'>Yea, and so used it, that, were it not here apparent that thou art</a>
<a id='line_246'>heir-apparent—But I pr’ythee, sweet wag, shall there be gallows</a>
<a id='line_247'>standing in England when thou art king? and resolution thus fobb’d as</a>
<a id='line_248'>it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do not thou,</a>
<a id='line_249'>when thou art king, hang a thief.</a>
<a id='line_250'></a>
<a id='line_251'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_252'>No; thou shalt.</a>
<a id='line_253'></a>
<a id='line_254'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_255'>Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I’ll be a brave judge.</a>
<a id='line_256'></a>
<a id='line_257'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_258'>Thou judgest false already:  I mean, thou shalt have the hanging of the</a>
<a id='line_259'>thieves, and so become a rare hangman.</a>
<a id='line_260'></a>
<a id='line_261'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_262'>Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my humour; as well as</a>
<a id='line_263'>waiting in the Court, I can tell you.</a>
<a id='line_264'></a>
<a id='line_265'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_266'>For obtaining of suits?</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_269'>Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe.</a>
<a id='line_270'>’Sblood, I am as melancholy as a gib-cat or a lugg’d bear.</a>
<a id='line_271'></a>
<a id='line_272'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_273'>Or an old lion, or a lover’s lute.</a>
<a id='line_274'></a>
<a id='line_275'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_276'>Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.</a>
<a id='line_277'></a>
<a id='line_278'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_279'>What say’st thou to a hare, or the melancholy of Moor-ditch?</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_282'>Thou hast the most unsavoury similes, and art, indeed, the most</a>
<a id='line_283'>comparative, rascalliest, sweet young prince,—But, Hal, I pr’ythee</a>
<a id='line_284'>trouble me no more with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a</a>
<a id='line_285'>commodity of good names were to be bought. An old lord of the Council</a>
<a id='line_286'>rated me the other day in the street about you, sir,—but I mark’d him</a>
<a id='line_287'>not; and yet he talk’d very wisely,—but I regarded him not; and yet he</a>
<a id='line_288'>talk’d wisely, and in the street too.</a>
<a id='line_289'></a>
<a id='line_290'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_291'>Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the streets, and no man</a>
<a id='line_292'>regards it.</a>
<a id='line_293'></a>
<a id='line_294'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_295'>O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art, indeed, able to corrupt a</a>
<a id='line_296'>saint. Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal; God forgive thee for it!</a>
<a id='line_297'>Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man should</a>
<a id='line_298'>speak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must give over</a>
<a id='line_299'>this life, and I will give it over; by the Lord, an I do not, I am a</a>
<a id='line_300'>villain:  I’ll be damn’d for never a king’s son in Christendom.</a>
<a id='line_301'></a>
<a id='line_302'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_303'>Where shall we take a purse to-morrow, Jack?</a>
<a id='line_304'></a>
<a id='line_305'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_306'>Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I’ll make one:  an I do not, call me</a>
<a id='line_307'>villain, and baffle me.</a>
<a id='line_308'></a>
<a id='line_309'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_310'>I see a good amendment of life in thee,—from praying to purse-taking.</a>
<a id='line_311'></a>
<a id='line_312'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_313'>Why, Hal, ’tis my vocation, Hal; ’tis no sin for a man to labour in his</a>
<a id='line_314'>vocation.</a>
<a id='line_315'></a>
<a id='line_316'>[Enter Poins.]</a>
<a id='line_317'></a>
<a id='line_318'>POINS.</a>
<a id='line_319'>Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match. O, if men were to be</a>
<a id='line_320'>saved by merit, what hole in Hell were hot enough for him? This is the</a>
<a id='line_321'>most omnipotent villain that ever cried Stand! to a true man.</a>
<a id='line_322'></a>
<a id='line_323'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_324'>Good morrow, Ned.</a>
<a id='line_325'></a>
<a id='line_326'>POINS.</a>
<a id='line_327'>Good morrow, sweet Hal.—What says Monsieur Remorse? what says Sir John</a>
<a id='line_328'>Sack-and-sugar? Jack, how agrees the Devil and thee about thy soul,</a>
<a id='line_329'>that thou soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira and a</a>
<a id='line_330'>cold capon’s leg?</a>
<a id='line_331'></a>
<a id='line_332'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_333'>Sir John stands to his word,—the Devil shall have his bargain;</a>
<a id='line_334'>for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs,—he will give the</a>
<a id='line_335'>Devil his due.</a>
<a id='line_336'></a>
<a id='line_337'>POINS.</a>
<a id='line_338'>Then art thou damn’d for keeping thy word with the Devil.</a>
<a id='line_339'></a>
<a id='line_340'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_341'>Else he had been damn’d for cozening the Devil.</a>
<a id='line_342'></a>
<a id='line_343'>POINS.</a>
<a id='line_344'>But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four o’clock, early at</a>
<a id='line_345'>Gads-hill! there are pilgrims gong to Canterbury with rich offerings,</a>
<a id='line_346'>and traders riding to London with fat purses: I have visards for you</a>
<a id='line_347'>all; you have horses for yourselves:  Gadshill lies to-night in</a>
<a id='line_348'>Rochester:  I have bespoke supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap:  we may</a>
<a id='line_349'>do it as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff your purses full</a>
<a id='line_350'>of crowns; if you will not, tarry at home and be hang’d.</a>
<a id='line_351'></a>
<a id='line_352'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_353'>Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not, I’ll hang you for</a>
<a id='line_354'>going.</a>
<a id='line_355'></a>
<a id='line_356'>POINS.</a>

<a id='line_402'>Now, my good sweet honey-lord, ride with us to-morrow:  I have a jest</a>
<a id='line_403'>to execute that I cannot manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto, and</a>
<a id='line_404'>Gadshill, shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:  yourself</a>
<a id='line_405'>and I will not be there; and when they have the booty, if you and I do</a>

<a id='line_412'>Why, we will set forth before or after them, and appoint them a place</a>

<a id='line_414'>adventure upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have no sooner</a>
<a id='line_415'>achieved but we’ll set upon them.</a>
<a id='line_416'></a>
<a id='line_417'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_418'>Ay, but ’tis like that they will know us by our horses, by our habits,</a>

<a id='line_420'></a>
<a id='line_421'>POINS.</a>
<a id='line_422'>Tut! our horses they shall not see,—I’ll tie them in the wood; our</a>

<a id='line_430'>Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred cowards as ever</a>
<a id='line_431'>turn’d back; and for the third, if he fight longer than he sees reason,</a>
<a id='line_432'>I’ll forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the</a>

<a id='line_434'>meet at supper: how thirty, at least, he fought with; what wards, what</a>
<a id='line_435'>blows, what extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this lies the</a>
<a id='line_436'>jest.</a>
<a id='line_437'></a>

<a id='line_439'>Well, I’ll go with thee:  provide us all things necessary and meet me</a>

<a id='line_515'>Yea, my good lord.</a>
<a id='line_516'>Those prisoners in your Highness’ name demanded,</a>
<a id='line_517'>Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,</a>
<a id='line_518'>Were, as he says, not with such strength denied</a>
<a id='line_519'>As is deliver’d to your Majesty:</a>
<a id='line_520'>Either envy, therefore, or misprision</a>
<a id='line_521'>Is guilty of this fault, and not my son.</a>
<a id='line_522'></a>
<a id='line_523'>HOTSPUR.</a>
<a id='line_524'>My liege, I did deny no prisoners.</a>
<a id='line_525'>But, I remember, when the fight was done,</a>
<a id='line_526'>When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,</a>
<a id='line_527'>Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,</a>
<a id='line_528'>Came there a certain lord, neat, trimly dress’d,</a>
<a id='line_529'>Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap’d</a>
<a id='line_530'>Show’d like a stubble-land at harvest-home:</a>
<a id='line_531'>He was perfumed like a milliner;</a>
<a id='line_532'>And ’twixt his finger and his thumb he held</a>
<a id='line_533'>A pouncet-box, which ever and anon</a>
<a id='line_534'>He gave his nose, and took’t away again;</a>
<a id='line_535'>Who therewith angry, when it next came there,</a>
<a id='line_536'>Took it in snuff:  and still he smiled and talk’d;</a>
<a id='line_537'>And, as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,</a>
<a id='line_538'>He call’d them untaught knaves, unmannerly,</a>
<a id='line_539'>To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse</a>
<a id='line_540'>Betwixt the wind and his nobility.</a>
<a id='line_541'>With many holiday and lady terms</a>
<a id='line_542'>He question’d me; amongst the rest, demanded</a>
<a id='line_543'>My prisoners in your Majesty’s behalf.</a>
<a id='line_544'>I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,</a>
<a id='line_545'>Out of my grief and my impatience</a>
<a id='line_546'>To be so pester’d with a popinjay,</a>
<a id='line_547'>Answer’d neglectingly, I know not what,—</a>
<a id='line_548'>He should, or he should not; for’t made me mad</a>
<a id='line_549'>To see him shine so brisk, and smell so sweet,</a>
<a id='line_550'>And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman</a>
<a id='line_551'>Of guns and drums and wounds,—God save the mark!—</a>
<a id='line_552'>And telling me the sovereign’st thing on Earth</a>
<a id='line_553'>Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;</a>
<a id='line_554'>And that it was great pity, so it was,</a>
<a id='line_555'>This villainous salt-petre should be digg’d</a>
<a id='line_556'>Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,</a>
<a id='line_557'>Which many a good tall fellow had destroy’d</a>
<a id='line_558'>So cowardly; and, but for these vile guns,</a>
<a id='line_559'>He would himself have been a soldier.</a>
<a id='line_560'>This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_561'>I answered indirectly, as I said;</a>

<a id='line_570'>At such a time, with all the rest re-told,</a>
<a id='line_571'>May reasonably die, and never rise</a>

<a id='line_578'>That we at our own charge shall ransom straight</a>
<a id='line_579'>His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;</a>

<a id='line_597'>Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,</a>
<a id='line_598'>Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took,</a>
<a id='line_599'>When on the gentle Severn’s sedgy bank,</a>
<a id='line_600'>In single opposition, hand to hand,</a>
<a id='line_601'>He did confound the best part of an hour</a>
<a id='line_602'>In changing hardiment with great Glendower.</a>
<a id='line_603'>Three times they breathed, and three times did they drink,</a>
<a id='line_604'>Upon agreement, of swift Severn’s flood;</a>
<a id='line_605'>Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,</a>
<a id='line_606'>Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,</a>
<a id='line_607'>And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank</a>
<a id='line_608'>Blood-stained with these valiant combatants.</a>
<a id='line_609'>Never did base and rotten policy</a>
<a id='line_610'>Colour her working with such deadly wounds;</a>
<a id='line_611'>Nor never could the noble Mortimer</a>
<a id='line_612'>Receive so many, and all willingly:</a>

<a id='line_1811'>Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.</a>
<a id='line_1812'></a>
<a id='line_1813'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_1814'>Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine in buckram that I</a>
<a id='line_1815'>told thee of,—</a>
<a id='line_1816'></a>

<a id='line_1825'></a>
<a id='line_1826'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_1827'>—began to give me ground:  but I followed me close, came in foot and</a>

<a id='line_1829'></a>
<a id='line_1830'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_1831'>O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!</a>
<a id='line_1832'></a>
<a id='line_1833'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_1834'>But, as the Devil would have it, three misbegotten knaves in Kendal</a>
<a id='line_1835'>Green came at my back and let drive at me; for it was so dark, Hal,</a>
<a id='line_1836'>that thou couldst not see thy hand.</a>
<a id='line_1837'></a>
<a id='line_1838'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_1839'>These lies are like the father that begets them, gross as a mountain,</a>

<a id='line_1843'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_1844'>What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth the truth?</a>
<a id='line_1845'></a>
<a id='line_1846'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_1847'>Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green, when it was so</a>
<a id='line_1848'>dark thou couldst not see thy hand? come, tell us your reason: what</a>
<a id='line_1849'>sayest thou to this?</a>
<a id='line_1850'></a>
<a id='line_1851'>POINS.</a>
<a id='line_1852'>Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.</a>
<a id='line_1853'></a>
<a id='line_1854'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_1855'>What, upon compulsion? No; were I at the strappado, or all the racks in</a>
<a id='line_1856'>the world, I would not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on</a>
<a id='line_1857'>compulsion! if reasons were as plentiful as blackberries, I would give</a>
<a id='line_1858'>no man a reason upon compulsion, I.</a>
<a id='line_1859'></a>
<a id='line_1860'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_1861'>I’ll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine coward, this</a>
<a id='line_1862'>bed-presser, this horse-back-breaker, this huge hill of flesh,—</a>
<a id='line_1863'></a>
<a id='line_1864'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_1865'>Away, you starveling, you eel-skin, you dried neat’s-tongue, you</a>

<a id='line_1870'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_1871'>Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again:  and, when thou hast tired</a>

<a id='line_1873'></a>
<a id='line_1874'>POINS.</a>
<a id='line_1875'>Mark, Jack.</a>
<a id='line_1876'></a>
<a id='line_1877'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_1878'>—We two saw you four set on four; you bound them, and were masters of</a>
<a id='line_1879'>their wealth.—Mark now, how a plain tale shall put you down.— Then did</a>
<a id='line_1880'>we two set on you four; and, with a word, outfaced you from your prize,</a>
<a id='line_1881'>and have it; yea, and can show it you here in the house: and, Falstaff,</a>
<a id='line_1882'>you carried yourself away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and</a>
<a id='line_1883'>roared for mercy, and still ran and roar’d, as ever I heard bull-calf.</a>
<a id='line_1884'>What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then</a>
<a id='line_1885'>say it was in fight! What trick, what device, what starting-hole canst</a>

<a id='line_1887'></a>
<a id='line_1888'>POINS.</a>
<a id='line_1889'>Come, let’s hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?</a>
<a id='line_1890'></a>
<a id='line_1891'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_1892'>By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye. Why, hear ye, my</a>
<a id='line_1893'>masters: Was it for me to kill the heir-apparent? should I turn upon</a>
<a id='line_1894'>the true Prince? why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules:  but</a>
<a id='line_1895'>beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true Prince. Instinct is a</a>
<a id='line_1896'>great matter; I was now a coward on instinct. I shall think the better</a>
<a id='line_1897'>of myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant lion, and thou for a</a>
<a id='line_1898'>true prince.  But, by the Lord, lads, I am glad you have the money.—</a>
<a id='line_1899'>[To Hostess within.]  Hostess, clap-to the doors:  watch to-night, pray</a>

<a id='line_1953'>Tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff’s sword so hack’d?</a>
<a id='line_1954'></a>
<a id='line_1955'>PETO.</a>
<a id='line_1956'>Why, he hack’d it with his dagger; and said he would swear truth out of</a>
<a id='line_1957'>England, but he would make you believe it was done in fight; and</a>
<a id='line_1958'>persuaded us to do the like.</a>
<a id='line_1959'></a>
<a id='line_1960'>BARDOLPH.</a>
<a id='line_1961'>Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to make them bleed; and</a>
<a id='line_1962'>then to beslubber our garments with it, and swear it was the blood of</a>

<a id='line_1967'>O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago, and wert</a>
<a id='line_1968'>taken with the manner, and ever since thou hast blush’d extempore. Thou</a>
<a id='line_1969'>hadst fire and sword on thy side, and yet thou rann’st away: what</a>
<a id='line_1970'>instinct hadst thou for it?</a>
<a id='line_1971'></a>
<a id='line_1972'>BARDOLPH.</a>
<a id='line_1973'>My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold these exhalations?</a>

<a id='line_1997'>My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an eagle’s</a>

<a id='line_2022'></a>
<a id='line_2023'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_2024'>Well, that rascal hath good metal in him; he will not run.</a>

<a id='line_2033'>Yes, Jack, upon instinct.</a>
<a id='line_2034'></a>
<a id='line_2035'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_2036'>I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too, and one Mordake, and</a>
<a id='line_2037'>a thousand blue-caps more: Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy</a>
<a id='line_2038'>father’s beard is turn’d white with the news:  you may buy land now as</a>
<a id='line_2039'>cheap as stinking mackerel. But, tell me, Hal, art not thou horrible</a>
<a id='line_2040'>afeard? thou being heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three</a>
<a id='line_2041'>such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that spirit Percy, and that</a>
<a id='line_2042'>devil Glendower? art thou not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood</a>

<a id='line_2044'></a>

<a id='line_2046'>Not a whit, i’faith; I lack some of thy instinct.</a>

<a id='line_2049'>Well, thou wilt be horribly chid to-morrow when thou comest to thy</a>

<a id='line_2064'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_2065'>Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee, now shalt thou be</a>

<a id='line_2074'>And here is my speech.—Stand aside, nobility.</a>
<a id='line_2075'></a>
<a id='line_2076'>HOSTESS.</a>
<a id='line_2077'>O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i faith!</a>
<a id='line_2078'></a>
<a id='line_2079'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_2080'>Weep not, sweet Queen; for trickling tears are vain.</a>

<a id='line_2085'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_2086'>For God’s sake, lords, convey my tristful Queen;</a>
<a id='line_2087'>For tears do stop the floodgates of her eyes.</a>
<a id='line_2088'></a>

<a id='line_2092'></a>
<a id='line_2093'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_2094'>Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.—Harry, I do not only</a>
<a id='line_2095'>marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou art accompanied:</a>
<a id='line_2096'> for though the camomile, the more it is trodden on, the faster it</a>
<a id='line_2097'>grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted, the sooner it wears. That thou</a>
<a id='line_2098'>art my son, I have partly thy mother’s word, partly my own opinion; but</a>
<a id='line_2099'>chiefly a villainous trick of thine eye, and a foolish hanging of thy</a>
<a id='line_2100'>nether lip, that doth warrant me. If, then, thou be son to me, here</a>
<a id='line_2101'>lies the point:  Why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall</a>
<a id='line_2102'>the blessed Sun of heaven prove a micher, and eat blackberries? a</a>
<a id='line_2103'>question not to be ask’d. Shall the son of England prove a thief, and</a>
<a id='line_2104'>take purses? a question to be ask’d. There is a thing, Harry, which</a>
<a id='line_2105'>thou hast often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the</a>
<a id='line_2106'>name of pitch:  this pitch, as ancient writers do report, doth defile;</a>
<a id='line_2107'>so doth the company thou keepest:  for, Harry, now I do not speak to</a>
<a id='line_2108'>thee in drink, but in tears; not in pleasure, but in passion; not in</a>
<a id='line_2109'>words only, but in woes also.  And yet there is a virtuous man whom I</a>
<a id='line_2110'>have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.</a>
<a id='line_2111'></a>
<a id='line_2112'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_2113'>What manner of man, an it like your Majesty?</a>
<a id='line_2114'></a>
<a id='line_2115'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_2116'>A goodly portly man, i’faith, and a corpulent; of a cheerful look, a</a>
<a id='line_2117'>pleasing eye, and a most noble carriage; and, as I think, his age some</a>
<a id='line_2118'>fifty, or, by’r Lady, inclining to threescore; and now I remember me,</a>
<a id='line_2119'>his name is Falstaff:  if that man should be lewdly given, he deceiveth</a>
<a id='line_2120'>me; for, Harry, I see virtue in his looks. If, then, the tree may be</a>
<a id='line_2121'>known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then, peremptorily I</a>
<a id='line_2122'>speak it, there is virtue in that Falstaff:  him keep with, the rest</a>
<a id='line_2123'>banish. And tell me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me where hast thou</a>
<a id='line_2124'>been this month?</a>
<a id='line_2125'></a>
<a id='line_2126'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_2127'>Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me, and I’ll play my</a>

<a id='line_2131'>Depose me! if thou dost it half so gravely, so majestically, both in</a>

<a id='line_2387'>Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,</a>
<a id='line_2388'>Shakes the old beldam Earth, and topples down</a>

<a id='line_2462'>To-morrow, cousin Percy, you, and I,</a>
<a id='line_2463'>And my good Lord of Worcester, will set forth</a>

<a id='line_2878'>Now, by my sceptre, and my soul to boot,</a>
<a id='line_2879'>He hath more worthy interest to the state</a>
<a id='line_2880'>Than thou, the shadow of succession;</a>

<a id='line_2896'>Enlarged him, and made a friend of him,</a>
<a id='line_2897'>To fill the mouth of deep defiance up,</a>
<a id='line_2898'>And shake the peace and safety of our throne.</a>

<a id='line_2905'>Thou that art like enough,—through vassal fear,</a>
<a id='line_2906'>Base inclination, and the start of spleen,—</a>
<a id='line_2907'>To fight against me under Percy’s pay,</a>
<a id='line_2908'>To dog his heels, and curtsy at his frowns,</a>

<a id='line_2981'>Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last action? do I not</a>
<a id='line_2982'>bate? do I not dwindle? Why, my skin hangs about me like an old lady’s</a>
<a id='line_2983'>loose gown; I am withered like an old apple-John. Well, I’ll repent,</a>
<a id='line_2984'>and that suddenly, while I am in some liking; I shall be out of heart</a>
<a id='line_2985'>shortly, and then I shall have no strength to repent. An I have not</a>

<a id='line_2989'></a>
<a id='line_2990'>BARDOLPH.</a>
<a id='line_2991'>Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.</a>
<a id='line_2992'></a>
<a id='line_2993'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_2994'>Why, there is it:  come, sing me a song; make me merry. I was as</a>
<a id='line_2995'>virtuously given as a gentleman need to be; virtuous enough; swore</a>
<a id='line_2996'>little; diced not above seven times a week; paid money that I borrowed</a>
<a id='line_2997'>—three or four times; lived well, and in good compass:  and now I live</a>
<a id='line_2998'>out of all order, out of all compass.</a>
<a id='line_2999'></a>
<a id='line_3000'>BARDOLPH.</a>
<a id='line_3001'>Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs be out of all</a>

<a id='line_3003'></a>
<a id='line_3004'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_3005'>Do thou amend thy face, and I’ll amend my life:  thou art our admiral,</a>

<a id='line_3008'></a>
<a id='line_3009'>BARDOLPH.</a>
<a id='line_3010'>Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.</a>
<a id='line_3011'></a>
<a id='line_3012'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_3013'>No, I’ll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many a man doth of a</a>

<a id='line_3015'>hell-fire, and Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his</a>
<a id='line_3016'>robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way given to virtue, I would</a>
<a id='line_3017'>swear by thy face; my oath should be, By this fire, that’s God’s angel:</a>
<a id='line_3018'> but thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but for the light</a>
<a id='line_3019'>in thy face, the son of utter darkness. When thou rann’st up Gad’s-hill</a>
<a id='line_3020'>in the night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou hadst been an</a>
<a id='line_3021'>ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire, there’s no purchase in money. O,</a>
<a id='line_3022'>thou art a perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light! Thou hast</a>
<a id='line_3023'>saved me a thousand marks in links and torches, walking with thee in</a>
<a id='line_3024'>the night betwixt tavern and tavern:  but the sack that thou hast drunk</a>
<a id='line_3025'>me would have bought me lights as good cheap at the dearest chandler’s</a>
<a id='line_3026'>in Europe. I have maintain’d that salamander of yours with fire any</a>

<a id='line_3039'></a>
<a id='line_3040'>HOSTESS.</a>
<a id='line_3041'>Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you think I keep thieves</a>
<a id='line_3042'>in my house? I have search’d, I have inquired, so has my husband, man</a>
<a id='line_3043'>by man, boy by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair was never</a>

<a id='line_3045'></a>
<a id='line_3046'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_3047'>Ye lie, hostess:  Bardolph was shaved, and lost many a hair; and</a>
<a id='line_3048'>I’ll be sworn my pocket was pick’d. Go to, you are a woman, go.</a>

<a id='line_3050'>HOSTESS.</a>

<a id='line_3056'></a>
<a id='line_3057'>HOSTESS.</a>
<a id='line_3058'>No, Sir John; you do not know me, Sir John. I know you, Sir John: you</a>
<a id='line_3059'>owe me money, Sir John; and now you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it:</a>
<a id='line_3060'>I bought you a dozen of shirts to your back.</a>
<a id='line_3061'></a>
<a id='line_3062'>FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_3063'>Dowlas, filthy dowlas:  I have given them away to bakers’ wives, and</a>
<a id='line_3064'>they have made bolters of them.</a>
<a id='line_3065'></a>
<a id='line_3066'>HOSTESS.</a>
<a id='line_3067'>Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight shillings an ell.</a>
<a id='line_3068'>You owe money here besides, Sir John, for your diet and by-drinkings,</a>
<a id='line_3069'>and money lent you, four-and-twenty pound.</a>
<a id='line_3070'></a>

<a id='line_3072'>He had his part of it; let him pay.</a>

<a id='line_3078'>How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich? let them coin his</a>

<a id='line_3080'>make a younker of me? shall I not take mine ease in mine inn, but I</a>
<a id='line_3081'>shall have my pocket pick’d? I have lost a seal-ring of my</a>

<a id='line_3101'>My lord, I pray you, hear me.</a>
<a id='line_3102'></a>
<a id='line_3103'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_3104'>What say’st thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy husband? I love him</a>

<a id='line_3117'>The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras, and had my pocket</a>

<a id='line_3574'>two napkins tack’d together and thrown over the shoulders like a</a>
<a id='line_3575'>herald’s coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say the truth, stolen</a>
<a id='line_3576'>from my host at Saint Alban’s, or the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry.</a>

<a id='line_3734'>But to my charge:  the King hath sent to know</a>
<a id='line_3735'>The nature of your griefs; and whereupon</a>
<a id='line_3736'>You conjure from the breast of civil peace</a>
<a id='line_3737'>Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land</a>
<a id='line_3738'>Audacious cruelty. If that the King</a>
<a id='line_3739'>Have any way your good deserts forgot,</a>
<a id='line_3740'>Which he confesseth to be manifold,</a>
<a id='line_3741'>He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed</a>
<a id='line_3742'>You shall have your desires with interest,</a>
<a id='line_3743'>And pardon absolute for yourself and these</a>

<a id='line_3745'></a>
<a id='line_3746'>HOTSPUR.</a>
<a id='line_3747'>The King is kind; and well we know the King</a>
<a id='line_3748'>Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.</a>
<a id='line_3749'>My father and my uncle and myself</a>
<a id='line_3750'>Did give him that same royalty he wears;</a>
<a id='line_3751'>And—when he was not six-and-twenty strong,</a>
<a id='line_3752'>Sick in the world’s regard, wretched and low,</a>
<a id='line_3753'>A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home—</a>
<a id='line_3754'>My father gave him welcome to the shore:</a>
<a id='line_3755'>And—when he heard him swear and vow to God,</a>
<a id='line_3756'>He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,</a>
<a id='line_3757'>To sue his livery and beg his peace,</a>
<a id='line_3758'>With tears of innocence and terms of zeal—</a>
<a id='line_3759'>My father, in kind heart and pity moved,</a>
<a id='line_3760'>Swore him assistance, and performed it too.</a>
<a id='line_3761'>Now, when the lords and barons of the realm</a>
<a id='line_3762'>Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,</a>
<a id='line_3763'>The more and less came in with cap and knee;</a>
<a id='line_3764'>Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,</a>
<a id='line_3765'>Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,</a>
<a id='line_3766'>Laid gifts before him, proffer’d him their oaths,</a>
<a id='line_3767'>Give him their heirs as pages, follow’d him</a>
<a id='line_3768'>Even at the heels in golden multitudes.</a>
<a id='line_3769'>He presently—as greatness knows itself—</a>
<a id='line_3770'>Steps me a little higher than his vow</a>
<a id='line_3771'>Made to my father, while his blood was poor,</a>
<a id='line_3772'>Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurg;</a>
<a id='line_3773'>And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform</a>
<a id='line_3774'>Some certain edicts and some strait decrees</a>
<a id='line_3775'>That lie too heavy on the commonwealth;</a>
<a id='line_3776'>Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep</a>
<a id='line_3777'>Over his country’s wrongs; and, by this face,</a>
<a id='line_3778'>This seeming brow of justice, did he win</a>
<a id='line_3779'>The hearts of all that he did angle for:</a>
<a id='line_3780'>Proceeded further; cut me off the heads</a>
<a id='line_3781'>Of all the favourites, that the absent King</a>
<a id='line_3782'>In deputation left behind him here</a>
<a id='line_3783'>When he was personal in the Irish war.</a>
<a id='line_3784'></a>
<a id='line_3785'>BLUNT.</a>
<a id='line_3786'>Tut, I came not to hear this.</a>
<a id='line_3787'></a>
<a id='line_3788'>HOTSPUR.</a>
<a id='line_3789'>Then to the point:</a>
<a id='line_3790'>In short time after, he deposed the King;</a>
<a id='line_3791'>Soon after that, deprived him of his life;</a>
<a id='line_3792'>And, in the neck of that, task’d the whole State:</a>
<a id='line_3793'>To make that worse, suffer’d his kinsman March</a>
<a id='line_3794'>(Who is, if every owner were well placed,</a>
<a id='line_3795'>Indeed his king) to be engaged in Wales,</a>
<a id='line_3796'>There without ransom to lie forfeited;</a>
<a id='line_3797'>Disgraced me in my happy victories,</a>
<a id='line_3798'>Sought to entrap me by intelligence;</a>
<a id='line_3799'>Rated my uncle from the Council-board;</a>
<a id='line_3800'>In rage dismiss’d my father from the Court;</a>
<a id='line_3801'>Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong;</a>
<a id='line_3802'>And, in conclusion, drove us to seek out</a>
<a id='line_3803'>This head of safety; and withal to pry</a>
<a id='line_3804'>Into his title, the which now we find</a>
<a id='line_3805'>Too indirect for long continuance.</a>
<a id='line_3806'></a>
<a id='line_3807'>BLUNT.</a>
<a id='line_3808'>Shall I return this answer to the King?</a>
<a id='line_3809'></a>
<a id='line_3810'>HOTSPUR.</a>
<a id='line_3811'>Not so, Sir Walter:  we’ll withdraw awhile.</a>
<a id='line_3812'>Go to the King; and let there be impawn’d</a>
<a id='line_3813'>Some surety for a safe return again,</a>

<a id='line_4655'>Pardon, and terms of love to all of you?</a>
<a id='line_4656'>And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?</a>
<a id='line_4657'>Misuse the tenour of thy kinsman’s trust?</a>
<a id='line_4658'>Three knights upon our party slain to-day,</a>
<a id='line_4659'>A noble earl, and many a creature else,</a>
<a id='line_4660'>Had been alive this hour,</a>
<a id='line_4661'>If, like a Christian, thou hadst truly borne</a>
<a id='line_4662'>Betwixt our armies true intelligence.</a>
<a id='line_4663'></a>
<a id='line_4664'>WORCESTER.</a>
<a id='line_4665'>What I have done my safety urged me to;</a>
<a id='line_4666'>And I embrace this fortune patiently,</a>
<a id='line_4667'>Since not to be avoided it fails on me.</a>
<a id='line_4668'></a>
<a id='line_4669'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_4670'>Bear Worcester to the death, and Vernon too:</a>
<a id='line_4671'>Other offenders we will pause upon.—</a>
<a id='line_4672'></a>
<a id='line_4673'>[Exeunt Worcester and Vernon, guarded.]</a>
<a id='line_4674'></a>
<a id='line_4675'>How goes the field?</a>
<a id='line_4676'></a>
<a id='line_4677'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_4678'>The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw</a>
<a id='line_4679'>The fortune of the day quite turn’d from him,</a>
<a id='line_4680'>The noble Percy slain, and all his men</a>
<a id='line_4681'>Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;</a>
<a id='line_4682'>And, falling from a hill, he was so bruised</a>
<a id='line_4683'>That the pursuers took him. At my tent</a>
<a id='line_4684'>The Douglas is:  and I beseech your Grace</a>
<a id='line_4685'>I may dispose of him.</a>
<a id='line_4686'></a>
<a id='line_4687'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_4688'>With all my heart.</a>
<a id='line_4689'></a>
<a id='line_4690'>PRINCE.</a>
<a id='line_4691'>Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you</a>
<a id='line_4692'>This honourable bounty shall belong:</a>
<a id='line_4693'>Go to the Douglas, and deliver him</a>
<a id='line_4694'>Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:</a>
<a id='line_4695'>His valour, shown upon our crests to-day,</a>
<a id='line_4696'>Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds</a>
<a id='line_4697'>Even in the bosom of our adversaries.</a>
<a id='line_4698'></a>
<a id='line_4699'>KING.</a>
<a id='line_4700'>Then this remains, that we divide our power.—</a>
<a id='line_4701'>You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland,</a>
<a id='line_4702'>Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,</a>
<a id='line_4703'>To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,</a>
<a id='line_4704'>Who, as we hear, are busily in arms:</a>
<a id='line_4705'>Myself,—and you, son Harry,—will towards Wales,</a>
<a id='line_4706'>To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.</a>
<a id='line_4707'>Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,</a>
<a id='line_4708'>Meeting the check of such another day;</a>
<a id='line_4709'>And since this business so fair is done,</a>
<a id='line_4710'>Let us not leave till all our own be won.</a>
<a id='line_4711'></a>
<a id='line_4712'>[Exeunt.]</a>
