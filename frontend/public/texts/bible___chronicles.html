<a id='line_899'>their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, a thousand and</a>
<a id='line_900'>seven hundred and threescore; very able men for the work of the</a>

<a id='line_910'>9:17 And the porters were, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman,</a>
<a id='line_911'>and their brethren: Shallum was the chief; 9:18 Who hitherto waited in</a>
<a id='line_912'>the king’s gate eastward: they were porters in the companies of the</a>
<a id='line_913'>children of Levi.</a>
<a id='line_914'></a>
<a id='line_915'>9:19 And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of</a>

<a id='line_926'></a>
<a id='line_927'>9:22 All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two</a>
<a id='line_928'>hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their</a>
<a id='line_929'>villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set</a>
<a id='line_930'>office.</a>
<a id='line_931'></a>
<a id='line_932'>9:23 So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the</a>
<a id='line_933'>house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by wards.</a>
<a id='line_934'></a>
<a id='line_935'>9:24 In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north,</a>
<a id='line_936'>and south.</a>
<a id='line_937'></a>
<a id='line_938'>9:25 And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come</a>
<a id='line_939'>after seven days from time to time with them.</a>
<a id='line_940'></a>
<a id='line_941'>9:26 For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set</a>
<a id='line_942'>office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.</a>
<a id='line_943'></a>
<a id='line_944'>9:27 And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge</a>
<a id='line_945'>was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning pertained to</a>
<a id='line_946'>them.</a>
<a id='line_947'></a>
<a id='line_948'>9:28 And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels,</a>
<a id='line_949'>that they should bring them in and out by tale.</a>
<a id='line_950'></a>
<a id='line_951'>9:29 Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and all</a>
<a id='line_952'>the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine,</a>
<a id='line_953'>and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.</a>
<a id='line_954'></a>
<a id='line_955'>9:30 And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the</a>
<a id='line_956'>spices.</a>
<a id='line_957'></a>
<a id='line_958'>9:31 And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of</a>
<a id='line_959'>Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were</a>
<a id='line_960'>made in the pans.</a>
<a id='line_961'></a>
<a id='line_962'>9:32 And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, were</a>
<a id='line_963'>over the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath.</a>
<a id='line_964'></a>
<a id='line_965'>9:33 And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites,</a>
<a id='line_966'>who remaining in the chambers were free: for they were employed in</a>
<a id='line_967'>that work day and night.</a>
<a id='line_968'></a>
<a id='line_969'>9:34 These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their</a>
<a id='line_970'>generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_971'></a>
<a id='line_972'>9:35 And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife’s</a>
<a id='line_973'>name was Maachah: 9:36 And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and</a>
<a id='line_974'>Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab.</a>
<a id='line_975'></a>
<a id='line_976'>9:37 And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.</a>
<a id='line_977'></a>
<a id='line_978'>9:38 And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their</a>
<a id='line_979'>brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren.</a>
<a id='line_980'></a>
<a id='line_981'>9:39 And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan,</a>
<a id='line_982'>and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.</a>
<a id='line_983'></a>
<a id='line_984'>9:40 And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begat Micah.</a>
<a id='line_985'></a>
<a id='line_986'>9:41 And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, and</a>
<a id='line_987'>Ahaz.</a>
<a id='line_988'></a>
<a id='line_989'>9:42 And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and</a>
<a id='line_990'>Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza; 9:43 And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah</a>
<a id='line_991'>his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.</a>
<a id='line_992'></a>
<a id='line_993'>9:44 And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam, Bocheru,</a>
<a id='line_994'>and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan: these were the sons</a>
<a id='line_995'>of Azel.</a>
<a id='line_996'></a>
<a id='line_997'>10:1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel</a>
<a id='line_998'>fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.</a>
<a id='line_999'></a>
<a id='line_1000'>10:2 And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons;</a>
<a id='line_1001'>and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the</a>
<a id='line_1002'>sons of Saul.</a>
<a id='line_1003'></a>
<a id='line_1004'>10:3 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him,</a>
<a id='line_1005'>and he was wounded of the archers.</a>
<a id='line_1006'></a>
<a id='line_1007'>10:4 Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me</a>
<a id='line_1008'>through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his</a>
<a id='line_1009'>armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword,</a>
<a id='line_1010'>and fell upon it.</a>
<a id='line_1011'></a>
<a id='line_1012'>10:5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell</a>
<a id='line_1013'>likewise on the sword, and died.</a>
<a id='line_1014'></a>
<a id='line_1015'>10:6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died</a>
<a id='line_1016'>together.</a>
<a id='line_1017'></a>
<a id='line_1018'>10:7 And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that</a>
<a id='line_1019'>they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook</a>
<a id='line_1020'>their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</a>
<a id='line_1021'></a>
<a id='line_1022'>10:8 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to</a>
<a id='line_1023'>strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount</a>
<a id='line_1024'>Gilboa.</a>
<a id='line_1025'></a>
<a id='line_1026'>10:9 And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his</a>
<a id='line_1027'>armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to</a>
<a id='line_1028'>carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.</a>
<a id='line_1029'></a>
<a id='line_1030'>10:10 And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened</a>
<a id='line_1031'>his head in the temple of Dagon.</a>
<a id='line_1032'></a>
<a id='line_1033'>10:11 And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had</a>
<a id='line_1034'>done to Saul, 10:12 They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the</a>
<a id='line_1035'>body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh,</a>
<a id='line_1036'>and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</a>
<a id='line_1037'></a>
<a id='line_1038'>10:13 So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against</a>
<a id='line_1039'>the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and</a>
<a id='line_1040'>also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire</a>
<a id='line_1041'>of it; 10:14 And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and</a>
<a id='line_1042'>turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.</a>
<a id='line_1043'></a>
<a id='line_1044'>11:1 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1045'>Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</a>
<a id='line_1046'></a>
<a id='line_1047'>11:2 And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he</a>
<a id='line_1048'>that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said</a>
<a id='line_1049'>unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler</a>
<a id='line_1050'>over my people Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1051'></a>
<a id='line_1052'>11:3 Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron;</a>
<a id='line_1053'>and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and</a>
<a id='line_1054'>they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the</a>
<a id='line_1055'>LORD by Samuel.</a>
<a id='line_1056'></a>
<a id='line_1057'>11:4 And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where</a>
<a id='line_1058'>the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.</a>
<a id='line_1059'></a>
<a id='line_1060'>11:5 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come</a>
<a id='line_1061'>hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city</a>
<a id='line_1062'>of David.</a>
<a id='line_1063'></a>
<a id='line_1064'>11:6 And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be</a>
<a id='line_1065'>chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was</a>
<a id='line_1066'>chief.</a>
<a id='line_1067'></a>
<a id='line_1068'>11:7 And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city</a>
<a id='line_1069'>of David.</a>
<a id='line_1070'></a>
<a id='line_1071'>11:8 And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about:</a>
<a id='line_1072'>and Joab repaired the rest of the city.</a>
<a id='line_1073'></a>
<a id='line_1074'>11:9 So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was</a>
<a id='line_1075'>with him.</a>
<a id='line_1076'></a>
<a id='line_1077'>11:10 These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who</a>
<a id='line_1078'>strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel,</a>
<a id='line_1079'>to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1080'></a>
<a id='line_1081'>11:11 And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had;</a>
<a id='line_1082'>Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his</a>
<a id='line_1083'>spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.</a>
<a id='line_1084'></a>
<a id='line_1085'>11:12 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was</a>
<a id='line_1086'>one of the three mighties.</a>
<a id='line_1087'></a>
<a id='line_1088'>11:13 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were</a>
<a id='line_1089'>gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of</a>
<a id='line_1090'>barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_1091'></a>
<a id='line_1092'>11:14 And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and</a>
<a id='line_1093'>delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a</a>
<a id='line_1094'>great deliverance.</a>
<a id='line_1095'></a>
<a id='line_1096'>11:15 Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David,</a>
<a id='line_1097'>into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in</a>
<a id='line_1098'>the valley of Rephaim.</a>
<a id='line_1099'></a>
<a id='line_1100'>11:16 And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines’ garrison</a>
<a id='line_1101'>was then at Bethlehem.</a>
<a id='line_1102'></a>
<a id='line_1103'>11:17 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of</a>
<a id='line_1104'>the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!  11:18 And</a>
<a id='line_1105'>the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water</a>
<a id='line_1106'>out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and</a>
<a id='line_1107'>brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it</a>
<a id='line_1108'>out to the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1109'></a>
<a id='line_1110'>11:19 And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing:</a>
<a id='line_1111'>shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in</a>
<a id='line_1112'>jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it.</a>
<a id='line_1113'>Therefore he would not drink it.</a>
<a id='line_1114'></a>
<a id='line_1115'>These things did these three mightiest.</a>
<a id='line_1116'></a>
<a id='line_1117'>11:20 And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for</a>
<a id='line_1118'>lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a</a>
<a id='line_1119'>name among the three.</a>
<a id='line_1120'></a>
<a id='line_1121'>11:21 Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was</a>
<a id='line_1122'>their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.</a>
<a id='line_1123'></a>
<a id='line_1124'>11:22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of</a>
<a id='line_1125'>Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab:</a>
<a id='line_1126'>also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.</a>
<a id='line_1127'></a>
<a id='line_1128'>11:23 And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits</a>
<a id='line_1129'>high; and in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and</a>
<a id='line_1130'>he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the</a>
<a id='line_1131'>Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.</a>
<a id='line_1132'></a>
<a id='line_1133'>11:24 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name</a>
<a id='line_1134'>among the three mighties.</a>
<a id='line_1135'></a>
<a id='line_1136'>11:25 Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to</a>
<a id='line_1137'>the first three: and David set him over his guard.</a>
<a id='line_1138'></a>
<a id='line_1139'>11:26 Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of</a>

<a id='line_1188'>Eliel the seventh, 12:12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, 12:13</a>
<a id='line_1189'>Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.</a>
<a id='line_1190'></a>
<a id='line_1191'>12:14 These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the</a>
<a id='line_1192'>least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.</a>
<a id='line_1193'></a>
<a id='line_1194'>12:15 These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it</a>
<a id='line_1195'>had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the</a>
<a id='line_1196'>valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.</a>
<a id='line_1197'></a>
<a id='line_1198'>12:16 And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold</a>
<a id='line_1199'>unto David.</a>
<a id='line_1200'></a>
<a id='line_1201'>12:17 And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto</a>
<a id='line_1202'>them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be</a>
<a id='line_1203'>knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing</a>
<a id='line_1204'>there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look thereon,</a>
<a id='line_1205'>and rebuke it.</a>
<a id='line_1206'></a>
<a id='line_1207'>12:18 Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains,</a>
<a id='line_1208'>and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse:</a>
<a id='line_1209'>peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God</a>
<a id='line_1210'>helpeth thee.</a>
<a id='line_1211'></a>
<a id='line_1212'>Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.</a>
<a id='line_1213'></a>
<a id='line_1214'>12:19 And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the</a>
<a id='line_1215'>Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the</a>
<a id='line_1216'>lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He</a>
<a id='line_1217'>will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.</a>
<a id='line_1218'></a>
<a id='line_1219'>12:20 As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and</a>
<a id='line_1220'>Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and</a>
<a id='line_1221'>Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.</a>
<a id='line_1222'></a>
<a id='line_1223'>12:21 And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they</a>
<a id='line_1224'>were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.</a>
<a id='line_1225'></a>
<a id='line_1226'>12:22 For at that time day by day there came to David to help him,</a>
<a id='line_1227'>until it was a great host, like the host of God.</a>
<a id='line_1228'></a>
<a id='line_1229'>12:23 And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to</a>
<a id='line_1230'>the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to</a>
<a id='line_1231'>him, according to the word of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1232'></a>
<a id='line_1233'>12:24 The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six</a>
<a id='line_1234'>thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.</a>
<a id='line_1235'></a>
<a id='line_1236'>12:25 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war,</a>
<a id='line_1237'>seven thousand and one hundred.</a>
<a id='line_1238'></a>
<a id='line_1239'>12:26 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.</a>
<a id='line_1240'></a>
<a id='line_1241'>12:27 And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were</a>
<a id='line_1242'>three thousand and seven hundred; 12:28 And Zadok, a young man mighty</a>
<a id='line_1243'>of valour, and of his father’s house twenty and two captains.</a>
<a id='line_1244'></a>
<a id='line_1245'>12:29 And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three</a>
<a id='line_1246'>thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of</a>
<a id='line_1247'>the house of Saul.</a>
<a id='line_1248'></a>
<a id='line_1249'>12:30 And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight</a>
<a id='line_1250'>hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their</a>
<a id='line_1251'>fathers.</a>
<a id='line_1252'></a>
<a id='line_1253'>12:31 And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were</a>
<a id='line_1254'>expressed by name, to come and make David king.</a>
<a id='line_1255'></a>
<a id='line_1256'>12:32 And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had</a>
<a id='line_1257'>understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads</a>
<a id='line_1258'>of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their</a>
<a id='line_1259'>commandment.</a>
<a id='line_1260'></a>
<a id='line_1261'>12:33 Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with</a>
<a id='line_1262'>all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they</a>
<a id='line_1263'>were not of double heart.</a>
<a id='line_1264'></a>
<a id='line_1265'>12:34 And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield</a>
<a id='line_1266'>and spear thirty and seven thousand.</a>
<a id='line_1267'></a>
<a id='line_1268'>12:35 And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and</a>
<a id='line_1269'>six hundred.</a>
<a id='line_1270'></a>
<a id='line_1271'>12:36 And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty</a>
<a id='line_1272'>thousand.</a>
<a id='line_1273'></a>
<a id='line_1274'>12:37 And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the</a>
<a id='line_1275'>Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of</a>
<a id='line_1276'>instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.</a>
<a id='line_1277'></a>
<a id='line_1278'>12:38 All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect</a>
<a id='line_1279'>heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest</a>
<a id='line_1280'>also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.</a>
<a id='line_1281'></a>
<a id='line_1282'>12:39 And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking:</a>
<a id='line_1283'>for their brethren had prepared for them.</a>
<a id='line_1284'></a>
<a id='line_1285'>12:40 Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and</a>
<a id='line_1286'>Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on</a>
<a id='line_1287'>mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of</a>
<a id='line_1288'>raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there</a>
<a id='line_1289'>was joy in Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1290'></a>
<a id='line_1291'>13:1 And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds,</a>
<a id='line_1292'>and with every leader.</a>
<a id='line_1293'></a>
<a id='line_1294'>13:2 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem</a>
<a id='line_1295'>good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad</a>
<a id='line_1296'>unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of</a>
<a id='line_1297'>Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in</a>
<a id='line_1298'>their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:</a>
<a id='line_1299'>13:3 And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired</a>
<a id='line_1300'>not at it in the days of Saul.</a>
<a id='line_1301'></a>
<a id='line_1302'>13:4 And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the</a>
<a id='line_1303'>thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</a>
<a id='line_1304'></a>
<a id='line_1305'>13:5 So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even</a>
<a id='line_1306'>unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from</a>
<a id='line_1307'>Kirjathjearim.</a>
<a id='line_1308'></a>
<a id='line_1309'>13:6 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to</a>
<a id='line_1310'>Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of</a>
<a id='line_1311'>God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is</a>
<a id='line_1312'>called on it.</a>
<a id='line_1313'></a>
<a id='line_1314'>13:7 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of</a>
<a id='line_1315'>Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.</a>
<a id='line_1316'></a>
<a id='line_1317'>13:8 And David and all Israel played before God with all their might,</a>
<a id='line_1318'>and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with</a>
<a id='line_1319'>timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.</a>
<a id='line_1320'></a>
<a id='line_1321'>13:9 And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put</a>
<a id='line_1322'>forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.</a>
<a id='line_1323'></a>
<a id='line_1324'>13:10 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote</a>
<a id='line_1325'>him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.</a>
<a id='line_1326'></a>
<a id='line_1327'>13:11 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach</a>
<a id='line_1328'>upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.</a>
<a id='line_1329'></a>
<a id='line_1330'>13:12 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring</a>
<a id='line_1331'>the ark of God home to me?  13:13 So David brought not the ark home to</a>
<a id='line_1332'>himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of</a>
<a id='line_1333'>Obededom the Gittite.</a>
<a id='line_1334'></a>
<a id='line_1335'>13:14 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his</a>
<a id='line_1336'>house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and</a>
<a id='line_1337'>all that he had.</a>
<a id='line_1338'></a>
<a id='line_1339'>14:1 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of</a>
<a id='line_1340'>cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.</a>
<a id='line_1341'></a>
<a id='line_1342'>14:2 And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over</a>
<a id='line_1343'>Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people</a>
<a id='line_1344'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1345'></a>
<a id='line_1346'>14:3 And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons</a>
<a id='line_1347'>and daughters.</a>
<a id='line_1348'></a>
<a id='line_1349'>14:4 Now these are the names of his children which he had in</a>
<a id='line_1350'>Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, 14:5 And Ibhar,</a>
<a id='line_1351'>and Elishua, and Elpalet, 14:6 And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 14:7</a>
<a id='line_1352'>And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.</a>
<a id='line_1353'></a>
<a id='line_1354'>14:8 And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over</a>
<a id='line_1355'>all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard</a>
<a id='line_1356'>of it, and went out against them.</a>
<a id='line_1357'></a>
<a id='line_1358'>14:9 And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of</a>
<a id='line_1359'>Rephaim.</a>
<a id='line_1360'></a>
<a id='line_1361'>14:10 And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the</a>
<a id='line_1362'>Philistines? And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1363'>said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_1364'></a>
<a id='line_1365'>14:11 So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then</a>
<a id='line_1366'>David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the</a>
<a id='line_1367'>breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place</a>
<a id='line_1368'>Baalperazim.</a>
<a id='line_1369'></a>
<a id='line_1370'>14:12 And when they had left their gods there, David gave a</a>
<a id='line_1371'>commandment, and they were burned with fire.</a>
<a id='line_1372'></a>
<a id='line_1373'>14:13 And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the</a>
<a id='line_1374'>valley.</a>
<a id='line_1375'></a>
<a id='line_1376'>14:14 Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go</a>
<a id='line_1377'>not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over</a>
<a id='line_1378'>against the mulberry trees.</a>
<a id='line_1379'></a>
<a id='line_1380'>14:15 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the</a>
<a id='line_1381'>tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for</a>
<a id='line_1382'>God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_1383'></a>
<a id='line_1384'>14:16 David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the</a>
<a id='line_1385'>host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.</a>
<a id='line_1386'></a>
<a id='line_1387'>14:17 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1388'>brought the fear of him upon all nations.</a>
<a id='line_1389'></a>
<a id='line_1390'>15:1 And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a</a>
<a id='line_1391'>place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.</a>
<a id='line_1392'></a>
<a id='line_1393'>15:2 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the</a>
<a id='line_1394'>Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to</a>
<a id='line_1395'>minister unto him for ever.</a>
<a id='line_1396'></a>
<a id='line_1397'>15:3 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up</a>
<a id='line_1398'>the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.</a>
<a id='line_1399'></a>
<a id='line_1400'>15:4 And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: 15:5</a>
<a id='line_1401'>Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred</a>
<a id='line_1402'>and twenty: 15:6 Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his</a>
<a id='line_1403'>brethren two hundred and twenty: 15:7 Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the</a>
<a id='line_1404'>chief and his brethren an hundred and thirty: 15:8 Of the sons of</a>
<a id='line_1405'>Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred: 15:9 Of</a>
<a id='line_1406'>the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: 15:10</a>
<a id='line_1407'>Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an</a>
<a id='line_1408'>hundred and twelve.</a>
<a id='line_1409'></a>
<a id='line_1410'>15:11 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the</a>
<a id='line_1411'>Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and</a>
<a id='line_1412'>Amminadab, 15:12 And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers</a>
<a id='line_1413'>of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that</a>
<a id='line_1414'>ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that</a>
<a id='line_1415'>I have prepared for it.</a>
<a id='line_1416'></a>
<a id='line_1417'>15:13 For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a</a>
<a id='line_1418'>breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.</a>
<a id='line_1419'></a>
<a id='line_1420'>15:14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up</a>
<a id='line_1421'>the ark of the LORD God of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1422'></a>
<a id='line_1423'>15:15 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their</a>
<a id='line_1424'>shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the</a>
<a id='line_1425'>word of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1426'></a>
<a id='line_1427'>15:16 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their</a>
<a id='line_1428'>brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and</a>
<a id='line_1429'>harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.</a>
<a id='line_1430'></a>
<a id='line_1431'>15:17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his</a>
<a id='line_1432'>brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their</a>
<a id='line_1433'>brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 15:18 And with them their</a>
<a id='line_1434'>brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and</a>
<a id='line_1435'>Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah,</a>
<a id='line_1436'>and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel,</a>
<a id='line_1437'>the porters.</a>
<a id='line_1438'></a>
<a id='line_1439'>15:19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound</a>
<a id='line_1440'>with cymbals of brass; 15:20 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and</a>
<a id='line_1441'>Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and</a>
<a id='line_1442'>Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; 15:21 And Mattithiah, and</a>
<a id='line_1443'>Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with</a>
<a id='line_1444'>harps on the Sheminith to excel.</a>
<a id='line_1445'></a>
<a id='line_1446'>15:22 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed</a>
<a id='line_1447'>about the song, because he was skilful.</a>
<a id='line_1448'></a>
<a id='line_1449'>15:23 And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.</a>
<a id='line_1450'></a>
<a id='line_1451'>15:24 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and</a>
<a id='line_1452'>Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the</a>
<a id='line_1453'>trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were</a>
<a id='line_1454'>doorkeepers for the ark.</a>
<a id='line_1455'></a>
<a id='line_1456'>15:25 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over</a>
<a id='line_1457'>thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of</a>
<a id='line_1458'>the house of Obededom with joy.</a>
<a id='line_1459'></a>
<a id='line_1460'>15:26 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the</a>
<a id='line_1461'>ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and</a>
<a id='line_1462'>seven rams.</a>
<a id='line_1463'></a>
<a id='line_1464'>15:27 And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the</a>
<a id='line_1465'>Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master</a>
<a id='line_1466'>of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of</a>
<a id='line_1467'>linen.</a>
<a id='line_1468'></a>
<a id='line_1469'>15:28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1470'>with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and</a>
<a id='line_1471'>with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.</a>
<a id='line_1472'></a>
<a id='line_1473'>15:29 And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came</a>
<a id='line_1474'>to the city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul looking out at</a>
<a id='line_1475'>a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in</a>
<a id='line_1476'>her heart.</a>
<a id='line_1477'></a>
<a id='line_1478'>16:1 So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_1479'>tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices</a>
<a id='line_1480'>and peace offerings before God.</a>
<a id='line_1481'></a>
<a id='line_1482'>16:2 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings</a>
<a id='line_1483'>and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the</a>
<a id='line_1484'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1485'></a>
<a id='line_1486'>16:3 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every</a>

<a id='line_1488'></a>
<a id='line_1489'>16:4 And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the</a>
<a id='line_1490'>ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God</a>
<a id='line_1491'>of Israel: 16:5 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and</a>
<a id='line_1492'>Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and</a>
<a id='line_1493'>Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a</a>
<a id='line_1494'>sound with cymbals; 16:6 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with</a>
<a id='line_1495'>trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.</a>
<a id='line_1496'></a>
<a id='line_1497'>16:7 Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the</a>
<a id='line_1498'>LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.</a>
<a id='line_1499'></a>
<a id='line_1500'>16:8 Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his</a>

<a id='line_1513'>ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.</a>
<a id='line_1514'></a>
<a id='line_1515'>16:14 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.</a>
<a id='line_1516'></a>
<a id='line_1517'>16:15 Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he</a>
<a id='line_1518'>commanded to a thousand generations; 16:16 Even of the covenant which</a>
<a id='line_1519'>he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac; 16:17 And hath</a>
<a id='line_1520'>confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an</a>
<a id='line_1521'>everlasting covenant, 16:18 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of</a>
<a id='line_1522'>Canaan, the lot of your inheritance; 16:19 When ye were but few, even</a>

<a id='line_1528'>and do my prophets no harm.</a>
<a id='line_1529'></a>
<a id='line_1530'>16:23 Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day</a>

<a id='line_1570'></a>
<a id='line_1571'>16:36 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the</a>
<a id='line_1572'>people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1573'></a>
<a id='line_1574'>16:37 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1575'>Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as</a>
<a id='line_1576'>every day’s work required: 16:38 And Obededom with their brethren,</a>
<a id='line_1577'>threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to</a>
<a id='line_1578'>be porters: 16:39 And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests,</a>
<a id='line_1579'>before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at</a>
<a id='line_1580'>Gibeon, 16:40 To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of</a>
<a id='line_1581'>the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do</a>
<a id='line_1582'>according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he</a>
<a id='line_1583'>commanded Israel; 16:41 And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest</a>
<a id='line_1584'>that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the</a>
<a id='line_1585'>LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever; 16:42 And with them Heman</a>
<a id='line_1586'>and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a</a>
<a id='line_1587'>sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun</a>
<a id='line_1588'>were porters.</a>
<a id='line_1589'></a>
<a id='line_1590'>16:43 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David</a>
<a id='line_1591'>returned to bless his house.</a>
<a id='line_1592'></a>
<a id='line_1593'>17:1 Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said</a>
<a id='line_1594'>to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark</a>
<a id='line_1595'>of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains.</a>
<a id='line_1596'></a>
<a id='line_1597'>17:2 Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for</a>
<a id='line_1598'>God is with thee.</a>
<a id='line_1599'></a>
<a id='line_1600'>17:3 And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to</a>
<a id='line_1601'>Nathan, saying, 17:4 Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the</a>
<a id='line_1602'>LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in: 17:5 For I have</a>
<a id='line_1603'>not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this</a>
<a id='line_1604'>day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to</a>
<a id='line_1605'>another.</a>
<a id='line_1606'></a>
<a id='line_1607'>17:6 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any</a>
<a id='line_1608'>of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1609'>Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?  17:7 Now therefore thus</a>
<a id='line_1610'>shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I</a>
<a id='line_1611'>took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou</a>
<a id='line_1612'>shouldest be ruler over my people Israel: 17:8 And I have been with</a>
<a id='line_1613'>thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine</a>
<a id='line_1614'>enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of</a>
<a id='line_1615'>the great men that are in the earth.</a>
<a id='line_1616'></a>
<a id='line_1617'>17:9 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant</a>
<a id='line_1618'>them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more;</a>
<a id='line_1619'>neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at</a>
<a id='line_1620'>the beginning, 17:10 And since the time that I commanded judges to be</a>
<a id='line_1621'>over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies.</a>
<a id='line_1622'>Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house.</a>
<a id='line_1623'></a>
<a id='line_1624'>17:11 And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou</a>
<a id='line_1625'>must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after</a>
<a id='line_1626'>thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_1627'></a>
<a id='line_1628'>17:12 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for</a>
<a id='line_1629'>ever.</a>
<a id='line_1630'></a>
<a id='line_1631'>17:13 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not</a>
<a id='line_1632'>take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before</a>
<a id='line_1633'>thee: 17:14 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for</a>
<a id='line_1634'>ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.</a>
<a id='line_1635'></a>
<a id='line_1636'>17:15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision,</a>
<a id='line_1637'>so did Nathan speak unto David.</a>
<a id='line_1638'></a>
<a id='line_1639'>17:16 And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who</a>
<a id='line_1640'>am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me</a>
<a id='line_1641'>hitherto?  17:17 And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God;</a>
<a id='line_1642'>for thou hast also spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to</a>
<a id='line_1643'>come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high</a>
<a id='line_1644'>degree, O LORD God.</a>
<a id='line_1645'></a>
<a id='line_1646'>17:18 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant?</a>
<a id='line_1647'>for thou knowest thy servant.</a>
<a id='line_1648'></a>
<a id='line_1649'>17:19 O LORD, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own</a>
<a id='line_1650'>heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these</a>
<a id='line_1651'>great things.</a>
<a id='line_1652'></a>
<a id='line_1653'>17:20 O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside</a>
<a id='line_1654'>thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</a>
<a id='line_1655'></a>
<a id='line_1656'>17:21 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom</a>
<a id='line_1657'>God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of</a>
<a id='line_1658'>greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy</a>
<a id='line_1659'>people whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?  17:22 For thy people</a>
<a id='line_1660'>Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD,</a>
<a id='line_1661'>becamest their God.</a>
<a id='line_1662'></a>
<a id='line_1663'>17:23 Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken</a>
<a id='line_1664'>concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for</a>
<a id='line_1665'>ever, and do as thou hast said.</a>
<a id='line_1666'></a>
<a id='line_1667'>17:24 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for</a>
<a id='line_1668'>ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to</a>
<a id='line_1669'>Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before</a>
<a id='line_1670'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_1671'></a>
<a id='line_1672'>17:25 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build</a>
<a id='line_1673'>him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray</a>
<a id='line_1674'>before thee.</a>
<a id='line_1675'></a>
<a id='line_1676'>17:26 And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness</a>
<a id='line_1677'>unto thy servant: 17:27 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the</a>
<a id='line_1678'>house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou</a>
<a id='line_1679'>blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.</a>
<a id='line_1680'></a>
<a id='line_1681'>18:1 Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines,</a>
<a id='line_1682'>and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_1683'>Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_1684'></a>
<a id='line_1685'>18:2 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David’s servants, and</a>
<a id='line_1686'>brought gifts.</a>
<a id='line_1687'></a>
<a id='line_1688'>18:3 And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went</a>
<a id='line_1689'>to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.</a>
<a id='line_1690'></a>
<a id='line_1691'>18:4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand</a>
<a id='line_1692'>horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the</a>
<a id='line_1693'>chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.</a>
<a id='line_1694'></a>
<a id='line_1695'>18:5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of</a>
<a id='line_1696'>Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.</a>
<a id='line_1697'></a>
<a id='line_1698'>18:6 Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became</a>
<a id='line_1699'>David’s servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David</a>
<a id='line_1700'>whithersoever he went.</a>
<a id='line_1701'></a>
<a id='line_1702'>18:7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of</a>
<a id='line_1703'>Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1704'></a>
<a id='line_1705'>18:8 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer,</a>
<a id='line_1706'>brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea,</a>
<a id='line_1707'>and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</a>
<a id='line_1708'></a>
<a id='line_1709'>18:9 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the</a>
<a id='line_1710'>host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; 18:10 He sent Hadoram his son to king</a>
<a id='line_1711'>David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he</a>
<a id='line_1712'>had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war</a>
<a id='line_1713'>with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and</a>
<a id='line_1714'>brass.</a>
<a id='line_1715'></a>
<a id='line_1716'>18:11 Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver</a>
<a id='line_1717'>and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and</a>
<a id='line_1718'>from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines,</a>
<a id='line_1719'>and from Amalek.</a>
<a id='line_1720'></a>
<a id='line_1721'>18:12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the</a>
<a id='line_1722'>valley of salt eighteen thousand.</a>
<a id='line_1723'></a>
<a id='line_1724'>18:13 And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became</a>
<a id='line_1725'>David’s servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</a>
<a id='line_1726'></a>
<a id='line_1727'>18:14 So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and</a>
<a id='line_1728'>justice among all his people.</a>
<a id='line_1729'></a>
<a id='line_1730'>18:15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat</a>
<a id='line_1731'>the son of Ahilud, recorder.</a>
<a id='line_1732'></a>
<a id='line_1733'>18:16 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar,</a>
<a id='line_1734'>were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; 18:17 And Benaiah the son of</a>
<a id='line_1735'>Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of</a>
<a id='line_1736'>David were chief about the king.</a>
<a id='line_1737'></a>
<a id='line_1738'>19:1 Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the</a>
<a id='line_1739'>children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_1740'></a>
<a id='line_1741'>19:2 And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of</a>
<a id='line_1742'>Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent</a>
<a id='line_1743'>messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of</a>
<a id='line_1744'>David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort</a>
<a id='line_1745'>him.</a>
<a id='line_1746'></a>
<a id='line_1747'>19:3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest</a>
<a id='line_1748'>thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters</a>
<a id='line_1749'>unto thee?  are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to</a>
<a id='line_1750'>overthrow, and to spy out the land?  19:4 Wherefore Hanun took David’s</a>
<a id='line_1751'>servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst</a>
<a id='line_1752'>hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.</a>
<a id='line_1753'></a>
<a id='line_1754'>19:5 Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served.</a>
<a id='line_1755'>And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the</a>
<a id='line_1756'>king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then</a>
<a id='line_1757'>return.</a>
<a id='line_1758'></a>
<a id='line_1759'>19:6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves</a>
<a id='line_1760'>odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand</a>
<a id='line_1761'>talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of</a>
<a id='line_1762'>Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.</a>
<a id='line_1763'></a>
<a id='line_1764'>19:7 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of</a>
<a id='line_1765'>Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the</a>
<a id='line_1766'>children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and</a>
<a id='line_1767'>came to battle.</a>
<a id='line_1768'></a>
<a id='line_1769'>19:8 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the</a>
<a id='line_1770'>mighty men.</a>
<a id='line_1771'></a>
<a id='line_1772'>19:9 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array</a>
<a id='line_1773'>before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by</a>
<a id='line_1774'>themselves in the field.</a>
<a id='line_1775'></a>
<a id='line_1776'>19:10 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and</a>
<a id='line_1777'>behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in</a>
<a id='line_1778'>array against the Syrians.</a>
<a id='line_1779'></a>
<a id='line_1780'>19:11 And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai</a>
<a id='line_1781'>his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of</a>
<a id='line_1782'>Ammon.</a>
<a id='line_1783'></a>
<a id='line_1784'>19:12 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou</a>
<a id='line_1785'>shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee,</a>
<a id='line_1786'>then I will help thee.</a>
<a id='line_1787'></a>
<a id='line_1788'>19:13 Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for</a>
<a id='line_1789'>our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that</a>
<a id='line_1790'>which is good in his sight.</a>
<a id='line_1791'></a>
<a id='line_1792'>19:14 So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the</a>
<a id='line_1793'>Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.</a>
<a id='line_1794'></a>
<a id='line_1795'>19:15 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,</a>
<a id='line_1796'>they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the</a>
<a id='line_1797'>city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1798'></a>
<a id='line_1799'>19:16 And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before</a>
<a id='line_1800'>Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were</a>
<a id='line_1801'>beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer</a>
<a id='line_1802'>went before them.</a>
<a id='line_1803'></a>
<a id='line_1804'>19:17 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed</a>
<a id='line_1805'>over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against</a>
<a id='line_1806'>them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians,</a>
<a id='line_1807'>they fought with him.</a>
<a id='line_1808'></a>
<a id='line_1809'>19:18 But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the</a>
<a id='line_1810'>Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty</a>
<a id='line_1811'>thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.</a>
<a id='line_1812'></a>
<a id='line_1813'>19:19 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the</a>
<a id='line_1814'>worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his</a>
<a id='line_1815'>servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any</a>
<a id='line_1816'>more.</a>
<a id='line_1817'></a>
<a id='line_1818'>20:1 And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time</a>
<a id='line_1819'>that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and</a>
<a id='line_1820'>wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged</a>
<a id='line_1821'>Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and</a>
<a id='line_1822'>destroyed it.</a>
<a id='line_1823'></a>
<a id='line_1824'>20:2 And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and</a>
<a id='line_1825'>found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in</a>
<a id='line_1826'>it; and it was set upon David’s head: and he brought also exceeding</a>
<a id='line_1827'>much spoil out of the city.</a>
<a id='line_1828'></a>
<a id='line_1829'>20:3 And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with</a>
<a id='line_1830'>saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David</a>
<a id='line_1831'>with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the</a>
<a id='line_1832'>people returned to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1833'></a>
<a id='line_1834'>20:4 And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer</a>
<a id='line_1835'>with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew</a>
<a id='line_1836'>Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.</a>
<a id='line_1837'></a>
<a id='line_1838'>20:5 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son</a>
<a id='line_1839'>of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear</a>
<a id='line_1840'>staff was like a weaver’s beam.</a>
<a id='line_1841'></a>
<a id='line_1842'>20:6 And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great</a>
<a id='line_1843'>stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each</a>
<a id='line_1844'>hand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant.</a>
<a id='line_1845'></a>
<a id='line_1846'>20:7 But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s</a>
<a id='line_1847'>brother slew him.</a>
<a id='line_1848'></a>
<a id='line_1849'>20:8 These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand</a>
<a id='line_1850'>of David, and by the hand of his servants.</a>
<a id='line_1851'></a>
<a id='line_1852'>21:1 And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number</a>
<a id='line_1853'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1854'></a>
<a id='line_1855'>21:2 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go,</a>
<a id='line_1856'>number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them</a>
<a id='line_1857'>to me, that I may know it.</a>
<a id='line_1858'></a>
<a id='line_1859'>21:3 And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so</a>
<a id='line_1860'>many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my</a>
<a id='line_1861'>lord’s servants?  why then doth my lord require this thing? why will</a>
<a id='line_1862'>he be a cause of trespass to Israel?  21:4 Nevertheless the king’s</a>
<a id='line_1863'>word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went</a>
<a id='line_1864'>throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1865'></a>
<a id='line_1866'>21:5 And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And</a>
<a id='line_1867'>all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand</a>
<a id='line_1868'>men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten</a>
<a id='line_1869'>thousand men that drew sword.</a>
<a id='line_1870'></a>
<a id='line_1871'>21:6 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s</a>
<a id='line_1872'>word was abominable to Joab.</a>
<a id='line_1873'></a>
<a id='line_1874'>21:7 And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote</a>
<a id='line_1875'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1876'></a>
<a id='line_1877'>21:8 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have</a>
<a id='line_1878'>done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy</a>
<a id='line_1879'>servant; for I have done very foolishly.</a>
<a id='line_1880'></a>
<a id='line_1881'>21:9 And the LORD spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying, 21:10 Go and</a>
<a id='line_1882'>tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things:</a>
<a id='line_1883'>choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_1884'></a>
<a id='line_1885'>21:11 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_1886'>Choose thee 21:12 Either three years’ famine; or three months to be</a>
<a id='line_1887'>destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies</a>
<a id='line_1888'>overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the</a>
<a id='line_1889'>pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying</a>
<a id='line_1890'>throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what</a>
<a id='line_1891'>word I shall bring again to him that sent me.</a>
<a id='line_1892'></a>
<a id='line_1893'>21:13 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now</a>
<a id='line_1894'>into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me</a>
<a id='line_1895'>not fall into the hand of man.</a>
<a id='line_1896'></a>
<a id='line_1897'>21:14 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of</a>
<a id='line_1898'>Israel seventy thousand men.</a>
<a id='line_1899'></a>
<a id='line_1900'>21:15 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he</a>
<a id='line_1901'>was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and</a>
<a id='line_1902'>said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_1903'>And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the</a>
<a id='line_1904'>Jebusite.</a>
<a id='line_1905'></a>
<a id='line_1906'>21:16 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1907'>stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his</a>
<a id='line_1908'>hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of</a>
<a id='line_1909'>Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</a>
<a id='line_1910'></a>
<a id='line_1911'>21:17 And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people</a>
<a id='line_1912'>to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed;</a>
<a id='line_1913'>but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray</a>
<a id='line_1914'>thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father’s house; but not on</a>
<a id='line_1915'>thy people, that they should be plagued.</a>
<a id='line_1916'></a>
<a id='line_1917'>21:18 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that</a>
<a id='line_1918'>David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the</a>
<a id='line_1919'>threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</a>
<a id='line_1920'></a>
<a id='line_1921'>21:19 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the</a>
<a id='line_1922'>name of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1923'></a>
<a id='line_1924'>21:20 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with</a>
<a id='line_1925'>him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</a>
<a id='line_1926'></a>
<a id='line_1927'>21:21 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went</a>
<a id='line_1928'>out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to</a>
<a id='line_1929'>the ground.</a>
<a id='line_1930'></a>
<a id='line_1931'>21:22 Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this</a>
<a id='line_1932'>threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou</a>
<a id='line_1933'>shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed</a>
<a id='line_1934'>from the people.</a>
<a id='line_1935'></a>
<a id='line_1936'>21:23 And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the</a>
<a id='line_1937'>king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also</a>
<a id='line_1938'>for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the</a>
<a id='line_1939'>wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</a>
<a id='line_1940'></a>
<a id='line_1941'>21:24 And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for</a>
<a id='line_1942'>the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_1943'>nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</a>
<a id='line_1944'></a>
<a id='line_1945'>21:25 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold</a>
<a id='line_1946'>by weight.</a>
<a id='line_1947'></a>
<a id='line_1948'>21:26 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt</a>
<a id='line_1949'>offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he</a>
<a id='line_1950'>answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.</a>
<a id='line_1951'></a>
<a id='line_1952'>21:27 And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again</a>
<a id='line_1953'>into the sheath thereof.</a>
<a id='line_1954'></a>
<a id='line_1955'>21:28 At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in</a>
<a id='line_1956'>the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</a>
<a id='line_1957'></a>
<a id='line_1958'>21:29 For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the</a>
<a id='line_1959'>wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season</a>
<a id='line_1960'>in the high place at Gibeon.</a>
<a id='line_1961'></a>
<a id='line_1962'>21:30 But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was</a>
<a id='line_1963'>afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1964'></a>
<a id='line_1965'>22:1 Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is</a>
<a id='line_1966'>the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1967'></a>
<a id='line_1968'>22:2 And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in</a>
<a id='line_1969'>the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build</a>
<a id='line_1970'>the house of God.</a>
<a id='line_1971'></a>
<a id='line_1972'>22:3 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors</a>
<a id='line_1973'>of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without</a>
<a id='line_1974'>weight; 22:4 Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they</a>
<a id='line_1975'>of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.</a>
<a id='line_1976'></a>
<a id='line_1977'>22:5 And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house</a>
<a id='line_1978'>that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical, of</a>
<a id='line_1979'>fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make</a>
<a id='line_1980'>preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.</a>
<a id='line_1981'></a>
<a id='line_1982'>22:6 Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an</a>
<a id='line_1983'>house for the LORD God of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1984'></a>
<a id='line_1985'>22:7 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind</a>
<a id='line_1986'>to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God: 22:8 But the word</a>
<a id='line_1987'>of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and</a>
<a id='line_1988'>hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name,</a>
<a id='line_1989'>because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.</a>
<a id='line_1990'></a>
<a id='line_1991'>22:9 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest;</a>
<a id='line_1992'>and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his</a>
<a id='line_1993'>name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel</a>
<a id='line_1994'>in his days.</a>
<a id='line_1995'></a>
<a id='line_1996'>22:10 He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and</a>
<a id='line_1997'>I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom</a>
<a id='line_1998'>over Israel for ever.</a>
<a id='line_1999'></a>
<a id='line_2000'>22:11 Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build</a>
<a id='line_2001'>the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.</a>
<a id='line_2002'></a>
<a id='line_2003'>22:12 Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee</a>
<a id='line_2004'>charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2005'>thy God.</a>
<a id='line_2006'></a>
<a id='line_2007'>22:13 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the</a>
<a id='line_2008'>statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning</a>
<a id='line_2009'>Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.</a>
<a id='line_2010'></a>
<a id='line_2011'>22:14 Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the</a>
<a id='line_2012'>LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand</a>
<a id='line_2013'>talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in</a>
<a id='line_2014'>abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add</a>
<a id='line_2015'>thereto.</a>
<a id='line_2016'></a>
<a id='line_2017'>22:15 Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and</a>
<a id='line_2018'>workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every</a>
<a id='line_2019'>manner of work.</a>
<a id='line_2020'></a>
<a id='line_2021'>22:16 Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is</a>
<a id='line_2022'>no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.</a>
<a id='line_2023'></a>
<a id='line_2024'>22:17 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon</a>
<a id='line_2025'>his son, saying, 22:18 Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he</a>
<a id='line_2026'>not given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of</a>
<a id='line_2027'>the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_2028'>before his people.</a>
<a id='line_2029'></a>
<a id='line_2030'>22:19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God;</a>
<a id='line_2031'>arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring</a>
<a id='line_2032'>the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into</a>
<a id='line_2033'>the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2034'></a>
<a id='line_2035'>23:1 So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son</a>
<a id='line_2036'>king over Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2037'></a>
<a id='line_2038'>23:2 And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the</a>
<a id='line_2039'>priests and the Levites.</a>
<a id='line_2040'></a>
<a id='line_2041'>23:3 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and</a>
<a id='line_2042'>upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and</a>
<a id='line_2043'>eight thousand.</a>
<a id='line_2044'></a>
<a id='line_2045'>23:4 Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work</a>
<a id='line_2046'>of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:</a>
<a id='line_2047'>23:5 Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised</a>
<a id='line_2048'>the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise</a>
<a id='line_2049'>therewith.</a>
<a id='line_2050'></a>
<a id='line_2051'>23:6 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi,</a>
<a id='line_2052'>namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</a>
<a id='line_2053'></a>
<a id='line_2054'>23:7 Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.</a>
<a id='line_2055'></a>
<a id='line_2056'>23:8 The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel,</a>
<a id='line_2057'>three.</a>
<a id='line_2058'></a>
<a id='line_2059'>23:9 The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three.</a>
<a id='line_2060'>These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.</a>
<a id='line_2061'></a>
<a id='line_2062'>23:10 And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and</a>
<a id='line_2063'>Beriah.</a>
<a id='line_2064'></a>
<a id='line_2065'>These four were the sons of Shimei.</a>
<a id='line_2066'></a>
<a id='line_2067'>23:11 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and</a>
<a id='line_2068'>Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning,</a>
<a id='line_2069'>according to their father’s house.</a>
<a id='line_2070'></a>
<a id='line_2071'>23:12 The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.</a>
<a id='line_2072'></a>
<a id='line_2073'>23:13 The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated,</a>
<a id='line_2074'>that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for</a>
<a id='line_2075'>ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to</a>
<a id='line_2076'>bless in his name for ever.</a>
<a id='line_2077'></a>
<a id='line_2078'>23:14 Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the</a>
<a id='line_2079'>tribe of Levi.</a>
<a id='line_2080'></a>
<a id='line_2081'>23:15 The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.</a>
<a id='line_2082'></a>
<a id='line_2083'>23:16 Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.</a>
<a id='line_2084'></a>
<a id='line_2085'>23:17 And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer</a>
<a id='line_2086'>had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.</a>
<a id='line_2087'></a>
<a id='line_2088'>23:18 Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.</a>
<a id='line_2089'></a>
<a id='line_2090'>23:19 Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,</a>
<a id='line_2091'>Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.</a>
<a id='line_2092'></a>
<a id='line_2093'>23:20 Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second.</a>
<a id='line_2094'></a>
<a id='line_2095'>23:21 The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli;</a>
<a id='line_2096'>Eleazar, and Kish.</a>
<a id='line_2097'></a>
<a id='line_2098'>23:22 And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their</a>

<a id='line_2100'></a>
<a id='line_2101'>23:23 The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.</a>
<a id='line_2102'></a>
<a id='line_2103'>23:24 These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers;</a>
<a id='line_2104'>even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names</a>
<a id='line_2105'>by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the</a>
<a id='line_2106'>LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.</a>
<a id='line_2107'></a>
<a id='line_2108'>23:25 For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his</a>
<a id='line_2109'>people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever: 23:26 And also unto</a>
<a id='line_2110'>the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels</a>
<a id='line_2111'>of it for the service thereof.</a>
<a id='line_2112'></a>
<a id='line_2113'>23:27 For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from</a>
<a id='line_2114'>twenty years old and above: 23:28 Because their office was to wait on</a>
<a id='line_2115'>the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the</a>
<a id='line_2116'>courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things,</a>
<a id='line_2117'>and the work of the service of the house of God; 23:29 Both for the</a>
<a id='line_2118'>shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the</a>
<a id='line_2119'>unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that</a>
<a id='line_2120'>which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size; 23:30 And to</a>
<a id='line_2121'>stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at</a>
<a id='line_2122'>even: 23:31 And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the</a>
<a id='line_2123'>sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number,</a>
<a id='line_2124'>according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the</a>
<a id='line_2125'>LORD: 23:32 And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of</a>
<a id='line_2126'>the congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of</a>
<a id='line_2127'>the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the</a>
<a id='line_2128'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2129'></a>
<a id='line_2130'>24:1 Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of</a>
<a id='line_2131'>Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</a>
<a id='line_2132'></a>
<a id='line_2133'>24:2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no</a>
<a id='line_2134'>children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest’s office.</a>
<a id='line_2135'></a>
<a id='line_2136'>24:3 And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar,</a>
<a id='line_2137'>and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in</a>
<a id='line_2138'>their service.</a>
<a id='line_2139'></a>
<a id='line_2140'>24:4 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than</a>
<a id='line_2141'>of the sons of Ithamar, and thus were they divided. Among the sons of</a>
<a id='line_2142'>Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers,</a>
<a id='line_2143'>and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their</a>
<a id='line_2144'>fathers.</a>
<a id='line_2145'></a>
<a id='line_2146'>24:5 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the</a>
<a id='line_2147'>governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of</a>
<a id='line_2148'>the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.</a>
<a id='line_2149'></a>
<a id='line_2150'>24:6 And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites,</a>

<a id='line_2152'>Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of</a>
<a id='line_2153'>the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for</a>
<a id='line_2154'>Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.</a>
<a id='line_2155'></a>
<a id='line_2156'>24:7 Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,</a>

<a id='line_2167'></a>
<a id='line_2168'>24:19 These were the orderings of them in their service to come into</a>

<a id='line_2201'>24:31 These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of</a>

<a id='line_2476'>footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building: 28:3 But</a>
<a id='line_2477'>God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because</a>
<a id='line_2478'>thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood.</a>
<a id='line_2479'></a>
<a id='line_2480'>28:4 Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of</a>
<a id='line_2481'>my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to</a>
<a id='line_2482'>be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and</a>
<a id='line_2483'>among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all</a>
<a id='line_2484'>Israel: 28:5 And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many</a>
<a id='line_2485'>sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the</a>
<a id='line_2486'>kingdom of the LORD over Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2487'></a>
<a id='line_2488'>28:6 And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and</a>
<a id='line_2489'>my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his</a>
<a id='line_2490'>father.</a>
<a id='line_2491'></a>
<a id='line_2492'>28:7 Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant</a>
<a id='line_2493'>to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.</a>
<a id='line_2494'></a>
<a id='line_2495'>28:8 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the</a>
<a id='line_2496'>LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the</a>
<a id='line_2497'>commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land,</a>
<a id='line_2498'>and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.</a>
<a id='line_2499'></a>
<a id='line_2500'>28:9 And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and</a>
<a id='line_2501'>serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2502'>searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the</a>
<a id='line_2503'>thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou</a>
<a id='line_2504'>forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</a>
<a id='line_2505'></a>
<a id='line_2506'>28:10 Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house</a>
<a id='line_2507'>for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.</a>
<a id='line_2508'></a>
<a id='line_2509'>28:11 Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and</a>
<a id='line_2510'>of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper</a>
<a id='line_2511'>chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place</a>
<a id='line_2512'>of the mercy seat, 28:12 And the pattern of all that he had by the</a>
<a id='line_2513'>spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the</a>
<a id='line_2514'>chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of</a>
<a id='line_2515'>the treasuries of the dedicated things: 28:13 Also for the courses of</a>
<a id='line_2516'>the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of</a>
<a id='line_2517'>the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house</a>
<a id='line_2518'>of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2519'></a>
<a id='line_2520'>28:14 He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all</a>
<a id='line_2521'>instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments</a>
<a id='line_2522'>of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:</a>
<a id='line_2523'>28:15 Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their</a>
<a id='line_2524'>lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps</a>
<a id='line_2525'>thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the</a>
<a id='line_2526'>candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of</a>
<a id='line_2527'>every candlestick.</a>
<a id='line_2528'></a>
<a id='line_2529'>28:16 And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for</a>
<a id='line_2530'>every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver: 28:17 Also</a>
<a id='line_2531'>pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the</a>
<a id='line_2532'>golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and likewise</a>
<a id='line_2533'>silver by weight for every bason of silver: 28:18 And for the altar of</a>
<a id='line_2534'>incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the</a>
<a id='line_2535'>chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the</a>
<a id='line_2536'>ark of the covenant of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2537'></a>
<a id='line_2538'>28:19 All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by</a>
<a id='line_2539'>his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.</a>
<a id='line_2540'></a>
<a id='line_2541'>28:20 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good</a>
<a id='line_2542'>courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even</a>
<a id='line_2543'>my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee,</a>
<a id='line_2544'>until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of</a>
<a id='line_2545'>the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2546'></a>
<a id='line_2547'>28:21 And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even</a>
<a id='line_2548'>they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and</a>
<a id='line_2549'>there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing</a>
<a id='line_2550'>skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the</a>
<a id='line_2551'>people will be wholly at thy commandment.</a>
<a id='line_2552'></a>
<a id='line_2553'>29:1 Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation,</a>
<a id='line_2554'>Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender,</a>
<a id='line_2555'>and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2556'>God.</a>
<a id='line_2557'></a>
<a id='line_2558'>29:2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the</a>
<a id='line_2559'>gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of</a>
<a id='line_2560'>silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of</a>
<a id='line_2561'>iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set,</a>
<a id='line_2562'>glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious</a>
<a id='line_2563'>stones, and marble stones in abundance.</a>
<a id='line_2564'></a>
<a id='line_2565'>29:3 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God,</a>
<a id='line_2566'>I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given</a>
<a id='line_2567'>to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for</a>
<a id='line_2568'>the holy house.</a>
<a id='line_2569'></a>
<a id='line_2570'>29:4 Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and</a>
<a id='line_2571'>seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the</a>
<a id='line_2572'>houses withal: 29:5 The gold for things of gold, and the silver for</a>
<a id='line_2573'>things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands</a>
<a id='line_2574'>of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this</a>
<a id='line_2575'>day unto the LORD?  29:6 Then the chief of the fathers and princes of</a>
<a id='line_2576'>the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds,</a>
<a id='line_2577'>with the rulers of the king’s work, offered willingly, 29:7 And gave</a>
<a id='line_2578'>for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and</a>
<a id='line_2579'>ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass</a>
<a id='line_2580'>eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.</a>
<a id='line_2581'></a>
<a id='line_2582'>29:8 And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the</a>
<a id='line_2583'>treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the</a>
<a id='line_2584'>Gershonite.</a>
<a id='line_2585'></a>
<a id='line_2586'>29:9 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly,</a>
<a id='line_2587'>because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and</a>
<a id='line_2588'>David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</a>
<a id='line_2589'></a>
<a id='line_2590'>29:10 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation:</a>
<a id='line_2591'>and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for</a>
<a id='line_2592'>ever and ever.</a>
<a id='line_2593'></a>
<a id='line_2594'>29:11 Thine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory,</a>
<a id='line_2595'>and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in</a>
<a id='line_2596'>the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted</a>
<a id='line_2597'>as head above all.</a>
<a id='line_2598'></a>
<a id='line_2599'>29:12 Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all;</a>
<a id='line_2600'>and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make</a>
<a id='line_2601'>great, and to give strength unto all.</a>
<a id='line_2602'></a>
<a id='line_2603'>29:13 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious</a>
<a id='line_2604'>name.</a>
<a id='line_2605'></a>
<a id='line_2606'>29:14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to</a>
<a id='line_2607'>offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and</a>
<a id='line_2608'>of thine own have we given thee.</a>
<a id='line_2609'></a>
<a id='line_2610'>29:15 For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all</a>
<a id='line_2611'>our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none</a>
<a id='line_2612'>abiding.</a>
<a id='line_2613'></a>
<a id='line_2614'>29:16 O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build</a>
<a id='line_2615'>thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all</a>
<a id='line_2616'>thine own.</a>
<a id='line_2617'></a>
<a id='line_2618'>29:17 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast</a>
<a id='line_2619'>pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I</a>
<a id='line_2620'>have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy</a>
<a id='line_2621'>thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_2622'></a>
<a id='line_2623'>29:18 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep</a>
<a id='line_2624'>this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy</a>
<a id='line_2625'>people, and prepare their heart unto thee: 29:19 And give unto Solomon</a>
<a id='line_2626'>my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and</a>
<a id='line_2627'>thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for</a>
<a id='line_2628'>the which I have made provision.</a>
<a id='line_2629'></a>
<a id='line_2630'>29:20 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your</a>
<a id='line_2631'>God.</a>
<a id='line_2632'></a>
<a id='line_2633'>And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and</a>
<a id='line_2634'>bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.</a>
<a id='line_2635'></a>
<a id='line_2636'>29:21 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt</a>
<a id='line_2637'>offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand</a>
<a id='line_2638'>bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink</a>
<a id='line_2639'>offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel: 29:22 And did</a>
<a id='line_2640'>eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And</a>
<a id='line_2641'>they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed</a>
<a id='line_2642'>him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.</a>
<a id='line_2643'></a>
<a id='line_2644'>29:23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of</a>
<a id='line_2645'>David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</a>
<a id='line_2646'></a>
<a id='line_2647'>29:24 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons</a>
<a id='line_2648'>likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.</a>
<a id='line_2649'></a>
<a id='line_2650'>29:25 And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all</a>
<a id='line_2651'>Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on</a>
<a id='line_2652'>any king before him in Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2653'></a>
<a id='line_2654'>29:26 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2655'></a>
<a id='line_2656'>29:27 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven</a>
<a id='line_2657'>years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in</a>
<a id='line_2658'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_2659'></a>
<a id='line_2660'>29:28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour:</a>
<a id='line_2661'>and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_2662'></a>
<a id='line_2663'>29:29 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are</a>
<a id='line_2664'>written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the</a>
<a id='line_2665'>prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer, 29:30 With all his reign and</a>

<a id='line_2679'>and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all</a>
<a id='line_2680'>Israel, the chief of the fathers.</a>
<a id='line_2681'></a>
<a id='line_2682'>1:3 So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high</a>
<a id='line_2683'>place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_2684'>congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in</a>
<a id='line_2685'>the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_2686'></a>
<a id='line_2687'>1:4 But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the</a>
<a id='line_2688'>place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for</a>
<a id='line_2689'>it at Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_2690'></a>
<a id='line_2691'>1:5 Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son</a>
<a id='line_2692'>of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and</a>
<a id='line_2693'>Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.</a>
<a id='line_2694'></a>
<a id='line_2695'>1:6 And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_2696'>which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a</a>
<a id='line_2697'>thousand burnt offerings upon it.</a>
<a id='line_2698'></a>
<a id='line_2699'>1:7 In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask</a>
<a id='line_2700'>what I shall give thee.</a>
<a id='line_2701'></a>
<a id='line_2702'>1:8 And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David</a>
<a id='line_2703'>my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_2704'></a>
<a id='line_2705'>1:9 Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be</a>
<a id='line_2706'>established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of</a>
<a id='line_2707'>the earth in multitude.</a>
<a id='line_2708'></a>
<a id='line_2709'>1:10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in</a>
<a id='line_2710'>before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so</a>
<a id='line_2711'>great?  1:11 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart,</a>
<a id='line_2712'>and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of</a>
<a id='line_2713'>thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom</a>
<a id='line_2714'>and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom</a>
<a id='line_2715'>I have made thee king: 1:12 Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee;</a>
<a id='line_2716'>and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of</a>
<a id='line_2717'>the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any</a>
<a id='line_2718'>after thee have the like.</a>
<a id='line_2719'></a>
<a id='line_2720'>1:13 Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at</a>
<a id='line_2721'>Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation,</a>
<a id='line_2722'>and reigned over Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2723'></a>
<a id='line_2724'>1:14 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand</a>
<a id='line_2725'>and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he</a>
<a id='line_2726'>placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_2727'></a>
<a id='line_2728'>1:15 And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as</a>
<a id='line_2729'>stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the</a>
<a id='line_2730'>vale for abundance.</a>
<a id='line_2731'></a>
<a id='line_2732'>1:16 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the</a>
<a id='line_2733'>king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</a>
<a id='line_2734'></a>
<a id='line_2735'>1:17 And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for</a>
<a id='line_2736'>six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty:</a>
<a id='line_2737'>and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and</a>
<a id='line_2738'>for the kings of Syria, by their means.</a>
<a id='line_2739'></a>
<a id='line_2740'>2:1 And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_2741'>and an house for his kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_2742'></a>
<a id='line_2743'>2:2 And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear</a>
<a id='line_2744'>burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three</a>
<a id='line_2745'>thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</a>
<a id='line_2746'></a>
<a id='line_2747'>2:3 And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst</a>
<a id='line_2748'>deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an</a>
<a id='line_2749'>house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.</a>
<a id='line_2750'></a>
<a id='line_2751'>2:4 Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to</a>
<a id='line_2752'>dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the</a>
<a id='line_2753'>continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening,</a>
<a id='line_2754'>on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the</a>
<a id='line_2755'>LORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2756'></a>
<a id='line_2757'>2:5 And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above</a>
<a id='line_2758'>all gods.</a>
<a id='line_2759'></a>
<a id='line_2760'>2:6 But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and</a>
<a id='line_2761'>heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should</a>
<a id='line_2762'>build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?  2:7 Send</a>
<a id='line_2763'>me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in</a>
<a id='line_2764'>brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can</a>
<a id='line_2765'>skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in</a>
<a id='line_2766'>Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.</a>
<a id='line_2767'></a>
<a id='line_2768'>2:8 Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of</a>
<a id='line_2769'>Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in</a>
<a id='line_2770'>Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants, 2:9 Even</a>
<a id='line_2771'>to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to</a>
<a id='line_2772'>build shall be wonderful great.</a>
<a id='line_2773'></a>
<a id='line_2774'>2:10 And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut</a>
<a id='line_2775'>timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand</a>
<a id='line_2776'>measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty</a>
<a id='line_2777'>thousand baths of oil.</a>
<a id='line_2778'></a>
<a id='line_2779'>2:11 Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to</a>
<a id='line_2780'>Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee</a>
<a id='line_2781'>king over them.</a>
<a id='line_2782'></a>
<a id='line_2783'>2:12 Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made</a>
<a id='line_2784'>heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued</a>
<a id='line_2785'>with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the</a>
<a id='line_2786'>LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_2787'></a>
<a id='line_2788'>2:13 And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of</a>
<a id='line_2789'>Huram my father’s, 2:14 The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan,</a>
<a id='line_2790'>and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in</a>
<a id='line_2791'>silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in</a>
<a id='line_2792'>blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of</a>
<a id='line_2793'>graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with</a>
<a id='line_2794'>thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.</a>
<a id='line_2795'></a>
<a id='line_2796'>2:15 Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine,</a>
<a id='line_2797'>which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants: 2:16 And</a>
<a id='line_2798'>we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we</a>
<a id='line_2799'>will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry</a>
<a id='line_2800'>it up to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_2801'></a>
<a id='line_2802'>2:17 And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of</a>
<a id='line_2803'>Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered</a>
<a id='line_2804'>them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three</a>
<a id='line_2805'>thousand and six hundred.</a>
<a id='line_2806'></a>
<a id='line_2807'>2:18 And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of</a>
<a id='line_2808'>burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and</a>
<a id='line_2809'>three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.</a>
<a id='line_2810'></a>
<a id='line_2811'>3:1 Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in</a>
<a id='line_2812'>mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father, in the</a>
<a id='line_2813'>place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the</a>
<a id='line_2814'>Jebusite.</a>
<a id='line_2815'></a>
<a id='line_2816'>3:2 And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in</a>
<a id='line_2817'>the fourth year of his reign.</a>
<a id='line_2818'></a>
<a id='line_2819'>3:3 Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the</a>
<a id='line_2820'>building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first</a>
<a id='line_2821'>measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</a>
<a id='line_2822'></a>
<a id='line_2823'>3:4 And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it</a>
<a id='line_2824'>was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the</a>
<a id='line_2825'>height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure</a>
<a id='line_2826'>gold.</a>
<a id='line_2827'></a>
<a id='line_2828'>3:5 And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid</a>
<a id='line_2829'>with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.</a>
<a id='line_2830'></a>
<a id='line_2831'>3:6 And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and</a>
<a id='line_2832'>the gold was gold of Parvaim.</a>
<a id='line_2833'></a>
<a id='line_2834'>3:7 He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls</a>
<a id='line_2835'>thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the</a>
<a id='line_2836'>walls.</a>
<a id='line_2837'></a>
<a id='line_2838'>3:8 And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according</a>
<a id='line_2839'>to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof</a>
<a id='line_2840'>twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six</a>
<a id='line_2841'>hundred talents.</a>
<a id='line_2842'></a>
<a id='line_2843'>3:9 And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he</a>
<a id='line_2844'>overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</a>
<a id='line_2845'></a>
<a id='line_2846'>3:10 And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work,</a>
<a id='line_2847'>and overlaid them with gold.</a>
<a id='line_2848'></a>
<a id='line_2849'>3:11 And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing</a>
<a id='line_2850'>of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house:</a>
<a id='line_2851'>and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of</a>
<a id='line_2852'>the other cherub.</a>
<a id='line_2853'></a>
<a id='line_2854'>3:12 And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the</a>
<a id='line_2855'>wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to</a>
<a id='line_2856'>the wing of the other cherub.</a>
<a id='line_2857'></a>
<a id='line_2858'>3:13 The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty</a>
<a id='line_2859'>cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.</a>
<a id='line_2860'></a>
<a id='line_2861'>3:14 And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine</a>
<a id='line_2862'>linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.</a>
<a id='line_2863'></a>
<a id='line_2864'>3:15 Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five</a>
<a id='line_2865'>cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was</a>
<a id='line_2866'>five cubits.</a>
<a id='line_2867'></a>
<a id='line_2868'>3:16 And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads</a>
<a id='line_2869'>of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the</a>
<a id='line_2870'>chains.</a>
<a id='line_2871'></a>
<a id='line_2872'>3:17 And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right</a>
<a id='line_2873'>hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the</a>
<a id='line_2874'>right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</a>
<a id='line_2875'></a>
<a id='line_2876'>4:1 Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length</a>
<a id='line_2877'>thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the</a>
<a id='line_2878'>height thereof.</a>
<a id='line_2879'></a>
<a id='line_2880'>4:2 Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round</a>
<a id='line_2881'>in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty</a>
<a id='line_2882'>cubits did compass it round about.</a>
<a id='line_2883'></a>
<a id='line_2884'>4:3 And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it</a>
<a id='line_2885'>round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows</a>
<a id='line_2886'>of oxen were cast, when it was cast.</a>
<a id='line_2887'></a>
<a id='line_2888'>4:4 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and</a>
<a id='line_2889'>three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and</a>
<a id='line_2890'>three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them,</a>
<a id='line_2891'>and all their hinder parts were inward.</a>
<a id='line_2892'></a>
<a id='line_2893'>4:5 And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it</a>
<a id='line_2894'>like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it</a>
<a id='line_2895'>received and held three thousand baths.</a>
<a id='line_2896'></a>
<a id='line_2897'>4:6 He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five</a>
<a id='line_2898'>on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the</a>
<a id='line_2899'>burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to</a>
<a id='line_2900'>wash in.</a>
<a id='line_2901'></a>
<a id='line_2902'>4:7 And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and</a>
<a id='line_2903'>set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</a>
<a id='line_2904'></a>
<a id='line_2905'>4:8 He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on</a>
<a id='line_2906'>the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of</a>
<a id='line_2907'>gold.</a>
<a id='line_2908'></a>
<a id='line_2909'>4:9 Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court,</a>
<a id='line_2910'>and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.</a>
<a id='line_2911'></a>
<a id='line_2912'>4:10 And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over</a>
<a id='line_2913'>against the south.</a>
<a id='line_2914'></a>
<a id='line_2915'>4:11 And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And</a>
<a id='line_2916'>Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the</a>
<a id='line_2917'>house of God; 4:12 To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the</a>
<a id='line_2918'>chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two</a>
<a id='line_2919'>wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the</a>
<a id='line_2920'>top of the pillars; 4:13 And four hundred pomegranates on the two</a>
<a id='line_2921'>wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two</a>
<a id='line_2922'>pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars.</a>
<a id='line_2923'></a>
<a id='line_2924'>4:14 He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases; 4:15 One</a>
<a id='line_2925'>sea, and twelve oxen under it.</a>
<a id='line_2926'></a>
<a id='line_2927'>4:16 The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their</a>
<a id='line_2928'>instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house</a>
<a id='line_2929'>of the LORD of bright brass.</a>
<a id='line_2930'></a>
<a id='line_2931'>4:17 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground</a>
<a id='line_2932'>between Succoth and Zeredathah.</a>
<a id='line_2933'></a>
<a id='line_2934'>4:18 Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the</a>
<a id='line_2935'>weight of the brass could not be found out.</a>
<a id='line_2936'></a>
<a id='line_2937'>4:19 And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God,</a>
<a id='line_2938'>the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set;</a>
<a id='line_2939'>4:20 Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn</a>
<a id='line_2940'>after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold; 4:21 And the</a>
<a id='line_2941'>flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and that</a>
<a id='line_2942'>perfect gold; 4:22 And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons,</a>
<a id='line_2943'>and the censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner</a>
<a id='line_2944'>doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of</a>
<a id='line_2945'>the temple, were of gold.</a>
<a id='line_2946'></a>
<a id='line_2947'>5:1 Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was</a>
<a id='line_2948'>finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father</a>
<a id='line_2949'>had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments,</a>
<a id='line_2950'>put he among the treasures of the house of God.</a>
<a id='line_2951'></a>
<a id='line_2952'>5:2 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of</a>
<a id='line_2953'>the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto</a>
<a id='line_2954'>Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the</a>
<a id='line_2955'>city of David, which is Zion.</a>
<a id='line_2956'></a>
<a id='line_2957'>5:3 Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king</a>
<a id='line_2958'>in the feast which was in the seventh month.</a>
<a id='line_2959'></a>
<a id='line_2960'>5:4 And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the</a>
<a id='line_2961'>ark.</a>
<a id='line_2962'></a>
<a id='line_2963'>5:5 And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_2964'>congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle,</a>
<a id='line_2965'>these did the priests and the Levites bring up.</a>
<a id='line_2966'></a>
<a id='line_2967'>5:6 Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were</a>
<a id='line_2968'>assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which</a>
<a id='line_2969'>could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</a>
<a id='line_2970'></a>
<a id='line_2971'>5:7 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2972'>unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place,</a>
<a id='line_2973'>even under the wings of the cherubims: 5:8 For the cherubims spread</a>
<a id='line_2974'>forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered</a>
<a id='line_2975'>the ark and the staves thereof above.</a>
<a id='line_2976'></a>
<a id='line_2977'>5:9 And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the</a>
<a id='line_2978'>staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not</a>
<a id='line_2979'>seen without. And there it is unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_2980'></a>
<a id='line_2981'>5:10 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put</a>
<a id='line_2982'>therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of</a>
<a id='line_2983'>Israel, when they came out of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_2984'></a>
<a id='line_2985'>5:11 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy</a>
<a id='line_2986'>place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did</a>
<a id='line_2987'>not then wait by course: 5:12 Also the Levites which were the singers,</a>
<a id='line_2988'>all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their</a>
<a id='line_2989'>brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries</a>
<a id='line_2990'>and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an</a>
<a id='line_2991'>hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:) 5:13 It came even</a>
<a id='line_2992'>to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound</a>
<a id='line_2993'>to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up</a>
<a id='line_2994'>their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick,</a>
<a id='line_2995'>and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth</a>
<a id='line_2996'>for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house</a>
<a id='line_2997'>of the LORD; 5:14 So that the priests could not stand to minister by</a>
<a id='line_2998'>reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of</a>
<a id='line_2999'>God.</a>
<a id='line_3000'></a>
<a id='line_3001'>6:1 Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the</a>
<a id='line_3002'>thick darkness.</a>
<a id='line_3003'></a>
<a id='line_3004'>6:2 But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for</a>
<a id='line_3005'>thy dwelling for ever.</a>
<a id='line_3006'></a>
<a id='line_3007'>6:3 And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation</a>
<a id='line_3008'>of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.</a>
<a id='line_3009'></a>
<a id='line_3010'>6:4 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his</a>
<a id='line_3011'>hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David,</a>
<a id='line_3012'>saying, 6:5 Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the</a>
<a id='line_3013'>land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build</a>
<a id='line_3014'>an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to</a>
<a id='line_3015'>be a ruler over my people Israel: 6:6 But I have chosen Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_3016'>that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my</a>
<a id='line_3017'>people Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3018'></a>
<a id='line_3019'>6:7 Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for</a>
<a id='line_3020'>the name of the LORD God of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3021'></a>
<a id='line_3022'>6:8 But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine</a>
<a id='line_3023'>heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in</a>
<a id='line_3024'>thine heart: 6:9 Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but</a>
<a id='line_3025'>thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the</a>
<a id='line_3026'>house for my name.</a>
<a id='line_3027'></a>
<a id='line_3028'>6:10 The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken:</a>
<a id='line_3029'>for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the</a>
<a id='line_3030'>throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for</a>
<a id='line_3031'>the name of the LORD God of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3032'></a>
<a id='line_3033'>6:11 And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the</a>
<a id='line_3034'>LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3035'></a>
<a id='line_3036'>6:12 And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all</a>
<a id='line_3037'>the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands: 6:13 For</a>
<a id='line_3038'>Solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long, and five</a>
<a id='line_3039'>cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of</a>
<a id='line_3040'>the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees</a>
<a id='line_3041'>before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands</a>
<a id='line_3042'>toward heaven.</a>
<a id='line_3043'></a>
<a id='line_3044'>6:14 And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the</a>
<a id='line_3045'>heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and shewest mercy</a>
<a id='line_3046'>unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts: 6:15</a>
<a id='line_3047'>Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou</a>
<a id='line_3048'>hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it</a>
<a id='line_3049'>with thine hand, as it is this day.</a>
<a id='line_3050'></a>
<a id='line_3051'>6:16 Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David</a>
<a id='line_3052'>my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not</a>
<a id='line_3053'>fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so</a>
<a id='line_3054'>that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou</a>
<a id='line_3055'>hast walked before me.</a>
<a id='line_3056'></a>
<a id='line_3057'>6:17 Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which</a>
<a id='line_3058'>thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.</a>
<a id='line_3059'></a>
<a id='line_3060'>6:18 But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold,</a>
<a id='line_3061'>heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less</a>
<a id='line_3062'>this house which I have built!  6:19 Have respect therefore to the</a>
<a id='line_3063'>prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to</a>
<a id='line_3064'>hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before</a>
<a id='line_3065'>thee: 6:20 That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night,</a>
<a id='line_3066'>upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name</a>
<a id='line_3067'>there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward</a>
<a id='line_3068'>this place.</a>
<a id='line_3069'></a>
<a id='line_3070'>6:21 Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of</a>
<a id='line_3071'>thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou</a>
<a id='line_3072'>from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest,</a>
<a id='line_3073'>forgive.</a>
<a id='line_3074'></a>
<a id='line_3075'>6:22 If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him</a>
<a id='line_3076'>to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;</a>

<a id='line_3079'>by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his</a>
<a id='line_3080'>righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_3081'></a>
<a id='line_3082'>6:24 And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy,</a>

<a id='line_3084'>thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;</a>
<a id='line_3085'>6:25 Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy</a>
<a id='line_3086'>people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to</a>

<a id='line_3088'></a>
<a id='line_3089'>6:26 When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they</a>

<a id='line_3092'>them; 6:27 Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy</a>
<a id='line_3093'>servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the</a>
<a id='line_3094'>good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which</a>
<a id='line_3095'>thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_3096'></a>
<a id='line_3097'>6:28 If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there</a>

<a id='line_3100'>whatsoever sickness there be: 6:29 Then what prayer or what</a>
<a id='line_3101'>supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people</a>
<a id='line_3102'>Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and</a>
<a id='line_3103'>shall spread forth his hands in this house: 6:30 Then hear thou from</a>
<a id='line_3104'>heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man</a>
<a id='line_3105'>according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only</a>
<a id='line_3106'>knowest the hearts of the children of men:) 6:31 That they may fear</a>
<a id='line_3107'>thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou</a>
<a id='line_3108'>gavest unto our fathers.</a>
<a id='line_3109'></a>
<a id='line_3110'>6:32 Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people</a>

<a id='line_3122'>Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication,</a>

<a id='line_3128'>near; 6:37 Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are</a>
<a id='line_3129'>carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their</a>
<a id='line_3130'>captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt</a>
<a id='line_3131'>wickedly; 6:38 If they return to thee with all their heart and with</a>
<a id='line_3132'>all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have</a>
<a id='line_3133'>carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest</a>
<a id='line_3134'>unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen, and</a>
<a id='line_3135'>toward the house which I have built for thy name: 6:39 Then hear thou</a>
<a id='line_3136'>from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their</a>
<a id='line_3137'>supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which</a>
<a id='line_3138'>have sinned against thee.</a>
<a id='line_3139'></a>
<a id='line_3140'>6:40 Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let</a>
<a id='line_3141'>thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.</a>
<a id='line_3142'></a>
<a id='line_3143'>6:41 Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou,</a>
<a id='line_3144'>and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed</a>
<a id='line_3145'>with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.</a>
<a id='line_3146'></a>
<a id='line_3147'>6:42 O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember</a>
<a id='line_3148'>the mercies of David thy servant.</a>
<a id='line_3149'></a>
<a id='line_3150'>7:1 Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down</a>
<a id='line_3151'>from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and</a>
<a id='line_3152'>the glory of the LORD filled the house.</a>
<a id='line_3153'></a>
<a id='line_3154'>7:2 And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_3155'>because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD’s house.</a>
<a id='line_3156'></a>
<a id='line_3157'>7:3 And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down,</a>
<a id='line_3158'>and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with</a>
<a id='line_3159'>their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and</a>
<a id='line_3160'>praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for</a>
<a id='line_3161'>ever.</a>
<a id='line_3162'></a>
<a id='line_3163'>7:4 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the</a>
<a id='line_3164'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3165'></a>
<a id='line_3166'>7:5 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand</a>
<a id='line_3167'>oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all</a>
<a id='line_3168'>the people dedicated the house of God.</a>
<a id='line_3169'></a>
<a id='line_3170'>7:6 And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with</a>
<a id='line_3171'>instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to</a>
<a id='line_3172'>praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David</a>
<a id='line_3173'>praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before</a>
<a id='line_3174'>them, and all Israel stood.</a>
<a id='line_3175'></a>
<a id='line_3176'>7:7 Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before</a>
<a id='line_3177'>the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the</a>
<a id='line_3178'>fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had</a>
<a id='line_3179'>made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat</a>
<a id='line_3180'>offerings, and the fat.</a>
<a id='line_3181'></a>
<a id='line_3182'>7:8 Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all</a>
<a id='line_3183'>Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of</a>
<a id='line_3184'>Hamath unto the river of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_3185'></a>
<a id='line_3186'>7:9 And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept</a>
<a id='line_3187'>the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.</a>
<a id='line_3188'></a>
<a id='line_3189'>7:10 And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent</a>
<a id='line_3190'>the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the</a>
<a id='line_3191'>goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to</a>
<a id='line_3192'>Israel his people.</a>
<a id='line_3193'></a>
<a id='line_3194'>7:11 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king’s</a>
<a id='line_3195'>house: and all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the house of</a>
<a id='line_3196'>the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.</a>
<a id='line_3197'></a>
<a id='line_3198'>7:12 And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I</a>
<a id='line_3199'>have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an</a>
<a id='line_3200'>house of sacrifice.</a>
<a id='line_3201'></a>
<a id='line_3202'>7:13 If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the</a>
<a id='line_3203'>locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;</a>
<a id='line_3204'>7:14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble</a>
<a id='line_3205'>themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked</a>
<a id='line_3206'>ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and</a>
<a id='line_3207'>will heal their land.</a>
<a id='line_3208'></a>
<a id='line_3209'>7:15 Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer</a>
<a id='line_3210'>that is made in this place.</a>
<a id='line_3211'></a>
<a id='line_3212'>7:16 For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may</a>
<a id='line_3213'>be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there</a>
<a id='line_3214'>perpetually.</a>
<a id='line_3215'></a>
<a id='line_3216'>7:17 And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father</a>
<a id='line_3217'>walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt</a>
<a id='line_3218'>observe my statutes and my judgments; 7:18 Then will I stablish the</a>
<a id='line_3219'>throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy</a>
<a id='line_3220'>father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3221'></a>
<a id='line_3222'>7:19 But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments,</a>
<a id='line_3223'>which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and</a>
<a id='line_3224'>worship them; 7:20 Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my</a>
<a id='line_3225'>land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified</a>
<a id='line_3226'>for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a</a>
<a id='line_3227'>proverb and a byword among all nations.</a>
<a id='line_3228'></a>
<a id='line_3229'>7:21 And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every</a>
<a id='line_3230'>one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done</a>
<a id='line_3231'>thus unto this land, and unto this house?  7:22 And it shall be</a>
<a id='line_3232'>answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which</a>
<a id='line_3233'>brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other</a>
<a id='line_3234'>gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought</a>
<a id='line_3235'>all this evil upon them.</a>
<a id='line_3236'></a>
<a id='line_3237'>8:1 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon</a>
<a id='line_3238'>had built the house of the LORD, and his own house, 8:2 That the</a>
<a id='line_3239'>cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and</a>
<a id='line_3240'>caused the children of Israel to dwell there.</a>
<a id='line_3241'></a>
<a id='line_3242'>8:3 And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.</a>
<a id='line_3243'></a>
<a id='line_3244'>8:4 And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities,</a>
<a id='line_3245'>which he built in Hamath.</a>
<a id='line_3246'></a>
<a id='line_3247'>8:5 Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether,</a>
<a id='line_3248'>fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars; 8:6 And Baalath, and all</a>
<a id='line_3249'>the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the</a>
<a id='line_3250'>cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in</a>
<a id='line_3251'>Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his</a>
<a id='line_3252'>dominion.</a>
<a id='line_3253'></a>
<a id='line_3254'>8:7 As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the</a>
<a id='line_3255'>Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites,</a>
<a id='line_3256'>which were not of Israel, 8:8 But of their children, who were left</a>
<a id='line_3257'>after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them</a>
<a id='line_3258'>did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day.</a>
<a id='line_3259'></a>
<a id='line_3260'>8:9 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his</a>
<a id='line_3261'>work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and</a>
<a id='line_3262'>captains of his chariots and horsemen.</a>
<a id='line_3263'></a>
<a id='line_3264'>8:10 And these were the chief of king Solomon’s officers, even two</a>
<a id='line_3265'>hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.</a>
<a id='line_3266'></a>
<a id='line_3267'>8:11 And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of</a>
<a id='line_3268'>David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife</a>
<a id='line_3269'>shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the</a>
<a id='line_3270'>places are holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come.</a>
<a id='line_3271'></a>
<a id='line_3272'>8:12 Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar</a>
<a id='line_3273'>of the LORD, which he had built before the porch, 8:13 Even after a</a>
<a id='line_3274'>certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of</a>
<a id='line_3275'>Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn</a>
<a id='line_3276'>feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened</a>
<a id='line_3277'>bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.</a>
<a id='line_3278'></a>
<a id='line_3279'>8:14 And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the</a>
<a id='line_3280'>courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their</a>
<a id='line_3281'>charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of</a>
<a id='line_3282'>every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate:</a>
<a id='line_3283'>for so had David the man of God commanded.</a>
<a id='line_3284'></a>
<a id='line_3285'>8:15 And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the</a>
<a id='line_3286'>priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the</a>
<a id='line_3287'>treasures.</a>
<a id='line_3288'></a>
<a id='line_3289'>8:16 Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the</a>
<a id='line_3290'>foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the</a>
<a id='line_3291'>house of the LORD was perfected.</a>
<a id='line_3292'></a>
<a id='line_3293'>8:17 Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in</a>
<a id='line_3294'>the land of Edom.</a>
<a id='line_3295'></a>
<a id='line_3296'>8:18 And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and</a>
<a id='line_3297'>servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the</a>
<a id='line_3298'>servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty</a>
<a id='line_3299'>talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.</a>
<a id='line_3300'></a>
<a id='line_3301'>9:1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came</a>
<a id='line_3302'>to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great</a>
<a id='line_3303'>company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and</a>
<a id='line_3304'>precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with</a>
<a id='line_3305'>him of all that was in her heart.</a>
<a id='line_3306'></a>
<a id='line_3307'>9:2 And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid</a>
<a id='line_3308'>from Solomon which he told her not.</a>
<a id='line_3309'></a>
<a id='line_3310'>9:3 And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and</a>
<a id='line_3311'>the house that he had built, 9:4 And the meat of his table, and the</a>
<a id='line_3312'>sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and</a>
<a id='line_3313'>their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent</a>
<a id='line_3314'>by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more</a>
<a id='line_3315'>spirit in her.</a>
<a id='line_3316'></a>
<a id='line_3317'>9:5 And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in</a>
<a id='line_3318'>mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom: 9:6 Howbeit I believed</a>
<a id='line_3319'>not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold,</a>
<a id='line_3320'>the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou</a>
<a id='line_3321'>exceedest the fame that I heard.</a>
<a id='line_3322'></a>
<a id='line_3323'>9:7 Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand</a>
<a id='line_3324'>continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.</a>
<a id='line_3325'></a>
<a id='line_3326'>9:8 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee</a>
<a id='line_3327'>on his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved</a>
<a id='line_3328'>Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over</a>
<a id='line_3329'>them, to do judgment and justice.</a>
<a id='line_3330'></a>
<a id='line_3331'>9:9 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and</a>
<a id='line_3332'>of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any</a>
<a id='line_3333'>such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.</a>
<a id='line_3334'></a>
<a id='line_3335'>9:10 And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon,</a>
<a id='line_3336'>which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious</a>
<a id='line_3337'>stones.</a>
<a id='line_3338'></a>
<a id='line_3339'>9:11 And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the</a>
<a id='line_3340'>LORD, and to the king’s palace, and harps and psalteries for singers:</a>
<a id='line_3341'>and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_3342'></a>
<a id='line_3343'>9:12 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,</a>
<a id='line_3344'>whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king.</a>
<a id='line_3345'>So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.</a>
<a id='line_3346'></a>
<a id='line_3347'>9:13 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six</a>
<a id='line_3348'>hundred and threescore and six talents of gold; 9:14 Beside that which</a>
<a id='line_3349'>chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and</a>
<a id='line_3350'>governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.</a>
<a id='line_3351'></a>
<a id='line_3352'>9:15 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six</a>
<a id='line_3353'>hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.</a>
<a id='line_3354'></a>
<a id='line_3355'>9:16 And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred</a>
<a id='line_3356'>shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house</a>
<a id='line_3357'>of the forest of Lebanon.</a>
<a id='line_3358'></a>
<a id='line_3359'>9:17 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it</a>
<a id='line_3360'>with pure gold.</a>
<a id='line_3361'></a>
<a id='line_3362'>9:18 And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold,</a>
<a id='line_3363'>which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the</a>
<a id='line_3364'>sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays: 9:19 And twelve</a>
<a id='line_3365'>lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps.</a>
<a id='line_3366'>There was not the like made in any kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_3367'></a>
<a id='line_3368'>9:20 And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and</a>
<a id='line_3369'>all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure</a>
<a id='line_3370'>gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted of in the</a>
<a id='line_3371'>days of Solomon.</a>
<a id='line_3372'></a>
<a id='line_3373'>9:21 For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram:</a>
<a id='line_3374'>every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and</a>
<a id='line_3375'>silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</a>
<a id='line_3376'></a>
<a id='line_3377'>9:22 And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and</a>
<a id='line_3378'>wisdom.</a>
<a id='line_3379'></a>
<a id='line_3380'>9:23 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to</a>
<a id='line_3381'>hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.</a>
<a id='line_3382'></a>
<a id='line_3383'>9:24 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and</a>
<a id='line_3384'>vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules,</a>
<a id='line_3385'>a rate year by year.</a>
<a id='line_3386'></a>
<a id='line_3387'>9:25 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and</a>
<a id='line_3388'>twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and</a>
<a id='line_3389'>with the king at Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_3390'></a>
<a id='line_3391'>9:26 And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the</a>
<a id='line_3392'>land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_3393'></a>
<a id='line_3394'>9:27 And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees</a>
<a id='line_3395'>made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance.</a>
<a id='line_3396'></a>
<a id='line_3397'>9:28 And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all</a>
<a id='line_3398'>lands.</a>
<a id='line_3399'></a>
<a id='line_3400'>9:29 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not</a>
<a id='line_3401'>written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of</a>
<a id='line_3402'>Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against</a>
<a id='line_3403'>Jeroboam the son of Nebat?  9:30 And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over</a>
<a id='line_3404'>all Israel forty years.</a>
<a id='line_3405'></a>
<a id='line_3406'>9:31 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city</a>
<a id='line_3407'>of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_3408'></a>
<a id='line_3409'>10:1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come</a>
<a id='line_3410'>to make him king.</a>
<a id='line_3411'></a>
<a id='line_3412'>10:2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in</a>
<a id='line_3413'>Egypt, whither he fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard</a>
<a id='line_3414'>it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_3415'></a>
<a id='line_3416'>10:3 And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and</a>
<a id='line_3417'>spake to Rehoboam, saying, 10:4 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now</a>
<a id='line_3418'>therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and</a>
<a id='line_3419'>his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.</a>
<a id='line_3420'></a>
<a id='line_3421'>10:5 And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And</a>
<a id='line_3422'>the people departed.</a>
<a id='line_3423'></a>
<a id='line_3424'>10:6 And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood</a>
<a id='line_3425'>before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel</a>
<a id='line_3426'>give ye me to return answer to this people?  10:7 And they spake unto</a>
<a id='line_3427'>him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and</a>
<a id='line_3428'>speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.</a>
<a id='line_3429'></a>
<a id='line_3430'>10:8 But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took</a>
<a id='line_3431'>counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood</a>
<a id='line_3432'>before him.</a>
<a id='line_3433'></a>
<a id='line_3434'>10:9 And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return</a>
<a id='line_3435'>answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat</a>
<a id='line_3436'>the yoke that thy father did put upon us?  10:10 And the young men</a>
<a id='line_3437'>that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou</a>
<a id='line_3438'>answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our</a>
<a id='line_3439'>yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou</a>
<a id='line_3440'>say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father’s</a>
<a id='line_3441'>loins.</a>
<a id='line_3442'></a>
<a id='line_3443'>10:11 For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more</a>
<a id='line_3444'>to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise</a>
<a id='line_3445'>you with scorpions.</a>
<a id='line_3446'></a>
<a id='line_3447'>10:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third</a>
<a id='line_3448'>day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.</a>
<a id='line_3449'></a>
<a id='line_3450'>10:13 And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook</a>
<a id='line_3451'>the counsel of the old men, 10:14 And answered them after the advice</a>
<a id='line_3452'>of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will</a>
<a id='line_3453'>add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise</a>
<a id='line_3454'>you with scorpions.</a>
<a id='line_3455'></a>
<a id='line_3456'>10:15 So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of</a>
<a id='line_3457'>God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand</a>
<a id='line_3458'>of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</a>
<a id='line_3459'></a>
<a id='line_3460'>10:16 And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto</a>
<a id='line_3461'>them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in</a>
<a id='line_3462'>David?  and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to</a>
<a id='line_3463'>your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to thine own house. So all</a>
<a id='line_3464'>Israel went to their tents.</a>
<a id='line_3465'></a>
<a id='line_3466'>10:17 But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of</a>
<a id='line_3467'>Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</a>
<a id='line_3468'></a>
<a id='line_3469'>10:18 Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and</a>
<a id='line_3470'>the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king</a>
<a id='line_3471'>Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to</a>
<a id='line_3472'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_3473'></a>
<a id='line_3474'>10:19 And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_3475'></a>
<a id='line_3476'>11:1 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house</a>
<a id='line_3477'>of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men,</a>
<a id='line_3478'>which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the</a>
<a id='line_3479'>kingdom again to Rehoboam.</a>
<a id='line_3480'></a>
<a id='line_3481'>11:2 But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</a>
<a id='line_3482'>11:3 Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all</a>
<a id='line_3483'>Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying, 11:4 Thus saith the LORD, Ye</a>
<a id='line_3484'>shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to</a>
<a id='line_3485'>his house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of</a>
<a id='line_3486'>the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.</a>
<a id='line_3487'></a>
<a id='line_3488'>11:5 And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in</a>
<a id='line_3489'>Judah.</a>
<a id='line_3490'></a>
<a id='line_3491'>11:6 He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa, 11:7 And Bethzur,</a>
<a id='line_3492'>and Shoco, and Adullam, 11:8 And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph, 11:9</a>
<a id='line_3493'>And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah, 11:10 And Zorah, and Aijalon,</a>
<a id='line_3494'>and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities.</a>
<a id='line_3495'></a>
<a id='line_3496'>11:11 And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and</a>
<a id='line_3497'>store of victual, and of oil and wine.</a>
<a id='line_3498'></a>
<a id='line_3499'>11:12 And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made</a>
<a id='line_3500'>them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.</a>
<a id='line_3501'></a>
<a id='line_3502'>11:13 And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted</a>
<a id='line_3503'>to him out of all their coasts.</a>
<a id='line_3504'></a>
<a id='line_3505'>11:14 For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and</a>
<a id='line_3506'>came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them</a>
<a id='line_3507'>off from executing the priest’s office unto the LORD: 11:15 And he</a>
<a id='line_3508'>ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for</a>
<a id='line_3509'>the calves which he had made.</a>
<a id='line_3510'></a>
<a id='line_3511'>11:16 And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their</a>
<a id='line_3512'>hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice</a>
<a id='line_3513'>unto the LORD God of their fathers.</a>
<a id='line_3514'></a>
<a id='line_3515'>11:17 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the</a>
<a id='line_3516'>son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the</a>
<a id='line_3517'>way of David and Solomon.</a>
<a id='line_3518'></a>
<a id='line_3519'>11:18 And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son</a>
<a id='line_3520'>of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;</a>
<a id='line_3521'>11:19 Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.</a>
<a id='line_3522'></a>
<a id='line_3523'>11:20 And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which</a>
<a id='line_3524'>bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.</a>
<a id='line_3525'></a>
<a id='line_3526'>11:21 And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his</a>
<a id='line_3527'>wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore</a>
<a id='line_3528'>concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore</a>
<a id='line_3529'>daughters.)  11:22 And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the</a>
<a id='line_3530'>chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him</a>
<a id='line_3531'>king.</a>
<a id='line_3532'></a>
<a id='line_3533'>11:23 And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children</a>
<a id='line_3534'>throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced</a>
<a id='line_3535'>city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many</a>
<a id='line_3536'>wives.</a>
<a id='line_3537'></a>
<a id='line_3538'>12:1 And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom,</a>
<a id='line_3539'>and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all</a>
<a id='line_3540'>Israel with him.</a>
<a id='line_3541'></a>
<a id='line_3542'>12:2 And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam</a>
<a id='line_3543'>Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had</a>
<a id='line_3544'>transgressed against the LORD, 12:3 With twelve hundred chariots, and</a>
<a id='line_3545'>threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that</a>
<a id='line_3546'>came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the</a>
<a id='line_3547'>Ethiopians.</a>
<a id='line_3548'></a>
<a id='line_3549'>12:4 And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came</a>
<a id='line_3550'>to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_3551'></a>
<a id='line_3552'>12:5 Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of</a>
<a id='line_3553'>Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak,</a>
<a id='line_3554'>and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and</a>
<a id='line_3555'>therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.</a>
<a id='line_3556'></a>
<a id='line_3557'>12:6 Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves;</a>
<a id='line_3558'>and they said, The LORD is righteous.</a>
<a id='line_3559'></a>
<a id='line_3560'>12:7 And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of</a>
<a id='line_3561'>the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves;</a>
<a id='line_3562'>therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some</a>
<a id='line_3563'>deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by</a>
<a id='line_3564'>the hand of Shishak.</a>
<a id='line_3565'></a>
<a id='line_3566'>12:8 Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my</a>
<a id='line_3567'>service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.</a>
<a id='line_3568'></a>
<a id='line_3569'>12:9 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away</a>
<a id='line_3570'>the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the</a>
<a id='line_3571'>king’s house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold</a>
<a id='line_3572'>which Solomon had made.</a>
<a id='line_3573'></a>
<a id='line_3574'>12:10 Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and</a>
<a id='line_3575'>committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the</a>
<a id='line_3576'>entrance of the king’s house.</a>
<a id='line_3577'></a>
<a id='line_3578'>12:11 And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard</a>
<a id='line_3579'>came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.</a>
<a id='line_3580'></a>
<a id='line_3581'>12:12 And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from</a>
<a id='line_3582'>him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah</a>
<a id='line_3583'>things went well.</a>
<a id='line_3584'></a>
<a id='line_3585'>12:13 So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned:</a>
<a id='line_3586'>for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and</a>
<a id='line_3587'>he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had</a>
<a id='line_3588'>chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his</a>
<a id='line_3589'>mother’s name was Naamah an Ammonitess.</a>
<a id='line_3590'></a>
<a id='line_3591'>12:14 And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the</a>
<a id='line_3592'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3593'></a>
<a id='line_3594'>12:15 Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written</a>
<a id='line_3595'>in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning</a>
<a id='line_3596'>genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam</a>
<a id='line_3597'>continually.</a>
<a id='line_3598'></a>
<a id='line_3599'>12:16 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city</a>
<a id='line_3600'>of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_3601'></a>
<a id='line_3602'>13:1 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign</a>
<a id='line_3603'>over Judah.</a>
<a id='line_3604'></a>
<a id='line_3605'>13:2 He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was</a>
<a id='line_3606'>Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between</a>
<a id='line_3607'>Abijah and Jeroboam.</a>
<a id='line_3608'></a>
<a id='line_3609'>13:3 And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of</a>
<a id='line_3610'>war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the</a>
<a id='line_3611'>battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men,</a>
<a id='line_3612'>being mighty men of valour.</a>
<a id='line_3613'></a>
<a id='line_3614'>13:4 And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount</a>
<a id='line_3615'>Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel; 13:5 Ought</a>
<a id='line_3616'>ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over</a>
<a id='line_3617'>Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of</a>
<a id='line_3618'>salt?  13:6 Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the</a>
<a id='line_3619'>son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.</a>
<a id='line_3620'></a>
<a id='line_3621'>13:7 And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial,</a>
<a id='line_3622'>and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon,</a>
<a id='line_3623'>when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand</a>
<a id='line_3624'>them.</a>
<a id='line_3625'></a>
<a id='line_3626'>13:8 And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand</a>
<a id='line_3627'>of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with</a>
<a id='line_3628'>your golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.</a>
<a id='line_3629'></a>
<a id='line_3630'>13:9 Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron,</a>
<a id='line_3631'>and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the</a>
<a id='line_3632'>nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself</a>
<a id='line_3633'>with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them</a>
<a id='line_3634'>that are no gods.</a>
<a id='line_3635'></a>
<a id='line_3636'>13:10 But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken</a>
<a id='line_3637'>him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of</a>
<a id='line_3638'>Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business: 13:11 And they burn</a>
<a id='line_3639'>unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and</a>
<a id='line_3640'>sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure</a>
<a id='line_3641'>table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn</a>
<a id='line_3642'>every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have</a>
<a id='line_3643'>forsaken him.</a>
<a id='line_3644'></a>
<a id='line_3645'>13:12 And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his</a>
<a id='line_3646'>priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of</a>
<a id='line_3647'>Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye</a>
<a id='line_3648'>shall not prosper.</a>
<a id='line_3649'></a>
<a id='line_3650'>13:13 But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so</a>
<a id='line_3651'>they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.</a>
<a id='line_3652'></a>
<a id='line_3653'>13:14 And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and</a>
<a id='line_3654'>behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the</a>
<a id='line_3655'>trumpets.</a>
<a id='line_3656'></a>
<a id='line_3657'>13:15 Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah</a>
<a id='line_3658'>shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel</a>
<a id='line_3659'>before Abijah and Judah.</a>
<a id='line_3660'></a>
<a id='line_3661'>13:16 And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered</a>
<a id='line_3662'>them into their hand.</a>
<a id='line_3663'></a>
<a id='line_3664'>13:17 And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so</a>
<a id='line_3665'>there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.</a>
<a id='line_3666'></a>
<a id='line_3667'>13:18 Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and</a>
<a id='line_3668'>the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God</a>
<a id='line_3669'>of their fathers.</a>
<a id='line_3670'></a>
<a id='line_3671'>13:19 And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him,</a>
<a id='line_3672'>Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof,</a>
<a id='line_3673'>and Ephraim with the towns thereof.</a>
<a id='line_3674'></a>
<a id='line_3675'>13:20 Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of</a>
<a id='line_3676'>Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.</a>
<a id='line_3677'></a>
<a id='line_3678'>13:21 But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat</a>
<a id='line_3679'>twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.</a>
<a id='line_3680'></a>
<a id='line_3681'>13:22 And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his</a>
<a id='line_3682'>sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.</a>
<a id='line_3683'></a>
<a id='line_3684'>14:1 So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city</a>
<a id='line_3685'>of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land</a>
<a id='line_3686'>was quiet ten years.</a>
<a id='line_3687'></a>
<a id='line_3688'>14:2 And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3689'>his God: 14:3 For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the</a>
<a id='line_3690'>high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves: 14:4</a>
<a id='line_3691'>And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do</a>
<a id='line_3692'>the law and the commandment.</a>
<a id='line_3693'></a>
<a id='line_3694'>14:5 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places</a>
<a id='line_3695'>and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</a>
<a id='line_3696'></a>
<a id='line_3697'>14:6 And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and</a>
<a id='line_3698'>he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</a>
<a id='line_3699'></a>
<a id='line_3700'>14:7 Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make</a>
<a id='line_3701'>about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet</a>
<a id='line_3702'>before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought</a>
<a id='line_3703'>him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and</a>
<a id='line_3704'>prospered.</a>
<a id='line_3705'></a>
<a id='line_3706'>14:8 And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of</a>
<a id='line_3707'>Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields</a>
<a id='line_3708'>and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were</a>
<a id='line_3709'>mighty men of valour.</a>
<a id='line_3710'></a>
<a id='line_3711'>14:9 And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host</a>
<a id='line_3712'>of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto</a>
<a id='line_3713'>Mareshah.</a>
<a id='line_3714'></a>
<a id='line_3715'>14:10 Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array</a>
<a id='line_3716'>in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</a>
<a id='line_3717'></a>
<a id='line_3718'>14:11 And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is</a>
<a id='line_3719'>nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have</a>
<a id='line_3720'>no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy</a>
<a id='line_3721'>name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let no</a>
<a id='line_3722'>man prevail against thee.</a>
<a id='line_3723'></a>
<a id='line_3724'>14:12 So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah;</a>
<a id='line_3725'>and the Ethiopians fled.</a>
<a id='line_3726'></a>
<a id='line_3727'>14:13 And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto</a>
<a id='line_3728'>Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover</a>
<a id='line_3729'>themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his</a>
<a id='line_3730'>host; and they carried away very much spoil.</a>
<a id='line_3731'></a>
<a id='line_3732'>14:14 And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of</a>
<a id='line_3733'>the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there</a>
<a id='line_3734'>was exceeding much spoil in them.</a>
<a id='line_3735'></a>
<a id='line_3736'>14:15 They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and</a>
<a id='line_3737'>camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_3738'></a>
<a id='line_3739'>15:1 And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded: 15:2 And</a>
<a id='line_3740'>he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all</a>
<a id='line_3741'>Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if</a>
<a id='line_3742'>ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will</a>
<a id='line_3743'>forsake you.</a>
<a id='line_3744'></a>
<a id='line_3745'>15:3 Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and</a>
<a id='line_3746'>without a teaching priest, and without law.</a>
<a id='line_3747'></a>
<a id='line_3748'>15:4 But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of</a>
<a id='line_3749'>Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.</a>
<a id='line_3750'></a>
<a id='line_3751'>15:5 And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor</a>
<a id='line_3752'>to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants</a>
<a id='line_3753'>of the countries.</a>
<a id='line_3754'></a>
<a id='line_3755'>15:6 And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did</a>
<a id='line_3756'>vex them with all adversity.</a>
<a id='line_3757'></a>
<a id='line_3758'>15:7 Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your</a>
<a id='line_3759'>work shall be rewarded.</a>
<a id='line_3760'></a>
<a id='line_3761'>15:8 And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the</a>
<a id='line_3762'>prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all</a>
<a id='line_3763'>the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had</a>
<a id='line_3764'>taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was</a>
<a id='line_3765'>before the porch of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3766'></a>
<a id='line_3767'>15:9 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with</a>
<a id='line_3768'>them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to</a>
<a id='line_3769'>him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God</a>
<a id='line_3770'>was with him.</a>
<a id='line_3771'></a>
<a id='line_3772'>15:10 So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third</a>
<a id='line_3773'>month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.</a>
<a id='line_3774'></a>
<a id='line_3775'>15:11 And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which</a>
<a id='line_3776'>they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.</a>
<a id='line_3777'></a>
<a id='line_3778'>15:12 And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their</a>
<a id='line_3779'>fathers with all their heart and with all their soul; 15:13 That</a>
<a id='line_3780'>whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to</a>
<a id='line_3781'>death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.</a>
<a id='line_3782'></a>
<a id='line_3783'>15:14 And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with</a>
<a id='line_3784'>shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.</a>
<a id='line_3785'></a>
<a id='line_3786'>15:15 And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all</a>
<a id='line_3787'>their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found</a>
<a id='line_3788'>of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.</a>
<a id='line_3789'></a>
<a id='line_3790'>15:16 And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he</a>
<a id='line_3791'>removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove:</a>
<a id='line_3792'>and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook</a>
<a id='line_3793'>Kidron.</a>
<a id='line_3794'></a>
<a id='line_3795'>15:17 But the high places were not taken away out of Israel:</a>
<a id='line_3796'>nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</a>
<a id='line_3797'></a>
<a id='line_3798'>15:18 And he brought into the house of God the things that his father</a>
<a id='line_3799'>had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold,</a>
<a id='line_3800'>and vessels.</a>
<a id='line_3801'></a>
<a id='line_3802'>15:19 And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of</a>
<a id='line_3803'>the reign of Asa.</a>
<a id='line_3804'></a>
<a id='line_3805'>16:1 In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of</a>
<a id='line_3806'>Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he</a>
<a id='line_3807'>might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_3808'></a>
<a id='line_3809'>16:2 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the</a>
<a id='line_3810'>house of the LORD and of the king’s house, and sent to Benhadad king</a>
<a id='line_3811'>of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, 16:3 There is a league</a>
<a id='line_3812'>between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father:</a>
<a id='line_3813'>behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with</a>
<a id='line_3814'>Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.</a>
<a id='line_3815'></a>
<a id='line_3816'>16:4 And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of</a>
<a id='line_3817'>his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan,</a>
<a id='line_3818'>and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.</a>
<a id='line_3819'></a>
<a id='line_3820'>16:5 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off</a>
<a id='line_3821'>building of Ramah, and let his work cease.</a>
<a id='line_3822'></a>
<a id='line_3823'>16:6 Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the</a>
<a id='line_3824'>stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was</a>
<a id='line_3825'>building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.</a>
<a id='line_3826'></a>
<a id='line_3827'>16:7 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and</a>
<a id='line_3828'>said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not</a>
<a id='line_3829'>relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria</a>
<a id='line_3830'>escaped out of thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_3831'></a>
<a id='line_3832'>16:8 Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very</a>
<a id='line_3833'>many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_3834'>he delivered them into thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_3835'></a>
<a id='line_3836'>16:9 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole</a>
<a id='line_3837'>earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is</a>
<a id='line_3838'>perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from</a>
<a id='line_3839'>henceforth thou shalt have wars.</a>
<a id='line_3840'></a>
<a id='line_3841'>16:10 Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house;</a>
<a id='line_3842'>for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed</a>
<a id='line_3843'>some of the people the same time.</a>
<a id='line_3844'></a>
<a id='line_3845'>16:11 And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are</a>
<a id='line_3846'>written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3847'></a>
<a id='line_3848'>16:12 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased</a>
<a id='line_3849'>in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease</a>
<a id='line_3850'>he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.</a>
<a id='line_3851'></a>
<a id='line_3852'>16:13 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth</a>
<a id='line_3853'>year of his reign.</a>
<a id='line_3854'></a>
<a id='line_3855'>16:14 And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for</a>
<a id='line_3856'>himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled</a>
<a id='line_3857'>with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the</a>
<a id='line_3858'>apothecaries’ art: and they made a very great burning for him.</a>
<a id='line_3859'></a>
<a id='line_3860'>17:1 And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened</a>
<a id='line_3861'>himself against Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3862'></a>
<a id='line_3863'>17:2 And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set</a>
<a id='line_3864'>garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which</a>
<a id='line_3865'>Asa his father had taken.</a>
<a id='line_3866'></a>
<a id='line_3867'>17:3 And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first</a>
<a id='line_3868'>ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim; 17:4 But sought</a>
<a id='line_3869'>to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not</a>
<a id='line_3870'>after the doings of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3871'></a>
<a id='line_3872'>17:5 Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all</a>
<a id='line_3873'>Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in</a>
<a id='line_3874'>abundance.</a>
<a id='line_3875'></a>
<a id='line_3876'>17:6 And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he</a>
<a id='line_3877'>took away the high places and groves out of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_3878'></a>
<a id='line_3879'>17:7 Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even</a>
<a id='line_3880'>to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to</a>
<a id='line_3881'>Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_3882'></a>
<a id='line_3883'>17:8 And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and</a>
<a id='line_3884'>Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah,</a>
<a id='line_3885'>and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and</a>
<a id='line_3886'>Jehoram, priests.</a>
<a id='line_3887'></a>
<a id='line_3888'>17:9 And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3889'>with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and</a>
<a id='line_3890'>taught the people.</a>
<a id='line_3891'></a>
<a id='line_3892'>17:10 And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands</a>
<a id='line_3893'>that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against</a>
<a id='line_3894'>Jehoshaphat.</a>
<a id='line_3895'></a>
<a id='line_3896'>17:11 Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and</a>
<a id='line_3897'>tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand</a>
<a id='line_3898'>and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats.</a>
<a id='line_3899'></a>
<a id='line_3900'>17:12 And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah</a>
<a id='line_3901'>castles, and cities of store.</a>
<a id='line_3902'></a>
<a id='line_3903'>17:13 And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of</a>
<a id='line_3904'>war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_3905'></a>
<a id='line_3906'>17:14 And these are the numbers of them according to the house of</a>
<a id='line_3907'>their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief,</a>
<a id='line_3908'>and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.</a>
<a id='line_3909'></a>
<a id='line_3910'>17:15 And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two</a>
<a id='line_3911'>hundred and fourscore thousand.</a>
<a id='line_3912'></a>
<a id='line_3913'>17:16 And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly</a>
<a id='line_3914'>offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand</a>
<a id='line_3915'>mighty men of valour.</a>
<a id='line_3916'></a>
<a id='line_3917'>17:17 And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him</a>
<a id='line_3918'>armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.</a>
<a id='line_3919'></a>
<a id='line_3920'>17:18 And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and</a>
<a id='line_3921'>fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.</a>
<a id='line_3922'></a>
<a id='line_3923'>17:19 These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the</a>
<a id='line_3924'>fenced cities throughout all Judah.</a>
<a id='line_3925'></a>
<a id='line_3926'>18:1 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined</a>
<a id='line_3927'>affinity with Ahab.</a>
<a id='line_3928'></a>
<a id='line_3929'>18:2 And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab</a>
<a id='line_3930'>killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he</a>
<a id='line_3931'>had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.</a>
<a id='line_3932'></a>
<a id='line_3933'>18:3 And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt</a>
<a id='line_3934'>thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou</a>
<a id='line_3935'>art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.</a>
<a id='line_3936'></a>
<a id='line_3937'>18:4 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray</a>
<a id='line_3938'>thee, at the word of the LORD to day.</a>
<a id='line_3939'></a>
<a id='line_3940'>18:5 Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four</a>
<a id='line_3941'>hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to</a>
<a id='line_3942'>battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver</a>
<a id='line_3943'>it into the king’s hand.</a>
<a id='line_3944'></a>
<a id='line_3945'>18:6 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3946'>besides, that we might enquire of him?  18:7 And the king of Israel</a>
<a id='line_3947'>said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of</a>
<a id='line_3948'>the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but</a>
<a id='line_3949'>always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat</a>
<a id='line_3950'>said, Let not the king say so.</a>
<a id='line_3951'></a>
<a id='line_3952'>18:8 And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said,</a>
<a id='line_3953'>Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.</a>
<a id='line_3954'></a>
<a id='line_3955'>18:9 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either</a>
<a id='line_3956'>of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void</a>
<a id='line_3957'>place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets</a>
<a id='line_3958'>prophesied before them.</a>
<a id='line_3959'></a>
<a id='line_3960'>18:10 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron,</a>
<a id='line_3961'>and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until</a>
<a id='line_3962'>they be consumed.</a>
<a id='line_3963'></a>
<a id='line_3964'>18:11 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to</a>
<a id='line_3965'>Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand</a>
<a id='line_3966'>of the king.</a>
<a id='line_3967'></a>
<a id='line_3968'>18:12 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him,</a>
<a id='line_3969'>saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king</a>
<a id='line_3970'>with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of</a>
<a id='line_3971'>theirs, and speak thou good.</a>
<a id='line_3972'></a>
<a id='line_3973'>18:13 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith,</a>
<a id='line_3974'>that will I speak.</a>
<a id='line_3975'></a>
<a id='line_3976'>18:14 And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him,</a>
<a id='line_3977'>Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear?</a>
<a id='line_3978'>And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into</a>
<a id='line_3979'>your hand.</a>
<a id='line_3980'></a>
<a id='line_3981'>18:15 And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee</a>
<a id='line_3982'>that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?</a>
<a id='line_3983'>18:16 Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains,</a>
<a id='line_3984'>as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no</a>
<a id='line_3985'>master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.</a>
<a id='line_3986'></a>
<a id='line_3987'>18:17 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee</a>
<a id='line_3988'>that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?  18:18 Again he</a>
<a id='line_3989'>said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon</a>
<a id='line_3990'>his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and</a>
<a id='line_3991'>on his left.</a>
<a id='line_3992'></a>
<a id='line_3993'>18:19 And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he</a>
<a id='line_3994'>may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this</a>
<a id='line_3995'>manner, and another saying after that manner.</a>
<a id='line_3996'></a>
<a id='line_3997'>18:20 Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_3998'>said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?  18:21</a>
<a id='line_3999'>And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all</a>
<a id='line_4000'>his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_4001'>also prevail: go out, and do even so.</a>
<a id='line_4002'></a>
<a id='line_4003'>18:22 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the</a>
<a id='line_4004'>mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against</a>
<a id='line_4005'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_4006'></a>
<a id='line_4007'>18:23 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah</a>
<a id='line_4008'>upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from</a>
<a id='line_4009'>me to speak unto thee?  18:24 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see</a>
<a id='line_4010'>on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</a>
<a id='line_4011'></a>
<a id='line_4012'>18:25 Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him</a>
<a id='line_4013'>back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;</a>
<a id='line_4014'>18:26 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and</a>
<a id='line_4015'>feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until</a>
<a id='line_4016'>I return in peace.</a>
<a id='line_4017'></a>
<a id='line_4018'>18:27 And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath</a>
<a id='line_4019'>not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.</a>
<a id='line_4020'></a>
<a id='line_4021'>18:28 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up</a>
<a id='line_4022'>to Ramothgilead.</a>
<a id='line_4023'></a>
<a id='line_4024'>18:29 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise</a>
<a id='line_4025'>myself, and I will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the</a>
<a id='line_4026'>king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.</a>
<a id='line_4027'></a>
<a id='line_4028'>18:30 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots</a>
<a id='line_4029'>that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save</a>
<a id='line_4030'>only with the king of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4031'></a>
<a id='line_4032'>18:31 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw</a>
<a id='line_4033'>Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they</a>
<a id='line_4034'>compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD</a>
<a id='line_4035'>helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.</a>
<a id='line_4036'></a>
<a id='line_4037'>18:32 For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots</a>
<a id='line_4038'>perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again</a>
<a id='line_4039'>from pursuing him.</a>
<a id='line_4040'></a>
<a id='line_4041'>18:33 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of</a>
<a id='line_4042'>Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his</a>
<a id='line_4043'>chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the</a>
<a id='line_4044'>host; for I am wounded.</a>
<a id='line_4045'></a>
<a id='line_4046'>18:34 And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel</a>
<a id='line_4047'>stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even:</a>
<a id='line_4048'>and about the time of the sun going down he died.</a>
<a id='line_4049'></a>
<a id='line_4050'>19:1 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace</a>
<a id='line_4051'>to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_4052'></a>
<a id='line_4053'>19:2 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and</a>
<a id='line_4054'>said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love</a>
<a id='line_4055'>them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the</a>
<a id='line_4056'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4057'></a>
<a id='line_4058'>19:3 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou</a>
<a id='line_4059'>hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine</a>
<a id='line_4060'>heart to seek God.</a>
<a id='line_4061'></a>
<a id='line_4062'>19:4 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through</a>
<a id='line_4063'>the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto</a>
<a id='line_4064'>the LORD God of their fathers.</a>
<a id='line_4065'></a>
<a id='line_4066'>19:5 And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of</a>
<a id='line_4067'>Judah, city by city, 19:6 And said to the judges, Take heed what ye</a>
<a id='line_4068'>do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the</a>
<a id='line_4069'>judgment.</a>
<a id='line_4070'></a>
<a id='line_4071'>19:7 Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and</a>
<a id='line_4072'>do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of</a>
<a id='line_4073'>persons, nor taking of gifts.</a>
<a id='line_4074'></a>
<a id='line_4075'>19:8 Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of</a>
<a id='line_4076'>the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the</a>
<a id='line_4077'>judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to</a>
<a id='line_4078'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_4079'></a>
<a id='line_4080'>19:9 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the</a>
<a id='line_4081'>LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.</a>
<a id='line_4082'></a>
<a id='line_4083'>19:10 And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that</a>
<a id='line_4084'>dwell in your cities, between blood and blood, between law and</a>
<a id='line_4085'>commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they</a>
<a id='line_4086'>trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon</a>
<a id='line_4087'>your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass.</a>
<a id='line_4088'></a>
<a id='line_4089'>19:11 And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters</a>
<a id='line_4090'>of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house</a>
<a id='line_4091'>of Judah, for all the king’s matters: also the Levites shall be</a>
<a id='line_4092'>officers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD shall be with the</a>
<a id='line_4093'>good.</a>
<a id='line_4094'></a>
<a id='line_4095'>20:1 It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and</a>
<a id='line_4096'>the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came</a>
<a id='line_4097'>against Jehoshaphat to battle.</a>
<a id='line_4098'></a>
<a id='line_4099'>20:2 Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh</a>
<a id='line_4100'>a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria;</a>
<a id='line_4101'>and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which is Engedi.</a>
<a id='line_4102'></a>
<a id='line_4103'>20:3 And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_4104'>proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.</a>
<a id='line_4105'></a>
<a id='line_4106'>20:4 And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD:</a>
<a id='line_4107'>even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4108'></a>
<a id='line_4109'>20:5 And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_4110'>in the house of the LORD, before the new court, 20:6 And said, O LORD</a>
<a id='line_4111'>God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou</a>
<a id='line_4112'>over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not</a>
<a id='line_4113'>power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?  20:7 Art not</a>
<a id='line_4114'>thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before</a>
<a id='line_4115'>thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for</a>
<a id='line_4116'>ever?  20:8 And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary</a>
<a id='line_4117'>therein for thy name, saying, 20:9 If, when evil cometh upon us, as</a>
<a id='line_4118'>the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this</a>
<a id='line_4119'>house, and in thy presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry</a>
<a id='line_4120'>unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.</a>
<a id='line_4121'></a>
<a id='line_4122'>20:10 And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir,</a>
<a id='line_4123'>whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the</a>
<a id='line_4124'>land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;</a>
<a id='line_4125'>20:11 Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy</a>
<a id='line_4126'>possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.</a>
<a id='line_4127'></a>
<a id='line_4128'>20:12 O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might</a>
<a id='line_4129'>against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we</a>
<a id='line_4130'>what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.</a>
<a id='line_4131'></a>
<a id='line_4132'>20:13 And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones,</a>
<a id='line_4133'>their wives, and their children.</a>
<a id='line_4134'></a>
<a id='line_4135'>20:14 Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the</a>
<a id='line_4136'>son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph,</a>
<a id='line_4137'>came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation; 20:15</a>
<a id='line_4138'>And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_4139'>and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid</a>
<a id='line_4140'>nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not</a>
<a id='line_4141'>yours, but God’s.</a>
<a id='line_4142'></a>
<a id='line_4143'>20:16 To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the</a>
<a id='line_4144'>cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before</a>
<a id='line_4145'>the wilderness of Jeruel.</a>
<a id='line_4146'></a>
<a id='line_4147'>20:17 Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand</a>
<a id='line_4148'>ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and</a>
<a id='line_4149'>Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them:</a>
<a id='line_4150'>for the LORD will be with you.</a>
<a id='line_4151'></a>
<a id='line_4152'>20:18 And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and</a>
<a id='line_4153'>all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_4154'>worshipping the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4155'></a>
<a id='line_4156'>20:19 And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the</a>
<a id='line_4157'>children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel</a>
<a id='line_4158'>with a loud voice on high.</a>
<a id='line_4159'></a>
<a id='line_4160'>20:20 And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the</a>
<a id='line_4161'>wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and</a>
<a id='line_4162'>said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in</a>
<a id='line_4163'>the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets,</a>
<a id='line_4164'>so shall ye prosper.</a>
<a id='line_4165'></a>
<a id='line_4166'>20:21 And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers</a>
<a id='line_4167'>unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they</a>
<a id='line_4168'>went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy</a>
<a id='line_4169'>endureth for ever.</a>
<a id='line_4170'></a>
<a id='line_4171'>20:22 And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set</a>
<a id='line_4172'>ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which</a>
<a id='line_4173'>were come against Judah; and they were smitten.</a>
<a id='line_4174'></a>
<a id='line_4175'>20:23 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the</a>
<a id='line_4176'>inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when</a>
<a id='line_4177'>they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to</a>
<a id='line_4178'>destroy another.</a>
<a id='line_4179'></a>
<a id='line_4180'>20:24 And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness,</a>
<a id='line_4181'>they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies</a>
<a id='line_4182'>fallen to the earth, and none escaped.</a>
<a id='line_4183'></a>
<a id='line_4184'>20:25 And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil</a>
<a id='line_4185'>of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead</a>
<a id='line_4186'>bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves,</a>
<a id='line_4187'>more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering</a>
<a id='line_4188'>of the spoil, it was so much.</a>
<a id='line_4189'></a>
<a id='line_4190'>20:26 And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of</a>
<a id='line_4191'>Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the</a>
<a id='line_4192'>same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_4193'></a>
<a id='line_4194'>20:27 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and</a>
<a id='line_4195'>Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with</a>
<a id='line_4196'>joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.</a>
<a id='line_4197'></a>
<a id='line_4198'>20:28 And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and</a>
<a id='line_4199'>trumpets unto the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4200'></a>
<a id='line_4201'>20:29 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries,</a>
<a id='line_4202'>when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of</a>
<a id='line_4203'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4204'></a>
<a id='line_4205'>20:30 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest</a>
<a id='line_4206'>round about.</a>
<a id='line_4207'></a>
<a id='line_4208'>20:31 And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years</a>
<a id='line_4209'>old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in</a>
<a id='line_4210'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_4211'></a>
<a id='line_4212'>And his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</a>
<a id='line_4213'></a>
<a id='line_4214'>20:32 And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not</a>
<a id='line_4215'>from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4216'></a>
<a id='line_4217'>20:33 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the</a>
<a id='line_4218'>people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.</a>
<a id='line_4219'></a>
<a id='line_4220'>20:34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold,</a>
<a id='line_4221'>they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is</a>
<a id='line_4222'>mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4223'></a>
<a id='line_4224'>20:35 And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with</a>
<a id='line_4225'>Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly: 20:36 And he joined</a>
<a id='line_4226'>himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the</a>
<a id='line_4227'>ships in Eziongaber.</a>
<a id='line_4228'></a>
<a id='line_4229'>20:37 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against</a>
<a id='line_4230'>Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah,</a>
<a id='line_4231'>the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they</a>
<a id='line_4232'>were not able to go to Tarshish.</a>
<a id='line_4233'></a>
<a id='line_4234'>21:1 Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his</a>
<a id='line_4235'>fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his</a>
<a id='line_4236'>stead.</a>
<a id='line_4237'></a>
<a id='line_4238'>21:2 And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel,</a>
<a id='line_4239'>and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these</a>
<a id='line_4240'>were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4241'></a>
<a id='line_4242'>21:3 And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold,</a>
<a id='line_4243'>and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom</a>
<a id='line_4244'>gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.</a>
<a id='line_4245'></a>
<a id='line_4246'>21:4 Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he</a>
<a id='line_4247'>strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and</a>
<a id='line_4248'>divers also of the princes of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4249'></a>
<a id='line_4250'>21:5 Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and</a>
<a id='line_4251'>he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_4252'></a>
<a id='line_4253'>21:6 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the</a>
<a id='line_4254'>house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought</a>
<a id='line_4255'>that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4256'></a>
<a id='line_4257'>21:7 Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of</a>
<a id='line_4258'>the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a</a>
<a id='line_4259'>light to him and to his sons for ever.</a>
<a id='line_4260'></a>
<a id='line_4261'>21:8 In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of</a>
<a id='line_4262'>Judah, and made themselves a king.</a>
<a id='line_4263'></a>
<a id='line_4264'>21:9 Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots</a>
<a id='line_4265'>with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which</a>
<a id='line_4266'>compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.</a>
<a id='line_4267'></a>
<a id='line_4268'>21:10 So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this</a>
<a id='line_4269'>day.</a>
<a id='line_4270'></a>
<a id='line_4271'>The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he</a>
<a id='line_4272'>had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.</a>
<a id='line_4273'></a>
<a id='line_4274'>21:11 Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and</a>
<a id='line_4275'>caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and</a>
<a id='line_4276'>compelled Judah thereto.</a>
<a id='line_4277'></a>
<a id='line_4278'>21:12 And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying,</a>
<a id='line_4279'>Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not</a>
<a id='line_4280'>walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa</a>
<a id='line_4281'>king of Judah, 21:13 But hast walked in the way of the kings of</a>
<a id='line_4282'>Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a</a>
<a id='line_4283'>whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast</a>
<a id='line_4284'>slain thy brethren of thy father’s house, which were better than</a>
<a id='line_4285'>thyself: 21:14 Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy</a>
<a id='line_4286'>people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods: 21:15 And</a>
<a id='line_4287'>thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy</a>
<a id='line_4288'>bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.</a>
<a id='line_4289'></a>
<a id='line_4290'>21:16 Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the</a>
<a id='line_4291'>Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians: 21:17</a>
<a id='line_4292'>And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all</a>
<a id='line_4293'>the substance that was found in the king’s house, and his sons also,</a>
<a id='line_4294'>and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz,</a>
<a id='line_4295'>the youngest of his sons.</a>
<a id='line_4296'></a>
<a id='line_4297'>21:18 And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an</a>
<a id='line_4298'>incurable disease.</a>
<a id='line_4299'></a>
<a id='line_4300'>21:19 And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of</a>
<a id='line_4301'>two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died</a>
<a id='line_4302'>of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the</a>
<a id='line_4303'>burning of his fathers.</a>
<a id='line_4304'></a>
<a id='line_4305'>21:20 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he</a>
<a id='line_4306'>reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired.</a>
<a id='line_4307'>Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the</a>
<a id='line_4308'>sepulchres of the kings.</a>
<a id='line_4309'></a>
<a id='line_4310'>22:1 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son</a>
<a id='line_4311'>king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to</a>
<a id='line_4312'>the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king</a>
<a id='line_4313'>of Judah reigned.</a>
<a id='line_4314'></a>
<a id='line_4315'>22:2 Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and</a>
<a id='line_4316'>he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Athaliah</a>
<a id='line_4317'>the daughter of Omri.</a>
<a id='line_4318'></a>
<a id='line_4319'>22:3 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother</a>
<a id='line_4320'>was his counsellor to do wickedly.</a>
<a id='line_4321'></a>
<a id='line_4322'>22:4 Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of</a>
<a id='line_4323'>Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to</a>
<a id='line_4324'>his destruction.</a>
<a id='line_4325'></a>
<a id='line_4326'>22:5 He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son</a>
<a id='line_4327'>of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at</a>
<a id='line_4328'>Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.</a>
<a id='line_4329'></a>
<a id='line_4330'>22:6 And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds</a>
<a id='line_4331'>which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of</a>
<a id='line_4332'>Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see</a>
<a id='line_4333'>Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.</a>
<a id='line_4334'></a>
<a id='line_4335'>22:7 And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for</a>
<a id='line_4336'>when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of</a>
<a id='line_4337'>Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.</a>
<a id='line_4338'></a>
<a id='line_4339'>22:8 And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon</a>
<a id='line_4340'>the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the</a>
<a id='line_4341'>brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.</a>
<a id='line_4342'></a>
<a id='line_4343'>22:9 And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in</a>
<a id='line_4344'>Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they</a>
<a id='line_4345'>buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who</a>
<a id='line_4346'>sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no</a>
<a id='line_4347'>power to keep still the kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_4348'></a>
<a id='line_4349'>22:10 But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was</a>
<a id='line_4350'>dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of</a>
<a id='line_4351'>Judah.</a>
<a id='line_4352'></a>
<a id='line_4353'>22:11 But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son</a>
<a id='line_4354'>of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king’s sons that were slain,</a>
<a id='line_4355'>and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the</a>
<a id='line_4356'>daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she</a>
<a id='line_4357'>was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew</a>
<a id='line_4358'>him not.</a>
<a id='line_4359'></a>
<a id='line_4360'>22:12 And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and</a>
<a id='line_4361'>Athaliah reigned over the land.</a>
<a id='line_4362'></a>
<a id='line_4363'>23:1 And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took</a>
<a id='line_4364'>the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the</a>
<a id='line_4365'>son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of</a>
<a id='line_4366'>Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.</a>
<a id='line_4367'></a>
<a id='line_4368'>23:2 And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all</a>
<a id='line_4369'>the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they</a>
<a id='line_4370'>came to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_4371'></a>
<a id='line_4372'>23:3 And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the</a>
<a id='line_4373'>house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king’s son shall</a>
<a id='line_4374'>reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.</a>
<a id='line_4375'></a>
<a id='line_4376'>23:4 This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering</a>
<a id='line_4377'>on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of</a>
<a id='line_4378'>the doors; 23:5 And a third part shall be at the king’s house; and a</a>
<a id='line_4379'>third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be</a>
<a id='line_4380'>in the courts of the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4381'></a>
<a id='line_4382'>23:6 But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests,</a>
<a id='line_4383'>and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are</a>
<a id='line_4384'>holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4385'></a>
<a id='line_4386'>23:7 And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man</a>
<a id='line_4387'>with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the</a>
<a id='line_4388'>house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he</a>
<a id='line_4389'>cometh in, and when he goeth out.</a>
<a id='line_4390'></a>
<a id='line_4391'>23:8 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that</a>
<a id='line_4392'>Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that</a>
<a id='line_4393'>were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the</a>
<a id='line_4394'>sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.</a>
<a id='line_4395'></a>
<a id='line_4396'>23:9 Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of</a>
<a id='line_4397'>hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king</a>
<a id='line_4398'>David’s, which were in the house of God.</a>
<a id='line_4399'></a>
<a id='line_4400'>23:10 And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his</a>
<a id='line_4401'>hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the</a>
<a id='line_4402'>temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.</a>
<a id='line_4403'></a>
<a id='line_4404'>23:11 Then they brought out the king’s son, and put upon him the</a>
<a id='line_4405'>crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and</a>
<a id='line_4406'>his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.</a>
<a id='line_4407'></a>
<a id='line_4408'>23:12 Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and</a>
<a id='line_4409'>praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:</a>
<a id='line_4410'>23:13 And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the</a>
<a id='line_4411'>entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the</a>
<a id='line_4412'>people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the</a>
<a id='line_4413'>singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise.</a>
<a id='line_4414'>Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.</a>
<a id='line_4415'></a>
<a id='line_4416'>23:14 Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds</a>
<a id='line_4417'>that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the</a>
<a id='line_4418'>ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For</a>
<a id='line_4419'>the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4420'></a>
<a id='line_4421'>23:15 So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering</a>
<a id='line_4422'>of the horse gate by the king’s house, they slew her there.</a>
<a id='line_4423'></a>
<a id='line_4424'>23:16 And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the</a>
<a id='line_4425'>people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD’s people.</a>
<a id='line_4426'></a>
<a id='line_4427'>23:17 Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it</a>
<a id='line_4428'>down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan</a>
<a id='line_4429'>the priest of Baal before the altars.</a>
<a id='line_4430'></a>
<a id='line_4431'>23:18 Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by</a>
<a id='line_4432'>the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the</a>
<a id='line_4433'>house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is</a>
<a id='line_4434'>written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it</a>
<a id='line_4435'>was ordained by David.</a>
<a id='line_4436'></a>
<a id='line_4437'>23:19 And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_4438'>that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.</a>
<a id='line_4439'></a>
<a id='line_4440'>23:20 And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the</a>
<a id='line_4441'>governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought</a>
<a id='line_4442'>down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the</a>
<a id='line_4443'>high gate into the king’s house, and set the king upon the throne of</a>
<a id='line_4444'>the kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_4445'></a>
<a id='line_4446'>23:21 And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet,</a>
<a id='line_4447'>after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.</a>
<a id='line_4448'></a>
<a id='line_4449'>24:1 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned</a>
<a id='line_4450'>forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Zibiah of</a>
<a id='line_4451'>Beersheba.</a>
<a id='line_4452'></a>
<a id='line_4453'>24:2 And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all</a>
<a id='line_4454'>the days of Jehoiada the priest.</a>
<a id='line_4455'></a>
<a id='line_4456'>24:3 And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and</a>
<a id='line_4457'>daughters.</a>
<a id='line_4458'></a>
<a id='line_4459'>24:4 And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair</a>
<a id='line_4460'>the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4461'></a>
<a id='line_4462'>24:5 And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to</a>
<a id='line_4463'>them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money</a>
<a id='line_4464'>to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye</a>
<a id='line_4465'>hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.</a>
<a id='line_4466'></a>
<a id='line_4467'>24:6 And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him,</a>
<a id='line_4468'>Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and</a>
<a id='line_4469'>out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses</a>
<a id='line_4470'>the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the</a>
<a id='line_4471'>tabernacle of witness?  24:7 For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked</a>
<a id='line_4472'>woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated</a>
<a id='line_4473'>things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.</a>
<a id='line_4474'></a>
<a id='line_4475'>24:8 And at the king’s commandment they made a chest, and set it</a>
<a id='line_4476'>without at the gate of the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4477'></a>
<a id='line_4478'>24:9 And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to</a>
<a id='line_4479'>bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid</a>
<a id='line_4480'>upon Israel in the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_4481'></a>
<a id='line_4482'>24:10 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in,</a>
<a id='line_4483'>and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.</a>
<a id='line_4484'></a>
<a id='line_4485'>24:11 Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought</a>
<a id='line_4486'>unto the king’s office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw</a>
<a id='line_4487'>that there was much money, the king’s scribe and the high priest’s</a>
<a id='line_4488'>officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his</a>
<a id='line_4489'>place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in</a>
<a id='line_4490'>abundance.</a>
<a id='line_4491'></a>
<a id='line_4492'>24:12 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the</a>
<a id='line_4493'>service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to</a>
<a id='line_4494'>repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass</a>
<a id='line_4495'>to mend the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4496'></a>
<a id='line_4497'>24:13 So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and</a>
<a id='line_4498'>they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.</a>
<a id='line_4499'></a>
<a id='line_4500'>24:14 And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the</a>
<a id='line_4501'>money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the</a>
<a id='line_4502'>house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and</a>
<a id='line_4503'>spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt</a>
<a id='line_4504'>offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of</a>
<a id='line_4505'>Jehoiada.</a>
<a id='line_4506'></a>
<a id='line_4507'>24:15 But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an</a>
<a id='line_4508'>hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.</a>
<a id='line_4509'></a>
<a id='line_4510'>24:16 And they buried him in the city of David among the kings,</a>
<a id='line_4511'>because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his</a>
<a id='line_4512'>house.</a>
<a id='line_4513'></a>
<a id='line_4514'>24:17 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and</a>
<a id='line_4515'>made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.</a>
<a id='line_4516'></a>
<a id='line_4517'>24:18 And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and</a>
<a id='line_4518'>served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for</a>
<a id='line_4519'>this their trespass.</a>
<a id='line_4520'></a>
<a id='line_4521'>24:19 Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD;</a>
<a id='line_4522'>and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.</a>
<a id='line_4523'></a>
<a id='line_4524'>24:20 And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada</a>
<a id='line_4525'>the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus</a>
<a id='line_4526'>saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye</a>
<a id='line_4527'>cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also</a>
<a id='line_4528'>forsaken you.</a>
<a id='line_4529'></a>
<a id='line_4530'>24:21 And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at</a>
<a id='line_4531'>the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4532'></a>
<a id='line_4533'>24:22 Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada</a>
<a id='line_4534'>his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he</a>
<a id='line_4535'>said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.</a>
<a id='line_4536'></a>
<a id='line_4537'>24:23 And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of</a>
<a id='line_4538'>Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and</a>
<a id='line_4539'>destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and</a>
<a id='line_4540'>sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.</a>
<a id='line_4541'></a>
<a id='line_4542'>24:24 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men,</a>
<a id='line_4543'>and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they</a>
<a id='line_4544'>had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment</a>
<a id='line_4545'>against Joash.</a>
<a id='line_4546'></a>
<a id='line_4547'>24:25 And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in</a>
<a id='line_4548'>great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood</a>
<a id='line_4549'>of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he</a>
<a id='line_4550'>died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him</a>
<a id='line_4551'>not in the sepulchres of the kings.</a>
<a id='line_4552'></a>
<a id='line_4553'>24:26 And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of</a>
<a id='line_4554'>Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.</a>
<a id='line_4555'></a>
<a id='line_4556'>24:27 Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid</a>
<a id='line_4557'>upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are</a>
<a id='line_4558'>written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son</a>
<a id='line_4559'>reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_4560'></a>
<a id='line_4561'>25:1 Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and</a>
<a id='line_4562'>he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name</a>
<a id='line_4563'>was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_4564'></a>
<a id='line_4565'>25:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not</a>
<a id='line_4566'>with a perfect heart.</a>
<a id='line_4567'></a>
<a id='line_4568'>25:3 Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him,</a>
<a id='line_4569'>that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.</a>
<a id='line_4570'></a>
<a id='line_4571'>25:4 But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the</a>
<a id='line_4572'>law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The</a>
<a id='line_4573'>fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die</a>
<a id='line_4574'>for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.</a>
<a id='line_4575'></a>
<a id='line_4576'>25:5 Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains</a>
<a id='line_4577'>over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of</a>
<a id='line_4578'>their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them</a>
<a id='line_4579'>from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand</a>
<a id='line_4580'>choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and</a>
<a id='line_4581'>shield.</a>
<a id='line_4582'></a>
<a id='line_4583'>25:6 He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of</a>
<a id='line_4584'>Israel for an hundred talents of silver.</a>
<a id='line_4585'></a>
<a id='line_4586'>25:7 But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the</a>
<a id='line_4587'>army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit,</a>
<a id='line_4588'>with all the children of Ephraim.</a>
<a id='line_4589'></a>
<a id='line_4590'>25:8 But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God shall</a>
<a id='line_4591'>make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to</a>
<a id='line_4592'>cast down.</a>
<a id='line_4593'></a>
<a id='line_4594'>25:9 And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the</a>
<a id='line_4595'>hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man</a>
<a id='line_4596'>of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.</a>
<a id='line_4597'></a>
<a id='line_4598'>25:10 Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to</a>
<a id='line_4599'>him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was</a>
<a id='line_4600'>greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.</a>
<a id='line_4601'></a>
<a id='line_4602'>25:11 And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and</a>
<a id='line_4603'>went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten</a>
<a id='line_4604'>thousand.</a>
<a id='line_4605'></a>
<a id='line_4606'>25:12 And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah</a>
<a id='line_4607'>carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and</a>
<a id='line_4608'>cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in</a>
<a id='line_4609'>pieces.</a>
<a id='line_4610'></a>
<a id='line_4611'>25:13 But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they</a>
<a id='line_4612'>should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from</a>
<a id='line_4613'>Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and</a>
<a id='line_4614'>took much spoil.</a>
<a id='line_4615'></a>
<a id='line_4616'>25:14 Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the</a>
<a id='line_4617'>slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of</a>
<a id='line_4618'>Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before</a>
<a id='line_4619'>them, and burned incense unto them.</a>
<a id='line_4620'></a>
<a id='line_4621'>25:15 Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and</a>
<a id='line_4622'>he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought</a>
<a id='line_4623'>after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people</a>
<a id='line_4624'>out of thine hand?  25:16 And it came to pass, as he talked with him,</a>
<a id='line_4625'>that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king’s counsel?</a>
<a id='line_4626'>forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and</a>
<a id='line_4627'>said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou</a>
<a id='line_4628'>hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.</a>
<a id='line_4629'></a>
<a id='line_4630'>25:17 Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the</a>
<a id='line_4631'>son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us</a>
<a id='line_4632'>see one another in the face.</a>
<a id='line_4633'></a>
<a id='line_4634'>25:18 And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying,</a>
<a id='line_4635'>The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon,</a>
<a id='line_4636'>saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a</a>
<a id='line_4637'>wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.</a>
<a id='line_4638'></a>
<a id='line_4639'>25:19 Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart</a>
<a id='line_4640'>lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle</a>
<a id='line_4641'>to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with</a>
<a id='line_4642'>thee?  25:20 But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he</a>
<a id='line_4643'>might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought</a>
<a id='line_4644'>after the gods of Edom.</a>
<a id='line_4645'></a>
<a id='line_4646'>25:21 So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in</a>
<a id='line_4647'>the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which</a>
<a id='line_4648'>belongeth to Judah.</a>
<a id='line_4649'></a>
<a id='line_4650'>25:22 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled</a>
<a id='line_4651'>every man to his tent.</a>
<a id='line_4652'></a>
<a id='line_4653'>25:23 And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son</a>
<a id='line_4654'>of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to</a>
<a id='line_4655'>Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of</a>
<a id='line_4656'>Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</a>
<a id='line_4657'></a>
<a id='line_4658'>25:24 And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels</a>
<a id='line_4659'>that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures</a>
<a id='line_4660'>of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.</a>
<a id='line_4661'></a>
<a id='line_4662'>25:25 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death</a>
<a id='line_4663'>of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</a>
<a id='line_4664'></a>
<a id='line_4665'>25:26 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are</a>
<a id='line_4666'>they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?  25:27</a>
<a id='line_4667'>Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD</a>
<a id='line_4668'>they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to</a>
<a id='line_4669'>Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.</a>
<a id='line_4670'></a>
<a id='line_4671'>25:28 And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his</a>
<a id='line_4672'>fathers in the city of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_4673'></a>
<a id='line_4674'>26:1 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years</a>
<a id='line_4675'>old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.</a>
<a id='line_4676'></a>
<a id='line_4677'>26:2 He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king</a>
<a id='line_4678'>slept with his fathers.</a>
<a id='line_4679'></a>
<a id='line_4680'>26:3 Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he</a>
<a id='line_4681'>reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was</a>
<a id='line_4682'>Jecoliah of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_4683'></a>
<a id='line_4684'>26:4 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_4685'>according to all that his father Amaziah did.</a>
<a id='line_4686'></a>
<a id='line_4687'>26:5 And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding</a>
<a id='line_4688'>in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him</a>
<a id='line_4689'>to prosper.</a>
<a id='line_4690'></a>
<a id='line_4691'>26:6 And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake</a>
<a id='line_4692'>down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod,</a>
<a id='line_4693'>and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_4694'></a>
<a id='line_4695'>26:7 And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the</a>
<a id='line_4696'>Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.</a>
<a id='line_4697'></a>
<a id='line_4698'>26:8 And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread</a>
<a id='line_4699'>abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself</a>
<a id='line_4700'>exceedingly.</a>
<a id='line_4701'></a>
<a id='line_4702'>26:9 Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and</a>
<a id='line_4703'>at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified</a>
<a id='line_4704'>them.</a>
<a id='line_4705'></a>
<a id='line_4706'>26:10 Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for</a>
<a id='line_4707'>he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains:</a>
<a id='line_4708'>husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel:</a>
<a id='line_4709'>for he loved husbandry.</a>
<a id='line_4710'></a>
<a id='line_4711'>26:11 Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to</a>
<a id='line_4712'>war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of</a>
<a id='line_4713'>Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah,</a>
<a id='line_4714'>one of the king’s captains.</a>
<a id='line_4715'></a>
<a id='line_4716'>26:12 The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men</a>
<a id='line_4717'>of valour were two thousand and six hundred.</a>
<a id='line_4718'></a>
<a id='line_4719'>26:13 And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and</a>
<a id='line_4720'>seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to</a>
<a id='line_4721'>help the king against the enemy.</a>
<a id='line_4722'></a>
<a id='line_4723'>26:14 And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields,</a>
<a id='line_4724'>and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast</a>
<a id='line_4725'>stones.</a>
<a id='line_4726'></a>
<a id='line_4727'>26:15 And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be</a>
<a id='line_4728'>on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones</a>
<a id='line_4729'>withal.</a>
<a id='line_4730'></a>
<a id='line_4731'>And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till</a>
<a id='line_4732'>he was strong.</a>
<a id='line_4733'></a>
<a id='line_4734'>26:16 But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his</a>
<a id='line_4735'>destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went</a>
<a id='line_4736'>into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.</a>
<a id='line_4737'></a>
<a id='line_4738'>26:17 And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore</a>
<a id='line_4739'>priests of the LORD, that were valiant men: 26:18 And they withstood</a>
<a id='line_4740'>Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee,</a>
<a id='line_4741'>Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of</a>
<a id='line_4742'>Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary;</a>
<a id='line_4743'>for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from</a>
<a id='line_4744'>the LORD God.</a>
<a id='line_4745'></a>
<a id='line_4746'>26:19 Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn</a>
<a id='line_4747'>incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even</a>
<a id='line_4748'>rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_4749'>from beside the incense altar.</a>
<a id='line_4750'></a>
<a id='line_4751'>26:20 And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon</a>
<a id='line_4752'>him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him</a>
<a id='line_4753'>out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD</a>
<a id='line_4754'>had smitten him.</a>
<a id='line_4755'></a>
<a id='line_4756'>26:21 And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and</a>
<a id='line_4757'>dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the</a>
<a id='line_4758'>house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king’s house,</a>
<a id='line_4759'>judging the people of the land.</a>
<a id='line_4760'></a>
<a id='line_4761'>26:22 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah</a>
<a id='line_4762'>the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.</a>
<a id='line_4763'></a>
<a id='line_4764'>26:23 So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his</a>
<a id='line_4765'>fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for</a>
<a id='line_4766'>they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_4767'></a>
<a id='line_4768'>27:1 Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and</a>
<a id='line_4769'>he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was</a>
<a id='line_4770'>Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.</a>
<a id='line_4771'></a>
<a id='line_4772'>27:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_4773'>according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not</a>
<a id='line_4774'>into the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly.</a>
<a id='line_4775'></a>
<a id='line_4776'>27:3 He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall</a>
<a id='line_4777'>of Ophel he built much.</a>
<a id='line_4778'></a>
<a id='line_4779'>27:4 Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the</a>
<a id='line_4780'>forests he built castles and towers.</a>
<a id='line_4781'></a>
<a id='line_4782'>27:5 He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed</a>
<a id='line_4783'>against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an</a>
<a id='line_4784'>hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten</a>
<a id='line_4785'>thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him,</a>
<a id='line_4786'>both the second year, and the third.</a>
<a id='line_4787'></a>
<a id='line_4788'>27:6 So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the</a>
<a id='line_4789'>LORD his God.</a>
<a id='line_4790'></a>
<a id='line_4791'>27:7 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his</a>
<a id='line_4792'>ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and</a>
<a id='line_4793'>Judah.</a>
<a id='line_4794'></a>
<a id='line_4795'>27:8 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and</a>
<a id='line_4796'>reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_4797'></a>
<a id='line_4798'>27:9 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the</a>
<a id='line_4799'>city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_4800'></a>
<a id='line_4801'>28:1 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned</a>
<a id='line_4802'>sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the</a>
<a id='line_4803'>sight of the LORD, like David his father: 28:2 For he walked in the</a>
<a id='line_4804'>ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.</a>
<a id='line_4805'></a>
<a id='line_4806'>28:3 Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and</a>
<a id='line_4807'>burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen</a>
<a id='line_4808'>whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4809'></a>
<a id='line_4810'>28:4 He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on</a>
<a id='line_4811'>the hills, and under every green tree.</a>
<a id='line_4812'></a>
<a id='line_4813'>28:5 Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_4814'>king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude</a>
<a id='line_4815'>of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also</a>
<a id='line_4816'>delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a</a>
<a id='line_4817'>great slaughter.</a>
<a id='line_4818'></a>
<a id='line_4819'>28:6 For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty</a>
<a id='line_4820'>thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had</a>
<a id='line_4821'>forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.</a>
<a id='line_4822'></a>
<a id='line_4823'>28:7 And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king’s</a>
<a id='line_4824'>son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next</a>
<a id='line_4825'>to the king.</a>
<a id='line_4826'></a>
<a id='line_4827'>28:8 And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren</a>
<a id='line_4828'>two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away</a>
<a id='line_4829'>much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.</a>
<a id='line_4830'></a>
<a id='line_4831'>28:9 But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he</a>
<a id='line_4832'>went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them,</a>
<a id='line_4833'>Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he</a>
<a id='line_4834'>hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage</a>
<a id='line_4835'>that reacheth up unto heaven.</a>
<a id='line_4836'></a>
<a id='line_4837'>28:10 And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and</a>
<a id='line_4838'>Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with</a>
<a id='line_4839'>you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?  28:11 Now hear me</a>
<a id='line_4840'>therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive</a>
<a id='line_4841'>of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.</a>
<a id='line_4842'></a>
<a id='line_4843'>28:12 Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah</a>
<a id='line_4844'>the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah</a>
<a id='line_4845'>the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them</a>
<a id='line_4846'>that came from the war, 28:13 And said unto them, Ye shall not bring</a>
<a id='line_4847'>in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD</a>
<a id='line_4848'>already, ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for</a>
<a id='line_4849'>our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4850'></a>
<a id='line_4851'>28:14 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the</a>
<a id='line_4852'>princes and all the congregation.</a>
<a id='line_4853'></a>
<a id='line_4854'>28:15 And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the</a>
<a id='line_4855'>captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them,</a>
<a id='line_4856'>and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink,</a>
<a id='line_4857'>and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and</a>
<a id='line_4858'>brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren:</a>
<a id='line_4859'>then they returned to Samaria.</a>
<a id='line_4860'></a>
<a id='line_4861'>28:16 At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to</a>
<a id='line_4862'>help him.</a>
<a id='line_4863'></a>
<a id='line_4864'>28:17 For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried</a>
<a id='line_4865'>away captives.</a>
<a id='line_4866'></a>
<a id='line_4867'>28:18 The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country,</a>
<a id='line_4868'>and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and</a>
<a id='line_4869'>Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the</a>
<a id='line_4870'>villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt</a>
<a id='line_4871'>there.</a>
<a id='line_4872'></a>
<a id='line_4873'>28:19 For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel;</a>
<a id='line_4874'>for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4875'></a>
<a id='line_4876'>28:20 And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and</a>
<a id='line_4877'>distressed him, but strengthened him not.</a>
<a id='line_4878'></a>
<a id='line_4879'>28:21 For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_4880'>out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the</a>
<a id='line_4881'>king of Assyria: but he helped him not.</a>
<a id='line_4882'></a>
<a id='line_4883'>28:22 And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against</a>
<a id='line_4884'>the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.</a>
<a id='line_4885'></a>
<a id='line_4886'>28:23 For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him:</a>
<a id='line_4887'>and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them,</a>
<a id='line_4888'>therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they</a>
<a id='line_4889'>were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4890'></a>
<a id='line_4891'>28:24 And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and</a>
<a id='line_4892'>cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors</a>
<a id='line_4893'>of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of</a>
<a id='line_4894'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_4895'></a>
<a id='line_4896'>28:25 And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn</a>
<a id='line_4897'>incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his</a>
<a id='line_4898'>fathers.</a>
<a id='line_4899'></a>
<a id='line_4900'>28:26 Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last,</a>
<a id='line_4901'>behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4902'></a>
<a id='line_4903'>28:27 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the</a>
<a id='line_4904'>city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres</a>
<a id='line_4905'>of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_4906'></a>
<a id='line_4907'>29:1 Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old,</a>
<a id='line_4908'>and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s</a>
<a id='line_4909'>name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.</a>
<a id='line_4910'></a>
<a id='line_4911'>29:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_4912'>according to all that David his father had done.</a>
<a id='line_4913'></a>
<a id='line_4914'>29:3 He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the</a>
<a id='line_4915'>doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.</a>
<a id='line_4916'></a>
<a id='line_4917'>29:4 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them</a>
<a id='line_4918'>together into the east street, 29:5 And said unto them, Hear me, ye</a>
<a id='line_4919'>Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_4920'>God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy</a>
<a id='line_4921'>place.</a>
<a id='line_4922'></a>
<a id='line_4923'>29:6 For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in</a>
<a id='line_4924'>the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned</a>
<a id='line_4925'>away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their</a>
<a id='line_4926'>backs.</a>
<a id='line_4927'></a>
<a id='line_4928'>29:7 Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the</a>
<a id='line_4929'>lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the</a>
<a id='line_4930'>holy place unto the God of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4931'></a>
<a id='line_4932'>29:8 Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and</a>
<a id='line_4933'>he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as</a>
<a id='line_4934'>ye see with your eyes.</a>
<a id='line_4935'></a>
<a id='line_4936'>29:9 For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and</a>
<a id='line_4937'>our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.</a>
<a id='line_4938'></a>
<a id='line_4939'>29:10 Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of</a>
<a id='line_4940'>Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.</a>
<a id='line_4941'></a>
<a id='line_4942'>29:11 My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to</a>
<a id='line_4943'>stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him,</a>
<a id='line_4944'>and burn incense.</a>
<a id='line_4945'></a>
<a id='line_4946'>29:12 Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the</a>
<a id='line_4947'>son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of</a>
<a id='line_4948'>Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of</a>
<a id='line_4949'>the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:</a>
<a id='line_4950'>29:13 And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons</a>
<a id='line_4951'>of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah: 29:14 And of the sons of Heman;</a>
<a id='line_4952'>Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.</a>
<a id='line_4953'></a>
<a id='line_4954'>29:15 And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and</a>
<a id='line_4955'>came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the</a>
<a id='line_4956'>LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4957'></a>
<a id='line_4958'>29:16 And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the</a>
<a id='line_4959'>LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they</a>
<a id='line_4960'>found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the</a>
<a id='line_4961'>LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook</a>
<a id='line_4962'>Kidron.</a>
<a id='line_4963'></a>
<a id='line_4964'>29:17 Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify,</a>
<a id='line_4965'>and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD:</a>
<a id='line_4966'>so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the</a>
<a id='line_4967'>sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.</a>
<a id='line_4968'></a>
<a id='line_4969'>29:18 Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have</a>
<a id='line_4970'>cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering,</a>
<a id='line_4971'>with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the</a>
<a id='line_4972'>vessels thereof.</a>
<a id='line_4973'></a>
<a id='line_4974'>29:19 Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast</a>
<a id='line_4975'>away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and,</a>
<a id='line_4976'>behold, they are before the altar of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4977'></a>
<a id='line_4978'>29:20 Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of</a>
<a id='line_4979'>the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4980'></a>
<a id='line_4981'>29:21 And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven</a>
<a id='line_4982'>lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for</a>
<a id='line_4983'>the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of</a>
<a id='line_4984'>Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4985'></a>
<a id='line_4986'>29:22 So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood,</a>
<a id='line_4987'>and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the</a>
<a id='line_4988'>rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the</a>
<a id='line_4989'>lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.</a>
<a id='line_4990'></a>
<a id='line_4991'>29:23 And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before</a>
<a id='line_4992'>the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:</a>
<a id='line_4993'>29:24 And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with</a>
<a id='line_4994'>their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for</a>
<a id='line_4995'>the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should</a>
<a id='line_4996'>be made for all Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4997'></a>
<a id='line_4998'>29:25 And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals,</a>
<a id='line_4999'>with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of</a>
<a id='line_5000'>David, and of Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was</a>
<a id='line_5001'>the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.</a>
<a id='line_5002'></a>
<a id='line_5003'>29:26 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the</a>
<a id='line_5004'>priests with the trumpets.</a>
<a id='line_5005'></a>
<a id='line_5006'>29:27 And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the</a>
<a id='line_5007'>altar.</a>
<a id='line_5008'></a>
<a id='line_5009'>And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also</a>
<a id='line_5010'>with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of</a>
<a id='line_5011'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_5012'></a>
<a id='line_5013'>29:28 And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and</a>
<a id='line_5014'>the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt</a>
<a id='line_5015'>offering was finished.</a>
<a id='line_5016'></a>
<a id='line_5017'>29:29 And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that</a>
<a id='line_5018'>were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.</a>
<a id='line_5019'></a>
<a id='line_5020'>29:30 Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites</a>
<a id='line_5021'>to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the</a>
<a id='line_5022'>seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads</a>
<a id='line_5023'>and worshipped.</a>
<a id='line_5024'></a>
<a id='line_5025'>29:31 Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated</a>
<a id='line_5026'>yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank</a>
<a id='line_5027'>offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in</a>
<a id='line_5028'>sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart</a>
<a id='line_5029'>burnt offerings.</a>
<a id='line_5030'></a>
<a id='line_5031'>29:32 And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation</a>
<a id='line_5032'>brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two</a>
<a id='line_5033'>hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5034'></a>
<a id='line_5035'>29:33 And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three</a>
<a id='line_5036'>thousand sheep.</a>
<a id='line_5037'></a>
<a id='line_5038'>29:34 But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all</a>
<a id='line_5039'>the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help</a>
<a id='line_5040'>them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had</a>
<a id='line_5041'>sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to</a>
<a id='line_5042'>sanctify themselves than the priests.</a>
<a id='line_5043'></a>
<a id='line_5044'>29:35 And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of</a>
<a id='line_5045'>the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering.</a>
<a id='line_5046'>So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.</a>
<a id='line_5047'></a>
<a id='line_5048'>29:36 And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared</a>
<a id='line_5049'>the people: for the thing was done suddenly.</a>
<a id='line_5050'></a>
<a id='line_5051'>30:1 And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also</a>
<a id='line_5052'>to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the</a>
<a id='line_5053'>LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_5054'></a>
<a id='line_5055'>30:2 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the</a>
<a id='line_5056'>congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.</a>
<a id='line_5057'></a>
<a id='line_5058'>30:3 For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had</a>
<a id='line_5059'>not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people</a>
<a id='line_5060'>gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5061'></a>
<a id='line_5062'>30:4 And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.</a>
<a id='line_5063'></a>
<a id='line_5064'>30:5 So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all</a>
<a id='line_5065'>Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the</a>
<a id='line_5066'>passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not</a>
<a id='line_5067'>done it of a long time in such sort as it was written.</a>
<a id='line_5068'></a>
<a id='line_5069'>30:6 So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes</a>
<a id='line_5070'>throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of</a>
<a id='line_5071'>the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God</a>
<a id='line_5072'>of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of</a>
<a id='line_5073'>you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</a>
<a id='line_5074'></a>
<a id='line_5075'>30:7 And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which</a>
<a id='line_5076'>trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave</a>
<a id='line_5077'>them up to desolation, as ye see.</a>
<a id='line_5078'></a>
<a id='line_5079'>30:8 Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield</a>
<a id='line_5080'>yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath</a>
<a id='line_5081'>sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness</a>
<a id='line_5082'>of his wrath may turn away from you.</a>
<a id='line_5083'></a>
<a id='line_5084'>30:9 For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your</a>
<a id='line_5085'>children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so</a>
<a id='line_5086'>that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is</a>
<a id='line_5087'>gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye</a>
<a id='line_5088'>return unto him.</a>
<a id='line_5089'></a>
<a id='line_5090'>30:10 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of</a>
<a id='line_5091'>Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to</a>
<a id='line_5092'>scorn, and mocked them.</a>
<a id='line_5093'></a>
<a id='line_5094'>30:11 Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled</a>
<a id='line_5095'>themselves, and came to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5096'></a>
<a id='line_5097'>30:12 Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do</a>
<a id='line_5098'>the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the</a>
<a id='line_5099'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5100'></a>
<a id='line_5101'>30:13 And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast</a>
<a id='line_5102'>of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.</a>
<a id='line_5103'></a>
<a id='line_5104'>30:14 And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_5105'>and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the</a>
<a id='line_5106'>brook Kidron.</a>
<a id='line_5107'></a>
<a id='line_5108'>30:15 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the</a>
<a id='line_5109'>second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and</a>
<a id='line_5110'>sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the</a>
<a id='line_5111'>house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5112'></a>
<a id='line_5113'>30:16 And they stood in their place after their manner, according to</a>
<a id='line_5114'>the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood,</a>
<a id='line_5115'>which they received of the hand of the Levites.</a>
<a id='line_5116'></a>
<a id='line_5117'>30:17 For there were many in the congregation that were not</a>
<a id='line_5118'>sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the</a>
<a id='line_5119'>passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the</a>
<a id='line_5120'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5121'></a>
<a id='line_5122'>30:18 For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and</a>
<a id='line_5123'>Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did</a>
<a id='line_5124'>they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah</a>
<a id='line_5125'>prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one 30:19 That</a>
<a id='line_5126'>prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though</a>
<a id='line_5127'>he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.</a>
<a id='line_5128'></a>
<a id='line_5129'>30:20 And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</a>
<a id='line_5130'></a>
<a id='line_5131'>30:21 And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept</a>
<a id='line_5132'>the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the</a>
<a id='line_5133'>Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud</a>
<a id='line_5134'>instruments unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5135'></a>
<a id='line_5136'>30:22 And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught</a>
<a id='line_5137'>the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast</a>
<a id='line_5138'>seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the</a>
<a id='line_5139'>LORD God of their fathers.</a>
<a id='line_5140'></a>
<a id='line_5141'>30:23 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days:</a>
<a id='line_5142'>and they kept other seven days with gladness.</a>
<a id='line_5143'></a>
<a id='line_5144'>30:24 For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a</a>
<a id='line_5145'>thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to</a>
<a id='line_5146'>the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a</a>
<a id='line_5147'>great number of priests sanctified themselves.</a>
<a id='line_5148'></a>
<a id='line_5149'>30:25 And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the</a>
<a id='line_5150'>Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the</a>
<a id='line_5151'>strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in</a>
<a id='line_5152'>Judah, rejoiced.</a>
<a id='line_5153'></a>
<a id='line_5154'>30:26 So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of</a>
<a id='line_5155'>Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in</a>
<a id='line_5156'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5157'></a>
<a id='line_5158'>30:27 Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and</a>
<a id='line_5159'>their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling</a>
<a id='line_5160'>place, even unto heaven.</a>
<a id='line_5161'></a>
<a id='line_5162'>31:1 Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went</a>
<a id='line_5163'>out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut</a>
<a id='line_5164'>down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of</a>
<a id='line_5165'>all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had</a>
<a id='line_5166'>utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned,</a>
<a id='line_5167'>every man to his possession, into their own cities.</a>
<a id='line_5168'></a>
<a id='line_5169'>31:2 And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites</a>
<a id='line_5170'>after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests</a>
<a id='line_5171'>and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister,</a>
<a id='line_5172'>and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the</a>
<a id='line_5173'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5174'></a>
<a id='line_5175'>31:3 He appointed also the king’s portion of his substance for the</a>
<a id='line_5176'>burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings,</a>
<a id='line_5177'>and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and</a>
<a id='line_5178'>for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5179'></a>
<a id='line_5180'>31:4 Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give</a>
<a id='line_5181'>the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be</a>
<a id='line_5182'>encouraged in the law of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5183'></a>
<a id='line_5184'>31:5 And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of</a>
<a id='line_5185'>Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil,</a>
<a id='line_5186'>and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all</a>
<a id='line_5187'>things brought they in abundantly.</a>
<a id='line_5188'></a>
<a id='line_5189'>31:6 And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in</a>
<a id='line_5190'>the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep,</a>
<a id='line_5191'>and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD</a>
<a id='line_5192'>their God, and laid them by heaps.</a>
<a id='line_5193'></a>
<a id='line_5194'>31:7 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps,</a>
<a id='line_5195'>and finished them in the seventh month.</a>
<a id='line_5196'></a>
<a id='line_5197'>31:8 And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they</a>
<a id='line_5198'>blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.</a>
<a id='line_5199'></a>
<a id='line_5200'>31:9 Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites</a>
<a id='line_5201'>concerning the heaps.</a>
<a id='line_5202'></a>
<a id='line_5203'>31:10 And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him,</a>
<a id='line_5204'>and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house</a>
<a id='line_5205'>of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the</a>
<a id='line_5206'>LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great</a>
<a id='line_5207'>store.</a>
<a id='line_5208'></a>
<a id='line_5209'>31:11 Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the</a>
<a id='line_5210'>LORD; and they prepared them, 31:12 And brought in the offerings and</a>
<a id='line_5211'>the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah</a>
<a id='line_5212'>the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next.</a>
<a id='line_5213'></a>
<a id='line_5214'>31:13 And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth,</a>
<a id='line_5215'>and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were</a>
<a id='line_5216'>overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the</a>
<a id='line_5217'>commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house</a>
<a id='line_5218'>of God.</a>
<a id='line_5219'></a>
<a id='line_5220'>31:14 And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the</a>
<a id='line_5221'>east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the</a>
<a id='line_5222'>oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.</a>
<a id='line_5223'></a>
<a id='line_5224'>31:15 And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah,</a>
<a id='line_5225'>Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set</a>
<a id='line_5226'>office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as</a>
<a id='line_5227'>to the small: 31:16 Beside their genealogy of males, from three years</a>
<a id='line_5228'>old and upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of</a>
<a id='line_5229'>the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges</a>
<a id='line_5230'>according to their courses; 31:17 Both to the genealogy of the priests</a>
<a id='line_5231'>by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old</a>
<a id='line_5232'>and upward, in their charges by their courses; 31:18 And to the</a>
<a id='line_5233'>genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and</a>
<a id='line_5234'>their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office</a>
<a id='line_5235'>they sanctified themselves in holiness: 31:19 Also of the sons of</a>
<a id='line_5236'>Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of the suburbs of their</a>
<a id='line_5237'>cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to</a>
<a id='line_5238'>give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were</a>
<a id='line_5239'>reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.</a>
<a id='line_5240'></a>
<a id='line_5241'>31:20 And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that</a>
<a id='line_5242'>which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.</a>
<a id='line_5243'></a>
<a id='line_5244'>31:21 And in every work that he began in the service of the house of</a>
<a id='line_5245'>God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did</a>
<a id='line_5246'>it with all his heart, and prospered.</a>
<a id='line_5247'></a>
<a id='line_5248'>32:1 After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib</a>
<a id='line_5249'>king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the</a>
<a id='line_5250'>fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself.</a>
<a id='line_5251'></a>
<a id='line_5252'>32:2 And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was</a>
<a id='line_5253'>purposed to fight against Jerusalem, 32:3 He took counsel with his</a>
<a id='line_5254'>princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which</a>
<a id='line_5255'>were without the city: and they did help him.</a>
<a id='line_5256'></a>
<a id='line_5257'>32:4 So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the</a>
<a id='line_5258'>fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land,</a>
<a id='line_5259'>saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?</a>
<a id='line_5260'>32:5 Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was</a>
<a id='line_5261'>broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and</a>
<a id='line_5262'>repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in</a>
<a id='line_5263'>abundance.</a>
<a id='line_5264'></a>
<a id='line_5265'>32:6 And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them</a>
<a id='line_5266'>together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake</a>
<a id='line_5267'>comfortably to them, saying, 32:7 Be strong and courageous, be not</a>
<a id='line_5268'>afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude</a>
<a id='line_5269'>that is with him: for there be more with us than with him: 32:8 With</a>
<a id='line_5270'>him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us,</a>
<a id='line_5271'>and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the</a>
<a id='line_5272'>words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_5273'></a>
<a id='line_5274'>32:9 After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to</a>
<a id='line_5275'>Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his</a>
<a id='line_5276'>power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that</a>
<a id='line_5277'>were at Jerusalem, saying, 32:10 Thus saith Sennacherib king of</a>
<a id='line_5278'>Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?</a>
<a id='line_5279'>32:11 Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by</a>
<a id='line_5280'>famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of</a>
<a id='line_5281'>the hand of the king of Assyria?  32:12 Hath not the same Hezekiah</a>
<a id='line_5282'>taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and</a>
<a id='line_5283'>Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense</a>
<a id='line_5284'>upon it?  32:13 Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all</a>
<a id='line_5285'>the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands</a>
<a id='line_5286'>any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?  32:14 Who was</a>
<a id='line_5287'>there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly</a>
<a id='line_5288'>destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your</a>
<a id='line_5289'>God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?  32:15 Now</a>
<a id='line_5290'>therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this</a>
<a id='line_5291'>manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom</a>
<a id='line_5292'>was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand</a>
<a id='line_5293'>of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine</a>
<a id='line_5294'>hand?  32:16 And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and</a>
<a id='line_5295'>against his servant Hezekiah.</a>
<a id='line_5296'></a>
<a id='line_5297'>32:17 He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to</a>
<a id='line_5298'>speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands</a>
<a id='line_5299'>have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God</a>
<a id='line_5300'>of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.</a>
<a id='line_5301'></a>
<a id='line_5302'>32:18 Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ speech unto the</a>
<a id='line_5303'>people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to</a>
<a id='line_5304'>trouble them; that they might take the city.</a>
<a id='line_5305'></a>
<a id='line_5306'>32:19 And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods</a>
<a id='line_5307'>of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.</a>
<a id='line_5308'></a>
<a id='line_5309'>32:20 And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the</a>
<a id='line_5310'>son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.</a>
<a id='line_5311'></a>
<a id='line_5312'>32:21 And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of</a>
<a id='line_5313'>valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of</a>
<a id='line_5314'>Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when</a>
<a id='line_5315'>he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own</a>
<a id='line_5316'>bowels slew him there with the sword.</a>
<a id='line_5317'></a>
<a id='line_5318'>32:22 Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem</a>
<a id='line_5319'>from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of</a>
<a id='line_5320'>all other, and guided them on every side.</a>
<a id='line_5321'></a>
<a id='line_5322'>32:23 And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents</a>
<a id='line_5323'>to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of</a>
<a id='line_5324'>all nations from thenceforth.</a>
<a id='line_5325'></a>
<a id='line_5326'>32:24 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto</a>
<a id='line_5327'>the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.</a>
<a id='line_5328'></a>
<a id='line_5329'>32:25 But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done</a>
<a id='line_5330'>unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon</a>
<a id='line_5331'>him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5332'></a>
<a id='line_5333'>32:26 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his</a>
<a id='line_5334'>heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of</a>
<a id='line_5335'>the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</a>
<a id='line_5336'></a>
<a id='line_5337'>32:27 And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made</a>
<a id='line_5338'>himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones,</a>
<a id='line_5339'>and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant</a>
<a id='line_5340'>jewels; 32:28 Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and</a>
<a id='line_5341'>oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.</a>
<a id='line_5342'></a>
<a id='line_5343'>32:29 Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and</a>
<a id='line_5344'>herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.</a>
<a id='line_5345'></a>
<a id='line_5346'>32:30 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon,</a>
<a id='line_5347'>and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David.</a>
<a id='line_5348'>And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</a>
<a id='line_5349'></a>
<a id='line_5350'>32:31 Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of</a>
<a id='line_5351'>Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in</a>
<a id='line_5352'>the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in</a>
<a id='line_5353'>his heart.</a>
<a id='line_5354'></a>
<a id='line_5355'>32:32 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold,</a>
<a id='line_5356'>they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz,</a>
<a id='line_5357'>and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</a>
<a id='line_5358'></a>
<a id='line_5359'>32:33 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the</a>
<a id='line_5360'>chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the</a>
<a id='line_5361'>inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his</a>
<a id='line_5362'>son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_5363'></a>
<a id='line_5364'>33:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he</a>
<a id='line_5365'>reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem: 33:2 But did that which was</a>
<a id='line_5366'>evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the</a>
<a id='line_5367'>heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_5368'></a>
<a id='line_5369'>33:3 For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had</a>
<a id='line_5370'>broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and</a>
<a id='line_5371'>worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.</a>
<a id='line_5372'></a>
<a id='line_5373'>33:4 Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD</a>
<a id='line_5374'>had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.</a>
<a id='line_5375'></a>
<a id='line_5376'>33:5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts</a>
<a id='line_5377'>of the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5378'></a>
<a id='line_5379'>33:6 And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley</a>
<a id='line_5380'>of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments,</a>
<a id='line_5381'>and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with</a>
<a id='line_5382'>wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him</a>
<a id='line_5383'>to anger.</a>
<a id='line_5384'></a>
<a id='line_5385'>33:7 And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the</a>
<a id='line_5386'>house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son,</a>
<a id='line_5387'>In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the</a>
<a id='line_5388'>tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: 33:8 Neither will I any</a>
<a id='line_5389'>more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have</a>
<a id='line_5390'>appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that</a>
<a id='line_5391'>I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and</a>
<a id='line_5392'>the ordinances by the hand of Moses.</a>
<a id='line_5393'></a>
<a id='line_5394'>33:9 So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err,</a>
<a id='line_5395'>and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before</a>
<a id='line_5396'>the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_5397'></a>
<a id='line_5398'>33:10 And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they</a>
<a id='line_5399'>would not hearken.</a>
<a id='line_5400'></a>
<a id='line_5401'>33:11 Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of</a>
<a id='line_5402'>the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound</a>
<a id='line_5403'>him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_5404'></a>
<a id='line_5405'>33:12 And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and</a>
<a id='line_5406'>humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers, 33:13 And</a>
<a id='line_5407'>prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his</a>
<a id='line_5408'>supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_5409'>Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.</a>
<a id='line_5410'></a>
<a id='line_5411'>33:14 Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the</a>
<a id='line_5412'>west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish</a>
<a id='line_5413'>gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height,</a>
<a id='line_5414'>and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_5415'></a>
<a id='line_5416'>33:15 And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house</a>
<a id='line_5417'>of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the</a>
<a id='line_5418'>house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.</a>
<a id='line_5419'></a>
<a id='line_5420'>33:16 And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon</a>
<a id='line_5421'>peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the</a>
<a id='line_5422'>LORD God of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_5423'></a>
<a id='line_5424'>33:17 Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places,</a>
<a id='line_5425'>yet unto the LORD their God only.</a>
<a id='line_5426'></a>
<a id='line_5427'>33:18 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his</a>
<a id='line_5428'>God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the</a>
<a id='line_5429'>LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings</a>
<a id='line_5430'>of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_5431'></a>
<a id='line_5432'>33:19 His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his</a>
<a id='line_5433'>sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places,</a>
<a id='line_5434'>and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold,</a>
<a id='line_5435'>they are written among the sayings of the seers.</a>
<a id='line_5436'></a>
<a id='line_5437'>33:20 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his</a>
<a id='line_5438'>own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_5439'></a>
<a id='line_5440'>33:21 Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and</a>
<a id='line_5441'>reigned two years in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5442'></a>
<a id='line_5443'>33:22 But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did</a>
<a id='line_5444'>Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images</a>
<a id='line_5445'>which Manasseh his father had made, and served them; 33:23 And humbled</a>
<a id='line_5446'>not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled</a>
<a id='line_5447'>himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.</a>
<a id='line_5448'></a>
<a id='line_5449'>33:24 And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own</a>
<a id='line_5450'>house.</a>
<a id='line_5451'></a>
<a id='line_5452'>33:25 But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired</a>
<a id='line_5453'>against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king</a>
<a id='line_5454'>in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_5455'></a>
<a id='line_5456'>34:1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned</a>
<a id='line_5457'>in Jerusalem one and thirty years.</a>
<a id='line_5458'></a>
<a id='line_5459'>34:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_5460'>walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the</a>
<a id='line_5461'>right hand, nor to the left.</a>
<a id='line_5462'></a>
<a id='line_5463'>34:3 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he</a>
<a id='line_5464'>began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth</a>
<a id='line_5465'>year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and</a>
<a id='line_5466'>the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.</a>
<a id='line_5467'></a>
<a id='line_5468'>34:4 And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the</a>
<a id='line_5469'>images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and</a>
<a id='line_5470'>the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made</a>
<a id='line_5471'>dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had</a>
<a id='line_5472'>sacrificed unto them.</a>
<a id='line_5473'></a>
<a id='line_5474'>34:5 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and</a>
<a id='line_5475'>cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5476'></a>
<a id='line_5477'>34:6 And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon,</a>
<a id='line_5478'>even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.</a>
<a id='line_5479'></a>
<a id='line_5480'>34:7 And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had</a>
<a id='line_5481'>beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols</a>
<a id='line_5482'>throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5483'></a>
<a id='line_5484'>34:8 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the</a>
<a id='line_5485'>land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah</a>
<a id='line_5486'>the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to</a>
<a id='line_5487'>repair the house of the LORD his God.</a>
<a id='line_5488'></a>
<a id='line_5489'>34:9 And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the</a>
<a id='line_5490'>money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that</a>
<a id='line_5491'>kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and</a>
<a id='line_5492'>of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they</a>
<a id='line_5493'>returned to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5494'></a>
<a id='line_5495'>34:10 And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the</a>
<a id='line_5496'>oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen</a>
<a id='line_5497'>that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:</a>
<a id='line_5498'>34:11 Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn</a>
<a id='line_5499'>stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the</a>
<a id='line_5500'>kings of Judah had destroyed.</a>
<a id='line_5501'></a>
<a id='line_5502'>34:12 And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them</a>
<a id='line_5503'>were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and</a>
<a id='line_5504'>Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it</a>
<a id='line_5505'>forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments</a>
<a id='line_5506'>of musick.</a>
<a id='line_5507'></a>
<a id='line_5508'>34:13 Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers</a>
<a id='line_5509'>of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the</a>
<a id='line_5510'>Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.</a>
<a id='line_5511'></a>
<a id='line_5512'>34:14 And when they brought out the money that was brought into the</a>
<a id='line_5513'>house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the</a>
<a id='line_5514'>LORD given by Moses.</a>
<a id='line_5515'></a>
<a id='line_5516'>34:15 And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have</a>
<a id='line_5517'>found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah</a>
<a id='line_5518'>delivered the book to Shaphan.</a>
<a id='line_5519'></a>
<a id='line_5520'>34:16 And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king</a>
<a id='line_5521'>word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they</a>
<a id='line_5522'>do it.</a>
<a id='line_5523'></a>
<a id='line_5524'>34:17 And they have gathered together the money that was found in the</a>
<a id='line_5525'>house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_5526'>overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.</a>
<a id='line_5527'></a>
<a id='line_5528'>34:18 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the</a>
<a id='line_5529'>priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</a>
<a id='line_5530'></a>
<a id='line_5531'>34:19 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the</a>
<a id='line_5532'>law, that he rent his clothes.</a>
<a id='line_5533'></a>
<a id='line_5534'>34:20 And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan,</a>
<a id='line_5535'>and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a</a>
<a id='line_5536'>servant of the king’s, saying, 34:21 Go, enquire of the LORD for me,</a>
<a id='line_5537'>and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the</a>
<a id='line_5538'>words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_5539'>that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word</a>
<a id='line_5540'>of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.</a>
<a id='line_5541'></a>
<a id='line_5542'>34:22 And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to</a>
<a id='line_5543'>Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son</a>
<a id='line_5544'>of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the</a>
<a id='line_5545'>college:) and they spake to her to that effect.</a>
<a id='line_5546'></a>
<a id='line_5547'>34:23 And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell</a>
<a id='line_5548'>ye the man that sent you to me, 34:24 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I</a>
<a id='line_5549'>will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof,</a>
<a id='line_5550'>even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read</a>
<a id='line_5551'>before the king of Judah: 34:25 Because they have forsaken me, and</a>
<a id='line_5552'>have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to</a>
<a id='line_5553'>anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be</a>
<a id='line_5554'>poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</a>
<a id='line_5555'></a>
<a id='line_5556'>34:26 And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the</a>
<a id='line_5557'>LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel</a>
<a id='line_5558'>concerning the words which thou hast heard; 34:27 Because thine heart</a>
<a id='line_5559'>was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou</a>
<a id='line_5560'>heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants</a>
<a id='line_5561'>thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes,</a>
<a id='line_5562'>and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5563'></a>
<a id='line_5564'>34:28 Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be</a>
<a id='line_5565'>gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the</a>
<a id='line_5566'>evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of</a>
<a id='line_5567'>the same. So they brought the king word again.</a>
<a id='line_5568'></a>
<a id='line_5569'>34:29 Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah</a>
<a id='line_5570'>and Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5571'></a>
<a id='line_5572'>34:30 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men</a>
<a id='line_5573'>of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the</a>
<a id='line_5574'>Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their</a>
<a id='line_5575'>ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the</a>
<a id='line_5576'>house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5577'></a>
<a id='line_5578'>34:31 And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the</a>
<a id='line_5579'>LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his</a>
<a id='line_5580'>testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his</a>
<a id='line_5581'>soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this</a>
<a id='line_5582'>book.</a>
<a id='line_5583'></a>
<a id='line_5584'>34:32 And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to</a>
<a id='line_5585'>stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the</a>
<a id='line_5586'>covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</a>
<a id='line_5587'></a>
<a id='line_5588'>34:33 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the</a>
<a id='line_5589'>countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that</a>
<a id='line_5590'>were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And</a>
<a id='line_5591'>all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of</a>
<a id='line_5592'>their fathers.</a>
<a id='line_5593'></a>
<a id='line_5594'>35:1 Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and</a>
<a id='line_5595'>they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.</a>
<a id='line_5596'></a>
<a id='line_5597'>35:2 And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to</a>
<a id='line_5598'>the service of the house of the LORD, 35:3 And said unto the Levites</a>
<a id='line_5599'>that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy</a>
<a id='line_5600'>ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did</a>
<a id='line_5601'>build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the</a>
<a id='line_5602'>LORD your God, and his people Israel, 35:4 And prepare yourselves by</a>
<a id='line_5603'>the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the</a>
<a id='line_5604'>writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of</a>
<a id='line_5605'>Solomon his son.</a>
<a id='line_5606'></a>
<a id='line_5607'>35:5 And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the</a>
<a id='line_5608'>families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the</a>
<a id='line_5609'>division of the families of the Levites.</a>
<a id='line_5610'></a>
<a id='line_5611'>35:6 So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your</a>
<a id='line_5612'>brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the</a>
<a id='line_5613'>hand of Moses.</a>
<a id='line_5614'></a>
<a id='line_5615'>35:7 And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all</a>
<a id='line_5616'>for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number</a>
<a id='line_5617'>of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the</a>
<a id='line_5618'>king’s substance.</a>
<a id='line_5619'></a>
<a id='line_5620'>35:8 And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests,</a>
<a id='line_5621'>and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the</a>
<a id='line_5622'>house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two</a>
<a id='line_5623'>thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen.</a>
<a id='line_5624'></a>
<a id='line_5625'>35:9 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and</a>
<a id='line_5626'>Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the</a>
<a id='line_5627'>Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five</a>
<a id='line_5628'>hundred oxen.</a>
<a id='line_5629'></a>
<a id='line_5630'>35:10 So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their</a>
<a id='line_5631'>place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king’s</a>
<a id='line_5632'>commandment.</a>
<a id='line_5633'></a>
<a id='line_5634'>35:11 And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the</a>
<a id='line_5635'>blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.</a>
<a id='line_5636'></a>
<a id='line_5637'>35:12 And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give</a>
<a id='line_5638'>according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer</a>
<a id='line_5639'>unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they</a>
<a id='line_5640'>with the oxen.</a>
<a id='line_5641'></a>
<a id='line_5642'>35:13 And they roasted the passover with fire according to the</a>
<a id='line_5643'>ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in</a>
<a id='line_5644'>caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.</a>
<a id='line_5645'></a>
<a id='line_5646'>35:14 And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the</a>
<a id='line_5647'>priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering</a>
<a id='line_5648'>of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites</a>
<a id='line_5649'>prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</a>
<a id='line_5650'></a>
<a id='line_5651'>35:15 And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according</a>
<a id='line_5652'>to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the</a>
<a id='line_5653'>king’s seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not</a>
<a id='line_5654'>depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for</a>
<a id='line_5655'>them.</a>
<a id='line_5656'></a>
<a id='line_5657'>35:16 So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to</a>
<a id='line_5658'>keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the</a>
<a id='line_5659'>LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.</a>
<a id='line_5660'></a>
<a id='line_5661'>35:17 And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover</a>
<a id='line_5662'>at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</a>
<a id='line_5663'></a>
<a id='line_5664'>35:18 And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the</a>
<a id='line_5665'>days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep</a>
<a id='line_5666'>such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and</a>
<a id='line_5667'>all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of</a>
<a id='line_5668'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5669'></a>
<a id='line_5670'>35:19 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover</a>
<a id='line_5671'>kept.</a>
<a id='line_5672'></a>
<a id='line_5673'>35:20 After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king</a>
<a id='line_5674'>of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah</a>
<a id='line_5675'>went out against him.</a>
<a id='line_5676'></a>
<a id='line_5677'>35:21 But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with</a>
<a id='line_5678'>thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but</a>
<a id='line_5679'>against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make</a>
<a id='line_5680'>haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he</a>
<a id='line_5681'>destroy thee not.</a>
<a id='line_5682'></a>
<a id='line_5683'>35:22 Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but</a>
<a id='line_5684'>disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not</a>
<a id='line_5685'>unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in</a>
<a id='line_5686'>the valley of Megiddo.</a>
<a id='line_5687'></a>
<a id='line_5688'>35:23 And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his</a>
<a id='line_5689'>servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.</a>
<a id='line_5690'></a>
<a id='line_5691'>35:24 His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him</a>
<a id='line_5692'>in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_5693'>and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers.</a>
<a id='line_5694'>And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</a>
<a id='line_5695'></a>
<a id='line_5696'>35:25 And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and</a>
<a id='line_5697'>the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day,</a>
<a id='line_5698'>and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in</a>
<a id='line_5699'>the lamentations.</a>
<a id='line_5700'></a>
<a id='line_5701'>35:26 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according</a>
<a id='line_5702'>to that which was written in the law of the LORD, 35:27 And his deeds,</a>
<a id='line_5703'>first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of</a>
<a id='line_5704'>Israel and Judah.</a>
<a id='line_5705'></a>
<a id='line_5706'>36:1 Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and</a>
<a id='line_5707'>made him king in his father’s stead in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5708'></a>
<a id='line_5709'>36:2 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign,</a>
<a id='line_5710'>and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5711'></a>
<a id='line_5712'>36:3 And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned</a>
<a id='line_5713'>the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.</a>
<a id='line_5714'></a>
<a id='line_5715'>36:4 And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah</a>
<a id='line_5716'>and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took</a>
<a id='line_5717'>Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_5718'></a>
<a id='line_5719'>36:5 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign,</a>
<a id='line_5720'>and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was</a>
<a id='line_5721'>evil in the sight of the LORD his God.</a>
<a id='line_5722'></a>
<a id='line_5723'>36:6 Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him</a>
<a id='line_5724'>in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_5725'></a>
<a id='line_5726'>36:7 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the</a>
<a id='line_5727'>LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_5728'></a>
<a id='line_5729'>36:8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which</a>
<a id='line_5730'>he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in</a>
<a id='line_5731'>the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son</a>
<a id='line_5732'>reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_5733'></a>
<a id='line_5734'>36:9 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he</a>
<a id='line_5735'>reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which</a>
<a id='line_5736'>was evil in the sight of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5737'></a>
<a id='line_5738'>36:10 And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and</a>
<a id='line_5739'>brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the</a>
<a id='line_5740'>LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5741'></a>
<a id='line_5742'>36:11 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign,</a>
<a id='line_5743'>and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5744'></a>
<a id='line_5745'>36:12 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God,</a>
<a id='line_5746'>and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the</a>
<a id='line_5747'>mouth of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5748'></a>
<a id='line_5749'>36:13 And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made</a>
<a id='line_5750'>him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart</a>
<a id='line_5751'>from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_5752'></a>
<a id='line_5753'>36:14 Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people,</a>
<a id='line_5754'>transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and</a>
<a id='line_5755'>polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5756'></a>
<a id='line_5757'>36:15 And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his</a>
<a id='line_5758'>messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion</a>
<a id='line_5759'>on his people, and on his dwelling place: 36:16 But they mocked the</a>
<a id='line_5760'>messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets,</a>
<a id='line_5761'>until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was</a>
<a id='line_5762'>no remedy.</a>
<a id='line_5763'></a>
<a id='line_5764'>36:17 Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who</a>
<a id='line_5765'>slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary,</a>
<a id='line_5766'>and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that</a>
<a id='line_5767'>stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand.</a>
<a id='line_5768'></a>
<a id='line_5769'>36:18 And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and</a>
<a id='line_5770'>the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king,</a>
<a id='line_5771'>and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_5772'></a>
<a id='line_5773'>36:19 And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of</a>
<a id='line_5774'>Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed</a>
<a id='line_5775'>all the goodly vessels thereof.</a>
<a id='line_5776'></a>
<a id='line_5777'>36:20 And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to</a>
<a id='line_5778'>Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign</a>
<a id='line_5779'>of the kingdom of Persia: 36:21 To fulfil the word of the LORD by the</a>
<a id='line_5780'>mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as</a>
<a id='line_5781'>long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and</a>
<a id='line_5782'>ten years.</a>
<a id='line_5783'></a>
<a id='line_5784'>36:22 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of</a>
<a id='line_5785'>the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the</a>
<a id='line_5786'>LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a</a>
<a id='line_5787'>proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing,</a>
<a id='line_5788'>saying, 36:23 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the</a>
<a id='line_5789'>earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to</a>
<a id='line_5790'>build him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among</a>
<a id='line_5791'>you of all his people?  The LORD his God be with him, and let him go up.</a>
