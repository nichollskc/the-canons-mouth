<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>      In the second year of the reign of Valentinian and Valens, on the</a>
<a id='line_10'>      morning of the twenty-first day of July, the greatest part of the</a>
<a id='line_11'>      Roman world was shaken by a violent and destructive earthquake.</a>
<a id='line_12'>      The impression was communicated to the waters; the shores of the</a>
<a id='line_13'>      Mediterranean were left dry, by the sudden retreat of the sea;</a>
<a id='line_14'>      great quantities of fish were caught with the hand; large vessels</a>
<a id='line_15'>      were stranded on the mud; and a curious spectator 1 amused his</a>
<a id='line_16'>      eye, or rather his fancy, by contemplating the various appearance</a>
<a id='line_17'>      of valleys and mountains, which had never, since the formation of</a>
<a id='line_18'>      the globe, been exposed to the sun. But the tide soon returned,</a>
<a id='line_19'>      with the weight of an immense and irresistible deluge, which was</a>
<a id='line_20'>      severely felt on the coasts of Sicily, of Dalmatia, of Greece,</a>
<a id='line_21'>      and of Egypt: large boats were transported, and lodged on the</a>
<a id='line_22'>      roofs of houses, or at the distance of two miles from the shore;</a>
<a id='line_23'>      the people, with their habitations, were swept away by the</a>
<a id='line_24'>      waters; and the city of Alexandria annually commemorated the</a>
<a id='line_25'>      fatal day, on which fifty thousand persons had lost their lives</a>
<a id='line_26'>      in the inundation. This calamity, the report of which was</a>
<a id='line_27'>      magnified from one province to another, astonished and terrified</a>
<a id='line_28'>      the subjects of Rome; and their affrighted imagination enlarged</a>
<a id='line_29'>      the real extent of a momentary evil. They recollected the</a>
<a id='line_30'>      preceding earthquakes, which had subverted the cities of</a>
<a id='line_31'>      Palestine and Bithynia: they considered these alarming strokes as</a>
<a id='line_32'>      the prelude only of still more dreadful calamities, and their</a>
<a id='line_33'>      fearful vanity was disposed to confound the symptoms of a</a>
<a id='line_34'>      declining empire and a sinking world. 2 It was the fashion of the</a>
<a id='line_35'>      times to attribute every remarkable event to the particular will</a>
<a id='line_36'>      of the Deity; the alterations of nature were connected, by an</a>
<a id='line_37'>      invisible chain, with the moral and metaphysical opinions of the</a>
<a id='line_38'>      human mind; and the most sagacious divines could distinguish,</a>
<a id='line_39'>      according to the color of their respective prejudices, that the</a>
<a id='line_40'>      establishment of heresy tended to produce an earthquake; or that</a>
<a id='line_41'>      a deluge was the inevitable consequence of the progress of sin</a>
<a id='line_42'>      and error. Without presuming to discuss the truth or propriety of</a>
<a id='line_43'>      these lofty speculations, the historian may content himself with</a>
<a id='line_44'>      an observation, which seems to be justified by experience, that</a>
<a id='line_45'>      man has much more to fear from the passions of his</a>
<a id='line_46'>      fellow-creatures, than from the convulsions of the elements. 3</a>
<a id='line_47'>      The mischievous effects of an earthquake, or deluge, a hurricane,</a>
<a id='line_48'>      or the eruption of a volcano, bear a very inconsiderable portion</a>
<a id='line_49'>      to the ordinary calamities of war, as they are now moderated by</a>
<a id='line_50'>      the prudence or humanity of the princes of Europe, who amuse</a>
<a id='line_51'>      their own leisure, and exercise the courage of their subjects, in</a>
<a id='line_52'>      the practice of the military art. But the laws and manners of</a>
<a id='line_53'>      modern nations protect the safety and freedom of the vanquished</a>
<a id='line_54'>      soldier; and the peaceful citizen has seldom reason to complain,</a>
<a id='line_55'>      that his life, or even his fortune, is exposed to the rage of</a>
<a id='line_56'>      war. In the disastrous period of the fall of the Roman empire,</a>
<a id='line_57'>      which may justly be dated from the reign of Valens, the happiness</a>
<a id='line_58'>      and security of each individual were personally attacked; and the</a>
<a id='line_59'>      arts and labors of ages were rudely defaced by the Barbarians of</a>
<a id='line_60'>      Scythia and Germany. The invasion of the Huns precipitated on the</a>
<a id='line_61'>      provinces of the West the Gothic nation, which advanced, in less</a>
<a id='line_62'>      than forty years, from the Danube to the Atlantic, and opened a</a>
<a id='line_63'>      way, by the success of their arms, to the inroads of so many</a>
<a id='line_64'>      hostile tribes, more savage than themselves. The original</a>
<a id='line_65'>      principle of motion was concealed in the remote countries of the</a>
<a id='line_66'>      North; and the curious observation of the pastoral life of the</a>
<a id='line_67'>      Scythians, 4 or Tartars, 5 will illustrate the latent cause of</a>
<a id='line_68'>      these destructive emigrations.</a>

<a id='line_106'></a>
<a id='line_107'>      The different characters that mark the civilized nations of the</a>
<a id='line_108'>      globe, may be ascribed to the use, and the abuse, of reason;</a>
<a id='line_109'>      which so variously shapes, and so artificially composes, the</a>
<a id='line_110'>      manners and opinions of a European, or a Chinese. But the</a>
<a id='line_111'>      operation of instinct is more sure and simple than that of</a>
<a id='line_112'>      reason: it is much easier to ascertain the appetites of a</a>
<a id='line_113'>      quadruped than the speculations of a philosopher; and the savage</a>
<a id='line_114'>      tribes of mankind, as they approach nearer to the condition of</a>
<a id='line_115'>      animals, preserve a stronger resemblance to themselves and to</a>
<a id='line_116'>      each other. The uniform stability of their manners is the natural</a>
<a id='line_117'>      consequence of the imperfection of their faculties. Reduced to a</a>
<a id='line_118'>      similar situation, their wants, their desires, their enjoyments,</a>
<a id='line_119'>      still continue the same: and the influence of food or climate,</a>
<a id='line_120'>      which, in a more improved state of society, is suspended, or</a>
<a id='line_121'>      subdued, by so many moral causes, most powerfully contributes to</a>
<a id='line_122'>      form, and to maintain, the national character of Barbarians. In</a>
<a id='line_123'>      every age, the immense plains of Scythia, or Tartary, have been</a>
<a id='line_124'>      inhabited by vagrant tribes of hunters and shepherds, whose</a>
<a id='line_125'>      indolence refuses to cultivate the earth, and whose restless</a>
<a id='line_126'>      spirit disdains the confinement of a sedentary life. In every</a>
<a id='line_127'>      age, the Scythians, and Tartars, have been renowned for their</a>
<a id='line_128'>      invincible courage and rapid conquests. The thrones of Asia have</a>
<a id='line_129'>      been repeatedly overturned by the shepherds of the North; and</a>
<a id='line_130'>      their arms have spread terror and devastation over the most</a>
<a id='line_131'>      fertile and warlike countries of Europe. 6 On this occasion, as</a>
<a id='line_132'>      well as on many others, the sober historian is forcibly awakened</a>
<a id='line_133'>      from a pleasing vision; and is compelled, with some reluctance,</a>
<a id='line_134'>      to confess, that the pastoral manners, which have been adorned</a>
<a id='line_135'>      with the fairest attributes of peace and innocence, are much</a>
<a id='line_136'>      better adapted to the fierce and cruel habits of a military life.</a>
<a id='line_137'>      To illustrate this observation, I shall now proceed to consider a</a>
<a id='line_138'>      nation of shepherds and of warriors, in the three important</a>
<a id='line_139'>      articles of, I. Their diet; II. Their habitations; and, III.</a>
<a id='line_140'>      Their exercises. The narratives of antiquity are justified by the</a>
<a id='line_141'>      experience of modern times; 7 and the banks of the Borysthenes,</a>

<a id='line_177'>      I. The corn, or even the rice, which constitutes the ordinary and</a>
<a id='line_178'>      wholesome food of a civilized people, can be obtained only by the</a>
<a id='line_179'>      patient toil of the husbandman. Some of the happy savages, who</a>
<a id='line_180'>      dwell between the tropics, are plentifully nourished by the</a>
<a id='line_181'>      liberality of nature; but in the climates of the North, a nation</a>
<a id='line_182'>      of shepherds is reduced to their flocks and herds. The skilful</a>
<a id='line_183'>      practitioners of the medical art will determine (if they are able</a>
<a id='line_184'>      to determine) how far the temper of the human mind may be</a>
<a id='line_185'>      affected by the use of animal, or of vegetable, food; and whether</a>
<a id='line_186'>      the common association of carniverous and cruel deserves to be</a>
<a id='line_187'>      considered in any other light than that of an innocent, perhaps a</a>
<a id='line_188'>      salutary, prejudice of humanity. 9 Yet, if it be true, that the</a>
<a id='line_189'>      sentiment of compassion is imperceptibly weakened by the sight</a>
<a id='line_190'>      and practice of domestic cruelty, we may observe, that the horrid</a>
<a id='line_191'>      objects which are disguised by the arts of European refinement,</a>
<a id='line_192'>      are exhibited in their naked and most disgusting simplicity in</a>
<a id='line_193'>      the tent of a Tartarian shepherd. The ox, or the sheep, are</a>
<a id='line_194'>      slaughtered by the same hand from which they were accustomed to</a>
<a id='line_195'>      receive their daily food; and the bleeding limbs are served, with</a>
<a id='line_196'>      very little preparation, on the table of their unfeeling</a>
<a id='line_197'>      murderer. In the military profession, and especially in the</a>
<a id='line_198'>      conduct of a numerous army, the exclusive use of animal food</a>
<a id='line_199'>      appears to be productive of the most solid advantages. Corn is a</a>
<a id='line_200'>      bulky and perishable commodity; and the large magazines, which</a>
<a id='line_201'>      are indispensably necessary for the subsistence of our troops,</a>
<a id='line_202'>      must be slowly transported by the labor of men or horses. But the</a>
<a id='line_203'>      flocks and herds, which accompany the march of the Tartars,</a>
<a id='line_204'>      afford a sure and increasing supply of flesh and milk: in the far</a>
<a id='line_205'>      greater part of the uncultivated waste, the vegetation of the</a>
<a id='line_206'>      grass is quick and luxuriant; and there are few places so</a>
<a id='line_207'>      extremely barren, that the hardy cattle of the North cannot find</a>
<a id='line_208'>      some tolerable pasture.</a>
<a id='line_209'></a>
<a id='line_210'>      The supply is multiplied and prolonged by the undistinguishing</a>
<a id='line_211'>      appetite, and patient abstinence, of the Tartars. They</a>
<a id='line_212'>      indifferently feed on the flesh of those animals that have been</a>
<a id='line_213'>      killed for the table, or have died of disease. Horseflesh, which</a>
<a id='line_214'>      in every age and country has been proscribed by the civilized</a>
<a id='line_215'>      nations of Europe and Asia, they devour with peculiar greediness;</a>
<a id='line_216'>      and this singular taste facilitates the success of their military</a>
<a id='line_217'>      operations. The active cavalry of Scythia is always followed, in</a>
<a id='line_218'>      their most distant and rapid incursions, by an adequate number of</a>
<a id='line_219'>      spare horses, who may be occasionally used, either to redouble</a>
<a id='line_220'>      the speed, or to satisfy the hunger, of the Barbarians. Many are</a>
<a id='line_221'>      the resources of courage and poverty. When the forage round a</a>
<a id='line_222'>      camp of Tartars is almost consumed, they slaughter the greatest</a>
<a id='line_223'>      part of their cattle, and preserve the flesh, either smoked, or</a>
<a id='line_224'>      dried in the sun. On the sudden emergency of a hasty march, they</a>
<a id='line_225'>      provide themselves with a sufficient quantity of little balls of</a>
<a id='line_226'>      cheese, or rather of hard curd, which they occasionally dissolve</a>
<a id='line_227'>      in water; and this unsubstantial diet will support, for many</a>
<a id='line_228'>      days, the life, and even the spirits, of the patient warrior. But</a>
<a id='line_229'>      this extraordinary abstinence, which the Stoic would approve, and</a>
<a id='line_230'>      the hermit might envy, is commonly succeeded by the most</a>
<a id='line_231'>      voracious indulgence of appetite. The wines of a happier climate</a>
<a id='line_232'>      are the most grateful present, or the most valuable commodity,</a>
<a id='line_233'>      that can be offered to the Tartars; and the only example of their</a>
<a id='line_234'>      industry seems to consist in the art of extracting from mareÕs</a>
<a id='line_235'>      milk a fermented liquor, which possesses a very strong power of</a>
<a id='line_236'>      intoxication. Like the animals of prey, the savages, both of the</a>
<a id='line_237'>      old and new world, experience the alternate vicissitudes of</a>
<a id='line_238'>      famine and plenty; and their stomach is inured to sustain,</a>
<a id='line_239'>      without much inconvenience, the opposite extremes of hunger and</a>
<a id='line_240'>      of intemperance.</a>

<a id='line_251'>      II. In the ages of rustic and martial simplicity, a people of</a>
<a id='line_252'>      soldiers and husbandmen are dispersed over the face of an</a>
<a id='line_253'>      extensive and cultivated country; and some time must elapse</a>
<a id='line_254'>      before the warlike youth of Greece or Italy could be assembled</a>
<a id='line_255'>      under the same standard, either to defend their own confines, or</a>
<a id='line_256'>      to invade the territories of the adjacent tribes. The progress of</a>
<a id='line_257'>      manufactures and commerce insensibly collects a large multitude</a>
<a id='line_258'>      within the walls of a city: but these citizens are no longer</a>
<a id='line_259'>      soldiers; and the arts which adorn and improve the state of civil</a>
<a id='line_260'>      society, corrupt the habits of the military life. The pastoral</a>
<a id='line_261'>      manners of the Scythians seem to unite the different advantages</a>
<a id='line_262'>      of simplicity and refinement. The individuals of the same tribe</a>
<a id='line_263'>      are constantly assembled, but they are assembled in a camp; and</a>
<a id='line_264'>      the native spirit of these dauntless shepherds is animated by</a>
<a id='line_265'>      mutual support and emulation. The houses of the Tartars are no</a>
<a id='line_266'>      more than small tents, of an oval form, which afford a cold and</a>
<a id='line_267'>      dirty habitation, for the promiscuous youth of both sexes. The</a>
<a id='line_268'>      palaces of the rich consist of wooden huts, of such a size that</a>
<a id='line_269'>      they may be conveniently fixed on large wagons, and drawn by a</a>
<a id='line_270'>      team perhaps of twenty or thirty oxen. The flocks and herds,</a>
<a id='line_271'>      after grazing all day in the adjacent pastures, retire, on the</a>
<a id='line_272'>      approach of night, within the protection of the camp. The</a>
<a id='line_273'>      necessity of preventing the most mischievous confusion, in such a</a>
<a id='line_274'>      perpetual concourse of men and animals, must gradually introduce,</a>
<a id='line_275'>      in the distribution, the order, and the guard, of the encampment,</a>
<a id='line_276'>      the rudiments of the military art. As soon as the forage of a</a>
<a id='line_277'>      certain district is consumed, the tribe, or rather army, of</a>
<a id='line_278'>      shepherds, makes a regular march to some fresh pastures; and thus</a>
<a id='line_279'>      acquires, in the ordinary occupations of the pastoral life, the</a>
<a id='line_280'>      practical knowledge of one of the most important and difficult</a>
<a id='line_281'>      operations of war. The choice of stations is regulated by the</a>
<a id='line_282'>      difference of the seasons: in the summer, the Tartars advance</a>
<a id='line_283'>      towards the North, and pitch their tents on the banks of a river,</a>
<a id='line_284'>      or, at least, in the neighborhood of a running stream. But in the</a>
<a id='line_285'>      winter, they return to the South, and shelter their camp, behind</a>
<a id='line_286'>      some convenient eminence, against the winds, which are chilled in</a>
<a id='line_287'>      their passage over the bleak and icy regions of Siberia. These</a>
<a id='line_288'>      manners are admirably adapted to diffuse, among the wandering</a>
<a id='line_289'>      tribes, the spirit of emigration and conquest. The connection</a>
<a id='line_290'>      between the people and their territory is of so frail a texture,</a>
<a id='line_291'>      that it may be broken by the slightest accident. The camp, and</a>
<a id='line_292'>      not the soil, is the native country of the genuine Tartar. Within</a>
<a id='line_293'>      the precincts of that camp, his family, his companions, his</a>
<a id='line_294'>      property, are always included; and, in the most distant marches,</a>
<a id='line_295'>      he is still surrounded by the objects which are dear, or</a>
<a id='line_296'>      valuable, or familiar in his eyes. The thirst of rapine, the</a>
<a id='line_297'>      fear, or the resentment of injury, the impatience of servitude,</a>
<a id='line_298'>      have, in every age, been sufficient causes to urge the tribes of</a>
<a id='line_299'>      Scythia boldly to advance into some unknown countries, where they</a>
<a id='line_300'>      might hope to find a more plentiful subsistence or a less</a>
<a id='line_301'>      formidable enemy. The revolutions of the North have frequently</a>
<a id='line_302'>      determined the fate of the South; and in the conflict of hostile</a>
<a id='line_303'>      nations, the victor and the vanquished have alternately drove,</a>
<a id='line_304'>      and been driven, from the confines of China to those of Germany.</a>
<a id='line_305'>      10 These great emigrations, which have been sometimes executed</a>
<a id='line_306'>      with almost incredible diligence, were rendered more easy by the</a>
<a id='line_307'>      peculiar nature of the climate. It is well known that the cold of</a>
<a id='line_308'>      Tartary is much more severe than in the midst of the temperate</a>
<a id='line_309'>      zone might reasonably be expected; this uncommon rigor is</a>
<a id='line_310'>      attributed to the height of the plains, which rise, especially</a>
<a id='line_311'>      towards the East, more than half a mile above the level of the</a>
<a id='line_312'>      sea; and to the quantity of saltpetre with which the soil is</a>
<a id='line_313'>      deeply impregnated. 11 In the winter season, the broad and rapid</a>
<a id='line_314'>      rivers, that discharge their waters into the Euxine, the Caspian,</a>
<a id='line_315'>      or the Icy Sea, are strongly frozen; the fields are covered with</a>
<a id='line_316'>      a bed of snow; and the fugitive, or victorious, tribes may</a>
<a id='line_317'>      securely traverse, with their families, their wagons, and their</a>

<a id='line_334'>      III. The pastoral life, compared with the labors of agriculture</a>
<a id='line_335'>      and manufactures, is undoubtedly a life of idleness; and as the</a>
<a id='line_336'>      most honorable shepherds of the Tartar race devolve on their</a>
<a id='line_337'>      captives the domestic management of the cattle, their own leisure</a>
<a id='line_338'>      is seldom disturbed by any servile and assiduous cares. But this</a>
<a id='line_339'>      leisure, instead of being devoted to the soft enjoyments of love</a>
<a id='line_340'>      and harmony, is usefully spent in the violent and sanguinary</a>
<a id='line_341'>      exercise of the chase. The plains of Tartary are filled with a</a>
<a id='line_342'>      strong and serviceable breed of horses, which are easily trained</a>
<a id='line_343'>      for the purposes of war and hunting. The Scythians of every age</a>
<a id='line_344'>      have been celebrated as bold and skilful riders; and constant</a>
<a id='line_345'>      practice had seated them so firmly on horseback, that they were</a>
<a id='line_346'>      supposed by strangers to perform the ordinary duties of civil</a>
<a id='line_347'>      life, to eat, to drink, and even to sleep, without dismounting</a>
<a id='line_348'>      from their steeds. They excel in the dexterous management of the</a>
<a id='line_349'>      lance; the long Tartar bow is drawn with a nervous arm; and the</a>
<a id='line_350'>      weighty arrow is directed to its object with unerring aim and</a>
<a id='line_351'>      irresistible force. These arrows are often pointed against the</a>
<a id='line_352'>      harmless animals of the desert, which increase and multiply in</a>
<a id='line_353'>      the absence of their most formidable enemy; the hare, the goat,</a>
<a id='line_354'>      the roebuck, the fallow-deer, the stag, the elk, and the</a>
<a id='line_355'>      antelope. The vigor and patience, both of the men and horses, are</a>
<a id='line_356'>      continually exercised by the fatigues of the chase; and the</a>
<a id='line_357'>      plentiful supply of game contributes to the subsistence, and even</a>
<a id='line_358'>      luxury, of a Tartar camp. But the exploits of the hunters of</a>
<a id='line_359'>      Scythia are not confined to the destruction of timid or innoxious</a>
<a id='line_360'>      beasts; they boldly encounter the angry wild boar, when he turns</a>
<a id='line_361'>      against his pursuers, excite the sluggish courage of the bear,</a>
<a id='line_362'>      and provoke the fury of the tiger, as he slumbers in the thicket.</a>
<a id='line_363'>      Where there is danger, there may be glory; and the mode of</a>
<a id='line_364'>      hunting, which opens the fairest field to the exertions of valor,</a>
<a id='line_365'>      may justly be considered as the image, and as the school, of war.</a>
<a id='line_366'>      The general hunting matches, the pride and delight of the Tartar</a>
<a id='line_367'>      princes, compose an instructive exercise for their numerous</a>
<a id='line_368'>      cavalry. A circle is drawn, of many miles in circumference, to</a>
<a id='line_369'>      encompass the game of an extensive district; and the troops that</a>
<a id='line_370'>      form the circle regularly advance towards a common centre; where</a>
<a id='line_371'>      the captive animals, surrounded on every side, are abandoned to</a>
<a id='line_372'>      the darts of the hunters. In this march, which frequently</a>
<a id='line_373'>      continues many days, the cavalry are obliged to climb the hills,</a>
<a id='line_374'>      to swim the rivers, and to wind through the valleys, without</a>
<a id='line_375'>      interrupting the prescribed order of their gradual progress. They</a>
<a id='line_376'>      acquire the habit of directing their eye, and their steps, to a</a>
<a id='line_377'>      remote object; of preserving their intervals of suspending or</a>
<a id='line_378'>      accelerating their pace, according to the motions of the troops</a>
<a id='line_379'>      on their right and left; and of watching and repeating the</a>
<a id='line_380'>      signals of their leaders. Their leaders study, in this practical</a>
<a id='line_381'>      school, the most important lesson of the military art; the prompt</a>
<a id='line_382'>      and accurate judgment of ground, of distance, and of time. To</a>
<a id='line_383'>      employ against a human enemy the same patience and valor, the</a>
<a id='line_384'>      same skill and discipline, is the only alteration which is</a>
<a id='line_385'>      required in real war; and the amusements of the chase serve as a</a>
<a id='line_386'>      prelude to the conquest of an empire. 12</a>

<a id='line_397'>      The political society of the ancient Germans has the appearance</a>
<a id='line_398'>      of a voluntary alliance of independent warriors. The tribes of</a>
<a id='line_399'>      Scythia, distinguished by the modern appellation of _Hords_,</a>
<a id='line_400'>      assume the form of a numerous and increasing family; which, in</a>
<a id='line_401'>      the course of successive generations, has been propagated from</a>
<a id='line_402'>      the same original stock. The meanest, and most ignorant, of the</a>
<a id='line_403'>      Tartars, preserve, with conscious pride, the inestimable treasure</a>
<a id='line_404'>      of their genealogy; and whatever distinctions of rank may have</a>
<a id='line_405'>      been introduced, by the unequal distribution of pastoral wealth,</a>
<a id='line_406'>      they mutually respect themselves, and each other, as the</a>
<a id='line_407'>      descendants of the first founder of the tribe. The custom, which</a>
<a id='line_408'>      still prevails, of adopting the bravest and most faithful of the</a>
<a id='line_409'>      captives, may countenance the very probable suspicion, that this</a>
<a id='line_410'>      extensive consanguinity is, in a great measure, legal and</a>
<a id='line_411'>      fictitious. But the useful prejudice, which has obtained the</a>
<a id='line_412'>      sanction of time and opinion, produces the effects of truth; the</a>
<a id='line_413'>      haughty Barbarians yield a cheerful and voluntary obedience to</a>
<a id='line_414'>      the head of their blood; and their chief, or _mursa_, as the</a>
<a id='line_415'>      representative of their great father, exercises the authority of</a>
<a id='line_416'>      a judge in peace, and of a leader in war. In the original state</a>
<a id='line_417'>      of the pastoral world, each of the _mursas_ (if we may continue</a>
<a id='line_418'>      to use a modern appellation) acted as the independent chief of a</a>
<a id='line_419'>      large and separate family; and the limits of their peculiar</a>
<a id='line_420'>      territories were gradually fixed by superior force, or mutual</a>
<a id='line_421'>      consent. But the constant operation of various and permanent</a>
<a id='line_422'>      causes contributed to unite the vagrant Hords into national</a>
<a id='line_423'>      communities, under the command of a supreme head. The weak were</a>
<a id='line_424'>      desirous of support, and the strong were ambitious of dominion;</a>
<a id='line_425'>      the power, which is the result of union, oppressed and collected</a>
<a id='line_426'>      the divided force of the adjacent tribes; and, as the vanquished</a>
<a id='line_427'>      were freely admitted to share the advantages of victory, the most</a>
<a id='line_428'>      valiant chiefs hastened to range themselves and their followers</a>
<a id='line_429'>      under the formidable standard of a confederate nation. The most</a>
<a id='line_430'>      successful of the Tartar princes assumed the military command, to</a>
<a id='line_431'>      which he was entitled by the superiority, either of merit or of</a>
<a id='line_432'>      power. He was raised to the throne by the acclamations of his</a>
<a id='line_433'>      equals; and the title of _Khan_ expresses, in the language of the</a>
<a id='line_434'>      North of Asia, the full extent of the regal dignity. The right of</a>
<a id='line_435'>      hereditary succession was long confined to the blood of the</a>
<a id='line_436'>      founder of the monarchy; and at this moment all the Khans, who</a>
<a id='line_437'>      reign from Crimea to the wall of China, are the lineal</a>
<a id='line_438'>      descendants of the renowned Zingis. 13 But, as it is the</a>
<a id='line_439'>      indispensable duty of a Tartar sovereign to lead his warlike</a>
<a id='line_440'>      subjects into the field, the claims of an infant are often</a>
<a id='line_441'>      disregarded; and some royal kinsman, distinguished by his age and</a>
<a id='line_442'>      valor, is intrusted with the sword and sceptre of his</a>
<a id='line_443'>      predecessor. Two distinct and regular taxes are levied on the</a>
<a id='line_444'>      tribes, to support the dignity of the national monarch, and of</a>
<a id='line_445'>      their peculiar chief; and each of those contributions amounts to</a>
<a id='line_446'>      the tithe, both of their property, and of their spoil. A Tartar</a>
<a id='line_447'>      sovereign enjoys the tenth part of the wealth of his people; and</a>
<a id='line_448'>      as his own domestic riches of flocks and herds increase in a much</a>
<a id='line_449'>      larger proportion, he is able plentifully to maintain the rustic</a>
<a id='line_450'>      splendor of his court, to reward the most deserving, or the most</a>
<a id='line_451'>      favored of his followers, and to obtain, from the gentle</a>
<a id='line_452'>      influence of corruption, the obedience which might be sometimes</a>
<a id='line_453'>      refused to the stern mandates of authority. The manners of his</a>
<a id='line_454'>      subjects, accustomed, like himself, to blood and rapine, might</a>
<a id='line_455'>      excuse, in their eyes, such partial acts of tyranny, as would</a>
<a id='line_456'>      excite the horror of a civilized people; but the power of a</a>
<a id='line_457'>      despot has never been acknowledged in the deserts of Scythia. The</a>
<a id='line_458'>      immediate jurisdiction of the khan is confined within the limits</a>
<a id='line_459'>      of his own tribe; and the exercise of his royal prerogative has</a>
<a id='line_460'>      been moderated by the ancient institution of a national council.</a>
<a id='line_461'>      The Coroulai, 14 or Diet, of the Tartars, was regularly held in</a>

<a id='line_502'>      the South, the Greeks, the Persians, and the Chinese. The Greeks,</a>
<a id='line_503'>      who navigated the Euxine, and planted their colonies along the</a>
<a id='line_504'>      sea-coast, made the gradual and imperfect discovery of Scythia;</a>

<a id='line_506'>      M¾otis, the seat of eternal winter, and Mount Caucasus, which, in</a>
<a id='line_507'>      the language of poetry, was described as the utmost boundary of</a>
<a id='line_508'>      the earth. They celebrated, with simple credulity, the virtues of</a>
<a id='line_509'>      the pastoral life: 17 they entertained a more rational</a>
<a id='line_510'>      apprehension of the strength and numbers of the warlike</a>
<a id='line_511'>      Barbarians, 18 who contemptuously baffled the immense armament of</a>
<a id='line_512'>      Darius, the son of Hystaspes. 19 The Persian monarchs had</a>
<a id='line_513'>      extended their western conquests to the banks of the Danube, and</a>
<a id='line_514'>      the limits of European Scythia. The eastern provinces of their</a>
<a id='line_515'>      empire were exposed to the Scythians of Asia; the wild</a>
<a id='line_516'>      inhabitants of the plains beyond the Oxus and the Jaxartes, two</a>
<a id='line_517'>      mighty rivers, which direct their course towards the Caspian Sea.</a>
<a id='line_518'>      The long and memorable quarrel of Iran and Touran is still the</a>
<a id='line_519'>      theme of history or romance: the famous, perhaps the fabulous,</a>

<a id='line_521'>      signalized, in the defence of their country, against the</a>
<a id='line_522'>      Afrasiabs of the North; 20 and the invincible spirit of the same</a>
<a id='line_523'>      Barbarians resisted, on the same ground, the victorious arms of</a>
<a id='line_524'>      Cyrus and Alexander. 21 In the eyes of the Greeks and Persians,</a>
<a id='line_525'>      the real geography of Scythia was bounded, on the East, by the</a>

<a id='line_530'>      ascends, by a probable tradition, above forty centuries; 23 and</a>

<a id='line_660'>      The Huns, who under the reign of Valens threatened the empire of</a>
<a id='line_661'>      Rome, had been formidable, in a much earlier period, to the</a>
<a id='line_662'>      empire of China. 27 Their ancient, perhaps their original, seat</a>
<a id='line_663'>      was an extensive, though dry and barren, tract of country,</a>
<a id='line_664'>      immediately on the north side of the great wall. Their place is</a>
<a id='line_665'>      at present occupied by the forty-nine Hords or Banners of the</a>
<a id='line_666'>      Mongous, a pastoral nation, which consists of about two hundred</a>
<a id='line_667'>      thousand families. 28 But the valor of the Huns had extended the</a>
<a id='line_668'>      narrow limits of their dominions; and their rustic chiefs, who</a>
<a id='line_669'>      assumed the appellation of _Tanjou_, gradually became the</a>
<a id='line_670'>      conquerors, and the sovereigns of a formidable empire. Towards</a>
<a id='line_671'>      the East, their victorious arms were stopped only by the ocean;</a>
<a id='line_672'>      and the tribes, which are thinly scattered between the Amoor and</a>
<a id='line_673'>      the extreme peninsula of Corea, adhered, with reluctance, to the</a>
<a id='line_674'>      standard of the Huns. On the West, near the head of the Irtish,</a>
<a id='line_675'>      in the valleys of Imaus, they found a more ample space, and more</a>
<a id='line_676'>      numerous enemies. One of the lieutenants of the Tanjou subdued,</a>
<a id='line_677'>      in a single expedition, twenty-six nations; the Igours, 29</a>
<a id='line_678'>      distinguished above the Tartar race by the use of letters, were</a>
<a id='line_679'>      in the number of his vassals; and, by the strange connection of</a>
<a id='line_680'>      human events, the flight of one of those vagrant tribes recalled</a>
<a id='line_681'>      the victorious Parthians from the invasion of Syria. 30 On the</a>
<a id='line_682'>      side of the North, the ocean was assigned as the limit of the</a>
<a id='line_683'>      power of the Huns. Without enemies to resist their progress, or</a>
<a id='line_684'>      witnesses to contradict their vanity, they might securely achieve</a>
<a id='line_685'>      a real, or imaginary, conquest of the frozen regions of Siberia.</a>
<a id='line_686'>      The _Northern Sea_ was fixed as the remote boundary of their</a>
<a id='line_687'>      empire. But the name of that sea, on whose shores the patriot</a>
<a id='line_688'>      Sovou embraced the life of a shepherd and an exile, 31 may be</a>
<a id='line_689'>      transferred, with much more probability, to the Baikal, a</a>
<a id='line_690'>      capacious basin, above three hundred miles in length, which</a>
<a id='line_691'>      disdains the modest appellation of a lake 32 and which actually</a>
<a id='line_692'>      communicates with the seas of the North, by the long course of</a>
<a id='line_693'>      the Angara, the Tongusha, and the Jenissea. The submission of so</a>
<a id='line_694'>      many distant nations might flatter the pride of the Tanjou; but</a>
<a id='line_695'>      the valor of the Huns could be rewarded only by the enjoyment of</a>
<a id='line_696'>      the wealth and luxury of the empire of the South. In the third</a>
<a id='line_697'>      century 3211 before the Christian ¾ra, a wall of fifteen hundred</a>
<a id='line_698'>      miles in length was constructed, to defend the frontiers of China</a>
<a id='line_699'>      against the inroads of the Huns; 33 but this stupendous work,</a>
<a id='line_700'>      which holds a conspicuous place in the map of the world, has</a>
<a id='line_701'>      never contributed to the safety of an unwarlike people. The</a>
<a id='line_702'>      cavalry of the Tanjou frequently consisted of two or three</a>
<a id='line_703'>      hundred thousand men, formidable by the matchless dexterity with</a>
<a id='line_704'>      which they managed their bows and their horses: by their hardy</a>
<a id='line_705'>      patience in supporting the inclemency of the weather; and by the</a>
<a id='line_706'>      incredible speed of their march, which was seldom checked by</a>
<a id='line_707'>      torrents, or precipices, by the deepest rivers, or by the most</a>
<a id='line_708'>      lofty mountains. They spread themselves at once over the face of</a>
<a id='line_709'>      the country; and their rapid impetuosity surprised, astonished,</a>
<a id='line_710'>      and disconcerted the grave and elaborate tactics of a Chinese</a>
<a id='line_711'>      army. The emperor Kaoti, 34 a soldier of fortune, whose personal</a>
<a id='line_712'>      merit had raised him to the throne, marched against the Huns with</a>
<a id='line_713'>      those veteran troops which had been trained in the civil wars of</a>
<a id='line_714'>      China. But he was soon surrounded by the Barbarians; and, after a</a>
<a id='line_715'>      siege of seven days, the monarch, hopeless of relief, was reduced</a>
<a id='line_716'>      to purchase his deliverance by an ignominious capitulation. The</a>
<a id='line_717'>      successors of Kaoti, whose lives were dedicated to the arts of</a>
<a id='line_718'>      peace, or the luxury of the palace, submitted to a more permanent</a>
<a id='line_719'>      disgrace. They too hastily confessed the insufficiency of arms</a>
<a id='line_720'>      and fortifications. They were too easily convinced, that while</a>
<a id='line_721'>      the blazing signals announced on every side the approach of the</a>
<a id='line_722'>      Huns, the Chinese troops, who slept with the helmet on their</a>
<a id='line_723'>      head, and the cuirass on their back, were destroyed by the</a>
<a id='line_724'>      incessant labor of ineffectual marches. 35 A regular payment of</a>
<a id='line_725'>      money, and silk, was stipulated as the condition of a temporary</a>
<a id='line_726'>      and precarious peace; and the wretched expedient of disguising a</a>
<a id='line_727'>      real tribute, under the names of a gift or subsidy, was practised</a>
<a id='line_728'>      by the emperors of China as well as by those of Rome. But there</a>
<a id='line_729'>      still remained a more disgraceful article of tribute, which</a>
<a id='line_730'>      violated the sacred feelings of humanity and nature. The</a>
<a id='line_731'>      hardships of the savage life, which destroy in their infancy the</a>
<a id='line_732'>      children who are born with a less healthy and robust</a>
<a id='line_733'>      constitution, introduced a remarkable disproportion between the</a>
<a id='line_734'>      numbers of the two sexes. The Tartars are an ugly and even</a>
<a id='line_735'>      deformed race; and while they consider their own women as the</a>
<a id='line_736'>      instruments of domestic labor, their desires, or rather their</a>
<a id='line_737'>      appetites, are directed to the enjoyment of more elegant beauty.</a>
<a id='line_738'>      A select band of the fairest maidens of China was annually</a>
<a id='line_739'>      devoted to the rude embraces of the Huns; 36 and the alliance of</a>
<a id='line_740'>      the haughty Tanjous was secured by their marriage with the</a>
<a id='line_741'>      genuine, or adopted, daughters of the Imperial family, which</a>
<a id='line_742'>      vainly attempted to escape the sacrilegious pollution. The</a>
<a id='line_743'>      situation of these unhappy victims is described in the verses of</a>
<a id='line_744'>      a Chinese princess, who laments that she had been condemned by</a>
<a id='line_745'>      her parents to a distant exile, under a Barbarian husband; who</a>
<a id='line_746'>      complains that sour milk was her only drink, raw flesh her only</a>
<a id='line_747'>      food, a tent her only palace; and who expresses, in a strain of</a>
<a id='line_748'>      pathetic simplicity, the natural wish, that she were transformed</a>

<a id='line_770'>      91 J. C., were dispersed by the Chinese, and assumed the name of</a>

<a id='line_864'>      and policy of Vouti, 38 the fifth emperor of the powerful dynasty</a>
<a id='line_865'>      of the Han. In his long reign of fifty- four years, the</a>
<a id='line_866'>      Barbarians of the southern provinces submitted to the laws and</a>
<a id='line_867'>      manners of China; and the ancient limits of the monarchy were</a>
<a id='line_868'>      enlarged, from the great river of Kiang, to the port of Canton.</a>
<a id='line_869'>      Instead of confining himself to the timid operations of a</a>
<a id='line_870'>      defensive war, his lieutenants penetrated many hundred miles into</a>
<a id='line_871'>      the country of the Huns. In those boundless deserts, where it is</a>
<a id='line_872'>      impossible to form magazines, and difficult to transport a</a>
<a id='line_873'>      sufficient supply of provisions, the armies of Vouti were</a>
<a id='line_874'>      repeatedly exposed to intolerable hardships: and, of one hundred</a>
<a id='line_875'>      and forty thousand soldiers, who marched against the Barbarians,</a>
<a id='line_876'>      thirty thousand only returned in safety to the feet of their</a>
<a id='line_877'>      master. These losses, however, were compensated by splendid and</a>
<a id='line_878'>      decisive success. The Chinese generals improved the superiority</a>
<a id='line_879'>      which they derived from the temper of their arms, their chariots</a>
<a id='line_880'>      of war, and the service of their Tartar auxiliaries. The camp of</a>
<a id='line_881'>      the Tanjou was surprised in the midst of sleep and intemperance;</a>
<a id='line_882'>      and, though the monarch of the Huns bravely cut his way through</a>
<a id='line_883'>      the ranks of the enemy, he left above fifteen thousand of his</a>
<a id='line_884'>      subjects on the field of battle. Yet this signal victory, which</a>
<a id='line_885'>      was preceded and followed by many bloody engagements, contributed</a>
<a id='line_886'>      much less to the destruction of the power of the Huns than the</a>
<a id='line_887'>      effectual policy which was employed to detach the tributary</a>
<a id='line_888'>      nations from their obedience. Intimidated by the arms, or allured</a>
<a id='line_889'>      by the promises, of Vouti and his successors, the most</a>
<a id='line_890'>      considerable tribes, both of the East and of the West, disclaimed</a>
<a id='line_891'>      the authority of the Tanjou. While some acknowledged themselves</a>
<a id='line_892'>      the allies or vassals of the empire, they all became the</a>
<a id='line_893'>      implacable enemies of the Huns; and the numbers of that haughty</a>
<a id='line_894'>      people, as soon as they were reduced to their native strength,</a>
<a id='line_895'>      might, perhaps, have been contained within the walls of one of</a>
<a id='line_896'>      the great and populous cities of China. 39 The desertion of his</a>
<a id='line_897'>      subjects, and the perplexity of a civil war, at length compelled</a>
<a id='line_898'>      the Tanjou himself to renounce the dignity of an independent</a>
<a id='line_899'>      sovereign, and the freedom of a warlike and high-spirited nation.</a>
<a id='line_900'>      He was received at Sigan, the capital of the monarchy, by the</a>
<a id='line_901'>      troops, the mandarins, and the emperor himself, with all the</a>
<a id='line_902'>      honors that could adorn and disguise the triumph of Chinese</a>
<a id='line_903'>      vanity. 40 A magnificent palace was prepared for his reception;</a>
<a id='line_904'>      his place was assigned above all the princes of the royal family;</a>
<a id='line_905'>      and the patience of the Barbarian king was exhausted by the</a>
<a id='line_906'>      ceremonies of a banquet, which consisted of eight courses of</a>
<a id='line_907'>      meat, and of nine solemn pieces of music. But he performed, on</a>
<a id='line_908'>      his knees, the duty of a respectful homage to the emperor of</a>
<a id='line_909'>      China; pronounced, in his own name, and in the name of his</a>
<a id='line_910'>      successors, a perpetual oath of fidelity; and gratefully accepted</a>
<a id='line_911'>      a seal, which was bestowed as the emblem of his regal dependence.</a>
<a id='line_912'>      After this humiliating submission, the Tanjous sometimes departed</a>
<a id='line_913'>      from their allegiance and seized the favorable moments of war and</a>
<a id='line_914'>      rapine; but the monarchy of the Huns gradually declined, till it</a>
<a id='line_915'>      was broken, by civil dissension, into two hostile and separate</a>
<a id='line_916'>      kingdoms. One of the princes of the nation was urged, by fear and</a>
<a id='line_917'>      ambition, to retire towards the South with eight hords, which</a>
<a id='line_918'>      composed between forty and fifty thousand families. He obtained,</a>
<a id='line_919'>      with the title of Tanjou, a convenient territory on the verge of</a>
<a id='line_920'>      the Chinese provinces; and his constant attachment to the service</a>
<a id='line_921'>      of the empire was secured by weakness, and the desire of revenge.</a>
<a id='line_922'>      From the time of this fatal schism, the Huns of the North</a>

<a id='line_1008'>      the silks of China for the furs of Siberia; the imperfect</a>
<a id='line_1009'>      rudiments of civilized life were obliterated; and the native</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      fierceness of the Huns was exasperated by their intercourse with</a>

<a id='line_1354'>      received from the civil and military officers who were intrusted</a>
<a id='line_1355'>      with the defence of the Danube. He was informed, that the North</a>
<a id='line_1356'>      was agitated by a furious tempest; that the irruption of the</a>
<a id='line_1357'>      Huns, an unknown and monstrous race of savages, had subverted the</a>
<a id='line_1358'>      power of the Goths; and that the suppliant multitudes of that</a>
<a id='line_1359'>      warlike nation, whose pride was now humbled in the dust, covered</a>
<a id='line_1360'>      a space of many miles along the banks of the river. With</a>
<a id='line_1361'>      outstretched arms, and pathetic lamentations, they loudly</a>
<a id='line_1362'>      deplored their past misfortunes and their present danger;</a>
<a id='line_1363'>      acknowledged that their only hope of safety was in the clemency</a>
<a id='line_1364'>      of the Roman government; and most solemnly protested, that if the</a>
<a id='line_1365'>      gracious liberality of the emperor would permit them to cultivate</a>
<a id='line_1366'>      the waste lands of Thrace, they should ever hold themselves</a>
<a id='line_1367'>      bound, by the strongest obligations of duty and gratitude, to</a>
<a id='line_1368'>      obey the laws, and to guard the limits, of the republic. These</a>
<a id='line_1369'>      assurances were confirmed by the ambassadors of the Goths, 6411</a>
<a id='line_1370'>      who impatiently expected from the mouth of Valens an answer that</a>
<a id='line_1371'>      must finally determine the fate of their unhappy countrymen. The</a>
<a id='line_1372'>      emperor of the East was no longer guided by the wisdom and</a>
<a id='line_1373'>      authority of his elder brother, whose death happened towards the</a>
<a id='line_1374'>      end of the preceding year; and as the distressful situation of</a>
<a id='line_1375'>      the Goths required an instant and peremptory decision, he was</a>
<a id='line_1376'>      deprived of the favorite resources of feeble and timid minds, who</a>
<a id='line_1377'>      consider the use of dilatory and ambiguous measures as the most</a>
<a id='line_1378'>      admirable efforts of consummate prudence. As long as the same</a>
<a id='line_1379'>      passions and interests subsist among mankind, the questions of</a>
<a id='line_1380'>      war and peace, of justice and policy, which were debated in the</a>
<a id='line_1381'>      councils of antiquity, will frequently present themselves as the</a>
<a id='line_1382'>      subject of modern deliberation. But the most experienced</a>
<a id='line_1383'>      statesman of Europe has never been summoned to consider the</a>
<a id='line_1384'>      propriety, or the danger, of admitting, or rejecting, an</a>
<a id='line_1385'>      innumerable multitude of Barbarians, who are driven by despair</a>
<a id='line_1386'>      and hunger to solicit a settlement on the territories of a</a>

<a id='line_1388'>      connected with the public safety, was referred to the ministers</a>
<a id='line_1389'>      of Valens, they were perplexed and divided; but they soon</a>
<a id='line_1390'>      acquiesced in the flattering sentiment which seemed the most</a>
<a id='line_1391'>      favorable to the pride, the indolence, and the avarice of their</a>

<a id='line_1395'>      and accidental colonies, which had been received on the extreme</a>

<a id='line_1397'>      fortune, which had conducted, from the most distant countries of</a>
<a id='line_1398'>      the globe, a numerous and invincible army of strangers, to defend</a>
<a id='line_1399'>      the throne of Valens; who might now add to the royal treasures</a>
<a id='line_1400'>      the immense sums of gold supplied by the provincials to</a>
<a id='line_1401'>      compensate their annual proportion of recruits. The prayers of</a>
<a id='line_1402'>      the Goths were granted, and their service was accepted by the</a>

<a id='line_1585'>      rapaciousness of their tyrants had left to an injured people the</a>

<a id='line_1640'>      slow marches towards Marcianopolis, the capital of the Lower</a>

<a id='line_1642'>      fatal spot, the flames of discord and mutual hatred burst forth</a>
<a id='line_1643'>      into a dreadful conflagration. Lupicinus had invited the Gothic</a>

<a id='line_1645'>      remained under arms at the entrance of the palace. But the gates</a>
<a id='line_1646'>      of the city were strictly guarded, and the Barbarians were</a>
<a id='line_1647'>      sternly excluded from the use of a plentiful market, to which</a>
<a id='line_1648'>      they asserted their equal claim of subjects and allies. Their</a>
<a id='line_1649'>      humble prayers were rejected with insolence and derision; and as</a>
<a id='line_1650'>      their patience was now exhausted, the townsmen, the soldiers, and</a>

<a id='line_1655'>      destructive war. In the midst of noise and brutal intemperance,</a>
<a id='line_1656'>      Lupicinus was informed, by a secret messenger, that many of his</a>
<a id='line_1657'>      soldiers were slain, and despoiled of their arms; and as he was</a>
<a id='line_1658'>      already inflamed by wine, and oppressed by sleep he issued a rash</a>

<a id='line_1662'>      The clamorous shouts and dying groans apprised Fritigern of his</a>

<a id='line_1664'>      of a hero, he saw that he was lost if he allowed a moment of</a>

<a id='line_1671'>      Fritigern and his companions drew their swords, opened their</a>
<a id='line_1672'>      passage through the unresisting crowd, which filled the palace,</a>
<a id='line_1673'>      the streets, and the gates, of Marcianopolis, and, mounting their</a>
<a id='line_1674'>      horses, hastily vanished from the eyes of the astonished Romans.</a>
<a id='line_1675'>      The generals of the Goths were saluted by the fierce and joyful</a>
<a id='line_1676'>      acclamations of the camp; war was instantly resolved, and the</a>
<a id='line_1677'>      resolution was executed without delay: the banners of the nation</a>
<a id='line_1678'>      were displayed according to the custom of their ancestors; and</a>
<a id='line_1679'>      the air resounded with the harsh and mournful music of the</a>
<a id='line_1680'>      Barbarian trumpet. 71 The weak and guilty Lupicinus, who had</a>
<a id='line_1681'>      dared to provoke, who had neglected to destroy, and who still</a>
<a id='line_1682'>      presumed to despise, his formidable enemy, marched against the</a>
<a id='line_1683'>      Goths, at the head of such a military force as could be collected</a>
<a id='line_1684'>      on this sudden emergency. The Barbarians expected his approach</a>
<a id='line_1685'>      about nine miles from Marcianopolis; and on this occasion the</a>
<a id='line_1686'>      talents of the general were found to be of more prevailing</a>
<a id='line_1687'>      efficacy than the weapons and discipline of the troops. The valor</a>
<a id='line_1688'>      of the Goths was so ably directed by the genius of Fritigern,</a>
<a id='line_1689'>      that they broke, by a close and vigorous attack, the ranks of the</a>
<a id='line_1690'>      Roman legions. Lupicinus left his arms and standards, his</a>
<a id='line_1691'>      tribunes and his bravest soldiers, on the field of battle; and</a>
<a id='line_1692'>      their useless courage served only to protect the ignominious</a>
<a id='line_1693'>      flight of their leader. ÒThat successful day put an end to the</a>
<a id='line_1694'>      distress of the Barbarians, and the security of the Romans: from</a>
<a id='line_1695'>      that day, the Goths, renouncing the precarious condition of</a>
<a id='line_1696'>      strangers and exiles, assumed the character of citizens and</a>
<a id='line_1697'>      masters, claimed an absolute dominion over the possessors of</a>
<a id='line_1698'>      land, and held, in their own right, the northern provinces of the</a>
<a id='line_1699'>      empire, which are bounded by the Danube.Ó Such are the words of</a>
<a id='line_1700'>      the Gothic historian, 72 who celebrates, with rude eloquence, the</a>
<a id='line_1701'>      glory of his countrymen. But the dominion of the Barbarians was</a>
<a id='line_1702'>      exercised only for the purposes of rapine and destruction. As</a>
<a id='line_1703'>      they had been deprived, by the ministers of the emperor, of the</a>
<a id='line_1704'>      common benefits of nature, and the fair intercourse of social</a>
<a id='line_1705'>      life, they retaliated the injustice on the subjects of the</a>
<a id='line_1706'>      empire; and the crimes of Lupicinus were expiated by the ruin of</a>
<a id='line_1707'>      the peaceful husbandmen of Thrace, the conflagration of their</a>
<a id='line_1708'>      villages, and the massacre, or captivity, of their innocent</a>
<a id='line_1709'>      families. The report of the Gothic victory was soon diffused over</a>
<a id='line_1710'>      the adjacent country; and while it filled the minds of the Romans</a>
<a id='line_1711'>      with terror and dismay, their own hasty imprudence contributed to</a>
<a id='line_1712'>      increase the forces of Fritigern, and the calamities of the</a>
<a id='line_1713'>      province. Some time before the great emigration, a numerous body</a>
<a id='line_1714'>      of Goths, under the command of Suerid and Colias, had been</a>
<a id='line_1715'>      received into the protection and service of the empire. 73 They</a>
<a id='line_1716'>      were encamped under the walls of Hadrianople; but the ministers</a>
<a id='line_1717'>      of Valens were anxious to remove them beyond the Hellespont, at a</a>
<a id='line_1718'>      distance from the dangerous temptation which might so easily be</a>
<a id='line_1719'>      communicated by the neighborhood, and the success, of their</a>
<a id='line_1720'>      countrymen. The respectful submission with which they yielded to</a>
<a id='line_1721'>      the order of their march, might be considered as a proof of their</a>
<a id='line_1722'>      fidelity; and their moderate request of a sufficient allowance of</a>
<a id='line_1723'>      provisions, and of a delay of only two days was expressed in the</a>

<a id='line_1725'>      incensed by some disorders which had been committed at his</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      country-house, refused this indulgence; and arming against them</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      the inhabitants and manufacturers of a populous city, he urged,</a>
<a id='line_1728'>      with hostile threats, their instant departure. The Barbarians</a>
<a id='line_1729'>      stood silent and amazed, till they were exasperated by the</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      insulting clamors, and missile weapons, of the populace: but when</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      patience or contempt was fatigued, they crushed the undisciplined</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      multitude, inflicted many a shameful wound on the backs of their</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      flying enemies, and despoiled them of the splendid armor, 74</a>
<a id='line_1734'>      which they were unworthy to bear. The resemblance of their</a>
<a id='line_1735'>      sufferings and their actions soon united this victorious</a>
<a id='line_1736'>      detachment to the nation of the Visigoths; the troops of Colias</a>
<a id='line_1737'>      and Suerid expected the approach of the great Fritigern, ranged</a>
<a id='line_1738'>      themselves under his standard, and signalized their ardor in the</a>
<a id='line_1739'>      siege of Hadrianople. But the resistance of the garrison informed</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      the Barbarians, that in the attack of regular fortifications, the</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      efforts of unskillful courage are seldom effectual. Their general</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      acknowledged his error, raised the siege, declared that Òhe was</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      at peace with stone walls,Ó 75 and revenged his disappointment on</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      the adjacent country. He accepted, with pleasure, the useful</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      reenforcement of hardy workmen, who labored in the gold mines of</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      Thrace, 76 for the emolument, and under the lash, of an unfeeling</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      master: 77 and these new associates conducted the Barbarians,</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      through the secret paths, to the most sequestered places, which</a>
<a id='line_1749'>      had been chosen to secure the inhabitants, the cattle, and the</a>

<a id='line_1755'>      the Goths, who had been sold into captivity, were restored to the</a>

<a id='line_1835'>      domestics; and the auxiliaries of the West, that marched under</a>

<a id='line_1837'>      by a spirit of desertion, to the vain appearances of strength and</a>
<a id='line_1838'>      numbers. In a council of war, which was influenced by pride,</a>
<a id='line_1839'>      rather than by reason, it was resolved to seek, and to encounter,</a>
<a id='line_1840'>      the Barbarians, who lay encamped in the spacious and fertile</a>
<a id='line_1841'>      meadows, near the most southern of the six mouths of the Danube.</a>
<a id='line_1842'>      79 Their camp was surrounded by the usual fortification of</a>
<a id='line_1843'>      wagons; 80 and the Barbarians, secure within the vast circle of</a>
<a id='line_1844'>      the enclosure, enjoyed the fruits of their valor, and the spoils</a>
<a id='line_1845'>      of the province. In the midst of riotous intemperance, the</a>
<a id='line_1846'>      watchful Fritigern observed the motions, and penetrated the</a>
<a id='line_1847'>      designs, of the Romans. He perceived, that the numbers of the</a>
<a id='line_1848'>      enemy were continually increasing: and, as he understood their</a>
<a id='line_1849'>      intention of attacking his rear, as soon as the scarcity of</a>
<a id='line_1850'>      forage should oblige him to remove his camp, he recalled to their</a>
<a id='line_1851'>      standard his predatory detachments, which covered the adjacent</a>
<a id='line_1852'>      country. As soon as they descried the flaming beacons, 81 they</a>
<a id='line_1853'>      obeyed, with incredible speed, the signal of their leader: the</a>
<a id='line_1854'>      camp was filled with the martial crowd of Barbarians; their</a>
<a id='line_1855'>      impatient clamors demanded the battle, and their tumultuous zeal</a>
<a id='line_1856'>      was approved and animated by the spirit of their chiefs. The</a>
<a id='line_1857'>      evening was already far advanced; and the two armies prepared</a>
<a id='line_1858'>      themselves for the approaching combat, which was deferred only</a>
<a id='line_1859'>      till the dawn of day.</a>
<a id='line_1860'></a>
<a id='line_1861'>      While the trumpets sounded to arms, the undaunted courage of the</a>
<a id='line_1862'>      Goths was confirmed by the mutual obligation of a solemn oath;</a>
<a id='line_1863'>      and as they advanced to meet the enemy, the rude songs, which</a>
<a id='line_1864'>      celebrated the glory of their forefathers, were mingled with</a>
<a id='line_1865'>      their fierce and dissonant outcries, and opposed to the</a>
<a id='line_1866'>      artificial harmony of the Roman shout. Some military skill was</a>
<a id='line_1867'>      displayed by Fritigern to gain the advantage of a commanding</a>
<a id='line_1868'>      eminence; but the bloody conflict, which began and ended with the</a>
<a id='line_1869'>      light, was maintained on either side, by the personal and</a>
<a id='line_1870'>      obstinate efforts of strength, valor, and agility. The legions of</a>
<a id='line_1871'>      Armenia supported their fame in arms; but they were oppressed by</a>
<a id='line_1872'>      the irresistible weight of the hostile multitude the left wing of</a>
<a id='line_1873'>      the Romans was thrown into disorder and the field was strewed</a>
<a id='line_1874'>      with their mangled carcasses. This partial defeat was balanced,</a>
<a id='line_1875'>      however, by partial success; and when the two armies, at a late</a>
<a id='line_1876'>      hour of the evening, retreated to their respective camps, neither</a>
<a id='line_1877'>      of them could claim the honors, or the effects, of a decisive</a>
<a id='line_1878'>      victory. The real loss was more severely felt by the Romans, in</a>
<a id='line_1879'>      proportion to the smallness of their numbers; but the Goths were</a>
<a id='line_1880'>      so deeply confounded and dismayed by this vigorous, and perhaps</a>
<a id='line_1881'>      unexpected, resistance, that they remained seven days within the</a>
<a id='line_1882'>      circle of their fortifications. Such funeral rites, as the</a>

<a id='line_2012'>      imprudently, or maliciously, revealed the weakness of the Roman</a>

<a id='line_2014'>      nation of the Alemanni, and of the tribe of the Lentienses, who</a>
<a id='line_2015'>      dwelt beyond the Lake of Constance. Some domestic business</a>
<a id='line_2016'>      obliged him to request a leave of absence. In a short visit to</a>
<a id='line_2017'>      his family and friends, he was exposed to their curious</a>
<a id='line_2018'>      inquiries: and the vanity of the loquacious soldier tempted him</a>
<a id='line_2019'>      to display his intimate acquaintance with the secrets of the</a>
<a id='line_2020'>      state, and the designs of his master. The intelligence, that</a>
<a id='line_2021'>      Gratian was preparing to lead the military force of Gaul, and of</a>
<a id='line_2022'>      the West, to the assistance of his uncle Valens, pointed out to</a>
<a id='line_2023'>      the restless spirit of the Alemanni the moment, and the mode, of</a>
<a id='line_2024'>      a successful invasion. The enterprise of some light detachments,</a>
<a id='line_2025'>      who, in the month of February, passed the Rhine upon the ice, was</a>
<a id='line_2026'>      the prelude of a more important war. The boldest hopes of rapine,</a>
<a id='line_2027'>      perhaps of conquest, outweighed the considerations of timid</a>
<a id='line_2028'>      prudence, or national faith. Every forest, and every village,</a>
<a id='line_2029'>      poured forth a band of hardy adventurers; and the great army of</a>
<a id='line_2030'>      the Alemanni, which, on their approach, was estimated at forty</a>
<a id='line_2031'>      thousand men by the fears of the people, was afterwards magnified</a>
<a id='line_2032'>      to the number of seventy thousand by the vain and credulous</a>
<a id='line_2033'>      flattery of the Imperial court. The legions, which had been</a>
<a id='line_2034'>      ordered to march into Pannonia, were immediately recalled, or</a>
<a id='line_2035'>      detained, for the defence of Gaul; the military command was</a>
<a id='line_2036'>      divided between Nanienus and Mellobaudes; and the youthful</a>
<a id='line_2037'>      emperor, though he respected the long experience and sober wisdom</a>
<a id='line_2038'>      of the former, was much more inclined to admire, and to follow,</a>
<a id='line_2039'>      the martial ardor of his colleague; who was allowed to unite the</a>
<a id='line_2040'>      incompatible characters of count of the domestics, and of king of</a>
<a id='line_2041'>      the Franks. His rival Priarius, king of the Alemanni, was guided,</a>
<a id='line_2042'>      or rather impelled, by the same headstrong valor; and as their</a>
<a id='line_2043'>      troops were animated by the spirit of their leaders, they met,</a>
<a id='line_2044'>      they saw, they encountered each other, near the town of</a>
<a id='line_2045'>      Argentaria, or Colmar, 86 in the plains of Alsace. The glory of</a>
<a id='line_2046'>      the day was justly ascribed to the missile weapons, and</a>
<a id='line_2047'>      well-practised evolutions, of the Roman soldiers; the Alemanni,</a>
<a id='line_2048'>      who long maintained their ground, were slaughtered with</a>
<a id='line_2049'>      unrelenting fury; five thousand only of the Barbarians escaped to</a>
<a id='line_2050'>      the woods and mountains; and the glorious death of their king on</a>

<a id='line_2052'>      who are always disposed to accuse the justice, or policy, of an</a>
<a id='line_2053'>      unsuccessful war. After this signal victory, which secured the</a>
<a id='line_2054'>      peace of Gaul, and asserted the honor of the Roman arms, the</a>
<a id='line_2055'>      emperor Gratian appeared to proceed without delay on his Eastern</a>
<a id='line_2056'>      expedition; but as he approached the confines of the Alemanni, he</a>
<a id='line_2057'>      suddenly inclined to the left, surprised them by his unexpected</a>
<a id='line_2058'>      passage of the Rhine, and boldly advanced into the heart of their</a>
<a id='line_2059'>      country. The Barbarians opposed to his progress the obstacles of</a>
<a id='line_2060'>      nature and of courage; and still continued to retreat, from one</a>
<a id='line_2061'>      hill to another, till they were satisfied, by repeated trials, of</a>
<a id='line_2062'>      the power and perseverance of their enemies. Their submission was</a>
<a id='line_2063'>      accepted as a proof, not indeed of their sincere repentance, but</a>
<a id='line_2064'>      of their actual distress; and a select number of their brave and</a>
<a id='line_2065'>      robust youth was exacted from the faithless nation, as the most</a>
<a id='line_2066'>      substantial pledge of their future moderation. The subjects of</a>
<a id='line_2067'>      the empire, who had so often experienced that the Alemanni could</a>
<a id='line_2068'>      neither be subdued by arms, nor restrained by treaties, might not</a>
<a id='line_2069'>      promise themselves any solid or lasting tranquillity: but they</a>
<a id='line_2070'>      discovered, in the virtues of their young sovereign, the prospect</a>
<a id='line_2071'>      of a long and auspicious reign. When the legions climbed the</a>
<a id='line_2072'>      mountains, and scaled the fortifications of the Barbarians, the</a>
<a id='line_2073'>      valor of Gratian was distinguished in the foremost ranks; and the</a>
<a id='line_2074'>      gilt and variegated armor of his guards was pierced and shattered</a>
<a id='line_2075'>      by the blows which they had received in their constant attachment</a>

<a id='line_2111'>      Goths, who, by the diligence of Fritigern, were now collected in</a>

<a id='line_2113'>      been intercepted by the valiant Frigeric: the king of those</a>
<a id='line_2114'>      licentious Barbarians was slain in battle; and the suppliant</a>
<a id='line_2115'>      captives were sent into distant exile to cultivate the lands of</a>

<a id='line_2118'>      who was recently engaged in the service of Valens, and promoted</a>
<a id='line_2119'>      to the rank of master-general of the infantry, were still more</a>
<a id='line_2120'>      honorable to himself, and useful to the republic. He obtained the</a>
<a id='line_2121'>      permission of selecting three hundred soldiers from each of the</a>
<a id='line_2122'>      legions; and this separate detachment soon acquired the spirit of</a>
<a id='line_2123'>      discipline, and the exercise of arms, which were almost forgotten</a>
<a id='line_2124'>      under the reign of Valens. By the vigor and conduct of Sebastian,</a>
<a id='line_2125'>      a large body of the Goths were surprised in their camp; and the</a>
<a id='line_2126'>      immense spoil, which was recovered from their hands, filled the</a>
<a id='line_2127'>      city of Hadrianople, and the adjacent plain. The splendid</a>
<a id='line_2128'>      narratives, which the general transmitted of his own exploits,</a>
<a id='line_2129'>      alarmed the Imperial court by the appearance of superior merit;</a>
<a id='line_2130'>      and though he cautiously insisted on the difficulties of the</a>
<a id='line_2131'>      Gothic war, his valor was praised, his advice was rejected; and</a>
<a id='line_2132'>      Valens, who listened with pride and pleasure to the flattering</a>
<a id='line_2133'>      suggestions of the eunuchs of the palace, was impatient to seize</a>
<a id='line_2134'>      the glory of an easy and assured conquest. His army was</a>
<a id='line_2135'>      strengthened by a numerous reenforcement of veterans; and his</a>
<a id='line_2136'>      march from Constantinople to Hadrianople was conducted with so</a>
<a id='line_2137'>      much military skill, that he prevented the activity of the</a>
<a id='line_2138'>      Barbarians, who designed to occupy the intermediate defiles, and</a>
<a id='line_2139'>      to intercept either the troops themselves, or their convoys of</a>
<a id='line_2140'>      provisions. The camp of Valens, which he pitched under the walls</a>
<a id='line_2141'>      of Hadrianople, was fortified, according to the practice of the</a>
<a id='line_2142'>      Romans, with a ditch and rampart; and a most important council</a>
<a id='line_2143'>      was summoned, to decide the fate of the emperor and of the</a>
<a id='line_2144'>      empire. The party of reason and of delay was strenuously</a>

<a id='line_2146'>      experience, the native fierceness of the Sarmatian character;</a>
<a id='line_2147'>      while Sebastian, with the flexible and obsequious eloquence of a</a>
<a id='line_2148'>      courtier, represented every precaution, and every measure, that</a>
<a id='line_2149'>      implied a doubt of immediate victory, as unworthy of the courage</a>
<a id='line_2150'>      and majesty of their invincible monarch. The ruin of Valens was</a>
<a id='line_2151'>      precipitated by the deceitful arts of Fritigern, and the prudent</a>
<a id='line_2152'>      admonitions of the emperor of the West. The advantages of</a>
<a id='line_2153'>      negotiating in the midst of war were perfectly understood by the</a>
<a id='line_2154'>      general of the Barbarians; and a Christian ecclesiastic was</a>
<a id='line_2155'>      despatched, as the holy minister of peace, to penetrate, and to</a>
<a id='line_2156'>      perplex, the councils of the enemy. The misfortunes, as well as</a>
<a id='line_2157'>      the provocations, of the Gothic nation, were forcibly and truly</a>
<a id='line_2158'>      described by their ambassador; who protested, in the name of</a>
<a id='line_2159'>      Fritigern, that he was still disposed to lay down his arms, or to</a>
<a id='line_2160'>      employ them only in the defence of the empire; if he could secure</a>
<a id='line_2161'>      for his wandering countrymen a tranquil settlement on the waste</a>
<a id='line_2162'>      lands of Thrace, and a sufficient allowance of corn and cattle.</a>
<a id='line_2163'>      But he added, in a whisper of confidential friendship, that the</a>
<a id='line_2164'>      exasperated Barbarians were averse to these reasonable</a>
<a id='line_2165'>      conditions; and that Fritigern was doubtful whether he could</a>
<a id='line_2166'>      accomplish the conclusion of the treaty, unless he found himself</a>
<a id='line_2167'>      supported by the presence and terrors of an Imperial army. About</a>
<a id='line_2168'>      the same time, Count Richomer returned from the West to announce</a>
<a id='line_2169'>      the defeat and submission of the Alemanni, to inform Valens that</a>
<a id='line_2170'>      his nephew advanced by rapid marches at the head of the veteran</a>
<a id='line_2171'>      and victorious legions of Gaul, and to request, in the name of</a>
<a id='line_2172'>      Gratian and of the republic, that every dangerous and decisive</a>
<a id='line_2173'>      measure might be suspended, till the junction of the two emperors</a>
<a id='line_2174'>      should insure the success of the Gothic war. But the feeble</a>
<a id='line_2175'>      sovereign of the East was actuated only by the fatal illusions of</a>
<a id='line_2176'>      pride and jealousy. He disdained the importunate advice; he</a>

<a id='line_2178'>      ignominious, at least the inglorious, period of his own reign,</a>
<a id='line_2179'>      with the fame of a beardless youth; and Valens rushed into the</a>

<a id='line_2213'>      and irregular delay. The Gothic cavalry had been detached to</a>
<a id='line_2214'>      forage in the adjacent country; and Fritigern still continued to</a>
<a id='line_2215'>      practise his customary arts. He despatched messengers of peace,</a>
<a id='line_2216'>      made proposals, required hostages, and wasted the hours, till the</a>
<a id='line_2217'>      Romans, exposed without shelter to the burning rays of the sun,</a>
<a id='line_2218'>      were exhausted by thirst, hunger, and intolerable fatigue. The</a>
<a id='line_2219'>      emperor was persuaded to send an ambassador to the Gothic camp;</a>
<a id='line_2220'>      the zeal of Richomer, who alone had courage to accept the</a>
<a id='line_2221'>      dangerous commission, was applauded; and the count of the</a>
<a id='line_2222'>      domestics, adorned with the splendid ensigns of his dignity, had</a>
<a id='line_2223'>      proceeded some way in the space between the two armies, when he</a>
<a id='line_2224'>      was suddenly recalled by the alarm of battle. The hasty and</a>
<a id='line_2225'>      imprudent attack was made by Bacurius the Iberian, who commanded</a>
<a id='line_2226'>      a body of archers and targeteers; and as they advanced with</a>
<a id='line_2227'>      rashness, they retreated with loss and disgrace. In the same</a>
<a id='line_2228'>      moment, the flying squadrons of Alatheus and Saphrax, whose</a>
<a id='line_2229'>      return was anxiously expected by the general of the Goths,</a>
<a id='line_2230'>      descended like a whirlwind from the hills, swept across the</a>
<a id='line_2231'>      plain, and added new terrors to the tumultuous, but irresistible</a>
<a id='line_2232'>      charge of the Barbarian host. The event of the battle of</a>
<a id='line_2233'>      Hadrianople, so fatal to Valens and to the empire, may be</a>
<a id='line_2234'>      described in a few words: the Roman cavalry fled; the infantry</a>
<a id='line_2235'>      was abandoned, surrounded, and cut in pieces. The most skilful</a>
<a id='line_2236'>      evolutions, the firmest courage, are scarcely sufficient to</a>
<a id='line_2237'>      extricate a body of foot, encompassed, on an open plain, by</a>
<a id='line_2238'>      superior numbers of horse; but the troops of Valens, oppressed by</a>
<a id='line_2239'>      the weight of the enemy and their own fears, were crowded into a</a>
<a id='line_2240'>      narrow space, where it was impossible for them to extend their</a>
<a id='line_2241'>      ranks, or even to use, with effect, their swords and javelins. In</a>
<a id='line_2242'>      the midst of tumult, of slaughter, and of dismay, the emperor,</a>
<a id='line_2243'>      deserted by his guards and wounded, as it was supposed, with an</a>
<a id='line_2244'>      arrow, sought protection among the Lancearii and the Mattiarii,</a>
<a id='line_2245'>      who still maintained their ground with some appearance of order</a>
<a id='line_2246'>      and firmness. His faithful generals, Trajan and Victor, who</a>
<a id='line_2247'>      perceived his danger, loudly exclaimed that all was lost, unless</a>
<a id='line_2248'>      the person of the emperor could be saved. Some troops, animated</a>
<a id='line_2249'>      by their exhortation, advanced to his relief: they found only a</a>
<a id='line_2250'>      bloody spot, covered with a heap of broken arms and mangled</a>
<a id='line_2251'>      bodies, without being able to discover their unfortunate prince,</a>
<a id='line_2252'>      either among the living or the dead. Their search could not</a>
<a id='line_2253'>      indeed be successful, if there is any truth in the circumstances</a>
<a id='line_2254'>      with which some historians have related the death of the emperor.</a>
<a id='line_2255'></a>
<a id='line_2256'>      By the care of his attendants, Valens was removed from the field</a>
<a id='line_2257'>      of battle to a neighboring cottage, where they attempted to dress</a>
<a id='line_2258'>      his wound, and to provide for his future safety. But this humble</a>
<a id='line_2259'>      retreat was instantly surrounded by the enemy: they tried to</a>
<a id='line_2260'>      force the door, they were provoked by a discharge of arrows from</a>
<a id='line_2261'>      the roof, till at length, impatient of delay, they set fire to a</a>
<a id='line_2262'>      pile of dry magots, and consumed the cottage with the Roman</a>
<a id='line_2263'>      emperor and his train. Valens perished in the flames; and a</a>
<a id='line_2264'>      youth, who dropped from the window, alone escaped, to attest the</a>
<a id='line_2265'>      melancholy tale, and to inform the Goths of the inestimable prize</a>
<a id='line_2266'>      which they had lost by their own rashness. A great number of</a>
<a id='line_2267'>      brave and distinguished officers perished in the battle of</a>
<a id='line_2268'>      Hadrianople, which equalled in the actual loss, and far surpassed</a>
<a id='line_2269'>      in the fatal consequences, the misfortune which Rome had formerly</a>
<a id='line_2270'>      sustained in the fields of Cann¾. 93 Two master-generals of the</a>
<a id='line_2271'>      cavalry and infantry, two great officers of the palace, and</a>
<a id='line_2272'>      thirty-five tribunes, were found among the slain; and the death</a>
<a id='line_2273'>      of Sebastian might satisfy the world, that he was the victim, as</a>
<a id='line_2274'>      well as the author, of the public calamity. Above two thirds of</a>
<a id='line_2275'>      the Roman army were destroyed: and the darkness of the night was</a>
<a id='line_2276'>      esteemed a very favorable circumstance, as it served to conceal</a>

<a id='line_2380'>      inundation rolled from the walls of Hadrianople to the suburbs of</a>
<a id='line_2381'>      Constantinople. The Barbarians were surprised with the splendid</a>

<a id='line_2515'>      betrayed their wish, their desire, perhaps their intention, to</a>
<a id='line_2516'>      emulate the glorious example of their fathers. The danger of the</a>

<a id='line_2520'>      dangerous conspiracy against the public safety. The death of</a>
<a id='line_2521'>      Valens had left the East without a sovereign; and Julius, who</a>

<a id='line_2523'>      with a high reputation of diligence and ability, thought it his</a>

<a id='line_2527'>      the discretionary power of acting as he should judge most</a>

<a id='line_2533'>      and, as a report was industriously circulated, that they were</a>

<a id='line_2535'>      pleasing hope allayed the fury of their resentment, and, perhaps,</a>

<a id='line_2573'>      of the state of the republic. Gratian was too late to assist, he</a>
<a id='line_2574'>      was too weak to revenge, his unfortunate colleague; and the</a>

<a id='line_2578'>      Gratian was oppressed and distracted by the administration of the</a>
<a id='line_2579'>      Western empire. In this important crisis, the government of the</a>
<a id='line_2580'>      East, and the conduct of the Gothic war, required the undivided</a>
<a id='line_2581'>      attention of a hero and a statesman. A subject invested with such</a>
<a id='line_2582'>      ample command would not long have preserved his fidelity to a</a>
<a id='line_2583'>      distant benefactor; and the Imperial council embraced the wise</a>
<a id='line_2584'>      and manly resolution of conferring an obligation, rather than of</a>
<a id='line_2585'>      yielding to an insult. It was the wish of Gratian to bestow the</a>
<a id='line_2586'>      purple as the reward of virtue; but, at the age of nineteen, it</a>
<a id='line_2587'>      is not easy for a prince, educated in the supreme rank, to</a>
<a id='line_2588'>      understand the true characters of his ministers and generals. He</a>
<a id='line_2589'>      attempted to weigh, with an impartial hand, their various merits</a>
<a id='line_2590'>      and defects; and, whilst he checked the rash confidence of</a>
<a id='line_2591'>      ambition, he distrusted the cautious wisdom which despaired of</a>
<a id='line_2592'>      the republic. As each moment of delay diminished something of the</a>
<a id='line_2593'>      power and resources of the future sovereign of the East, the</a>
<a id='line_2594'>      situation of the times would not allow a tedious debate. The</a>
<a id='line_2595'>      choice of Gratian was soon declared in favor of an exile, whose</a>
<a id='line_2596'>      father, only three years before, had suffered, under the sanction</a>
<a id='line_2597'>      of _his_ authority, an unjust and ignominious death. The great</a>

<a id='line_2649'>      difference of seasons and climates; distinguished his valor by</a>

<a id='line_2759'>      revenged by any signal or decisive victory of Theodosius over the</a>
<a id='line_2760'>      Barbarians: and the expressive silence of his venal orators may</a>
<a id='line_2761'>      be confirmed by the observation of the condition and</a>
<a id='line_2762'>      circumstances of the times. The fabric of a mighty state, which</a>
<a id='line_2763'>      has been reared by the labors of successive ages, could not be</a>
<a id='line_2764'>      overturned by the misfortune of a single day, if the fatal power</a>
<a id='line_2765'>      of the imagination did not exaggerate the real measure of the</a>
<a id='line_2766'>      calamity. The loss of forty thousand Romans, who fell in the</a>
<a id='line_2767'>      plains of Hadrianople, might have been soon recruited in the</a>
<a id='line_2768'>      populous provinces of the East, which contained so many millions</a>
<a id='line_2769'>      of inhabitants. The courage of a soldier is found to be the</a>
<a id='line_2770'>      cheapest, and most common, quality of human nature; and</a>
<a id='line_2771'>      sufficient skill to encounter an undisciplined foe might have</a>
<a id='line_2772'>      been speedily taught by the care of the surviving centurions. If</a>
<a id='line_2773'>      the Barbarians were mounted on the horses, and equipped with the</a>
<a id='line_2774'>      armor, of their vanquished enemies, the numerous studs of</a>
<a id='line_2775'>      Cappadocia and Spain would have supplied new squadrons of</a>
<a id='line_2776'>      cavalry; the thirty-four arsenals of the empire were plentifully</a>
<a id='line_2777'>      stored with magazines of offensive and defensive arms: and the</a>
<a id='line_2778'>      wealth of Asia might still have yielded an ample fund for the</a>
<a id='line_2779'>      expenses of the war. But the effects which were produced by the</a>
<a id='line_2780'>      battle of Hadrianople on the minds of the Barbarians and of the</a>
<a id='line_2781'>      Romans, extended the victory of the former, and the defeat of the</a>
<a id='line_2782'>      latter, far beyond the limits of a single day. A Gothic chief was</a>
<a id='line_2783'>      heard to declare, with insolent moderation, that, for his own</a>
<a id='line_2784'>      part, he was fatigued with slaughter: but that he was astonished</a>
<a id='line_2785'>      how a people, who fled before him like a flock of sheep, could</a>
<a id='line_2786'>      still presume to dispute the possession of their treasures and</a>
<a id='line_2787'>      provinces. 115 The same terrors which the name of the Huns had</a>
<a id='line_2788'>      spread among the Gothic tribes, were inspired, by the formidable</a>
<a id='line_2789'>      name of the Goths, among the subjects and soldiers of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_2790'>      empire. 116 If Theodosius, hastily collecting his scattered</a>
<a id='line_2791'>      forces, had led them into the field to encounter a victorious</a>
<a id='line_2792'>      enemy, his army would have been vanquished by their own fears;</a>
<a id='line_2793'>      and his rashness could not have been excused by the chance of</a>
<a id='line_2794'>      success. But the _great_ Theodosius, an epithet which he</a>
<a id='line_2795'>      honorably deserved on this momentous occasion, conducted himself</a>
<a id='line_2796'>      as the firm and faithful guardian of the republic. He fixed his</a>
<a id='line_2797'>      head-quarters at Thessalonica, the capital of the Macedonian</a>
<a id='line_2798'>      diocese; 117 from whence he could watch the irregular motions of</a>
<a id='line_2799'>      the Barbarians, and direct the operations of his lieutenants,</a>
<a id='line_2800'>      from the gates of Constantinople to the shores of the Hadriatic.</a>
<a id='line_2801'>      The fortifications and garrisons of the cities were strengthened;</a>
<a id='line_2802'>      and the troops, among whom a sense of order and discipline was</a>
<a id='line_2803'>      revived, were insensibly emboldened by the confidence of their</a>
<a id='line_2804'>      own safety. From these secure stations, they were encouraged to</a>
<a id='line_2805'>      make frequent sallies on the Barbarians, who infested the</a>
<a id='line_2806'>      adjacent country; and, as they were seldom allowed to engage,</a>
<a id='line_2807'>      without some decisive superiority, either of ground or of</a>
<a id='line_2808'>      numbers, their enterprises were, for the most part, successful;</a>
<a id='line_2809'>      and they were soon convinced, by their own experience, of the</a>
<a id='line_2810'>      possibility of vanquishing their _invincible_ enemies. The</a>
<a id='line_2811'>      detachments of these separate garrisons were generally united</a>
<a id='line_2812'>      into small armies; the same cautious measures were pursued,</a>
<a id='line_2813'>      according to an extensive and well-concerted plan of operations;</a>
<a id='line_2814'>      the events of each day added strength and spirit to the Roman</a>
<a id='line_2815'>      arms; and the artful diligence of the emperor, who circulated the</a>
<a id='line_2816'>      most favorable reports of the success of the war, contributed to</a>
<a id='line_2817'>      subdue the pride of the Barbarians, and to animate the hopes and</a>
<a id='line_2818'>      courage of his subjects. If, instead of this faint and imperfect</a>
<a id='line_2819'>      outline, we could accurately represent the counsels and actions</a>
<a id='line_2820'>      of Theodosius, in four successive campaigns, there is reason to</a>
<a id='line_2821'>      believe, that his consummate skill would deserve the applause of</a>
<a id='line_2822'>      every military reader. The republic had formerly been saved by</a>

<a id='line_2824'>      in the field of Zama, attract the eyes of posterity, the camps</a>

<a id='line_2827'>      which the general is not compelled to share, either with fortune</a>

<a id='line_2880'>      were seldom uniform or consistent. An army of conquerors was</a>

<a id='line_2882'>      blind and irregular fury was not less pernicious to themselves,</a>

<a id='line_2887'>      afterwards became necessary for their own subsistence. A spirit</a>
<a id='line_2888'>      of discord arose among the independent tribes and nations, which</a>
<a id='line_2889'>      had been united only by the bands of a loose and voluntary</a>
<a id='line_2890'>      alliance. The troops of the Huns and the Alani would naturally</a>

<a id='line_2892'>      with moderation the advantages of their fortune; the ancient</a>
<a id='line_2893'>      jealousy of the Ostrogoths and the Visigoths could not long be</a>

<a id='line_2896'>      while the nation was seated in the countries beyond the Danube.</a>
<a id='line_2897'>      The progress of domestic faction abated the more diffusive</a>

<a id='line_2899'>      were instructed to purchase, with liberal gifts and promises, the</a>
<a id='line_2900'>      retreat or service of the discontented party. The acquisition of</a>
<a id='line_2901'>      Modar, a prince of the royal blood of the Amali, gave a bold and</a>
<a id='line_2902'>      faithful champion to the cause of Rome. The illustrious deserter</a>
<a id='line_2903'>      soon obtained the rank of master-general, with an important</a>
<a id='line_2904'>      command; surprised an army of his countrymen, who were immersed</a>
<a id='line_2905'>      in wine and sleep; and, after a cruel slaughter of the astonished</a>
<a id='line_2906'>      Goths, returned with an immense spoil, and four thousand wagons,</a>
<a id='line_2907'>      to the Imperial camp. 120 In the hands of a skilful politician,</a>
<a id='line_2908'>      the most different means may be successfully applied to the same</a>
<a id='line_2909'>      ends; and the peace of the empire, which had been forwarded by</a>
<a id='line_2910'>      the divisions, was accomplished by the reunion, of the Gothic</a>
<a id='line_2911'>      nation. Athanaric, who had been a patient spectator of these</a>
<a id='line_2912'>      extraordinary events, was at length driven, by the chance of</a>
<a id='line_2913'>      arms, from the dark recesses of the woods of Caucaland. He no</a>
<a id='line_2914'>      longer hesitated to pass the Danube; and a very considerable part</a>
<a id='line_2915'>      of the subjects of Fritigern, who already felt the inconveniences</a>
<a id='line_2916'>      of anarchy, were easily persuaded to acknowledge for their king a</a>
<a id='line_2917'>      Gothic Judge, whose birth they respected, and whose abilities</a>
<a id='line_2918'>      they had frequently experienced. But age had chilled the daring</a>
<a id='line_2919'>      spirit of Athanaric; and, instead of leading his people to the</a>
<a id='line_2920'>      field of battle and victory, he wisely listened to the fair</a>
<a id='line_2921'>      proposal of an honorable and advantageous treaty. Theodosius, who</a>
<a id='line_2922'>      was acquainted with the merit and power of his new ally,</a>
<a id='line_2923'>      condescended to meet him at the distance of several miles from</a>
<a id='line_2924'>      Constantinople; and entertained him in the Imperial city, with</a>
<a id='line_2925'>      the confidence of a friend, and the magnificence of a monarch.</a>
<a id='line_2926'>      ÒThe Barbarian prince observed, with curious attention, the</a>
<a id='line_2927'>      variety of objects which attracted his notice, and at last broke</a>
<a id='line_2928'>      out into a sincere and passionate exclamation of wonder. I now</a>
<a id='line_2929'>      behold (said he) what I never could believe, the glories of this</a>
<a id='line_2930'>      stupendous capital! And as he cast his eyes around, he viewed,</a>
<a id='line_2931'>      and he admired, the commanding situation of the city, the</a>
<a id='line_2932'>      strength and beauty of the walls and public edifices, the</a>
<a id='line_2933'>      capacious harbor, crowded with innumerable vessels, the perpetual</a>
<a id='line_2934'>      concourse of distant nations, and the arms and discipline of the</a>
<a id='line_2935'>      troops. Indeed, (continued Athanaric,) the emperor of the Romans</a>
<a id='line_2936'>      is a god upon earth; and the presumptuous man, who dares to lift</a>
<a id='line_2937'>      his hand against him, is guilty of his own blood.Ó 121 The Gothic</a>

<a id='line_2999'>      treaty with the emperor Gratian; advanced into the unknown</a>

<a id='line_3002'>      Lower Danube. Their troops were recruited with the fiercest</a>
<a id='line_3003'>      warriors of Germany and Scythia; and the soldiers, or at least</a>
<a id='line_3004'>      the historians, of the empire, no longer recognized the name and</a>

<a id='line_3007'>      soon perceived that his superiority would be disadvantageous to</a>
<a id='line_3008'>      the public service; and that the Barbarians, awed by the presence</a>
<a id='line_3009'>      of his fleet and legions, would probably defer the passage of the</a>
<a id='line_3010'>      river till the approaching winter. The dexterity of the spies,</a>
<a id='line_3011'>      whom he sent into the Gothic camp, allured the Barbarians into a</a>
<a id='line_3012'>      fatal snare. They were persuaded that, by a bold attempt, they</a>
<a id='line_3013'>      might surprise, in the silence and darkness of the night, the</a>
<a id='line_3014'>      sleeping army of the Romans; and the whole multitude was hastily</a>
<a id='line_3015'>      embarked in a fleet of three thousand canoes. 125 The bravest of</a>
<a id='line_3016'>      the Ostrogoths led the van; the main body consisted of the</a>
<a id='line_3017'>      remainder of their subjects and soldiers; and the women and</a>
<a id='line_3018'>      children securely followed in the rear. One of the nights without</a>
<a id='line_3019'>      a moon had been selected for the execution of their design; and</a>
<a id='line_3020'>      they had almost reached the southern bank of the Danube, in the</a>
<a id='line_3021'>      firm confidence that they should find an easy landing and an</a>
<a id='line_3022'>      unguarded camp. But the progress of the Barbarians was suddenly</a>
<a id='line_3023'>      stopped by an unexpected obstacle a triple line of vessels,</a>
<a id='line_3024'>      strongly connected with each other, and which formed an</a>
<a id='line_3025'>      impenetrable chain of two miles and a half along the river. While</a>
<a id='line_3026'>      they struggled to force their way in the unequal conflict, their</a>
<a id='line_3027'>      right flank was overwhelmed by the irresistible attack of a fleet</a>
<a id='line_3028'>      of galleys, which were urged down the stream by the united</a>
<a id='line_3029'>      impulse of oars and of the tide. The weight and velocity of those</a>
<a id='line_3030'>      ships of war broke, and sunk, and dispersed, the rude and feeble</a>
<a id='line_3031'>      canoes of the Barbarians; their valor was ineffectual; and</a>
<a id='line_3032'>      Alatheus, the king, or general, of the Ostrogoths, perished with</a>
<a id='line_3033'>      his bravest troops, either by the sword of the Romans, or in the</a>
<a id='line_3034'>      waves of the Danube. The last division of this unfortunate fleet</a>
<a id='line_3035'>      might regain the opposite shore; but the distress and disorder of</a>
<a id='line_3036'>      the multitude rendered them alike incapable, either of action or</a>

<a id='line_3174'>      design. It was generally believed, that the Goths had signed the</a>

<a id='line_3185'>      conversation and dispute, to compare the obligations of their</a>

<a id='line_3187'>      themselves as the friends of peace, of justice, and of Rome, were</a>
<a id='line_3188'>      directed by the authority of Fravitta, a valiant and honorable</a>
<a id='line_3189'>      youth, distinguished above the rest of his countrymen by the</a>
<a id='line_3190'>      politeness of his manners, the liberality of his sentiments, and</a>

<a id='line_3192'>      adhered to the fierce and faithless Priulf, 13411 who inflamed</a>
<a id='line_3193'>      the passions, and asserted the independence, of his warlike</a>
<a id='line_3194'>      followers. On one of the solemn festivals, when the chiefs of</a>
<a id='line_3195'>      both parties were invited to the Imperial table, they were</a>
<a id='line_3196'>      insensibly heated by wine, till they forgot the usual restraints</a>
<a id='line_3197'>      of discretion and respect, and betrayed, in the presence of</a>
<a id='line_3198'>      Theodosius, the fatal secret of their domestic disputes. The</a>
<a id='line_3199'>      emperor, who had been the reluctant witness of this extraordinary</a>
<a id='line_3200'>      controversy, dissembled his fears and resentment, and soon</a>
<a id='line_3201'>      dismissed the tumultuous assembly. Fravitta, alarmed and</a>
<a id='line_3202'>      exasperated by the insolence of his rival, whose departure from</a>
<a id='line_3203'>      the palace might have been the signal of a civil war, boldly</a>
<a id='line_3204'>      followed him; and, drawing his sword, laid Priulf dead at his</a>
<a id='line_3205'>      feet. Their companions flew to arms; and the faithful champion of</a>
<a id='line_3206'>      Rome would have been oppressed by superior numbers, if he had not</a>
<a id='line_3207'>      been protected by the seasonable interposition of the Imperial</a>

<a id='line_3209'>      disgraced the palace and table of the Roman emperor; and, as the</a>
<a id='line_3210'>      impatient Goths could only be restrained by the firm and</a>
<a id='line_3211'>      temperate character of Theodosius, the public safety seemed to</a>
