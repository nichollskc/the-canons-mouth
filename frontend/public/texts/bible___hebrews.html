                    <a id='line_0'>The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past</a>
<a id='line_4'>unto the fathers by the prophets, 1:2 Hath in these last days spoken</a>
<a id='line_5'>unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom</a>
<a id='line_6'>also he made the worlds; 1:3 Who being the brightness of his glory,</a>
<a id='line_7'>and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the</a>
<a id='line_8'>word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on</a>
<a id='line_9'>the right hand of the Majesty on high: 1:4 Being made so much better</a>
<a id='line_10'>than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent</a>
<a id='line_11'>name than they.</a>
<a id='line_12'></a>
<a id='line_13'>1:5 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son,</a>
<a id='line_14'>this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father,</a>
<a id='line_15'>and he shall be to me a Son?  1:6 And again, when he bringeth in the</a>
<a id='line_16'>firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God</a>
<a id='line_17'>worship him.</a>
<a id='line_18'></a>
<a id='line_19'>1:7 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his</a>
<a id='line_20'>ministers a flame of fire.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>1:8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and</a>
<a id='line_23'>ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'>1:9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God,</a>
<a id='line_26'>even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy</a>
<a id='line_27'>fellows.</a>
<a id='line_28'></a>
<a id='line_29'>1:10 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the</a>
<a id='line_30'>earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands: 1:11 They shall</a>
<a id='line_31'>perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a</a>
<a id='line_32'>garment; 1:12 And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall</a>
<a id='line_33'>be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.</a>
<a id='line_34'></a>
<a id='line_35'>1:13 But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right</a>
<a id='line_36'>hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?  1:14 Are they not all</a>
<a id='line_37'>ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be</a>
<a id='line_38'>heirs of salvation?  2:1 Therefore we ought to give the more earnest</a>
<a id='line_39'>heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let</a>
<a id='line_40'>them slip.</a>
<a id='line_41'></a>
<a id='line_42'>2:2 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every</a>
<a id='line_43'>transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;</a>
<a id='line_44'>2:3 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at</a>
<a id='line_45'>the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by</a>
<a id='line_46'>them that heard him; 2:4 God also bearing them witness, both with</a>
<a id='line_47'>signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy</a>
<a id='line_48'>Ghost, according to his own will?  2:5 For unto the angels hath he not</a>
<a id='line_49'>put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</a>
<a id='line_50'></a>
<a id='line_51'>2:6 But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that</a>
<a id='line_52'>thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?</a>
<a id='line_53'>2:7 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him</a>
<a id='line_54'>with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</a>
<a id='line_55'>2:8 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that</a>
<a id='line_56'>he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put</a>
<a id='line_57'>under him.</a>
<a id='line_58'></a>
<a id='line_59'>But now we see not yet all things put under him.</a>
<a id='line_60'></a>
<a id='line_61'>2:9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for</a>
<a id='line_62'>the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the</a>
<a id='line_63'>grace of God should taste death for every man.</a>
<a id='line_64'></a>
<a id='line_65'>2:10 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all</a>
<a id='line_66'>things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their</a>
<a id='line_67'>salvation perfect through sufferings.</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>2:11 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all</a>
<a id='line_70'>of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, 2:12</a>
<a id='line_71'>Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_72'>church will I sing praise unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_73'></a>
<a id='line_74'>2:13 And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and</a>
<a id='line_75'>the children which God hath given me.</a>
<a id='line_76'></a>
<a id='line_77'>2:14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,</a>
<a id='line_78'>he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he</a>
<a id='line_79'>might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</a>
<a id='line_80'>2:15 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their</a>
<a id='line_81'>lifetime subject to bondage.</a>
<a id='line_82'></a>
<a id='line_83'>2:16 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took</a>
<a id='line_84'>on him the seed of Abraham.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>2:17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his</a>
<a id='line_87'>brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in</a>
<a id='line_88'>things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the</a>
<a id='line_89'>people.</a>
<a id='line_90'></a>
<a id='line_91'>2:18 For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to</a>
<a id='line_92'>succour them that are tempted.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>3:1 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling,</a>
<a id='line_95'>consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</a>
<a id='line_96'>3:2 Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was</a>
<a id='line_97'>faithful in all his house.</a>
<a id='line_98'></a>
<a id='line_99'>3:3 For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch</a>
<a id='line_100'>as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>3:4 For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all</a>
<a id='line_103'>things is God.</a>
<a id='line_104'></a>
<a id='line_105'>3:5 And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for</a>
<a id='line_106'>a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; 3:6 But</a>
<a id='line_107'>Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold</a>
<a id='line_108'>fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>
<a id='line_110'>3:7 Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his</a>
<a id='line_111'>voice, 3:8 Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day</a>
<a id='line_112'>of temptation in the wilderness: 3:9 When your fathers tempted me,</a>
<a id='line_113'>proved me, and saw my works forty years.</a>
<a id='line_114'></a>
<a id='line_115'>3:10 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do</a>
<a id='line_116'>alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.</a>
<a id='line_117'></a>
<a id='line_118'>3:11 So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)  3:12</a>
<a id='line_119'>Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of</a>
<a id='line_120'>unbelief, in departing from the living God.</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>3:13 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any</a>
<a id='line_123'>of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</a>
<a id='line_124'></a>
<a id='line_125'>3:14 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of</a>
<a id='line_126'>our confidence stedfast unto the end; 3:15 While it is said, To day if</a>
<a id='line_127'>ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</a>
<a id='line_128'></a>
<a id='line_129'>3:16 For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that</a>
<a id='line_130'>came out of Egypt by Moses.</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'>3:17 But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them</a>
<a id='line_133'>that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?  3:18 And to</a>
<a id='line_134'>whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them</a>
<a id='line_135'>that believed not?  3:19 So we see that they could not enter in</a>
<a id='line_136'>because of unbelief.</a>
<a id='line_137'></a>
<a id='line_138'>4:1 Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering</a>
<a id='line_139'>into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>4:2 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the</a>
<a id='line_142'>word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them</a>
<a id='line_143'>that heard it.</a>
<a id='line_144'></a>
<a id='line_145'>4:3 For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I</a>
<a id='line_146'>have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the</a>
<a id='line_147'>works were finished from the foundation of the world.</a>
<a id='line_148'></a>
<a id='line_149'>4:4 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise,</a>
<a id='line_150'>And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</a>
<a id='line_151'></a>
<a id='line_152'>4:5 And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>4:6 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and</a>
<a id='line_155'>they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</a>
<a id='line_156'>4:7 Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after</a>
<a id='line_157'>so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice,</a>
<a id='line_158'>harden not your hearts.</a>
<a id='line_159'></a>
<a id='line_160'>4:8 For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have</a>
<a id='line_161'>spoken of another day.</a>
<a id='line_162'></a>
<a id='line_163'>4:9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</a>
<a id='line_164'></a>
<a id='line_165'>4:10 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from</a>
<a id='line_166'>his own works, as God did from his.</a>
<a id='line_167'></a>
<a id='line_168'>4:11 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man</a>
<a id='line_169'>fall after the same example of unbelief.</a>
<a id='line_170'></a>
<a id='line_171'>4:12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any</a>
<a id='line_172'>twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and</a>
<a id='line_173'>spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the</a>
<a id='line_174'>thoughts and intents of the heart.</a>
<a id='line_175'></a>
<a id='line_176'>4:13 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight:</a>
<a id='line_177'>but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we</a>
<a id='line_178'>have to do.</a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>4:14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into</a>
<a id='line_181'>the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.</a>
<a id='line_182'></a>
<a id='line_183'>4:15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the</a>
<a id='line_184'>feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we</a>
<a id='line_185'>are, yet without sin.</a>
<a id='line_186'></a>
<a id='line_187'>4:16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we</a>
<a id='line_188'>may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</a>
<a id='line_189'></a>
<a id='line_190'>5:1 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in</a>
<a id='line_191'>things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices</a>
<a id='line_192'>for sins: 5:2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them</a>
<a id='line_193'>that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with</a>
<a id='line_194'>infirmity.</a>
<a id='line_195'></a>
<a id='line_196'>5:3 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for</a>
<a id='line_197'>himself, to offer for sins.</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>5:4 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called</a>
<a id='line_200'>of God, as was Aaron.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>5:5 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest;</a>
<a id='line_203'>but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten</a>
<a id='line_204'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_205'></a>
<a id='line_206'>5:6 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever</a>
<a id='line_207'>after the order of Melchisedec.</a>
<a id='line_208'></a>
<a id='line_209'>5:7 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and</a>
<a id='line_210'>supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to</a>
<a id='line_211'>save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; 5:8 Though he</a>
<a id='line_212'>were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</a>
<a id='line_213'>5:9 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation</a>
<a id='line_214'>unto all them that obey him; 5:10 Called of God an high priest after</a>
<a id='line_215'>the order of Melchisedec.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>5:11 Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered,</a>
<a id='line_218'>seeing ye are dull of hearing.</a>
<a id='line_219'></a>
<a id='line_220'>5:12 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that</a>
<a id='line_221'>one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of</a>
<a id='line_222'>God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>5:13 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of</a>
<a id='line_225'>righteousness: for he is a babe.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>5:14 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even</a>
<a id='line_228'>those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both</a>
<a id='line_229'>good and evil.</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>6:1 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us</a>
<a id='line_232'>go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance</a>
<a id='line_233'>from dead works, and of faith toward God, 6:2 Of the doctrine of</a>
<a id='line_234'>baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead,</a>
<a id='line_235'>and of eternal judgment.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>6:3 And this will we do, if God permit.</a>
<a id='line_238'></a>
<a id='line_239'>6:4 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have</a>
<a id='line_240'>tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy</a>
<a id='line_241'>Ghost, 6:5 And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the</a>
<a id='line_242'>world to come, 6:6 If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto</a>
<a id='line_243'>repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh,</a>
<a id='line_244'>and put him to an open shame.</a>
<a id='line_245'></a>
<a id='line_246'>6:7 For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it,</a>
<a id='line_247'>and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed,</a>
<a id='line_248'>receiveth blessing from God: 6:8 But that which beareth thorns and</a>
<a id='line_249'>briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be</a>
<a id='line_250'>burned.</a>
<a id='line_251'></a>
<a id='line_252'>6:9 But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things</a>
<a id='line_253'>that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.</a>
<a id='line_254'></a>
<a id='line_255'>6:10 For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of</a>
<a id='line_256'>love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered</a>
<a id='line_257'>to the saints, and do minister.</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>6:11 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to</a>
<a id='line_260'>the full assurance of hope unto the end: 6:12 That ye be not slothful,</a>
<a id='line_261'>but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the</a>
<a id='line_262'>promises.</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>6:13 For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by</a>
<a id='line_265'>no greater, he sware by himself, 6:14 Saying, Surely blessing I will</a>
<a id='line_266'>bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>6:15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</a>
<a id='line_269'></a>
<a id='line_270'>6:16 For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation</a>
<a id='line_271'>is to them an end of all strife.</a>
<a id='line_272'></a>
<a id='line_273'>6:17 Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of</a>
<a id='line_274'>promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: 6:18</a>
<a id='line_275'>That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to</a>
<a id='line_276'>lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to</a>
<a id='line_277'>lay hold upon the hope set before us: 6:19 Which hope we have as an</a>
<a id='line_278'>anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into</a>
<a id='line_279'>that within the veil; 6:20 Whither the forerunner is for us entered,</a>
<a id='line_280'>even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of</a>
<a id='line_281'>Melchisedec.</a>
<a id='line_282'></a>
<a id='line_283'>7:1 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God,</a>
<a id='line_284'>who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed</a>
<a id='line_285'>him; 7:2 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by</a>
<a id='line_286'>interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of</a>
<a id='line_287'>Salem, which is, King of peace; 7:3 Without father, without mother,</a>
<a id='line_288'>without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life;</a>
<a id='line_289'>but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</a>
<a id='line_290'></a>
<a id='line_291'>7:4 Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch</a>
<a id='line_292'>Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</a>
<a id='line_293'></a>
<a id='line_294'>7:5 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the</a>
<a id='line_295'>office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the</a>
<a id='line_296'>people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they</a>
<a id='line_297'>come out of the loins of Abraham: 7:6 But he whose descent is not</a>
<a id='line_298'>counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had</a>
<a id='line_299'>the promises.</a>
<a id='line_300'></a>
<a id='line_301'>7:7 And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</a>
<a id='line_302'></a>
<a id='line_303'>7:8 And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them,</a>
<a id='line_304'>of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</a>
<a id='line_305'></a>
<a id='line_306'>7:9 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes</a>
<a id='line_307'>in Abraham.</a>
<a id='line_308'></a>
<a id='line_309'>7:10 For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met</a>
<a id='line_310'>him.</a>
<a id='line_311'></a>
<a id='line_312'>7:11 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for</a>
<a id='line_313'>under it the people received the law,) what further need was there</a>
<a id='line_314'>that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and</a>
<a id='line_315'>not be called after the order of Aaron?  7:12 For the priesthood being</a>
<a id='line_316'>changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</a>
<a id='line_317'></a>
<a id='line_318'>7:13 For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another</a>
<a id='line_319'>tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</a>
<a id='line_320'></a>
<a id='line_321'>7:14 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which</a>
<a id='line_322'>tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</a>
<a id='line_323'></a>
<a id='line_324'>7:15 And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of</a>
<a id='line_325'>Melchisedec there ariseth another priest, 7:16 Who is made, not after</a>
<a id='line_326'>the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless</a>
<a id='line_327'>life.</a>
<a id='line_328'></a>
<a id='line_329'>7:17 For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of</a>
<a id='line_330'>Melchisedec.</a>
<a id='line_331'></a>
<a id='line_332'>7:18 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going</a>
<a id='line_333'>before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</a>
<a id='line_334'></a>
<a id='line_335'>7:19 For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better</a>
<a id='line_336'>hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.</a>
<a id='line_337'></a>
<a id='line_338'>7:20 And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest: 7:21 (For</a>
<a id='line_339'>those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him</a>
<a id='line_340'>that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a</a>
<a id='line_341'>priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:) 7:22 By so much was</a>
<a id='line_342'>Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</a>
<a id='line_343'></a>
<a id='line_344'>7:23 And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered</a>
<a id='line_345'>to continue by reason of death: 7:24 But this man, because he</a>
<a id='line_346'>continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</a>
<a id='line_347'></a>
<a id='line_348'>7:25 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come</a>
<a id='line_349'>unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</a>
<a id='line_350'></a>
<a id='line_351'>7:26 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless,</a>
<a id='line_352'>undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</a>
<a id='line_353'>7:27 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up</a>
<a id='line_354'>sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this</a>
<a id='line_355'>he did once, when he offered up himself.</a>
<a id='line_356'></a>
<a id='line_357'>7:28 For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the</a>
<a id='line_358'>word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is</a>
<a id='line_359'>consecrated for evermore.</a>
<a id='line_360'></a>
<a id='line_361'>8:1 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have</a>
<a id='line_362'>such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the</a>
<a id='line_363'>Majesty in the heavens; 8:2 A minister of the sanctuary, and of the</a>
<a id='line_364'>true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</a>
<a id='line_365'></a>
<a id='line_366'>8:3 For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices:</a>
<a id='line_367'>wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to</a>
<a id='line_368'>offer.</a>
<a id='line_369'></a>
<a id='line_370'>8:4 For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that</a>
<a id='line_371'>there are priests that offer gifts according to the law: 8:5 Who serve</a>
<a id='line_372'>unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was</a>
<a id='line_373'>admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See,</a>
<a id='line_374'>saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to</a>
<a id='line_375'>thee in the mount.</a>
<a id='line_376'></a>
<a id='line_377'>8:6 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much</a>
<a id='line_378'>also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established</a>
<a id='line_379'>upon better promises.</a>
<a id='line_380'></a>
<a id='line_381'>8:7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no</a>
<a id='line_382'>place have been sought for the second.</a>
<a id='line_383'></a>
<a id='line_384'>8:8 For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come,</a>
<a id='line_385'>saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of</a>
<a id='line_386'>Israel and with the house of Judah: 8:9 Not according to the covenant</a>
<a id='line_387'>that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand</a>
<a id='line_388'>to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in</a>
<a id='line_389'>my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_390'></a>
<a id='line_391'>8:10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of</a>
<a id='line_392'>Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their</a>
<a id='line_393'>mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and</a>
<a id='line_394'>they shall be to me a people: 8:11 And they shall not teach every man</a>
<a id='line_395'>his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for</a>
<a id='line_396'>all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</a>
<a id='line_397'></a>
<a id='line_398'>8:12 For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins</a>
<a id='line_399'>and their iniquities will I remember no more.</a>
<a id='line_400'></a>
<a id='line_401'>8:13 In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now</a>
<a id='line_402'>that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.</a>
<a id='line_403'></a>
<a id='line_404'>9:1 Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine</a>
<a id='line_405'>service, and a worldly sanctuary.</a>
<a id='line_406'></a>
<a id='line_407'>9:2 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the</a>
<a id='line_408'>candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the</a>
<a id='line_409'>sanctuary.</a>
<a id='line_410'></a>
<a id='line_411'>9:3 And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the</a>
<a id='line_412'>Holiest of all; 9:4 Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the</a>
<a id='line_413'>covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot</a>
<a id='line_414'>that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the</a>
<a id='line_415'>covenant; 9:5 And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the</a>
<a id='line_416'>mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.</a>
<a id='line_417'></a>
<a id='line_418'>9:6 Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always</a>
<a id='line_419'>into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.</a>
<a id='line_420'></a>
<a id='line_421'>9:7 But into the second went the high priest alone once every year,</a>
<a id='line_422'>not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of</a>
<a id='line_423'>the people: 9:8 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the</a>
<a id='line_424'>holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first</a>
<a id='line_425'>tabernacle was yet standing: 9:9 Which was a figure for the time then</a>
<a id='line_426'>present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could</a>
<a id='line_427'>not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the</a>
<a id='line_428'>conscience; 9:10 Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers</a>
<a id='line_429'>washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of</a>
<a id='line_430'>reformation.</a>
<a id='line_431'></a>
<a id='line_432'>9:11 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a</a>
<a id='line_433'>greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to</a>
<a id='line_434'>say, not of this building; 9:12 Neither by the blood of goats and</a>
<a id='line_435'>calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place,</a>
<a id='line_436'>having obtained eternal redemption for us.</a>
<a id='line_437'></a>
<a id='line_438'>9:13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an</a>
<a id='line_439'>heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the</a>
<a id='line_440'>flesh: 9:14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the</a>
<a id='line_441'>eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your</a>
<a id='line_442'>conscience from dead works to serve the living God?  9:15 And for this</a>
<a id='line_443'>cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death,</a>
<a id='line_444'>for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first</a>
<a id='line_445'>testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal</a>
<a id='line_446'>inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_447'></a>
<a id='line_448'>9:16 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the</a>
<a id='line_449'>death of the testator.</a>
<a id='line_450'></a>
<a id='line_451'>9:17 For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is</a>
<a id='line_452'>of no strength at all while the testator liveth.</a>
<a id='line_453'></a>
<a id='line_454'>9:18 Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without</a>
<a id='line_455'>blood.</a>
<a id='line_456'></a>
<a id='line_457'>9:19 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people</a>
<a id='line_458'>according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with</a>
<a id='line_459'>water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and</a>
<a id='line_460'>all the people, 9:20 Saying, This is the blood of the testament which</a>
<a id='line_461'>God hath enjoined unto you.</a>
<a id='line_462'></a>
<a id='line_463'>9:21 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the</a>
<a id='line_464'>vessels of the ministry.</a>
<a id='line_465'></a>
<a id='line_466'>9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and</a>
<a id='line_467'>without shedding of blood is no remission.</a>
<a id='line_468'></a>
<a id='line_469'>9:23 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the</a>
<a id='line_470'>heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things</a>
<a id='line_471'>themselves with better sacrifices than these.</a>
<a id='line_472'></a>
<a id='line_473'>9:24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands,</a>
<a id='line_474'>which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to</a>
<a id='line_475'>appear in the presence of God for us: 9:25 Nor yet that he should</a>
<a id='line_476'>offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place</a>
<a id='line_477'>every year with blood of others; 9:26 For then must he often have</a>
<a id='line_478'>suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of</a>
<a id='line_479'>the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of</a>
<a id='line_480'>himself.</a>
<a id='line_481'></a>
<a id='line_482'>9:27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the</a>
<a id='line_483'>judgment: 9:28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many;</a>
<a id='line_484'>and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time</a>
<a id='line_485'>without sin unto salvation.</a>
<a id='line_486'></a>
<a id='line_487'>10:1 For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the</a>
<a id='line_488'>very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they</a>
<a id='line_489'>offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.</a>
<a id='line_490'></a>
<a id='line_491'>10:2 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that</a>
<a id='line_492'>the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of</a>
<a id='line_493'>sins.</a>
<a id='line_494'></a>
<a id='line_495'>10:3 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins</a>
<a id='line_496'>every year.</a>
<a id='line_497'></a>
<a id='line_498'>10:4 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats</a>
<a id='line_499'>should take away sins.</a>
<a id='line_500'></a>
<a id='line_501'>10:5 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and</a>
<a id='line_502'>offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: 10:6 In</a>
<a id='line_503'>burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.</a>
<a id='line_504'></a>
<a id='line_505'>10:7 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written</a>
<a id='line_506'>of me,) to do thy will, O God.</a>
<a id='line_507'></a>
<a id='line_508'>10:8 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings</a>
<a id='line_509'>and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure</a>
<a id='line_510'>therein; which are offered by the law; 10:9 Then said he, Lo, I come</a>
<a id='line_511'>to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish</a>
<a id='line_512'>the second.</a>
<a id='line_513'></a>
<a id='line_514'>10:10 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the</a>
<a id='line_515'>body of Jesus Christ once for all.</a>
<a id='line_516'></a>
<a id='line_517'>10:11 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering</a>
<a id='line_518'>oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: 10:12</a>
<a id='line_519'>But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever,</a>
<a id='line_520'>sat down on the right hand of God; 10:13 From henceforth expecting</a>
<a id='line_521'>till his enemies be made his footstool.</a>
<a id='line_522'></a>
<a id='line_523'>10:14 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are</a>
<a id='line_524'>sanctified.</a>
<a id='line_525'></a>
<a id='line_526'>10:15 Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that</a>
<a id='line_527'>he had said before, 10:16 This is the covenant that I will make with</a>
<a id='line_528'>them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their</a>
<a id='line_529'>hearts, and in their minds will I write them; 10:17 And their sins and</a>
<a id='line_530'>iniquities will I remember no more.</a>
<a id='line_531'></a>
<a id='line_532'>10:18 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for</a>
<a id='line_533'>sin.</a>
<a id='line_534'></a>
<a id='line_535'>10:19 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest</a>
<a id='line_536'>by the blood of Jesus, 10:20 By a new and living way, which he hath</a>
<a id='line_537'>consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; 10:21</a>
<a id='line_538'>And having an high priest over the house of God; 10:22 Let us draw</a>
<a id='line_539'>near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts</a>
<a id='line_540'>sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure</a>
<a id='line_541'>water.</a>
<a id='line_542'></a>
<a id='line_543'>10:23 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering;</a>
<a id='line_544'>(for he is faithful that promised;) 10:24 And let us consider one</a>
<a id='line_545'>another to provoke unto love and to good works: 10:25 Not forsaking</a>
<a id='line_546'>the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but</a>
<a id='line_547'>exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day</a>
<a id='line_548'>approaching.</a>
<a id='line_549'></a>
<a id='line_550'>10:26 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge</a>
<a id='line_551'>of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, 10:27 But a</a>
<a id='line_552'>certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which</a>
<a id='line_553'>shall devour the adversaries.</a>
<a id='line_554'></a>
<a id='line_555'>10:28 He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or</a>
<a id='line_556'>three witnesses: 10:29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall</a>
<a id='line_557'>he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and</a>
<a id='line_558'>hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified,</a>
<a id='line_559'>an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?</a>
<a id='line_560'>10:30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I</a>
<a id='line_561'>will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his</a>
<a id='line_562'>people.</a>
<a id='line_563'></a>
<a id='line_564'>10:31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</a>
<a id='line_565'></a>
<a id='line_566'>10:32 But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were</a>
<a id='line_567'>illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; 10:33 Partly,</a>
<a id='line_568'>whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions;</a>
<a id='line_569'>and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.</a>
<a id='line_570'></a>
<a id='line_571'>10:34 For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the</a>
<a id='line_572'>spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a</a>
<a id='line_573'>better and an enduring substance.</a>
<a id='line_574'></a>
<a id='line_575'>10:35 Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great</a>
<a id='line_576'>recompence of reward.</a>
<a id='line_577'></a>
<a id='line_578'>10:36 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will</a>
<a id='line_579'>of God, ye might receive the promise.</a>
<a id='line_580'></a>
<a id='line_581'>10:37 For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and</a>
<a id='line_582'>will not tarry.</a>
<a id='line_583'></a>
<a id='line_584'>10:38 Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my</a>
<a id='line_585'>soul shall have no pleasure in him.</a>
<a id='line_586'></a>
<a id='line_587'>10:39 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them</a>
<a id='line_588'>that believe to the saving of the soul.</a>
<a id='line_589'></a>
<a id='line_590'>11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of</a>
<a id='line_591'>things not seen.</a>
<a id='line_592'></a>
<a id='line_593'>11:2 For by it the elders obtained a good report.</a>
<a id='line_594'></a>
<a id='line_595'>11:3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the</a>
<a id='line_596'>word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things</a>
<a id='line_597'>which do appear.</a>
<a id='line_598'></a>
<a id='line_599'>11:4 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than</a>
<a id='line_600'>Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God</a>
<a id='line_601'>testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</a>
<a id='line_602'></a>
<a id='line_603'>11:5 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and</a>
<a id='line_604'>was not found, because God had translated him: for before his</a>
<a id='line_605'>translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</a>
<a id='line_606'></a>
<a id='line_607'>11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that</a>
<a id='line_608'>cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of</a>
<a id='line_609'>them that diligently seek him.</a>
<a id='line_610'></a>
<a id='line_611'>11:7 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,</a>
<a id='line_612'>moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the</a>
<a id='line_613'>which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness</a>
<a id='line_614'>which is by faith.</a>
<a id='line_615'></a>
<a id='line_616'>11:8 By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which</a>
<a id='line_617'>he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out,</a>
<a id='line_618'>not knowing whither he went.</a>
<a id='line_619'></a>
<a id='line_620'>11:9 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange</a>
<a id='line_621'>country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with</a>
<a id='line_622'>him of the same promise: 11:10 For he looked for a city which hath</a>
<a id='line_623'>foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</a>
<a id='line_624'></a>
<a id='line_625'>11:11 Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive</a>
<a id='line_626'>seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she</a>
<a id='line_627'>judged him faithful who had promised.</a>
<a id='line_628'></a>
<a id='line_629'>11:12 Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so</a>
<a id='line_630'>many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by</a>
<a id='line_631'>the sea shore innumerable.</a>
<a id='line_632'></a>
<a id='line_633'>11:13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but</a>
<a id='line_634'>having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced</a>
<a id='line_635'>them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the</a>
<a id='line_636'>earth.</a>
<a id='line_637'></a>
<a id='line_638'>11:14 For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a</a>
<a id='line_639'>country.</a>
<a id='line_640'></a>
<a id='line_641'>11:15 And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence</a>
<a id='line_642'>they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.</a>
<a id='line_643'></a>
<a id='line_644'>11:16 But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly:</a>
<a id='line_645'>wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath</a>
<a id='line_646'>prepared for them a city.</a>
<a id='line_647'></a>
<a id='line_648'>11:17 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he</a>
<a id='line_649'>that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, 11:18</a>
<a id='line_650'>Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called: 11:19</a>
<a id='line_651'>Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from</a>
<a id='line_652'>whence also he received him in a figure.</a>
<a id='line_653'></a>
<a id='line_654'>11:20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</a>
<a id='line_655'></a>
<a id='line_656'>11:21 By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of</a>
<a id='line_657'>Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.</a>
<a id='line_658'></a>
<a id='line_659'>11:22 By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of</a>
<a id='line_660'>the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.</a>
<a id='line_661'></a>
<a id='line_662'>11:23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his</a>
<a id='line_663'>parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not</a>
<a id='line_664'>afraid of the king’s commandment.</a>
<a id='line_665'></a>
<a id='line_666'>11:24 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called</a>
<a id='line_667'>the son of Pharaoh’s daughter; 11:25 Choosing rather to suffer</a>
<a id='line_668'>affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin</a>
<a id='line_669'>for a season; 11:26 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches</a>
<a id='line_670'>than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of</a>
<a id='line_671'>the reward.</a>
<a id='line_672'></a>
<a id='line_673'>11:27 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king:</a>
<a id='line_674'>for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</a>
<a id='line_675'></a>
<a id='line_676'>11:28 Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood,</a>
<a id='line_677'>lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</a>
<a id='line_678'></a>
<a id='line_679'>11:29 By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which</a>
<a id='line_680'>the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.</a>
<a id='line_681'></a>
<a id='line_682'>11:30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were</a>
<a id='line_683'>compassed about seven days.</a>
<a id='line_684'></a>
<a id='line_685'>11:31 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed</a>
<a id='line_686'>not, when she had received the spies with peace.</a>
<a id='line_687'></a>
<a id='line_688'>11:32 And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of</a>
<a id='line_689'>Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also,</a>
<a id='line_690'>and Samuel, and of the prophets: 11:33 Who through faith subdued</a>
<a id='line_691'>kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths</a>
<a id='line_692'>of lions.</a>
<a id='line_693'></a>
<a id='line_694'>11:34 Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,</a>
<a id='line_695'>out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to</a>
<a id='line_696'>flight the armies of the aliens.</a>
<a id='line_697'></a>
<a id='line_698'>11:35 Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were</a>
<a id='line_699'>tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better</a>
<a id='line_700'>resurrection: 11:36 And others had trial of cruel mockings and</a>
<a id='line_701'>scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: 11:37 They were</a>
<a id='line_702'>stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the</a>
<a id='line_703'>sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being</a>
<a id='line_704'>destitute, afflicted, tormented; 11:38 (Of whom the world was not</a>
<a id='line_705'>worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and</a>
<a id='line_706'>caves of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_707'></a>
<a id='line_708'>11:39 And these all, having obtained a good report through faith,</a>
<a id='line_709'>received not the promise: 11:40 God having provided some better thing</a>
<a id='line_710'>for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.</a>
<a id='line_711'></a>
<a id='line_712'>12:1 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a</a>
<a id='line_713'>cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which</a>
<a id='line_714'>doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is</a>
<a id='line_715'>set before us, 12:2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our</a>
<a id='line_716'>faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross,</a>
<a id='line_717'>despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne</a>
<a id='line_718'>of God.</a>
<a id='line_719'></a>
<a id='line_720'>12:3 For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners</a>
<a id='line_721'>against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.</a>
<a id='line_722'></a>
<a id='line_723'>12:4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.</a>
<a id='line_724'></a>
<a id='line_725'>12:5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as</a>
<a id='line_726'>unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord,</a>
<a id='line_727'>nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: 12:6 For whom the Lord loveth</a>
<a id='line_728'>he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</a>
<a id='line_729'></a>
<a id='line_730'>12:7 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for</a>
<a id='line_731'>what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?  12:8 But if ye be</a>
<a id='line_732'>without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards,</a>
<a id='line_733'>and not sons.</a>
<a id='line_734'></a>
<a id='line_735'>12:9 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us,</a>
<a id='line_736'>and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection</a>
<a id='line_737'>unto the Father of spirits, and live?  12:10 For they verily for a few</a>
<a id='line_738'>days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit,</a>
<a id='line_739'>that we might be partakers of his holiness.</a>
<a id='line_740'></a>
<a id='line_741'>12:11 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but</a>
<a id='line_742'>grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of</a>
<a id='line_743'>righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.</a>
<a id='line_744'></a>
<a id='line_745'>12:12 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble</a>
<a id='line_746'>knees; 12:13 And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is</a>
<a id='line_747'>lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.</a>
<a id='line_748'></a>
<a id='line_749'>12:14 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man</a>
<a id='line_750'>shall see the Lord: 12:15 Looking diligently lest any man fail of the</a>
<a id='line_751'>grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you,</a>
<a id='line_752'>and thereby many be defiled; 12:16 Lest there be any fornicator, or</a>
<a id='line_753'>profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his</a>
<a id='line_754'>birthright.</a>
<a id='line_755'></a>
<a id='line_756'>12:17 For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the</a>
<a id='line_757'>blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though</a>
<a id='line_758'>he sought it carefully with tears.</a>
<a id='line_759'></a>
<a id='line_760'>12:18 For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and</a>
<a id='line_761'>that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,</a>
<a id='line_762'>12:19 And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice</a>
<a id='line_763'>they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them</a>
<a id='line_764'>any more: 12:20 (For they could not endure that which was commanded,</a>
<a id='line_765'>And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or</a>
<a id='line_766'>thrust through with a dart: 12:21 And so terrible was the sight, that</a>
<a id='line_767'>Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:) 12:22 But ye are come unto</a>
<a id='line_768'>mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly</a>
<a id='line_769'>Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, 12:23 To the</a>
<a id='line_770'>general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in</a>
<a id='line_771'>heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men</a>
<a id='line_772'>made perfect, 12:24 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and</a>
<a id='line_773'>to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of</a>
<a id='line_774'>Abel.</a>
<a id='line_775'></a>
<a id='line_776'>12:25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped</a>
<a id='line_777'>not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we</a>
<a id='line_778'>escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven: 12:26</a>
<a id='line_779'>Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying,</a>
<a id='line_780'>Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.</a>
<a id='line_781'></a>
<a id='line_782'>12:27 And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those</a>
<a id='line_783'>things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things</a>
<a id='line_784'>which cannot be shaken may remain.</a>
<a id='line_785'></a>
<a id='line_786'>12:28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us</a>
<a id='line_787'>have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and</a>
<a id='line_788'>godly fear: 12:29 For our God is a consuming fire.</a>
<a id='line_789'></a>
<a id='line_790'>13:1 Let brotherly love continue.</a>
<a id='line_791'></a>
<a id='line_792'>13:2 Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have</a>
<a id='line_793'>entertained angels unawares.</a>
<a id='line_794'></a>
<a id='line_795'>13:3 Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them</a>
<a id='line_796'>which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.</a>
<a id='line_797'></a>
<a id='line_798'>13:4 Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but</a>
<a id='line_799'>whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.</a>
<a id='line_800'></a>
<a id='line_801'>13:5 Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content</a>
<a id='line_802'>with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave</a>
<a id='line_803'>thee, nor forsake thee.</a>
<a id='line_804'></a>
<a id='line_805'>13:6 So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not</a>
<a id='line_806'>fear what man shall do unto me.</a>
<a id='line_807'></a>
<a id='line_808'>13:7 Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto</a>
<a id='line_809'>you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their</a>
<a id='line_810'>conversation.</a>
<a id='line_811'></a>
<a id='line_812'>13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.</a>
<a id='line_813'></a>
<a id='line_814'>13:9 Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is</a>
<a id='line_815'>a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats,</a>
<a id='line_816'>which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.</a>
<a id='line_817'></a>
<a id='line_818'>13:10 We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve</a>
<a id='line_819'>the tabernacle.</a>
<a id='line_820'></a>
<a id='line_821'>13:11 For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the</a>
<a id='line_822'>sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.</a>
<a id='line_823'></a>
<a id='line_824'>13:12 Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his</a>
<a id='line_825'>own blood, suffered without the gate.</a>
<a id='line_826'></a>
<a id='line_827'>13:13 Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his</a>
<a id='line_828'>reproach.</a>
<a id='line_829'></a>
<a id='line_830'>13:14 For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.</a>
<a id='line_831'></a>
<a id='line_832'>13:15 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God</a>
<a id='line_833'>continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.</a>
<a id='line_834'></a>
<a id='line_835'>13:16 But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such</a>
<a id='line_836'>sacrifices God is well pleased.</a>
<a id='line_837'></a>
<a id='line_838'>13:17 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves:</a>
<a id='line_839'>for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that</a>
<a id='line_840'>they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable</a>
<a id='line_841'>for you.</a>
<a id='line_842'></a>
<a id='line_843'>13:18 Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all</a>
<a id='line_844'>things willing to live honestly.</a>
<a id='line_845'></a>
<a id='line_846'>13:19 But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored</a>
<a id='line_847'>to you the sooner.</a>
<a id='line_848'></a>
<a id='line_849'>13:20 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord</a>
<a id='line_850'>Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the</a>
<a id='line_851'>everlasting covenant, 13:21 Make you perfect in every good work to do</a>
<a id='line_852'>his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight,</a>
<a id='line_853'>through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_854'></a>
<a id='line_855'>13:22 And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for</a>
<a id='line_856'>I have written a letter unto you in few words.</a>
<a id='line_857'></a>
<a id='line_858'>13:23 Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom,</a>
<a id='line_859'>if he come shortly, I will see you.</a>
<a id='line_860'></a>
<a id='line_861'>13:24 Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints.</a>
<a id='line_862'></a>
<a id='line_863'>They of Italy salute you.</a>
<a id='line_864'></a>
<a id='line_865'>13:25 Grace be with you all. Amen.</a>
