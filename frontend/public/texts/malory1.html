<a id='line_763'>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</a>
<a id='line_764'></a>
<a id='line_765'></a>
<a id='line_766'>The Morte D’Arthur was finished, as the epilogue tells us, in the ninth</a>
<a id='line_767'>year of Edward IV., i.e. between March 4, 1469 and the same date in</a>
<a id='line_768'>1470. It is thus, fitly enough, the last important English book written</a>
<a id='line_769'>before the introduction of printing into this country, and since no</a>
<a id='line_770'>manuscript of it has come down to us it is also the first English</a>
<a id='line_771'>classic for our knowledge of which we are entirely dependent on a</a>
<a id='line_772'>printed text. Caxton’s story of how the book was brought to him and he</a>
<a id='line_773'>was induced to print it may be read farther on in his own preface. From</a>
<a id='line_774'>this we learn also that he was not only the printer of the book, but to</a>
<a id='line_775'>some extent its editor also, dividing Malory’s work into twenty-one</a>
<a id='line_776'>books, splitting up the books into chapters, by no means skilfully, and</a>
<a id='line_777'>supplying the “Rubrish” or chapter-headings. It may be added that</a>
<a id='line_778'>Caxton’s preface contains, moreover, a brief criticism which, on the</a>
<a id='line_779'>points on which it touches, is still the soundest and most sympathetic</a>
<a id='line_780'>that has been written.</a>
<a id='line_781'></a>
<a id='line_782'>Caxton finished his edition the last day of July 1485, some fifteen or</a>
<a id='line_783'>sixteen years after Malory wrote his epilogue. It is clear that the</a>
<a id='line_784'>author was then dead, or the printer would not have acted as a clumsy</a>
<a id='line_785'>editor to the book, and recent discoveries (if bibliography may, for</a>
<a id='line_786'>the moment, enlarge its bounds to mention such matters) have revealed</a>
<a id='line_787'>with tolerable certainty when Malory died and who he was. In letters to</a>
<a id='line_788'>The Athenaeum in July 1896 Mr. T. Williams pointed out that the name of</a>
<a id='line_789'>a Sir Thomas Malorie occurred among those of a number of other</a>
<a id='line_790'>Lancastrians excluded from a general pardon granted by Edward IV. in</a>
<a id='line_791'>1468, and that a William Mallerye was mentioned in the same year as</a>
<a id='line_792'>taking part in a Lancastrian rising. In September 1897, again, in</a>
<a id='line_793'>another letter to the same paper, Mr. A. T. Martin reported the finding</a>
<a id='line_794'>of the will of a Thomas Malory of Papworth, a hundred partly in</a>
<a id='line_795'>Cambridgeshire, partly in Hunts. This will was made on September 16,</a>
<a id='line_796'>1469, and as it was proved the 27th of the next month the testator must</a>
<a id='line_797'>have been in immediate expectation of death. It contains the most</a>
<a id='line_798'>careful provision for the education and starting in life of a family of</a>
<a id='line_799'>three daughters and seven sons, of whom the youngest seems to have been</a>
<a id='line_800'>still an infant. We cannot say with certainty that this Thomas Malory,</a>
<a id='line_801'>whose last thoughts were so busy for his children, was our author, or</a>
<a id='line_802'>that the Lancastrian knight discovered by Mr. Williams was identical</a>
<a id='line_803'>with either or both, but such evidence as the Morte D’Arthur offers</a>
<a id='line_804'>favours such a belief. There is not only the epilogue with its</a>
<a id='line_805'>petition, “pray for me while I am alive that God send me good</a>
<a id='line_806'>deliverance and when I am dead pray you all for my soul,” but this very</a>
<a id='line_807'>request is foreshadowed at the end of chap. 37 of Book ix. in the</a>
<a id='line_808'>touching passage, surely inspired by personal experience, as to the</a>
<a id='line_809'>sickness “that is the greatest pain a prisoner may have”; and the</a>
<a id='line_810'>reflections on English fickleness in the first chapter of Book xxi.,</a>
<a id='line_811'>though the Wars of the Roses might have inspired them in any one, come</a>
<a id='line_812'>most naturally from an author who was a Lancastrian knight.</a>
<a id='line_813'></a>
<a id='line_814'>If the Morte D’Arthur was really written in prison and by a prisoner</a>
<a id='line_815'>distressed by ill-health as well as by lack of liberty, surely no task</a>
<a id='line_816'>was ever better devised to while away weary hours. Leaving abundant</a>
<a id='line_817'>scope for originality in selection, modification, and arrangement, as a</a>
<a id='line_818'>compilation and translation it had in it that mechanical element which</a>
<a id='line_819'>adds the touch of restfulness to literary work. No original, it is</a>
<a id='line_820'>said, has yet been found for Book vii., and it is possible that none</a>
<a id='line_821'>will ever be forthcoming for chap. 20 of Book xviii., which describes</a>
<a id='line_822'>the arrival of the body of the Fair Maiden of Astolat at Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_823'>court, or vii for chap. 25 of the same book, with its discourse on true</a>
<a id='line_824'>love; but the great bulk of the work has been traced chapter by chapter</a>
<a id='line_825'>to the “Merlin” of Robert de Borron and his successors (Bks. i.-iv.),</a>
<a id='line_826'>the English metrical romance La Morte Arthur of the Thornton manuscript</a>
<a id='line_827'>(Bk. v.), the French romances of Tristan (Bks. viii.-x.) and of</a>
<a id='line_828'>Launcelot (Bks. vi., xi.-xix.), and lastly to the English prose Morte</a>
<a id='line_829'>Arthur of Harley MS. 2252 (Bks. xviii., xx., xxi.). As to Malory’s</a>
<a id='line_830'>choice of his authorities critics have not failed to point out that now</a>
<a id='line_831'>and again he gives a worse version where a better has come down to us,</a>
<a id='line_832'>and if he had been able to order a complete set of Arthurian</a>
<a id='line_833'>manuscripts from his bookseller, no doubt he would have done even</a>
<a id='line_834'>better than he did! But of the skill, approaching to original genius,</a>
<a id='line_835'>with which he used the books from which he worked there is little</a>
<a id='line_836'>dispute.</a>
<a id='line_837'></a>
<a id='line_838'>Malory died leaving his work obviously unrevised, and in this condition</a>
<a id='line_839'>it was brought to Caxton, who prepared it for the press with his usual</a>
<a id='line_840'>enthusiasm in the cause of good literature, and also, it must be added,</a>
<a id='line_841'>with his usual carelessness. New chapters are sometimes made to begin</a>
<a id='line_842'>in the middle of a sentence, and in addition to simple misprints there</a>
<a id='line_843'>are numerous passages in which it is impossible to believe that we have</a>
<a id='line_844'>the text as Malory intended it to stand. After Caxton’s edition</a>
<a id='line_845'>Malory’s manuscript must have disappeared, and subsequent editions are</a>
<a id='line_846'>differentiated only by the degree of closeness with which they follow</a>
<a id='line_847'>the first. Editions appeared printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1498 and</a>
<a id='line_848'>1529, by William Copland in 1559, by Thomas East about 1585, and by</a>
<a id='line_849'>Thomas Stansby in 1634, each printer apparently taking the text of his</a>
<a id='line_850'>immediate predecessor and reproducing it with modifications. Stansby’s</a>
<a id='line_851'>edition served for reprints in 1816 and 1856 (the latter edited by</a>
<a id='line_852'>Thomas Wright); but in 1817 an edition supervised by Robert Southey</a>
<a id='line_853'>went back to Caxton’s text, though to a copy (only two are extant, and</a>
<a id='line_854'>only one perfect!) in which eleven leaves were supplied from Wynkyn de</a>
<a id='line_855'>Worde’s reprint. In 1868 Sir Edward Strachey produced for the present</a>
<a id='line_856'>publishers a reprint of Southey’s text in modern spelling, with the</a>
<a id='line_857'>substitution of current words for those now obsolete, and the softening</a>
<a id='line_858'>of a handful of passages likely, he thought, to prevent the book being</a>
<a id='line_859'>placed in the hands of boys. In 1889 a boon was conferred on scholars</a>
<a id='line_860'>by the publication of Dr. H. Oskar Sommer’s page-for-page reprint of</a>
<a id='line_861'>Caxton’s text, with an elaborate discussion of Malory’s sources. Dr.</a>
<a id='line_862'>Sommer’s edition was used by Sir E. Strachey to revise his Globe text,</a>
<a id='line_863'>and in 1897 Mr. Israel Gollancz produced for the “Temple Classics” a</a>
<a id='line_864'>very pretty edition in which Sir Edward Strachey’s principles of</a>
<a id='line_865'>modernisation in spelling and punctuation were adopted, but with the</a>
<a id='line_866'>restoration of obsolete words and omitted phrases. As to the present</a>
<a id='line_867'>edition, Sir Edward Strachey altered with so sparing a hand that on</a>
<a id='line_868'>many pages differences between his version and that here printed will</a>
<a id='line_869'>be looked for in vain; but the most anxious care has been taken to</a>
<a id='line_870'>produce a text modernised as to its spelling, but in other respects in</a>
<a id='line_871'>accurate accordance with Caxton’s text, as represented by Dr Sommer’s</a>
<a id='line_872'>reprint. Obvious misprints have been silently corrected, but in a few</a>
<a id='line_873'>cases notes show where emendations have been introduced from Wynkyn de</a>
<a id='line_874'>Worde—not that Wynkyn had any more right to emend Caxton than we, but</a>
<a id='line_875'>because even a printer’s conjecture gains a little sanctity after four</a>
<a id='line_876'>centuries. The restoration of obsolete words has necessitated a much</a>
<a id='line_877'>fuller glossary, and the index of names has therefore been separated</a>
<a id='line_878'>from it and enlarged. In its present form the index is the work of Mr.</a>
<a id='line_879'>Henry Littlehales.</a>

<a id='line_885'>PREFACE OF WILLIAM CAXTON</a>
<a id='line_886'></a>
<a id='line_887'>After that I had accomplished and finished divers histories, as well of</a>
<a id='line_888'>contemplation as of other historial and worldly acts of great</a>
<a id='line_889'>conquerors and princes, and also certain books of ensamples and</a>
<a id='line_890'>doctrine, many noble and divers gentlemen of this realm of England came</a>
<a id='line_891'>and demanded me many and oft times, wherefore that I have not do made</a>
<a id='line_892'>and imprint the noble history of the Saint Greal, and of the most</a>
<a id='line_893'>renowned Christian king, first and chief of the three best Christian,</a>
<a id='line_894'>and worthy, King Arthur, which ought most to be remembered among us</a>
<a id='line_895'>Englishmen to-fore all other Christian kings; for it is notoyrly known</a>
<a id='line_896'>through the universal world, that there be nine worthy and the best</a>
<a id='line_897'>that ever were, that is to wit, three Paynims, three Jews, and three</a>
<a id='line_898'>Christian men. As for the Paynims, they were to-fore the Incarnation of</a>
<a id='line_899'>Christ, which were named, the first Hector of Troy, of whom the history</a>
<a id='line_900'>is comen both in ballad and in prose, the second Alexander the Great,</a>
<a id='line_901'>and the third Julius Caesar, Emperor of Rome, of whom the histories be</a>
<a id='line_902'>well known and had. And as for the three Jews, which also were to-fore</a>
<a id='line_903'>the incarnation of our Lord, of whom the first was duke Joshua which</a>
<a id='line_904'>brought the children of Israel into the land of behest, the second</a>
<a id='line_905'>David king of Jerusalem, and the third Judas Machabeus, of these three</a>
<a id='line_906'>the Bible rehearseth all their noble histories and acts. And since the</a>
<a id='line_907'>said Incarnation have been three noble Christian men, stalled and</a>
<a id='line_908'>admitted through the universal world into the number of the nine best</a>
<a id='line_909'>and worthy. Of whom was first the noble Arthur, whose noble acts I</a>
<a id='line_910'>purpose to write in this present book here following. The second was</a>
<a id='line_911'>Charlemain, or Charles the Great, of whom the history is had in many</a>
<a id='line_912'>places, both in French and in English. And the third and last was</a>
<a id='line_913'>Godfrey of Boloine, of whose acts and life I made a book unto the</a>
<a id='line_914'>excellent prince and king of noble memory, King Edward the Fourth.</a>
<a id='line_915'></a>
<a id='line_916'>The said noble gentlemen instantly required me to imprint the history</a>
<a id='line_917'>of the said noble king and conqueror King Arthur, and of his knights,</a>
<a id='line_918'>with the history of the Saint Greal, and of the death and ending of the</a>
<a id='line_919'>said Arthur; affirming that I ought rather to imprint his acts and</a>
<a id='line_920'>noble feats, than of Godfrey of Boloine, or any of the other eight,</a>
<a id='line_921'>considering that he was a man born within this realm, and king and</a>
<a id='line_922'>emperor of the same: and that there be in French divers and many noble</a>
<a id='line_923'>volumes of his acts, and also of his knights. To whom I answered that</a>
<a id='line_924'>divers men hold opinion that there was no such Arthur, and that all</a>
<a id='line_925'>such books as been made of him be feigned and fables, because that some</a>
<a id='line_926'>chronicles make of him no mention, nor remember him nothing, nor of his</a>
<a id='line_927'>knights. Whereto they answered, and one in special said, that in him</a>
<a id='line_928'>that should say or think that there was never such a king called Arthur</a>
<a id='line_929'>might well be aretted great folly and blindness. For he said that there</a>
<a id='line_930'>were many evidences of the contrary. First ye may see his sepulchre in</a>
<a id='line_931'>the monastery of Glastonbury. And also in Policronicon, in the fifth</a>
<a id='line_932'>book the sixth chapter, and in the seventh book the twenty-third</a>
<a id='line_933'>chapter, where his body was buried, and after found, and translated</a>
<a id='line_934'>into the said monastery. Ye shall see also in the history of Bochas, in</a>
<a id='line_935'>his book De Casu Principum, part of his noble acts, and also of his</a>
<a id='line_936'>fall. Also Galfridus in his British book recounteth his life: and in</a>
<a id='line_937'>divers places of England many remembrances be yet of him, and shall</a>
<a id='line_938'>remain perpetually, and also of his knights. First in the abbey of</a>
<a id='line_939'>Westminster, at St. Edward’s shrine, remaineth the print of his seal in</a>
<a id='line_940'>red wax closed in beryl, in which is written, Patricius Arthurus</a>
<a id='line_941'>Britannie, Gallie, Germanie, Dacie, Imperator. Item in the castle of</a>
<a id='line_942'>Dover ye may see Gawaine’s skull, and Cradok’s mantle: at Winchester</a>
<a id='line_943'>the Round Table: in other places Launcelot’s sword and many other</a>
<a id='line_944'>things. Then all these things considered, there can no man reasonably</a>
<a id='line_945'>gainsay but there was a king of this land named Arthur. For in all</a>
<a id='line_946'>places, Christian and heathen, he is reputed and taken for one of the</a>
<a id='line_947'>nine worthy, and the first of the three Christian men. And also, he is</a>
<a id='line_948'>more spoken of beyond the sea, more books made of his noble acts, than</a>
<a id='line_949'>there be in England, as well in Dutch, Italian, Spanish, and Greekish,</a>
<a id='line_950'>as in French. And yet of record remain in witness of him in Wales, in</a>
<a id='line_951'>the town of Camelot, the great stones and the marvellous works of iron</a>
<a id='line_952'>lying under the ground, and royal vaults, which divers now living have</a>
<a id='line_953'>seen. Wherefore it is a marvel why he is no more renowned in his own</a>
<a id='line_954'>country, save only it accordeth to the Word of God, which saith that no</a>
<a id='line_955'>man is accepted for a prophet in his own country.</a>
<a id='line_956'></a>
<a id='line_957'>Then all these things aforesaid alleged, I could not well deny but that</a>
<a id='line_958'>there was such a noble king named Arthur, and reputed one of the nine</a>
<a id='line_959'>worthy, and first and chief of the Christian men. And many noble</a>
<a id='line_960'>volumes be made of him and of his noble knights in French, which I have</a>
<a id='line_961'>seen and read beyond the sea, which be not had in our maternal tongue.</a>
<a id='line_962'>But in Welsh be many and also in French, and some in English but</a>
<a id='line_963'>nowhere nigh all. Wherefore, such as have late been drawn out briefly</a>
<a id='line_964'>into English I have after the simple conning that God hath sent to me,</a>
<a id='line_965'>under the favour and correction of all noble lords and gentlemen,</a>
<a id='line_966'>enprised to imprint a book of the noble histories of the said King</a>
<a id='line_967'>Arthur, and of certain of his knights, after a copy unto me delivered,</a>
<a id='line_968'>which copy Sir Thomas Malorye did take out of certain books of French,</a>
<a id='line_969'>and reduced it into English. And I, according to my copy, have done set</a>
<a id='line_970'>it in imprint, to the intent that noble men may see and learn the noble</a>
<a id='line_971'>acts of chivalry, the gentle and virtuous deeds that some knights used</a>
<a id='line_972'>in those days, by which they came to honour, and how they that were</a>
<a id='line_973'>vicious were punished and oft put to shame and rebuke; humbly</a>
<a id='line_974'>beseeching all noble lords and ladies, with all other estates of what</a>
<a id='line_975'>estate or degree they been of, that shall see and read in this said</a>
<a id='line_976'>book and work, that they take the good and honest acts in their</a>
<a id='line_977'>remembrance, and to follow the same. Wherein they shall find many</a>
<a id='line_978'>joyous and pleasant histories, and noble and renowned acts of humanity,</a>
<a id='line_979'>gentleness, and chivalry. For herein may be seen noble chivalry,</a>
<a id='line_980'>courtesy, humanity, friendliness, hardiness, love, friendship,</a>
<a id='line_981'>cowardice, murder, hate, virtue, and sin. Do after the good and leave</a>
<a id='line_982'>the evil, and it shall bring you to good fame and renown. And for to</a>
<a id='line_983'>pass the time this book shall be pleasant to read in, but for to give</a>
<a id='line_984'>faith and belief that all is true that is contained herein, ye be at</a>
<a id='line_985'>your liberty: but all is written for our doctrine, and for to beware</a>
<a id='line_986'>that we fall not to vice nor sin, but to exercise and follow virtue, by</a>
<a id='line_987'>which we may come and attain to good fame and renown in this life, and</a>
<a id='line_988'>after this short and transitory life to come unto everlasting bliss in</a>
<a id='line_989'>heaven; the which He grant us that reigneth in heaven, the blessed</a>
<a id='line_990'>Trinity. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_991'></a>
<a id='line_992'>Then to proceed forth in this said book, which I direct unto all noble</a>
<a id='line_993'>princes, lords and ladies, gentlemen or gentlewomen, that desire to</a>
<a id='line_994'>read or hear read of the noble and joyous history of the great</a>
<a id='line_995'>conqueror and excellent king, King Arthur, sometime king of this noble</a>
<a id='line_996'>realm, then called Britain; I, William Caxton, simple person, present</a>

<a id='line_1041'></a>
<a id='line_1042'></a>
<a id='line_1043'></a>
<a id='line_1044'>CHAPTER I. First, How Uther Pendragon sent for the duke of Cornwall and</a>
<a id='line_1045'>Igraine his wife, and of their departing suddenly again.</a>
<a id='line_1046'></a>
<a id='line_1047'>It befell in the days of Uther Pendragon, when he was king of all</a>
<a id='line_1048'>England, and so reigned, that there was a mighty duke in Cornwall that</a>
<a id='line_1049'>held war against him long time. And the duke was called the Duke of</a>
<a id='line_1050'>Tintagil. And so by means King Uther sent for this duke, charging him</a>
<a id='line_1051'>to bring his wife with him, for she was called a fair lady, and a</a>
<a id='line_1052'>passing wise, and her name was called Igraine.</a>
<a id='line_1053'></a>
<a id='line_1054'>So when the duke and his wife were come unto the king, by the means of</a>
<a id='line_1055'>great lords they were accorded both. The king liked and loved this lady</a>
<a id='line_1056'>well, and he made them great cheer out of measure, and desired to have</a>
<a id='line_1057'>lain by her. But she was a passing good woman, and would not assent</a>
<a id='line_1058'>unto the king. And then she told the duke her husband, and said, I</a>
<a id='line_1059'>suppose that we were sent for that I should be dishonoured; wherefore,</a>
<a id='line_1060'>husband, I counsel you, that we depart from hence suddenly, that we may</a>
<a id='line_1061'>ride all night unto our own castle. And in like wise as she said so</a>
<a id='line_1062'>they departed, that neither the king nor none of his council were ware</a>
<a id='line_1063'>of their departing. All so soon as King Uther knew of their departing</a>
<a id='line_1064'>so suddenly, he was wonderly wroth. Then he called to him his privy</a>
<a id='line_1065'>council, and told them of the sudden departing of the duke and his</a>
<a id='line_1066'>wife.</a>
<a id='line_1067'></a>
<a id='line_1068'>Then they advised the king to send for the duke and his wife by a great</a>
<a id='line_1069'>charge; and if he will not come at your summons, then may ye do your</a>
<a id='line_1070'>best, then have ye cause to make mighty war upon him. So that was done,</a>
<a id='line_1071'>and the messengers had their answers; and that was this shortly, that</a>
<a id='line_1072'>neither he nor his wife would not come at him.</a>
<a id='line_1073'></a>
<a id='line_1074'>Then was the king wonderly wroth. And then the king sent him plain word</a>
<a id='line_1075'>again, and bade him be ready and stuff him and garnish him, for within</a>
<a id='line_1076'>forty days he would fetch him out of the biggest castle that he hath.</a>
<a id='line_1077'></a>
<a id='line_1078'>When the duke had this warning, anon he went and furnished and</a>
<a id='line_1079'>garnished two strong castles of his, of the which the one hight</a>
<a id='line_1080'>Tintagil, and the other castle hight Terrabil. So his wife Dame Igraine</a>
<a id='line_1081'>he put in the castle of Tintagil, and himself he put in the castle of</a>
<a id='line_1082'>Terrabil, the which had many issues and posterns out. Then in all haste</a>
<a id='line_1083'>came Uther with a great host, and laid a siege about the castle of</a>
<a id='line_1084'>Terrabil. And there he pight many pavilions, and there was great war</a>
<a id='line_1085'>made on both parties, and much people slain. Then for pure anger and</a>
<a id='line_1086'>for great love of fair Igraine the king Uther fell sick. So came to the</a>
<a id='line_1087'>king Uther Sir Ulfius, a noble knight, and asked the king why he was</a>
<a id='line_1088'>sick. I shall tell thee, said the king, I am sick for anger and for</a>
<a id='line_1089'>love of fair Igraine, that I may not be whole. Well, my lord, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_1090'>Ulfius, I shall seek Merlin, and he shall do you remedy, that your</a>
<a id='line_1091'>heart shall be pleased. So Ulfius departed, and by adventure he met</a>
<a id='line_1092'>Merlin in a beggar’s array, and there Merlin asked Ulfius whom he</a>
<a id='line_1093'>sought. And he said he had little ado to tell him. Well, said Merlin, I</a>
<a id='line_1094'>know whom thou seekest, for thou seekest Merlin; therefore seek no</a>
<a id='line_1095'>farther, for I am he; and if King Uther will well reward me, and be</a>
<a id='line_1096'>sworn unto me to fulfil my desire, that shall be his honour and profit</a>
<a id='line_1097'>more than mine; for I shall cause him to have all his desire. All this</a>
<a id='line_1098'>will I undertake, said Ulfius, that there shall be nothing reasonable</a>
<a id='line_1099'>but thou shalt have thy desire. Well, said Merlin, he shall have his</a>
<a id='line_1100'>intent and desire. And therefore, said Merlin, ride on your way, for I</a>
<a id='line_1101'>will not be long behind.</a>
<a id='line_1102'></a>
<a id='line_1103'></a>
<a id='line_1104'></a>
<a id='line_1105'>CHAPTER II. How Uther Pendragon made war on the duke of Cornwall, and</a>
<a id='line_1106'>how by the mean of Merlin he lay by the duchess and gat Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_1107'></a>
<a id='line_1108'>Then Ulfius was glad, and rode on more than a pace till that he came to</a>
<a id='line_1109'>King Uther Pendragon, and told him he had met with Merlin. Where is he?</a>
<a id='line_1110'>said the king. Sir, said Ulfius, he will not dwell long. Therewithal</a>
<a id='line_1111'>Ulfius was ware where Merlin stood at the porch of the pavilion’s door.</a>
<a id='line_1112'>And then Merlin was bound to come to the king. When King Uther saw him,</a>
<a id='line_1113'>he said he was welcome. Sir, said Merlin, I know all your heart every</a>
<a id='line_1114'>deal; so ye will be sworn unto me as ye be a true king anointed, to</a>
<a id='line_1115'>fulfil my desire, ye shall have your desire. Then the king was sworn</a>
<a id='line_1116'>upon the Four Evangelists. Sir, said Merlin, this is my desire: the</a>
<a id='line_1117'>first night that ye shall lie by Igraine ye shall get a child on her,</a>
<a id='line_1118'>and when that is born, that it shall be delivered to me for to nourish</a>
<a id='line_1119'>there as I will have it; for it shall be your worship, and the child’s</a>
<a id='line_1120'>avail, as mickle as the child is worth. I will well, said the king, as</a>
<a id='line_1121'>thou wilt have it. Now make you ready, said Merlin, this night ye shall</a>
<a id='line_1122'>lie with Igraine in the castle of Tintagil; and ye shall be like the</a>
<a id='line_1123'>duke her husband, Ulfius shall be like Sir Brastias, a knight of the</a>
<a id='line_1124'>duke’s, and I will be like a knight that hight Sir Jordanus, a knight</a>
<a id='line_1125'>of the duke’s. But wait ye make not many questions with her nor her</a>
<a id='line_1126'>men, but say ye are diseased, and so hie you to bed, and rise not on</a>
<a id='line_1127'>the morn till I come to you, for the castle of Tintagil is but ten</a>
<a id='line_1128'>miles hence; so this was done as they devised. But the duke of Tintagil</a>
<a id='line_1129'>espied how the king rode from the siege of Terrabil, and therefore that</a>
<a id='line_1130'>night he issued out of the castle at a postern for to have distressed</a>
<a id='line_1131'>the king’s host. And so, through his own issue, the duke himself was</a>
<a id='line_1132'>slain or ever the king came at the castle of Tintagil.</a>
<a id='line_1133'></a>
<a id='line_1134'>So after the death of the duke, King Uther lay with Igraine more than</a>
<a id='line_1135'>three hours after his death, and begat on her that night Arthur, and on</a>
<a id='line_1136'>day came Merlin to the king, and bade him make him ready, and so he</a>
<a id='line_1137'>kissed the lady Igraine and departed in all haste. But when the lady</a>
<a id='line_1138'>heard tell of the duke her husband, and by all record he was dead or</a>
<a id='line_1139'>ever King Uther came to her, then she marvelled who that might be that</a>
<a id='line_1140'>lay with her in likeness of her lord; so she mourned privily and held</a>
<a id='line_1141'>her peace. Then all the barons by one assent prayed the king of accord</a>
<a id='line_1142'>betwixt the lady Igraine and him; the king gave them leave, for fain</a>
<a id='line_1143'>would he have been accorded with her. So the king put all the trust in</a>
<a id='line_1144'>Ulfius to entreat between them, so by the entreaty at the last the king</a>
<a id='line_1145'>and she met together. Now will we do well, said Ulfius, our king is a</a>
<a id='line_1146'>lusty knight and wifeless, and my lady Igraine is a passing fair lady;</a>
<a id='line_1147'>it were great joy unto us all, an it might please the king to make her</a>
<a id='line_1148'>his queen. Unto that they all well accorded and moved it to the king.</a>
<a id='line_1149'>And anon, like a lusty knight, he assented thereto with good will, and</a>
<a id='line_1150'>so in all haste they were married in a morning with great mirth and</a>
<a id='line_1151'>joy.</a>
<a id='line_1152'></a>
<a id='line_1153'>And King Lot of Lothian and of Orkney then wedded Margawse that was</a>
<a id='line_1154'>Gawaine’s mother, and King Nentres of the land of Garlot wedded Elaine.</a>
<a id='line_1155'>All this was done at the request of King Uther. And the third sister</a>
<a id='line_1156'>Morgan le Fay was put to school in a nunnery, and there she learned so</a>
<a id='line_1157'>much that she was a great clerk of necromancy. And after she was wedded</a>
<a id='line_1158'>to King Uriens of the land of Gore, that was Sir Ewain’s le</a>
<a id='line_1159'>Blanchemain’s father.</a>

<a id='line_1163'>CHAPTER III. Of the birth of King Arthur and of his nurture.</a>
<a id='line_1164'></a>
<a id='line_1165'>Then Queen Igraine waxed daily greater and greater, so it befell after</a>
<a id='line_1166'>within half a year, as King Uther lay by his queen, he asked her, by</a>
<a id='line_1167'>the faith she owed to him, whose was the body; then she sore abashed to</a>
<a id='line_1168'>give answer. Dismay you not, said the king, but tell me the truth, and</a>
<a id='line_1169'>I shall love you the better, by the faith of my body. Sir, said she, I</a>
<a id='line_1170'>shall tell you the truth. The same night that my lord was dead, the</a>
<a id='line_1171'>hour of his death, as his knights record, there came into my castle of</a>
<a id='line_1172'>Tintagil a man like my lord in speech and in countenance, and two</a>
<a id='line_1173'>knights with him in likeness of his two knights Brastias and Jordanus,</a>
<a id='line_1174'>and so I went unto bed with him as I ought to do with my lord, and the</a>
<a id='line_1175'>same night, as I shall answer unto God, this child was begotten upon</a>
<a id='line_1176'>me. That is truth, said the king, as ye say; for it was I myself that</a>
<a id='line_1177'>came in the likeness, and therefore dismay you not, for I am father of</a>
<a id='line_1178'>the child; and there he told her all the cause, how it was by Merlin’s</a>
<a id='line_1179'>counsel. Then the queen made great joy when she knew who was the father</a>
<a id='line_1180'>of her child.</a>
<a id='line_1181'></a>
<a id='line_1182'>Soon came Merlin unto the king, and said, Sir, ye must purvey you for</a>
<a id='line_1183'>the nourishing of your child. As thou wilt, said the king, be it. Well,</a>
<a id='line_1184'>said Merlin, I know a lord of yours in this land, that is a passing</a>
<a id='line_1185'>true man and a faithful, and he shall have the nourishing of your</a>
<a id='line_1186'>child, and his name is Sir Ector, and he is a lord of fair livelihood</a>
<a id='line_1187'>in many parts in England and Wales; and this lord, Sir Ector, let him</a>
<a id='line_1188'>be sent for, for to come and speak with you, and desire him yourself,</a>
<a id='line_1189'>as he loveth you, that he will put his own child to nourishing to</a>
<a id='line_1190'>another woman, and that his wife nourish yours. And when the child is</a>
<a id='line_1191'>born let it be delivered to me at yonder privy postern unchristened. So</a>
<a id='line_1192'>like as Merlin devised it was done. And when Sir Ector was come he made</a>
<a id='line_1193'>fiaunce to the king for to nourish the child like as the king desired;</a>
<a id='line_1194'>and there the king granted Sir Ector great rewards. Then when the lady</a>
<a id='line_1195'>was delivered, the king commanded two knights and two ladies to take</a>
<a id='line_1196'>the child, bound in a cloth of gold, and that ye deliver him to what</a>
<a id='line_1197'>poor man ye meet at the postern gate of the castle. So the child was</a>
<a id='line_1198'>delivered unto Merlin, and so he bare it forth unto Sir Ector, and made</a>
<a id='line_1199'>an holy man to christen him, and named him Arthur; and so Sir Ector’s</a>
<a id='line_1200'>wife nourished him with her own pap.</a>

<a id='line_1204'>CHAPTER IV. Of the death of King Uther Pendragon.</a>
<a id='line_1205'></a>
<a id='line_1206'>Then within two years King Uther fell sick of a great malady. And in</a>
<a id='line_1207'>the meanwhile his enemies usurped upon him, and did a great battle upon</a>
<a id='line_1208'>his men, and slew many of his people. Sir, said Merlin, ye may not lie</a>
<a id='line_1209'>so as ye do, for ye must to the field though ye ride on an</a>
<a id='line_1210'>horse-litter: for ye shall never have the better of your enemies but if</a>
<a id='line_1211'>your person be there, and then shall ye have the victory. So it was</a>
<a id='line_1212'>done as Merlin had devised, and they carried the king forth in an</a>
<a id='line_1213'>horse-litter with a great host towards his enemies. And at St. Albans</a>
<a id='line_1214'>there met with the king a great host of the North. And that day Sir</a>
<a id='line_1215'>Ulfius and Sir Brastias did great deeds of arms, and King Uther’s men</a>
<a id='line_1216'>overcame the Northern battle and slew many people, and put the remnant</a>
<a id='line_1217'>to flight. And then the king returned unto London, and made great joy</a>
<a id='line_1218'>of his victory. And then he fell passing sore sick, so that three days</a>
<a id='line_1219'>and three nights he was speechless: wherefore all the barons made great</a>
<a id='line_1220'>sorrow, and asked Merlin what counsel were best. There is none other</a>
<a id='line_1221'>remedy, said Merlin, but God will have his will. But look ye all barons</a>
<a id='line_1222'>be before King Uther to-morn, and God and I shall make him to speak. So</a>
<a id='line_1223'>on the morn all the barons with Merlin came to-fore the king; then</a>
<a id='line_1224'>Merlin said aloud unto King Uther, Sir, shall your son Arthur be king</a>
<a id='line_1225'>after your days, of this realm with all the appurtenance? Then Uther</a>
<a id='line_1226'>Pendragon turned him, and said in hearing of them all, I give him God’s</a>
<a id='line_1227'>blessing and mine, and bid him pray for my soul, and righteously and</a>
<a id='line_1228'>worshipfully that he claim the crown, upon forfeiture of my blessing;</a>
<a id='line_1229'>and therewith he yielded up the ghost, and then was he interred as</a>
<a id='line_1230'>longed to a king. Wherefore the queen, fair Igraine, made great sorrow,</a>
<a id='line_1231'>and all the barons.</a>
<a id='line_1232'></a>
<a id='line_1233'></a>
<a id='line_1234'></a>
<a id='line_1235'>CHAPTER V. How Arthur was chosen king, and of wonders and marvels of a</a>
<a id='line_1236'>sword taken out of a stone by the said Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_1237'></a>
<a id='line_1238'>Then stood the realm in great jeopardy long while, for every lord that</a>
<a id='line_1239'>was mighty of men made him strong, and many weened to have been king.</a>
<a id='line_1240'>Then Merlin went to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and counselled him</a>
<a id='line_1241'>for to send for all the lords of the realm, and all the gentlemen of</a>
<a id='line_1242'>arms, that they should to London come by Christmas, upon pain of</a>
<a id='line_1243'>cursing; and for this cause, that Jesus, that was born on that night,</a>
<a id='line_1244'>that he would of his great mercy show some miracle, as he was come to</a>
<a id='line_1245'>be king of mankind, for to show some miracle who should be rightwise</a>
<a id='line_1246'>king of this realm. So the Archbishop, by the advice of Merlin, sent</a>
<a id='line_1247'>for all the lords and gentlemen of arms that they should come by</a>
<a id='line_1248'>Christmas even unto London. And many of them made them clean of their</a>
<a id='line_1249'>life, that their prayer might be the more acceptable unto God. So in</a>
<a id='line_1250'>the greatest church of London, whether it were Paul’s or not the French</a>
<a id='line_1251'>book maketh no mention, all the estates were long or day in the church</a>
<a id='line_1252'>for to pray. And when matins and the first mass was done, there was</a>
<a id='line_1253'>seen in the churchyard, against the high altar, a great stone four</a>
<a id='line_1254'>square, like unto a marble stone; and in midst thereof was like an</a>
<a id='line_1255'>anvil of steel a foot on high, and therein stuck a fair sword naked by</a>
<a id='line_1256'>the point, and letters there were written in gold about the sword that</a>
<a id='line_1257'>said thus:—Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil, is</a>
<a id='line_1258'>rightwise king born of all England. Then the people marvelled, and told</a>
<a id='line_1259'>it to the Archbishop.</a>
<a id='line_1260'></a>
<a id='line_1261'>I command, said the Archbishop, that ye keep you within your church and</a>
<a id='line_1262'>pray unto God still, that no man touch the sword till the high mass be</a>
<a id='line_1263'>all done. So when all masses were done all the lords went to behold the</a>
<a id='line_1264'>stone and the sword. And when they saw the scripture some assayed, such</a>
<a id='line_1265'>as would have been king. But none might stir the sword nor move it. He</a>
<a id='line_1266'>is not here, said the Archbishop, that shall achieve the sword, but</a>
<a id='line_1267'>doubt not God will make him known. But this is my counsel, said the</a>
<a id='line_1268'>Archbishop, that we let purvey ten knights, men of good fame, and they</a>
<a id='line_1269'>to keep this sword. So it was ordained, and then there was made a cry,</a>
<a id='line_1270'>that every man should assay that would, for to win the sword. And upon</a>
<a id='line_1271'>New Year’s Day the barons let make a jousts and a tournament, that all</a>
<a id='line_1272'>knights that would joust or tourney there might play, and all this was</a>
<a id='line_1273'>ordained for to keep the lords together and the commons, for the</a>
<a id='line_1274'>Archbishop trusted that God would make him known that should win the</a>
<a id='line_1275'>sword.</a>
<a id='line_1276'></a>
<a id='line_1277'>So upon New Year’s Day, when the service was done, the barons rode unto</a>
<a id='line_1278'>the field, some to joust and some to tourney, and so it happened that</a>
<a id='line_1279'>Sir Ector, that had great livelihood about London, rode unto the</a>
<a id='line_1280'>jousts, and with him rode Sir Kay his son, and young Arthur that was</a>
<a id='line_1281'>his nourished brother; and Sir Kay was made knight at All Hallowmass</a>
<a id='line_1282'>afore. So as they rode to the jousts-ward, Sir Kay lost his sword, for</a>
<a id='line_1283'>he had left it at his father’s lodging, and so he prayed young Arthur</a>
<a id='line_1284'>for to ride for his sword. I will well, said Arthur, and rode fast</a>
<a id='line_1285'>after the sword, and when he came home, the lady and all were out to</a>
<a id='line_1286'>see the jousting. Then was Arthur wroth, and said to himself, I will</a>
<a id='line_1287'>ride to the churchyard, and take the sword with me that sticketh in the</a>
<a id='line_1288'>stone, for my brother Sir Kay shall not be without a sword this day. So</a>
<a id='line_1289'>when he came to the churchyard, Sir Arthur alighted and tied his horse</a>
<a id='line_1290'>to the stile, and so he went to the tent, and found no knights there,</a>
<a id='line_1291'>for they were at the jousting. And so he handled the sword by the</a>
<a id='line_1292'>handles, and lightly and fiercely pulled it out of the stone, and took</a>
<a id='line_1293'>his horse and rode his way until he came to his brother Sir Kay, and</a>
<a id='line_1294'>delivered him the sword. And as soon as Sir Kay saw the sword, he wist</a>
<a id='line_1295'>well it was the sword of the stone, and so he rode to his father Sir</a>
<a id='line_1296'>Ector, and said: Sir, lo here is the sword of the stone, wherefore I</a>
<a id='line_1297'>must be king of this land. When Sir Ector beheld the sword, he returned</a>
<a id='line_1298'>again and came to the church, and there they alighted all three, and</a>
<a id='line_1299'>went into the church. And anon he made Sir Kay swear upon a book how he</a>
<a id='line_1300'>came to that sword. Sir, said Sir Kay, by my brother Arthur, for he</a>
<a id='line_1301'>brought it to me. How gat ye this sword? said Sir Ector to Arthur. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_1302'>I will tell you. When I came home for my brother’s sword, I found</a>
<a id='line_1303'>nobody at home to deliver me his sword; and so I thought my brother Sir</a>
<a id='line_1304'>Kay should not be swordless, and so I came hither eagerly and pulled it</a>
<a id='line_1305'>out of the stone without any pain. Found ye any knights about this</a>
<a id='line_1306'>sword? said Sir Ector. Nay, said Arthur. Now, said Sir Ector to Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_1307'>I understand ye must be king of this land. Wherefore I, said Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_1308'>and for what cause? Sir, said Ector, for God will have it so; for there</a>
<a id='line_1309'>should never man have drawn out this sword, but he that shall be</a>
<a id='line_1310'>rightwise king of this land. Now let me see whether ye can put the</a>
<a id='line_1311'>sword there as it was, and pull it out again. That is no mastery, said</a>
<a id='line_1312'>Arthur, and so he put it in the stone; wherewithal Sir Ector assayed to</a>
<a id='line_1313'>pull out the sword and failed.</a>

<a id='line_1317'>CHAPTER VI. How King Arthur pulled out the sword divers times.</a>
<a id='line_1318'></a>
<a id='line_1319'>Now assay, said Sir Ector unto Sir Kay. And anon he pulled at the sword</a>
<a id='line_1320'>with all his might; but it would not be. Now shall ye assay, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_1321'>Ector to Arthur. I will well, said Arthur, and pulled it out easily.</a>
<a id='line_1322'>And therewithal Sir Ector knelt down to the earth, and Sir Kay. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_1323'>said Arthur, my own dear father and brother, why kneel ye to me? Nay,</a>
<a id='line_1324'>nay, my lord Arthur, it is not so; I was never your father nor of your</a>
<a id='line_1325'>blood, but I wot well ye are of an higher blood than I weened ye were.</a>
<a id='line_1326'>And then Sir Ector told him all, how he was betaken him for to nourish</a>
<a id='line_1327'>him, and by whose commandment, and by Merlin’s deliverance.</a>
<a id='line_1328'></a>
<a id='line_1329'>Then Arthur made great dole when he understood that Sir Ector was not</a>
<a id='line_1330'>his father. Sir, said Ector unto Arthur, will ye be my good and</a>
<a id='line_1331'>gracious lord when ye are king? Else were I to blame, said Arthur, for</a>
<a id='line_1332'>ye are the man in the world that I am most beholden to, and my good</a>
<a id='line_1333'>lady and mother your wife, that as well as her own hath fostered me and</a>
<a id='line_1334'>kept. And if ever it be God’s will that I be king as ye say, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_1335'>desire of me what I may do, and I shall not fail you; God forbid I</a>
<a id='line_1336'>should fail you Sir, said Sir Ector, I will ask no more of you, but</a>
<a id='line_1337'>that ye will make my son, your foster brother, Sir Kay, seneschal of</a>
<a id='line_1338'>all your lands. That shall be done, said Arthur, and more, by the faith</a>
<a id='line_1339'>of my body, that never man shall have that office but he, while he and</a>
<a id='line_1340'>I live. Therewithal they went unto the Archbishop, and told him how the</a>
<a id='line_1341'>sword was achieved, and by whom; and on Twelfth-day all the barons came</a>
<a id='line_1342'>thither, and to assay to take the sword, who that would assay. But</a>
<a id='line_1343'>there afore them all, there might none take it out but Arthur;</a>
<a id='line_1344'>wherefore there were many lords wroth, and said it was great shame unto</a>
<a id='line_1345'>them all and the realm, to be overgoverned with a boy of no high blood</a>
<a id='line_1346'>born. And so they fell out at that time that it was put off till</a>
<a id='line_1347'>Candlemas and then all the barons should meet there again; but always</a>
<a id='line_1348'>the ten knights were ordained to watch the sword day and night, and so</a>
<a id='line_1349'>they set a pavilion over the stone and the sword, and five always</a>
<a id='line_1350'>watched. So at Candlemas many more great lords came thither for to have</a>
<a id='line_1351'>won the sword, but there might none prevail. And right as Arthur did at</a>
<a id='line_1352'>Christmas, he did at Candlemas, and pulled out the sword easily,</a>
<a id='line_1353'>whereof the barons were sore aggrieved and put it off in delay till the</a>
<a id='line_1354'>high feast of Easter. And as Arthur sped before, so did he at Easter;</a>
<a id='line_1355'>yet there were some of the great lords had indignation that Arthur</a>
<a id='line_1356'>should be king, and put it off in a delay till the feast of Pentecost.</a>
<a id='line_1357'></a>
<a id='line_1358'>Then the Archbishop of Canterbury by Merlin’s providence let purvey</a>
<a id='line_1359'>then of the best knights that they might get, and such knights as Uther</a>
<a id='line_1360'>Pendragon loved best and most trusted in his days. And such knights</a>
<a id='line_1361'>were put about Arthur as Sir Baudwin of Britain, Sir Kay, Sir Ulfius,</a>
<a id='line_1362'>Sir Brastias. All these, with many other, were always about Arthur, day</a>
<a id='line_1363'>and night, till the feast of Pentecost.</a>

<a id='line_1367'>CHAPTER VII. How King Arthur was crowned, and how he made officers.</a>
<a id='line_1368'></a>
<a id='line_1369'>And at the feast of Pentecost all manner of men assayed to pull at the</a>
<a id='line_1370'>sword that would assay; but none might prevail but Arthur, and pulled</a>
<a id='line_1371'>it out afore all the lords and commons that were there, wherefore all</a>
<a id='line_1372'>the commons cried at once, We will have Arthur unto our king, we will</a>
<a id='line_1373'>put him no more in delay, for we all see that it is God’s will that he</a>
<a id='line_1374'>shall be our king, and who that holdeth against it, we will slay him.</a>
<a id='line_1375'>And therewithal they kneeled at once, both rich and poor, and cried</a>
<a id='line_1376'>Arthur mercy because they had delayed him so long, and Arthur forgave</a>
<a id='line_1377'>them, and took the sword between both his hands, and offered it upon</a>
<a id='line_1378'>the altar where the Archbishop was, and so was he made knight of the</a>
<a id='line_1379'>best man that was there. And so anon was the coronation made. And there</a>
<a id='line_1380'>was he sworn unto his lords and the commons for to be a true king, to</a>
<a id='line_1381'>stand with true justice from thenceforth the days of this life. Also</a>
<a id='line_1382'>then he made all lords that held of the crown to come in, and to do</a>
<a id='line_1383'>service as they ought to do. And many complaints were made unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_1384'>Arthur of great wrongs that were done since the death of King Uther, of</a>
<a id='line_1385'>many lands that were bereaved lords, knights, ladies, and gentlemen.</a>
<a id='line_1386'>Wherefore King Arthur made the lands to be given again unto them that</a>
<a id='line_1387'>owned them.</a>
<a id='line_1388'></a>
<a id='line_1389'>When this was done, that the king had stablished all the countries</a>
<a id='line_1390'>about London, then he let make Sir Kay seneschal of England; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_1391'>Baudwin of Britain was made constable; and Sir Ulfius was made</a>
<a id='line_1392'>chamberlain; and Sir Brastias was made warden to wait upon the north</a>
<a id='line_1393'>from Trent forwards, for it was that time the most party the king’s</a>
<a id='line_1394'>enemies. But within few years after Arthur won all the north, Scotland,</a>
<a id='line_1395'>and all that were under their obeissance. Also Wales, a part of it,</a>
<a id='line_1396'>held against Arthur, but he overcame them all, as he did the remnant,</a>
<a id='line_1397'>through the noble prowess of himself and his knights of the Round</a>
<a id='line_1398'>Table.</a>

<a id='line_1402'>CHAPTER VIII. How King Arthur held in Wales, at a Pentecost, a great</a>
<a id='line_1403'>feast, and what kings and lords came to his feast.</a>
<a id='line_1404'></a>
<a id='line_1405'>Then the king removed into Wales, and let cry a great feast that it</a>
<a id='line_1406'>should be holden at Pentecost after the incoronation of him at the city</a>
<a id='line_1407'>of Carlion. Unto the feast came King Lot of Lothian and of Orkney, with</a>
<a id='line_1408'>five hundred knights with him. Also there came to the feast King Uriens</a>
<a id='line_1409'>of Gore with four hundred knights with him. Also there came to that</a>
<a id='line_1410'>feast King Nentres of Garlot, with seven hundred knights with him. Also</a>
<a id='line_1411'>there came to the feast the king of Scotland with six hundred knights</a>
<a id='line_1412'>with him, and he was but a young man. Also there came to the feast a</a>
<a id='line_1413'>king that was called the King with the Hundred Knights, but he and his</a>
<a id='line_1414'>men were passing well beseen at all points. Also there came the king of</a>
<a id='line_1415'>Carados with five hundred knights. And King Arthur was glad of their</a>
<a id='line_1416'>coming, for he weened that all the kings and knights had come for great</a>
<a id='line_1417'>love, and to have done him worship at his feast; wherefore the king</a>
<a id='line_1418'>made great joy, and sent the kings and knights great presents. But the</a>
<a id='line_1419'>kings would none receive, but rebuked the messengers shamefully, and</a>
<a id='line_1420'>said they had no joy to receive no gifts of a beardless boy that was</a>
<a id='line_1421'>come of low blood, and sent him word they would none of his gifts, but</a>
<a id='line_1422'>that they were come to give him gifts with hard swords betwixt the neck</a>
<a id='line_1423'>and the shoulders: and therefore they came thither, so they told to the</a>
<a id='line_1424'>messengers plainly, for it was great shame to all them to see such a</a>
<a id='line_1425'>boy to have a rule of so noble a realm as this land was. With this</a>
<a id='line_1426'>answer the messengers departed and told to King Arthur this answer.</a>
<a id='line_1427'>Wherefore, by the advice of his barons, he took him to a strong tower</a>
<a id='line_1428'>with five hundred good men with him. And all the kings aforesaid in a</a>
<a id='line_1429'>manner laid a siege to-fore him, but King Arthur was well victualed.</a>
<a id='line_1430'>And within fifteen days there came Merlin among them into the city of</a>
<a id='line_1431'>Carlion. Then all the kings were passing glad of Merlin, and asked him,</a>
<a id='line_1432'>For what cause is that boy Arthur made your king? Sirs, said Merlin, I</a>
<a id='line_1433'>shall tell you the cause, for he is King Uther Pendragon’s son, born in</a>
<a id='line_1434'>wedlock, gotten on Igraine, the duke’s wife of Tintagil. Then is he a</a>
<a id='line_1435'>bastard, they said all. Nay, said Merlin, after the death of the duke,</a>
<a id='line_1436'>more than three hours, was Arthur begotten, and thirteen days after</a>
<a id='line_1437'>King Uther wedded Igraine; and therefore I prove him he is no bastard.</a>
<a id='line_1438'>And who saith nay, he shall be king and overcome all his enemies; and,</a>
<a id='line_1439'>or he die, he shall be long king of all England, and have under his</a>
<a id='line_1440'>obeissance Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, and more realms than I will</a>
<a id='line_1441'>now rehearse. Some of the kings had marvel of Merlin’s words, and</a>
<a id='line_1442'>deemed well that it should be as he said; and some of them laughed him</a>
<a id='line_1443'>to scorn, as King Lot; and more other called him a witch. But then were</a>
<a id='line_1444'>they accorded with Merlin, that King Arthur should come out and speak</a>
<a id='line_1445'>with the kings, and to come safe and to go safe, such surance there was</a>
<a id='line_1446'>made. So Merlin went unto King Arthur, and told him how he had done,</a>
<a id='line_1447'>and bade him fear not, but come out boldly and speak with them, and</a>
<a id='line_1448'>spare them not, but answer them as their king and chieftain; for ye</a>
<a id='line_1449'>shall overcome them all, whether they will or nill.</a>

<a id='line_1453'>CHAPTER IX. Of the first war that King Arthur had, and how he won the</a>
<a id='line_1454'>field.</a>
<a id='line_1455'></a>
<a id='line_1456'>Then King Arthur came out of his tower, and had under his gown a</a>
<a id='line_1457'>jesseraunt of double mail, and there went with him the Archbishop of</a>
<a id='line_1458'>Canterbury, and Sir Baudwin of Britain, and Sir Kay, and Sir Brastias:</a>
<a id='line_1459'>these were the men of most worship that were with him. And when they</a>
<a id='line_1460'>were met there was no meekness, but stout words on both sides; but</a>
<a id='line_1461'>always King Arthur answered them, and said he would make them to bow an</a>
<a id='line_1462'>he lived. Wherefore they departed with wrath, and King Arthur bade keep</a>
<a id='line_1463'>them well, and they bade the king keep him well. So the king returned</a>
<a id='line_1464'>him to the tower again and armed him and all his knights. What will ye</a>
<a id='line_1465'>do? said Merlin to the kings; ye were better for to stint, for ye shall</a>
<a id='line_1466'>not here prevail though ye were ten times so many. Be we well advised</a>
<a id='line_1467'>to be afeared of a dream-reader? said King Lot. With that Merlin</a>
<a id='line_1468'>vanished away, and came to King Arthur, and bade him set on them</a>
<a id='line_1469'>fiercely; and in the meanwhile there were three hundred good men, of</a>
<a id='line_1470'>the best that were with the kings, that went straight unto King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_1471'>and that comforted him greatly. Sir, said Merlin to Arthur, fight not</a>
<a id='line_1472'>with the sword that ye had by miracle, till that ye see ye go unto the</a>
<a id='line_1473'>worse, then draw it out and do your best. So forthwithal King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_1474'>set upon them in their lodging. And Sir Baudwin, Sir Kay, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_1475'>Brastias slew on the right hand and on the left hand that it was</a>
<a id='line_1476'>marvel; and always King Arthur on horseback laid on with a sword, and</a>
<a id='line_1477'>did marvellous deeds of arms, that many of the kings had great joy of</a>
<a id='line_1478'>his deeds and hardiness.</a>
<a id='line_1479'></a>
<a id='line_1480'>Then King Lot brake out on the back side, and the King with the Hundred</a>
<a id='line_1481'>Knights, and King Carados, and set on Arthur fiercely behind him. With</a>
<a id='line_1482'>that Sir Arthur turned with his knights, and smote behind and before,</a>
<a id='line_1483'>and ever Sir Arthur was in the foremost press till his horse was slain</a>
<a id='line_1484'>underneath him. And therewith King Lot smote down King Arthur. With</a>
<a id='line_1485'>that his four knights received him and set him on horseback. Then he</a>
<a id='line_1486'>drew his sword Excalibur, but it was so bright in his enemies’ eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1487'>that it gave light like thirty torches. And therewith he put them</a>
<a id='line_1488'>a-back, and slew much people. And then the commons of Carlion arose</a>
<a id='line_1489'>with clubs and staves and slew many knights; but all the kings held</a>
<a id='line_1490'>them together with their knights that were left alive, and so fled and</a>
<a id='line_1491'>departed. And Merlin came unto Arthur, and counselled him to follow</a>
<a id='line_1492'>them no further.</a>

<a id='line_1497'>King Bors, and of their counsel taken for the war.</a>
<a id='line_1498'></a>
<a id='line_1499'>So after the feast and journey, King Arthur drew him unto London, and</a>
<a id='line_1500'>so by the counsel of Merlin, the king let call his barons to council,</a>
<a id='line_1501'>for Merlin had told the king that the six kings that made war upon him</a>
<a id='line_1502'>would in all haste be awroke on him and on his lands. Wherefore the</a>
<a id='line_1503'>king asked counsel at them all. They could no counsel give, but said</a>
<a id='line_1504'>they were big enough. Ye say well, said Arthur; I thank you for your</a>
<a id='line_1505'>good courage, but will ye all that loveth me speak with Merlin? ye know</a>
<a id='line_1506'>well that he hath done much for me, and he knoweth many things, and</a>
<a id='line_1507'>when he is afore you, I would that ye prayed him heartily of his best</a>
<a id='line_1508'>advice. All the barons said they would pray him and desire him. So</a>
<a id='line_1509'>Merlin was sent for, and fair desired of all the barons to give them</a>
<a id='line_1510'>best counsel. I shall say you, said Merlin, I warn you all, your</a>
<a id='line_1511'>enemies are passing strong for you, and they are good men of arms as be</a>
<a id='line_1512'>alive, and by this time they have gotten to them four kings more, and a</a>
<a id='line_1513'>mighty duke; and unless that our king have more chivalry with him than</a>
<a id='line_1514'>he may make within the bounds of his own realm, an he fight with them</a>
<a id='line_1515'>in battle, he shall be overcome and slain. What were best to do in this</a>
<a id='line_1516'>cause? said all the barons. I shall tell you, said Merlin, mine advice;</a>
<a id='line_1517'>there are two brethren beyond the sea, and they be kings both, and</a>
<a id='line_1518'>marvellous good men of their hands; and that one hight King Ban of</a>
<a id='line_1519'>Benwick, and that other hight King Bors of Gaul, that is France. And on</a>
<a id='line_1520'>these two kings warreth a mighty man of men, the King Claudas, and</a>
<a id='line_1521'>striveth with them for a castle, and great war is betwixt them. But</a>
<a id='line_1522'>this Claudas is so mighty of goods whereof he getteth good knights,</a>
<a id='line_1523'>that he putteth these two kings most part to the worse; wherefore this</a>
<a id='line_1524'>is my counsel, that our king and sovereign lord send unto the kings Ban</a>
<a id='line_1525'>and Bors by two trusty knights with letters well devised, that an they</a>
<a id='line_1526'>will come and see King Arthur and his court, and so help him in his</a>
<a id='line_1527'>wars, that he will be sworn unto them to help them in their wars</a>
<a id='line_1528'>against King Claudas. Now, what say ye unto this counsel? said Merlin.</a>
<a id='line_1529'>This is well counselled, said the king and all the barons.</a>
<a id='line_1530'></a>
<a id='line_1531'>Right so in all haste there were ordained to go two knights on the</a>
<a id='line_1532'>message unto the two kings. So were there made letters in the pleasant</a>
<a id='line_1533'>wise according unto King Arthur’s desire. Ulfius and Brastias were made</a>
<a id='line_1534'>the messengers, and so rode forth well horsed and well armed and as the</a>
<a id='line_1535'>guise was that time, and so passed the sea and rode toward the city of</a>
<a id='line_1536'>Benwick. And there besides were eight knights that espied them, and at</a>
<a id='line_1537'>a strait passage they met with Ulfius and Brastias, and would have</a>
<a id='line_1538'>taken them prisoners; so they prayed them that they might pass, for</a>
<a id='line_1539'>they were messengers unto King Ban and Bors sent from King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_1540'>Therefore, said the eight knights, ye shall die or be prisoners, for we</a>
<a id='line_1541'>be knights of King Claudas. And therewith two of them dressed their</a>
<a id='line_1542'>spears, and Ulfius and Brastias dressed their spears, and ran together</a>
<a id='line_1543'>with great raundon. And Claudas’ knights brake their spears, and theirs</a>
<a id='line_1544'>to-held and bare the two knights out of their saddles to the earth, and</a>
<a id='line_1545'>so left them lying, and rode their ways. And the other six knights rode</a>
<a id='line_1546'>afore to a passage to meet with them again, and so Ulfius and Brastias</a>
<a id='line_1547'>smote other two down, and so passed on their ways. And at the fourth</a>
<a id='line_1548'>passage there met two for two, and both were laid unto the earth; so</a>
<a id='line_1549'>there was none of the eight knights but he was sore hurt or bruised.</a>
<a id='line_1550'>And when they come to Benwick it fortuned there were both kings, Ban</a>
<a id='line_1551'>and Bors.</a>
<a id='line_1552'></a>
<a id='line_1553'>And when it was told the kings that there were come messengers, there</a>
<a id='line_1554'>were sent unto them two knights of worship, the one hight Lionses, lord</a>
<a id='line_1555'>of the country of Payarne, and Sir Phariance a worshipful knight. Anon</a>
<a id='line_1556'>they asked from whence they came, and they said from King Arthur, king</a>
<a id='line_1557'>of England; so they took them in their arms and made great joy each of</a>
<a id='line_1558'>other. But anon, as the two kings wist they were messengers of</a>
<a id='line_1559'>Arthur’s, there was made no tarrying, but forthwith they spake with the</a>
<a id='line_1560'>knights, and welcomed them in the faithfullest wise, and said they were</a>
<a id='line_1561'>most welcome unto them before all the kings living; and therewith they</a>
<a id='line_1562'>kissed the letters and delivered them. And when Ban and Bors understood</a>
<a id='line_1563'>the letters, then they were more welcome than they were before. And</a>
<a id='line_1564'>after the haste of the letters they gave them this answer, that they</a>
<a id='line_1565'>would fulfil the desire of King Arthur’s writing, and Ulfius and</a>
<a id='line_1566'>Brastias, tarry there as long as they would, they should have such</a>
<a id='line_1567'>cheer as might be made them in those marches. Then Ulfius and Brastias</a>
<a id='line_1568'>told the kings of the adventure at their passages of the eight knights.</a>
<a id='line_1569'>Ha! ah! said Ban and Bors, they were my good friends. I would I had</a>
<a id='line_1570'>wist of them; they should not have escaped so. So Ulfius and Brastias</a>
<a id='line_1571'>had good cheer and great gifts, as much as they might bear away; and</a>
<a id='line_1572'>had their answer by mouth and by writing, that those two kings would</a>
<a id='line_1573'>come unto Arthur in all the haste that they might. So the two knights</a>
<a id='line_1574'>rode on afore, and passed the sea, and came to their lord, and told him</a>
<a id='line_1575'>how they had sped, whereof King Arthur was passing glad. At what time</a>
<a id='line_1576'>suppose ye the two kings will be here? Sir, said they, afore All</a>
<a id='line_1577'>Hallowmass. Then the king let purvey for a great feast, and let cry a</a>
<a id='line_1578'>great jousts. And by All Hallowmass the two kings were come over the</a>
<a id='line_1579'>sea with three hundred knights well arrayed both for the peace and for</a>
<a id='line_1580'>the war. And King Arthur met with them ten mile out of London, and</a>
<a id='line_1581'>there was great joy as could be thought or made. And on All Hallowmass</a>
<a id='line_1582'>at the great feast, sat in the hall the three kings, and Sir Kay</a>
<a id='line_1583'>seneschal served in the hall, and Sir Lucas the butler, that was Duke</a>
<a id='line_1584'>Corneus’ son, and Sir Griflet, that was the son of Cardol, these three</a>
<a id='line_1585'>knights had the rule of all the service that served the kings. And</a>
<a id='line_1586'>anon, as they had washen and risen, all knights that would joust made</a>
<a id='line_1587'>them ready; by then they were ready on horseback there were seven</a>
<a id='line_1588'>hundred knights. And Arthur, Ban, and Bors, with the Archbishop of</a>
<a id='line_1589'>Canterbury, and Sir Ector, Kay’s father, they were in a place covered</a>
<a id='line_1590'>with cloth of gold like an hall, with ladies and gentlewomen, for to</a>
<a id='line_1591'>behold who did best, and thereon to give judgment.</a>

<a id='line_1593'></a>
<a id='line_1594'></a>
<a id='line_1595'>CHAPTER XI. Of a great tourney made by King Arthur and the two kings</a>
<a id='line_1596'>Ban and Bors, and how they went over the sea.</a>
<a id='line_1597'></a>
<a id='line_1598'>And King Arthur and the two kings let depart the seven hundred knights</a>
<a id='line_1599'>in two parties. And there were three hundred knights of the realm of</a>
<a id='line_1600'>Benwick and of Gaul turned on the other side. Then they dressed their</a>
<a id='line_1601'>shields, and began to couch their spears many good knights. So Griflet</a>
<a id='line_1602'>was the first that met with a knight, one Ladinas, and they met so</a>
<a id='line_1603'>eagerly that all men had wonder; and they so fought that their shields</a>
<a id='line_1604'>fell to pieces, and horse and man fell to the earth; and both the</a>
<a id='line_1605'>French knight and the English knight lay so long that all men weened</a>
<a id='line_1606'>they had been dead. When Lucas the butler saw Griflet so lie, he horsed</a>
<a id='line_1607'>him again anon, and they two did marvellous deeds of arms with many</a>
<a id='line_1608'>bachelors. Also Sir Kay came out of an ambushment with five knights</a>
<a id='line_1609'>with him, and they six smote other six down. But Sir Kay did that day</a>
<a id='line_1610'>marvellous deeds of arms, that there was none did so well as he that</a>
<a id='line_1611'>day. Then there came Ladinas and Gracian, two knights of France, and</a>
<a id='line_1612'>did passing well, that all men praised them.</a>
<a id='line_1613'></a>
<a id='line_1614'>Then came there Sir Placidas, a good knight, and met with Sir Kay, and</a>
<a id='line_1615'>smote him down horse and man, where fore Sir Griflet was wroth, and met</a>
<a id='line_1616'>with Sir Placidas so hard, that horse and man fell to the earth. But</a>
<a id='line_1617'>when the five knights wist that Sir Kay had a fall, they were wroth out</a>
<a id='line_1618'>of wit, and therewith each of them five bare down a knight. When King</a>
<a id='line_1619'>Arthur and the two kings saw them begin to wax wroth on both parties,</a>
<a id='line_1620'>they leapt on small hackneys, and let cry that all men should depart</a>
<a id='line_1621'>unto their lodging. And so they went home and unarmed them, and so to</a>
<a id='line_1622'>evensong and supper. And after, the three kings went into a garden, and</a>
<a id='line_1623'>gave the prize unto Sir Kay, and to Lucas the butler, and unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_1624'>Griflet. And then they went unto council, and with them Gwenbaus, the</a>
<a id='line_1625'>brother unto Sir Ban and Bors, a wise clerk, and thither went Ulfius</a>
<a id='line_1626'>and Brastias, and Merlin. And after they had been in council, they went</a>
<a id='line_1627'>unto bed. And on the morn they heard mass, and to dinner, and so to</a>
<a id='line_1628'>their council, and made many arguments what were best to do. At the</a>
<a id='line_1629'>last they were concluded, that Merlin should go with a token of King</a>
<a id='line_1630'>Ban, and that was a ring, unto his men and King Bors’; and Gracian and</a>
<a id='line_1631'>Placidas should go again and keep their castles and their countries, as</a>
<a id='line_1632'>for [dread of King Claudas] King Ban of Benwick, and King Bors of Gaul</a>
<a id='line_1633'>had ordained them, and so passed the sea and came to Benwick. And when</a>
<a id='line_1634'>the people saw King Ban’s ring, and Gracian and Placidas, they were</a>
<a id='line_1635'>glad, and asked how the kings fared, and made great joy of their</a>
<a id='line_1636'>welfare and cording, and according unto the sovereign lords desire, the</a>
<a id='line_1637'>men of war made them ready in all haste possible, so that they were</a>
<a id='line_1638'>fifteen thousand on horse and foot, and they had great plenty of</a>
<a id='line_1639'>victual with them, by Merlin’s provision. But Gracian and Placidas were</a>
<a id='line_1640'>left to furnish and garnish the castles, for dread of King Claudas.</a>
<a id='line_1641'>Right so Merlin passed the sea, well victualled both by water and by</a>
<a id='line_1642'>land. And when he came to the sea he sent home the footmen again, and</a>
<a id='line_1643'>took no more with him but ten thousand men on horseback, the most part</a>
<a id='line_1644'>men of arms, and so shipped and passed the sea into England, and landed</a>
<a id='line_1645'>at Dover; and through the wit of Merlin, he had the host northward, the</a>
<a id='line_1646'>priviest way that could be thought, unto the forest of Bedegraine, and</a>
<a id='line_1647'>there in a valley he lodged them secretly.</a>
<a id='line_1648'></a>
<a id='line_1649'>Then rode Merlin unto Arthur and the two kings, and told them how he</a>
<a id='line_1650'>had sped; whereof they had great marvel, that man on earth might speed</a>
<a id='line_1651'>so soon, and go and come. So Merlin told them ten thousand were in the</a>
<a id='line_1652'>forest of Bedegraine, well armed at all points. Then was there no more</a>
<a id='line_1653'>to say, but to horseback went all the host as Arthur had afore</a>
<a id='line_1654'>purveyed. So with twenty thousand he passed by night and day, but there</a>
<a id='line_1655'>was made such an ordinance afore by Merlin, that there should no man of</a>
<a id='line_1656'>war ride nor go in no country on this side Trent water, but if he had a</a>
<a id='line_1657'>token from King Arthur, where through the king’s enemies durst not ride</a>
<a id='line_1658'>as they did to-fore to espy.</a>

<a id='line_1662'>CHAPTER XII. How eleven kings gathered a great host against King</a>
<a id='line_1663'>Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_1664'></a>
<a id='line_1665'>And so within a little space the three kings came unto the castle of</a>
<a id='line_1666'>Bedegraine, and found there a passing fair fellowship, and well beseen,</a>
<a id='line_1667'>whereof they had great joy, and victual they wanted none. This was the</a>
<a id='line_1668'>cause of the northern host: that they were reared for the despite and</a>
<a id='line_1669'>rebuke the six kings had at Carlion. And those six kings by their</a>
<a id='line_1670'>means, gat unto them five other kings; and thus they began to gather</a>
<a id='line_1671'>their people.</a>
<a id='line_1672'></a>
<a id='line_1673'>And now they sware that for weal nor woe, they should not leave other,</a>
<a id='line_1674'>till they had destroyed Arthur. And then they made an oath. The first</a>
<a id='line_1675'>that began the oath was the Duke of Cambenet, that he would bring with</a>
<a id='line_1676'>him five thousand men of arms, the which were ready on horseback. Then</a>
<a id='line_1677'>sware King Brandegoris of Stranggore that he would bring five thousand</a>
<a id='line_1678'>men of arms on horseback. Then sware King Clariance of Northumberland</a>
<a id='line_1679'>he would bring three thousand men of arms. Then sware the King of the</a>
<a id='line_1680'>Hundred Knights, that was a passing good man and a young, that he would</a>
<a id='line_1681'>bring four thousand men of arms on horseback. Then there swore King</a>
<a id='line_1682'>Lot, a passing good knight, and Sir Gawain’s father, that he would</a>
<a id='line_1683'>bring five thousand men of arms on horseback. Also there swore King</a>
<a id='line_1684'>Urience, that was Sir Uwain’s father, of the land of Gore, and he would</a>
<a id='line_1685'>bring six thousand men of arms on horseback. Also there swore King</a>
<a id='line_1686'>Idres of Cornwall, that he would bring five thousand men of arms on</a>
<a id='line_1687'>horseback. Also there swore King Cradelmas to bring five thousand men</a>
<a id='line_1688'>on horseback. Also there swore King Agwisance of Ireland to bring five</a>
<a id='line_1689'>thousand men of arms on horseback. Also there swore King Nentres to</a>
<a id='line_1690'>bring five thousand men of arms on horseback. Also there swore King</a>
<a id='line_1691'>Carados to bring five thousand men of arms on horseback. So their whole</a>
<a id='line_1692'>host was of clean men of arms on horseback fifty thousand, and a-foot</a>
<a id='line_1693'>ten thousand of good men’s bodies. Then were they soon ready, and</a>
<a id='line_1694'>mounted upon horse and sent forth their fore-riders, for these eleven</a>
<a id='line_1695'>kings in their ways laid a siege unto the castle of Bedegraine; and so</a>
<a id='line_1696'>they departed and drew toward Arthur, and left few to abide at the</a>
<a id='line_1697'>siege, for the castle of Bedegraine was holden of King Arthur, and the</a>
<a id='line_1698'>men that were therein were Arthur’s.</a>

<a id='line_1702'>CHAPTER XIII. Of a dream of the King with the Hundred Knights.</a>
<a id='line_1703'></a>
<a id='line_1704'>So by Merlin’s advice there were sent fore-riders to skim the country,</a>
<a id='line_1705'>and they met with the fore-riders of the north, and made them to tell</a>
<a id='line_1706'>which way the host came, and then they told it to Arthur, and by King</a>
<a id='line_1707'>Ban and Bors’ council they let burn and destroy all the country afore</a>
<a id='line_1708'>them, there they should ride.</a>
<a id='line_1709'></a>
<a id='line_1710'>The King with the Hundred Knights met a wonder dream two nights afore</a>
<a id='line_1711'>the battle, that there blew a great wind, and blew down their castles</a>
<a id='line_1712'>and their towns, and after that came a water and bare it all away. All</a>
<a id='line_1713'>that heard of the sweven said it was a token of great battle. Then by</a>
<a id='line_1714'>counsel of Merlin, when they wist which way the eleven kings would ride</a>
<a id='line_1715'>and lodge that night, at midnight they set upon them, as they were in</a>
<a id='line_1716'>their pavilions. But the scout-watch by their host cried, Lords! at</a>
<a id='line_1717'>arms! for here be your enemies at your hand!</a>
<a id='line_1718'></a>
<a id='line_1719'></a>
<a id='line_1720'></a>
<a id='line_1721'>CHAPTER XIV. How the eleven kings with their host fought against Arthur</a>
<a id='line_1722'>and his host, and many great feats of the war.</a>
<a id='line_1723'></a>
<a id='line_1724'>Then King Arthur and King Ban and King Bors, with their good and trusty</a>
<a id='line_1725'>knights, set on them so fiercely that they made them overthrow their</a>
<a id='line_1726'>pavilions on their heads, but the eleven kings, by manly prowess of</a>
<a id='line_1727'>arms, took a fair champaign, but there was slain that morrowtide ten</a>
<a id='line_1728'>thousand good men’s bodies. And so they had afore them a strong</a>
<a id='line_1729'>passage, yet were they fifty thousand of hardy men. Then it drew toward</a>
<a id='line_1730'>day. Now shall ye do by mine advice, said Merlin unto the three kings:</a>
<a id='line_1731'>I would that King Ban and King Bors, with their fellowship of ten</a>
<a id='line_1732'>thousand men, were put in a wood here beside, in an ambushment, and</a>
<a id='line_1733'>keep them privy, and that they be laid or the light of the day come,</a>
<a id='line_1734'>and that they stir not till ye and your knights have fought with them</a>
<a id='line_1735'>long. And when it is daylight, dress your battle even afore them and</a>
<a id='line_1736'>the passage, that they may see all your host, for then will they be the</a>
<a id='line_1737'>more hardy, when they see you but about twenty thousand men, and cause</a>
<a id='line_1738'>them to be the gladder to suffer you and your host to come over the</a>
<a id='line_1739'>passage. All the three kings and the whole barons said that Merlin said</a>
<a id='line_1740'>passingly well, and it was done anon as Merlin had devised. So on the</a>
<a id='line_1741'>morn, when either host saw other, the host of the north was well</a>
<a id='line_1742'>comforted. Then to Ulfius and Brastias were delivered three thousand</a>
<a id='line_1743'>men of arms, and they set on them fiercely in the passage, and slew on</a>
<a id='line_1744'>the right hand and on the left hand that it was wonder to tell.</a>
<a id='line_1745'></a>
<a id='line_1746'>When that the eleven kings saw that there was so few a fellowship did</a>
<a id='line_1747'>such deeds of arms, they were ashamed and set on them again fiercely;</a>
<a id='line_1748'>and there was Sir Ulfius’s horse slain under him, but he did</a>
<a id='line_1749'>marvellously well on foot. But the Duke Eustace of Cambenet and King</a>
<a id='line_1750'>Clariance of Northumberland, were alway grievous on Ulfius. Then</a>
<a id='line_1751'>Brastias saw his fellow fared so withal he smote the duke with a spear,</a>
<a id='line_1752'>that horse and man fell down. That saw King Clariance and returned unto</a>
<a id='line_1753'>Brastias, and either smote other so that horse and man went to the</a>
<a id='line_1754'>earth, and so they lay long astonied, and their horses’ knees brast to</a>
<a id='line_1755'>the hard bone. Then came Sir Kay the seneschal with six fellows with</a>
<a id='line_1756'>him, and did passing well. With that came the eleven kings, and there</a>
<a id='line_1757'>was Griflet put to the earth, horse and man, and Lucas the butler,</a>
<a id='line_1758'>horse and man, by King Brandegoris, and King Idres, and King Agwisance.</a>
<a id='line_1759'>Then waxed the medley passing hard on both parties. When Sir Kay saw</a>
<a id='line_1760'>Griflet on foot, he rode on King Nentres and smote him down, and led</a>
<a id='line_1761'>his horse unto Sir Griflet, and horsed him again. Also Sir Kay with the</a>
<a id='line_1762'>same spear smote down King Lot, and hurt him passing sore. That saw the</a>
<a id='line_1763'>King with the Hundred Knights, and ran unto Sir Kay and smote him down,</a>
<a id='line_1764'>and took his horse, and gave him King Lot, whereof he said gramercy.</a>
<a id='line_1765'>When Sir Griflet saw Sir Kay and Lucas the butler on foot, he took a</a>
<a id='line_1766'>sharp spear, great and square, and rode to Pinel, a good man of arms,</a>
<a id='line_1767'>and smote horse and man down, and then he took his horse, and gave him</a>
<a id='line_1768'>unto Sir Kay. Then King Lot saw King Nentres on foot, he ran unto Melot</a>
<a id='line_1769'>de la Roche, and smote him down, horse and man, and gave King Nentres</a>
<a id='line_1770'>the horse, and horsed him again. Also the King of the Hundred Knights</a>
<a id='line_1771'>saw King Idres on foot; then he ran unto Gwiniart de Bloi, and smote</a>
<a id='line_1772'>him down, horse and man, and gave King Idres the horse, and horsed him</a>
<a id='line_1773'>again; and King Lot smote down Clariance de la Forest Savage, and gave</a>
<a id='line_1774'>the horse unto Duke Eustace. And so when they had horsed the kings</a>
<a id='line_1775'>again they drew them, all eleven kings, together, and said they would</a>
<a id='line_1776'>be revenged of the damage that they had taken that day. The meanwhile</a>
<a id='line_1777'>came in Sir Ector with an eager countenance, and found Ulfius and</a>
<a id='line_1778'>Brastias on foot, in great peril of death, that were foul defoiled</a>
<a id='line_1779'>under horse-feet.</a>
<a id='line_1780'></a>
<a id='line_1781'>Then Arthur as a lion, ran unto King Cradelment of North Wales, and</a>
<a id='line_1782'>smote him through the left side, that the horse and the king fell down;</a>
<a id='line_1783'>and then he took the horse by the rein, and led him unto Ulfius, and</a>
<a id='line_1784'>said, Have this horse, mine old friend, for great need hast thou of</a>
<a id='line_1785'>horse. Gramercy, said Ulfius. Then Sir Arthur did so marvellously in</a>
<a id='line_1786'>arms, that all men had wonder. When the King with the Hundred Knights</a>
<a id='line_1787'>saw King Cradelment on foot, he ran unto Sir Ector, that was well</a>
<a id='line_1788'>horsed, Sir Kay’s father, and smote horse and man down, and gave the</a>
<a id='line_1789'>horse unto the king, and horsed him again. And when King Arthur saw the</a>
<a id='line_1790'>king ride on Sir Ector’s horse, he was wroth and with his sword he</a>
<a id='line_1791'>smote the king on the helm, that a quarter of the helm and shield fell</a>
<a id='line_1792'>down, and so the sword carved down unto the horse’s neck, and so the</a>
<a id='line_1793'>king and the horse fell down to the ground. Then Sir Kay came unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_1794'>Morganore, seneschal with the King of the Hundred Knights, and smote</a>
<a id='line_1795'>him down, horse and man, and led the horse unto his father, Sir Ector;</a>
<a id='line_1796'>then Sir Ector ran unto a knight, hight Lardans, and smote horse and</a>
<a id='line_1797'>man down, and led the horse unto Sir Brastias, that great need had of</a>
<a id='line_1798'>an horse, and was greatly defoiled. When Brastias beheld Lucas the</a>
<a id='line_1799'>butler, that lay like a dead man under the horses’ feet, and ever Sir</a>
<a id='line_1800'>Griflet did marvellously for to rescue him, and there were always</a>
<a id='line_1801'>fourteen knights on Sir Lucas; then Brastias smote one of them on the</a>
<a id='line_1802'>helm, that it went to the teeth, and he rode to another and smote him,</a>
<a id='line_1803'>that the arm flew into the field. Then he went to the third and smote</a>
<a id='line_1804'>him on the shoulder, that shoulder and arm flew in the field. And when</a>
<a id='line_1805'>Griflet saw rescues, he smote a knight on the temples, that head and</a>
<a id='line_1806'>helm went to the earth, and Griflet took the horse of that knight, and</a>
<a id='line_1807'>led him unto Sir Lucas, and bade him mount upon the horse and revenge</a>
<a id='line_1808'>his hurts. For Brastias had slain a knight to-fore and horsed Griflet.</a>
<a id='line_1809'></a>

<a id='line_1811'></a>
<a id='line_1812'>CHAPTER XV. Yet of the same battle.</a>
<a id='line_1813'></a>
<a id='line_1814'>Then Lucas saw King Agwisance, that late had slain Moris de la Roche,</a>
<a id='line_1815'>and Lucas ran to him with a short spear that was great, that he gave</a>
<a id='line_1816'>him such a fall, that the horse fell down to the earth. Also Lucas</a>
<a id='line_1817'>found there on foot, Bloias de La Flandres, and Sir Gwinas, two hardy</a>
<a id='line_1818'>knights, and in that woodness that Lucas was in, he slew two bachelors</a>
<a id='line_1819'>and horsed them again. Then waxed the battle passing hard on both</a>
<a id='line_1820'>parties, but Arthur was glad that his knights were horsed again, and</a>
<a id='line_1821'>then they fought together, that the noise and sound rang by the water</a>
<a id='line_1822'>and the wood. Wherefore King Ban and King Bors made them ready, and</a>
<a id='line_1823'>dressed their shields and harness, and they were so courageous that</a>
<a id='line_1824'>many knights shook and bevered for eagerness. All this while Lucas, and</a>
<a id='line_1825'>Gwinas, and Briant, and Bellias of Flanders, held strong medley against</a>
<a id='line_1826'>six kings, that was King Lot, King Nentres, King Brandegoris, King</a>
<a id='line_1827'>Idres, King Uriens, and King Agwisance. So with the help of Sir Kay and</a>
<a id='line_1828'>of Sir Griflet they held these six kings hard, that unnethe they had</a>
<a id='line_1829'>any power to defend them. But when Sir Arthur saw the battle would not</a>
<a id='line_1830'>be ended by no manner, he fared wood as a lion, and steered his horse</a>
<a id='line_1831'>here and there, on the right hand, and on the left hand, that he</a>
<a id='line_1832'>stinted not till he had slain twenty knights. Also he wounded King Lot</a>
<a id='line_1833'>sore on the shoulder, and made him to leave that ground, for Sir Kay</a>
<a id='line_1834'>and Griflet did with King Arthur there great deeds of arms. Then</a>
<a id='line_1835'>Ulfius, and Brastias, and Sir Ector encountered against the Duke</a>
<a id='line_1836'>Eustace, and King Cradelment, and King Clariance of Northumberland, and</a>
<a id='line_1837'>King Carados, and against the King with the Hundred Knights. So these</a>
<a id='line_1838'>knights encountered with these kings, that they made them to avoid the</a>
<a id='line_1839'>ground. Then King Lot made great dole for his damages and his fellows,</a>
<a id='line_1840'>and said unto the ten kings, But if ye will do as I devise we shall be</a>
<a id='line_1841'>slain and destroyed; let me have the King with the Hundred Knights, and</a>
<a id='line_1842'>King Agwisance, and King Idres, and the Duke of Cambenet, and we five</a>
<a id='line_1843'>kings will have fifteen thousand men of arms with us, and we will go</a>
<a id='line_1844'>apart while ye six kings hold medley with twelve thousand; an we see</a>
<a id='line_1845'>that ye have foughten with them long, then will we come on fiercely,</a>
<a id='line_1846'>and else shall we never match them, said King Lot, but by this mean. So</a>
<a id='line_1847'>they departed as they here devised, and six kings made their party</a>
<a id='line_1848'>strong against Arthur, and made great war long.</a>
<a id='line_1849'></a>
<a id='line_1850'>In the meanwhile brake the ambushment of King Ban and King Bors, and</a>
<a id='line_1851'>Lionses and Phariance had the vanguard, and they two knights met with</a>
<a id='line_1852'>King Idres and his fellowship, and there began a great medley of</a>
<a id='line_1853'>breaking of spears, and smiting of swords, with slaying of men and</a>
<a id='line_1854'>horses, and King Idres was near at discomforture.</a>
<a id='line_1855'></a>
<a id='line_1856'>That saw Agwisance the king, and put Lionses and Phariance in point of</a>
<a id='line_1857'>death; for the Duke of Cambenet came on withal with a great fellowship.</a>
<a id='line_1858'>So these two knights were in great danger of their lives that they were</a>
<a id='line_1859'>fain to return, but always they rescued themselves and their fellowship</a>
<a id='line_1860'>marvellously. When King Bors saw those knights put aback, it grieved</a>
<a id='line_1861'>him sore; then he came on so fast that his fellowship seemed as black</a>
<a id='line_1862'>as Inde. When King Lot had espied King Bors, he knew him well, then he</a>
<a id='line_1863'>said, O Jesu, defend us from death and horrible maims! for I see well</a>
<a id='line_1864'>we be in great peril of death; for I see yonder a king, one of the most</a>
<a id='line_1865'>worshipfullest men and one of the best knights of the world, is</a>
<a id='line_1866'>inclined unto his fellowship. What is he? said the King with the</a>
<a id='line_1867'>Hundred Knights. It is, said King Lot, King Bors of Gaul; I marvel how</a>
<a id='line_1868'>they came into this country without witting of us all. It was by</a>
<a id='line_1869'>Merlin’s advice, said the knight. As for him, said King Carados, I will</a>
<a id='line_1870'>encounter with King Bors, an ye will rescue me when myster is. Go on,</a>
<a id='line_1871'>said they all, we will do all that we may. Then King Carados and his</a>
<a id='line_1872'>host rode on a soft pace, till that they came as nigh King Bors as</a>
<a id='line_1873'>bow-draught; then either battle let their horse run as fast as they</a>
<a id='line_1874'>might. And Bleoberis, that was godson unto King Bors, he bare his chief</a>
<a id='line_1875'>standard, that was a passing good knight. Now shall we see, said King</a>
<a id='line_1876'>Bors, how these northern Britons can bear the arms: and King Bors</a>
<a id='line_1877'>encountered with a knight, and smote him throughout with a spear that</a>
<a id='line_1878'>he fell dead unto the earth; and after drew his sword and did</a>
<a id='line_1879'>marvellous deeds of arms, that all parties had great wonder thereof;</a>
<a id='line_1880'>and his knights failed not, but did their part, and King Carados was</a>
<a id='line_1881'>smitten to the earth. With that came the King with the Hundred Knights</a>
<a id='line_1882'>and rescued King Carados mightily by force of arms, for he was a</a>
<a id='line_1883'>passing good knight of a king, and but a young man.</a>
<a id='line_1884'></a>
<a id='line_1885'></a>
<a id='line_1886'></a>
<a id='line_1887'>CHAPTER XVI. Yet more of the same battle.</a>
<a id='line_1888'></a>
<a id='line_1889'>By then came into the field King Ban as fierce as a lion, with bands of</a>
<a id='line_1890'>green and thereupon gold. Ha! a! said King Lot, we must be discomfited,</a>
<a id='line_1891'>for yonder I see the most valiant knight of the world, and the man of</a>
<a id='line_1892'>the most renown, for such two brethren as is King Ban and King Bors are</a>
<a id='line_1893'>not living, wherefore we must needs void or die; and but if we avoid</a>
<a id='line_1894'>manly and wisely there is but death. When King Ban came into the</a>
<a id='line_1895'>battle, he came in so fiercely that the strokes redounded again from</a>
<a id='line_1896'>the wood and the water; wherefore King Lot wept for pity and dole that</a>
<a id='line_1897'>he saw so many good knights take their end. But through the great force</a>
<a id='line_1898'>of King Ban they made both the northern battles that were departed</a>
<a id='line_1899'>hurtled together for great dread; and the three kings and their knights</a>
<a id='line_1900'>slew on ever, that it was pity on to behold that multitude of the</a>
<a id='line_1901'>people that fled. But King Lot, and King of the Hundred Knights, and</a>
<a id='line_1902'>King Morganore gathered the people together passing knightly, and did</a>
<a id='line_1903'>great prowess of arms, and held the battle all that day, like hard.</a>
<a id='line_1904'></a>
<a id='line_1905'>When the King of the Hundred Knights beheld the great damage that King</a>
<a id='line_1906'>Ban did, he thrust unto him with his horse, and smote him on high upon</a>
<a id='line_1907'>the helm, a great stroke, and astonied him sore. Then King Ban was</a>
<a id='line_1908'>wroth with him, and followed on him fiercely; the other saw that, and</a>
<a id='line_1909'>cast up his shield, and spurred his horse forward, but the stroke of</a>
<a id='line_1910'>King Ban fell down and carved a cantel off the shield, and the sword</a>
<a id='line_1911'>slid down by the hauberk behind his back, and cut through the trapping</a>
<a id='line_1912'>of steel and the horse even in two pieces, that the sword felt the</a>
<a id='line_1913'>earth. Then the King of the Hundred Knights voided the horse lightly,</a>
<a id='line_1914'>and with his sword he broached the horse of King Ban through and</a>
<a id='line_1915'>through. With that King Ban voided lightly from the dead horse, and</a>
<a id='line_1916'>then King Ban smote at the other so eagerly, and smote him on the helm</a>
<a id='line_1917'>that he fell to the earth. Also in that ire he felled King Morganore,</a>
<a id='line_1918'>and there was great slaughter of good knights and much people. By then</a>
<a id='line_1919'>came into the press King Arthur, and found King Ban standing among dead</a>
<a id='line_1920'>men and dead horses, fighting on foot as a wood lion, that there came</a>
<a id='line_1921'>none nigh him, as far as he might reach with his sword, but he caught a</a>
<a id='line_1922'>grievous buffet; whereof King Arthur had great pity. And Arthur was so</a>
<a id='line_1923'>bloody, that by his shield there might no man know him, for all was</a>
<a id='line_1924'>blood and brains on his sword. And as Arthur looked by him he saw a</a>
<a id='line_1925'>knight that was passingly well horsed, and therewith Sir Arthur ran to</a>
<a id='line_1926'>him, and smote him on the helm, that his sword went unto his teeth, and</a>
<a id='line_1927'>the knight sank down to the earth dead, and anon Arthur took the horse</a>
<a id='line_1928'>by the rein, and led him unto King Ban, and said, Fair brother, have</a>
<a id='line_1929'>this horse, for he have great myster thereof, and me repenteth sore of</a>
<a id='line_1930'>your great damage. It shall be soon revenged, said King Ban, for I</a>
<a id='line_1931'>trust in God mine ure is not such but some of them may sore repent</a>
<a id='line_1932'>this. I will well, said Arthur, for I see your deeds full actual;</a>
<a id='line_1933'>nevertheless, I might not come at you at that time.</a>
<a id='line_1934'></a>
<a id='line_1935'>But when King Ban was mounted on horseback, then there began new</a>
<a id='line_1936'>battle, the which was sore and hard, and passing great slaughter. And</a>
<a id='line_1937'>so through great force King Arthur, King Ban, and King Bors made their</a>
<a id='line_1938'>knights a little to withdraw them. But alway the eleven kings with</a>
<a id='line_1939'>their chivalry never turned back; and so withdrew them to a little</a>
<a id='line_1940'>wood, and so over a little river, and there they rested them, for on</a>
<a id='line_1941'>the night they might have no rest on the field. And then the eleven</a>
<a id='line_1942'>kings and knights put them on a heap all together, as men adread and</a>
<a id='line_1943'>out of all comfort. But there was no man might pass them, they held</a>
<a id='line_1944'>them so hard together both behind and before, that King Arthur had</a>
<a id='line_1945'>marvel of their deeds of arms, and was passing wroth. Ah, Sir Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_1946'>said King Ban and King Bors, blame them not, for they do as good men</a>
<a id='line_1947'>ought to do. For by my faith, said King Ban, they are the best fighting</a>
<a id='line_1948'>men, and knights of most prowess, that ever I saw or heard speak of,</a>
<a id='line_1949'>and those eleven kings are men of great worship; and if they were</a>
<a id='line_1950'>longing unto you there were no king under the heaven had such eleven</a>
<a id='line_1951'>knights, and of such worship. I may not love them, said Arthur, they</a>
<a id='line_1952'>would destroy me. That wot we well, said King Ban and King Bors, for</a>
<a id='line_1953'>they are your mortal enemies, and that hath been proved aforehand; and</a>
<a id='line_1954'>this day they have done their part, and that is great pity of their</a>
<a id='line_1955'>wilfulness.</a>
<a id='line_1956'></a>
<a id='line_1957'>Then all the eleven kings drew them together, and then said King Lot,</a>
<a id='line_1958'>Lords, ye must other ways than ye do, or else the great loss is behind;</a>
<a id='line_1959'>ye may see what people we have lost, and what good men we lose, because</a>
<a id='line_1960'>we wait always on these foot-men, and ever in saving of one of the</a>
<a id='line_1961'>foot-men we lose ten horsemen for him; therefore this is mine advice,</a>
<a id='line_1962'>let us put our foot-men from us, for it is near night, for the noble</a>
<a id='line_1963'>Arthur will not tarry on the footmen, for they may save themselves, the</a>
<a id='line_1964'>wood is near hand. And when we horsemen be together, look every each of</a>
<a id='line_1965'>you kings let make such ordinance that none break upon pain of death.</a>
<a id='line_1966'>And who that seeth any man dress him to flee, lightly that he be slain,</a>
<a id='line_1967'>for it is better that we slay a coward, than through a coward all we to</a>
<a id='line_1968'>be slain. How say ye? said King Lot, answer me all ye kings. It is well</a>
<a id='line_1969'>said, quoth King Nentres; so said the King of the Hundred Knights; the</a>
<a id='line_1970'>same said the King Carados, and King Uriens; so did King Idres and King</a>
<a id='line_1971'>Brandegoris; and so did King Cradelment, and the Duke of Cambenet; the</a>
<a id='line_1972'>same said King Clariance and King Agwisance, and sware they would never</a>
<a id='line_1973'>fail other, neither for life nor for death. And whoso that fled, but</a>
<a id='line_1974'>did as they did, should be slain. Then they amended their harness, and</a>
<a id='line_1975'>righted their shields, and took new spears and set them on their</a>
<a id='line_1976'>thighs, and stood still as it had been a plump of wood.</a>
<a id='line_1977'></a>
<a id='line_1978'></a>
<a id='line_1979'></a>
<a id='line_1980'>CHAPTER XVII. Yet more of the same battle, and how it was ended by</a>
<a id='line_1981'>Merlin.</a>
<a id='line_1982'></a>
<a id='line_1983'>When Sir Arthur and King Ban and Bors beheld them and all their</a>
<a id='line_1984'>knights, they praised them much for their noble cheer of chivalry, for</a>
<a id='line_1985'>the hardiest fighters that ever they heard or saw. With that, there</a>
<a id='line_1986'>dressed them a forty noble knights, and said unto the three kings, they</a>
<a id='line_1987'>would break their battle; these were their names: Lionses, Phariance,</a>
<a id='line_1988'>Ulfius, Brastias, Ector, Kay, Lucas the butler, Griflet le Fise de</a>
<a id='line_1989'>Dieu, Mariet de la Roche, Guinas de Bloi, Briant de la Forest Savage,</a>
<a id='line_1990'>Bellaus, Morians of the Castle [of] Maidens, Flannedrius of the Castle</a>
<a id='line_1991'>of Ladies, Annecians that was King Bors’ godson, a noble knight,</a>
<a id='line_1992'>Ladinas de la Rouse, Emerause, Caulas, Graciens le Castlein, one Blois</a>
<a id='line_1993'>de la Case, and Sir Colgrevaunce de Gorre; all these knights rode on</a>
<a id='line_1994'>afore with spears on their thighs, and spurred their horses mightily as</a>
<a id='line_1995'>the horses might run. And the eleven kings with part of their knights</a>
<a id='line_1996'>rushed with their horses as fast as they might with their spears, and</a>
<a id='line_1997'>there they did on both parties marvellous deeds of arms. So came into</a>
<a id='line_1998'>the thick of the press, Arthur, Ban, and Bors, and slew down right on</a>
<a id='line_1999'>both hands, that their horses went in blood up to the fetlocks. But</a>
<a id='line_2000'>ever the eleven kings and their host was ever in the visage of Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_2001'>Wherefore Ban and Bors had great marvel, considering the great</a>
<a id='line_2002'>slaughter that there was, but at the last they were driven aback over a</a>
<a id='line_2003'>little river. With that came Merlin on a great black horse, and said</a>
<a id='line_2004'>unto Arthur, Thou hast never done! Hast thou not done enough? of three</a>
<a id='line_2005'>score thousand this day hast thou left alive but fifteen thousand, and</a>
<a id='line_2006'>it is time to say Ho! For God is wroth with thee, that thou wilt never</a>
<a id='line_2007'>have done; for yonder eleven kings at this time will not be overthrown,</a>
<a id='line_2008'>but an thou tarry on them any longer, thy fortune will turn and they</a>
<a id='line_2009'>shall increase. And therefore withdraw you unto your lodging, and rest</a>
<a id='line_2010'>you as soon as ye may, and reward your good knights with gold and with</a>
<a id='line_2011'>silver, for they have well deserved it; there may no riches be too dear</a>
<a id='line_2012'>for them, for of so few men as ye have, there were never men did more</a>
<a id='line_2013'>of prowess than they have done today, for ye have matched this day with</a>
<a id='line_2014'>the best fighters of the world. That is truth, said King Ban and Bors.</a>
<a id='line_2015'>Also said Merlin, withdraw you where ye list, for this three year I</a>
<a id='line_2016'>dare undertake they shall not dere you; and by then ye shall hear new</a>
<a id='line_2017'>tidings. And then Merlin said unto Arthur, These eleven kings have more</a>
<a id='line_2018'>on hand than they are ware of, for the Saracens are landed in their</a>
<a id='line_2019'>countries, more than forty thousand, that burn and slay, and have laid</a>
<a id='line_2020'>siege at the castle Wandesborow, and make great destruction; therefore</a>
<a id='line_2021'>dread you not this three year. Also, sir, all the goods that be gotten</a>
<a id='line_2022'>at this battle, let it be searched, and when ye have it in your hands,</a>
<a id='line_2023'>let it be given freely unto these two kings, Ban and Bors, that they</a>
<a id='line_2024'>may reward their knights withal; and that shall cause strangers to be</a>
<a id='line_2025'>of better will to do you service at need. Also you be able to reward</a>
<a id='line_2026'>your own knights of your own goods whensomever it liketh you. It is</a>
<a id='line_2027'>well said, quoth Arthur, and as thou hast devised, so shall it be done.</a>
<a id='line_2028'>When it was delivered to Ban and Bors, they gave the goods as freely to</a>
<a id='line_2029'>their knights as freely as it was given to them. Then Merlin took his</a>
<a id='line_2030'>leave of Arthur and of the two kings, for to go and see his master</a>
<a id='line_2031'>Bleise, that dwelt in Northumberland; and so he departed and came to</a>
<a id='line_2032'>his master, that was passing glad of his coming; and there he told how</a>
<a id='line_2033'>Arthur and the two kings had sped at the great battle, and how it was</a>
<a id='line_2034'>ended, and told the names of every king and knight of worship that was</a>
<a id='line_2035'>there. And so Bleise wrote the battle word by word, as Merlin told him,</a>
<a id='line_2036'>how it began, and by whom, and in likewise how it was ended, and who</a>
<a id='line_2037'>had the worse. All the battles that were done in Arthur’s days Merlin</a>
<a id='line_2038'>did his master Bleise do write; also he did do write all the battles</a>
<a id='line_2039'>that every worthy knight did of Arthur’s court.</a>
<a id='line_2040'></a>
<a id='line_2041'>After this Merlin departed from his master and came to King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_2042'>that was in the castle of Bedegraine, that was one of the castles that</a>
<a id='line_2043'>stand in the forest of Sherwood. And Merlin was so disguised that King</a>
<a id='line_2044'>Arthur knew him not, for he was all befurred in black sheep-skins, and</a>
<a id='line_2045'>a great pair of boots, and a bow and arrows, in a russet gown, and</a>
<a id='line_2046'>brought wild geese in his hand, and it was on the morn after Candlemas</a>
<a id='line_2047'>day; but King Arthur knew him not. Sir, said Merlin unto the king, will</a>
<a id='line_2048'>ye give me a gift? Wherefore, said King Arthur, should I give thee a</a>
<a id='line_2049'>gift, churl? Sir, said Merlin, ye were better to give me a gift that is</a>
<a id='line_2050'>not in your hand than to lose great riches, for here in the same place</a>
<a id='line_2051'>where the great battle was, is great treasure hid in the earth. Who</a>
<a id='line_2052'>told thee so, churl? said Arthur. Merlin told me so, said he. Then</a>
<a id='line_2053'>Ulfius and Brastias knew him well enough, and smiled. Sir, said these</a>
<a id='line_2054'>two knights, it is Merlin that so speaketh unto you. Then King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_2055'>was greatly abashed, and had marvel of Merlin, and so had King Ban and</a>
<a id='line_2056'>King Bors, and so they had great disport at him. So in the meanwhile</a>
<a id='line_2057'>there came a damosel that was an earl’s daughter: his name was Sanam,</a>
<a id='line_2058'>and her name was Lionors, a passing fair damosel; and so she came</a>
<a id='line_2059'>thither for to do homage, as other lords did after the great battle.</a>
<a id='line_2060'>And King Arthur set his love greatly upon her, and so did she upon him,</a>
<a id='line_2061'>and the king had ado with her, and gat on her a child: his name was</a>
<a id='line_2062'>Borre, that was after a good knight, and of the Table Round. Then there</a>
<a id='line_2063'>came word that the King Rience of North Wales made great war on King</a>
<a id='line_2064'>Leodegrance of Cameliard, for the which thing Arthur was wroth, for he</a>
<a id='line_2065'>loved him well, and hated King Rience, for he was alway against him. So</a>
<a id='line_2066'>by ordinance of the three kings that were sent home unto Benwick, all</a>
<a id='line_2067'>they would depart for dread of King Claudas; and Phariance, and</a>
<a id='line_2068'>Antemes, and Gratian, and Lionses [of] Payarne, with the leaders of</a>
<a id='line_2069'>those that should keep the kings’ lands.</a>

<a id='line_2074'>Leodegrance, and other incidents.</a>
<a id='line_2075'></a>
<a id='line_2076'>And then King Arthur, and King Ban, and King Bors departed with their</a>
<a id='line_2077'>fellowship, a twenty thousand, and came within six days into the</a>
<a id='line_2078'>country of Cameliard, and there rescued King Leodegrance, and slew</a>
<a id='line_2079'>there much people of King Rience, unto the number of ten thousand men,</a>
<a id='line_2080'>and put him to flight. And then had these three kings great cheer of</a>
<a id='line_2081'>King Leodegrance, that thanked them of their great goodness, that they</a>
<a id='line_2082'>would revenge him of his enemies; and there had Arthur the first sight</a>
<a id='line_2083'>of Guenever, the king’s daughter of Cameliard, and ever after he loved</a>
<a id='line_2084'>her. After they were wedded, as it telleth in the book. So, briefly to</a>
<a id='line_2085'>make an end, they took their leave to go into their own countries, for</a>
<a id='line_2086'>King Claudas did great destruction on their lands. Then said Arthur, I</a>
<a id='line_2087'>will go with you. Nay, said the kings, ye shall not at this time, for</a>
<a id='line_2088'>ye have much to do yet in these lands, therefore we will depart, and</a>
<a id='line_2089'>with the great goods that we have gotten in these lands by your gifts,</a>
<a id='line_2090'>we shall wage good knights and withstand the King Claudas’ malice, for</a>
<a id='line_2091'>by the grace of God, an we have need we will send to you for your</a>
<a id='line_2092'>succour; and if ye have need, send for us, and we will not tarry, by</a>
<a id='line_2093'>the faith of our bodies. It shall not, said Merlin, need that these two</a>
<a id='line_2094'>kings come again in the way of war, but I know well King Arthur may not</a>
<a id='line_2095'>be long from you, for within a year or two ye shall have great need,</a>
<a id='line_2096'>and then shall he revenge you on your enemies, as ye have done on his.</a>
<a id='line_2097'>For these eleven kings shall die all in a day, by the great might and</a>
<a id='line_2098'>prowess of arms of two valiant knights (as it telleth after); their</a>
<a id='line_2099'>names be Balin le Savage, and Balan, his brother, that be marvellous</a>
<a id='line_2100'>good knights as be any living.</a>
<a id='line_2101'></a>
<a id='line_2102'>Now turn we to the eleven kings that returned unto a city that hight</a>
<a id='line_2103'>Sorhaute, the which city was within King Uriens’, and there they</a>
<a id='line_2104'>refreshed them as well as they might, and made leeches search their</a>
<a id='line_2105'>wounds, and sorrowed greatly for the death of their people. With that</a>
<a id='line_2106'>there came a messenger and told how there was come into their lands</a>
<a id='line_2107'>people that were lawless as well as Saracens, a forty thousand, and</a>
<a id='line_2108'>have burnt and slain all the people that they may come by, without</a>
<a id='line_2109'>mercy, and have laid siege on the castle of Wandesborow. Alas, said the</a>
<a id='line_2110'>eleven kings, here is sorrow upon sorrow, and if we had not warred</a>
<a id='line_2111'>against Arthur as we have done, he would soon revenge us. As for King</a>
<a id='line_2112'>Leodegrance, he loveth Arthur better than us, and as for King Rience,</a>
<a id='line_2113'>he hath enough to do with Leodegrance, for he hath laid siege unto him.</a>
<a id='line_2114'>So they consented together to keep all the marches of Cornwall, of</a>
<a id='line_2115'>Wales, and of the North. So first, they put King Idres in the City of</a>
<a id='line_2116'>Nauntes in Britain, with four thousand men of arms, to watch both the</a>
<a id='line_2117'>water and the land. Also they put in the city of Windesan, King Nentres</a>
<a id='line_2118'>of Garlot, with four thousand knights to watch both on water and on</a>
<a id='line_2119'>land. Also they had of other men of war more than eight thousand, for</a>
<a id='line_2120'>to fortify all the fortresses in the marches of Cornwall. Also they put</a>
<a id='line_2121'>more knights in all the marches of Wales and Scotland, with many good</a>
<a id='line_2122'>men of arms, and so they kept them together the space of three year,</a>
<a id='line_2123'>and ever allied them with mighty kings and dukes and lords. And to them</a>
<a id='line_2124'>fell King Rience of North Wales, the which and Nero that was a mighty</a>
<a id='line_2125'>man of men. And all this while they furnished them and garnished them</a>
<a id='line_2126'>of good men of arms, and victual, and of all manner of habiliment that</a>
<a id='line_2127'>pretendeth to the war, to avenge them for the battle of Bedegraine, as</a>
<a id='line_2128'>it telleth in the book of adventures following.</a>
<a id='line_2129'></a>
<a id='line_2130'></a>
<a id='line_2131'></a>
<a id='line_2132'>CHAPTER XIX. How King Arthur rode to Carlion, and of his dream, and how</a>
<a id='line_2133'>he saw the questing beast.</a>
<a id='line_2134'></a>
<a id='line_2135'>Then after the departing of King Ban and of King Bors, King Arthur rode</a>
<a id='line_2136'>into Carlion. And thither came to him, King Lot’s wife, of Orkney, in</a>
<a id='line_2137'>manner of a message, but she was sent thither to espy the court of King</a>
<a id='line_2138'>Arthur; and she came richly beseen, with her four sons, Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_2139'>Gaheris, Agravine, and Gareth, with many other knights and ladies. For</a>
<a id='line_2140'>she was a passing fair lady, therefore the king cast great love unto</a>
<a id='line_2141'>her, and desired to lie by her; so they were agreed, and he begat upon</a>
<a id='line_2142'>her Mordred, and she was his sister, on his mother’s side, Igraine. So</a>
<a id='line_2143'>there she rested her a month, and at the last departed. Then the king</a>
<a id='line_2144'>dreamed a marvellous dream whereof he was sore adread. But all this</a>
<a id='line_2145'>time King Arthur knew not that King Lot’s wife was his sister. Thus was</a>
<a id='line_2146'>the dream of Arthur: Him thought there was come into this land griffins</a>
<a id='line_2147'>and serpents, and him thought they burnt and slew all the people in the</a>
<a id='line_2148'>land, and then him thought he fought with them, and they did him</a>
<a id='line_2149'>passing great harm, and wounded him full sore, but at the last he slew</a>
<a id='line_2150'>them. When the king awaked, he was passing heavy of his dream, and so</a>
<a id='line_2151'>to put it out of thoughts, he made him ready with many knights to ride</a>
<a id='line_2152'>a-hunting. As soon as he was in the forest the king saw a great hart</a>
<a id='line_2153'>afore him. This hart will I chase, said King Arthur, and so he spurred</a>
<a id='line_2154'>the horse, and rode after long, and so by fine force oft he was like to</a>
<a id='line_2155'>have smitten the hart; whereas the king had chased the hart so long,</a>
<a id='line_2156'>that his horse lost his breath, and fell down dead. Then a yeoman</a>
<a id='line_2157'>fetched the king another horse.</a>
<a id='line_2158'></a>
<a id='line_2159'>So the king saw the hart enbushed, and his horse dead, he set him down</a>
<a id='line_2160'>by a fountain, and there he fell in great thoughts. And as he sat so,</a>
<a id='line_2161'>him thought he heard a noise of hounds, to the sum of thirty. And with</a>
<a id='line_2162'>that the king saw coming toward him the strangest beast that ever he</a>
<a id='line_2163'>saw or heard of; so the beast went to the well and drank, and the noise</a>
<a id='line_2164'>was in the beast’s belly like unto the questing of thirty couple</a>
<a id='line_2165'>hounds; but all the while the beast drank there was no noise in the</a>
<a id='line_2166'>beast’s belly: and there with the beast departed with a great noise,</a>
<a id='line_2167'>whereof the king had great marvel. And so he was in a great thought,</a>
<a id='line_2168'>and therewith he fell asleep. Right so there came a knight afoot unto</a>
<a id='line_2169'>Arthur and said, Knight full of thought and sleepy, tell me if thou</a>
<a id='line_2170'>sawest a strange beast pass this way. Such one saw I, said King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_2171'>that is past two mile; what would ye with the beast? said Arthur. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_2172'>I have followed that beast long time, and killed mine horse, so would</a>
<a id='line_2173'>God I had another to follow my quest. Right so came one with the king’s</a>
<a id='line_2174'>horse, and when the knight saw the horse, he prayed the king to give</a>
<a id='line_2175'>him the horse: for I have followed this quest this twelvemonth, and</a>
<a id='line_2176'>either I shall achieve him, or bleed of the best blood of my body.</a>
<a id='line_2177'>Pellinore, that time king, followed the Questing Beast, and after his</a>
<a id='line_2178'>death Sir Palamides followed it.</a>
<a id='line_2179'></a>
<a id='line_2180'></a>
<a id='line_2181'></a>
<a id='line_2182'>CHAPTER XX. How King Pellinore took Arthur’s horse and followed the</a>
<a id='line_2183'>Questing Beast, and how Merlin met with Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_2184'></a>
<a id='line_2185'>Sir knight, said the king, leave that quest, and suffer me to have it,</a>
<a id='line_2186'>and I will follow it another twelvemonth. Ah, fool, said the knight</a>
<a id='line_2187'>unto Arthur, it is in vain thy desire, for it shall never be achieved</a>
<a id='line_2188'>but by me, or my next kin. Therewith he started unto the king’s horse</a>
<a id='line_2189'>and mounted into the saddle, and said, Gramercy, this horse is my own.</a>
<a id='line_2190'>Well, said the king, thou mayst take my horse by force, but an I might</a>
<a id='line_2191'>prove thee whether thou were better on horseback or I.—Well, said the</a>
<a id='line_2192'>knight, seek me here when thou wilt, and here nigh this well thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_2193'>find me, and so passed on his way. Then the king sat in a study, and</a>
<a id='line_2194'>bade his men fetch his horse as fast as ever they might. Right so came</a>
<a id='line_2195'>by him Merlin like a child of fourteen year of age, and saluted the</a>
<a id='line_2196'>king, and asked him why he was so pensive. I may well be pensive, said</a>
<a id='line_2197'>the king, for I have seen the marvellest sight that ever I saw. That</a>
<a id='line_2198'>know I well, said Merlin, as well as thyself, and of all thy thoughts,</a>
<a id='line_2199'>but thou art but a fool to take thought, for it will not amend thee.</a>
<a id='line_2200'>Also I know what thou art, and who was thy father, and of whom thou</a>
<a id='line_2201'>wert begotten; King Uther Pendragon was thy father, and begat thee on</a>
<a id='line_2202'>Igraine. That is false, said King Arthur, how shouldest thou know it,</a>
<a id='line_2203'>for thou art not so old of years to know my father? Yes, said Merlin, I</a>
<a id='line_2204'>know it better than ye or any man living. I will not believe thee, said</a>
<a id='line_2205'>Arthur, and was wroth with the child. So departed Merlin, and came</a>
<a id='line_2206'>again in the likeness of an old man of fourscore year of age, whereof</a>
<a id='line_2207'>the king was right glad, for he seemed to be right wise.</a>
<a id='line_2208'></a>
<a id='line_2209'>Then said the old man, Why are ye so sad? I may well be heavy, said</a>
<a id='line_2210'>Arthur, for many things. Also here was a child, and told me many things</a>
<a id='line_2211'>that meseemeth he should not know, for he was not of age to know my</a>
<a id='line_2212'>father. Yes, said the old man, the child told you truth, and more would</a>
<a id='line_2213'>he have told you an ye would have suffered him. But ye have done a</a>
<a id='line_2214'>thing late that God is displeased with you, for ye have lain by your</a>
<a id='line_2215'>sister, and on her ye have gotten a child that shall destroy you and</a>
<a id='line_2216'>all the knights of your realm. What are ye, said Arthur, that tell me</a>
<a id='line_2217'>these tidings? I am Merlin, and I was he in the child’s likeness. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_2218'>said King Arthur, ye are a marvellous man, but I marvel much of thy</a>
<a id='line_2219'>words that I must die in battle. Marvel not, said Merlin, for it is</a>
<a id='line_2220'>God’s will your body to be punished for your foul deeds; but I may well</a>
<a id='line_2221'>be sorry, said Merlin, for I shall die a shameful death, to be put in</a>
<a id='line_2222'>the earth quick, and ye shall die a worshipful death. And as they</a>
<a id='line_2223'>talked this, came one with the king’s horse, and so the king mounted on</a>
<a id='line_2224'>his horse, and Merlin on another, and so rode unto Carlion. And anon</a>
<a id='line_2225'>the king asked Ector and Ulfius how he was begotten, and they told him</a>
<a id='line_2226'>Uther Pendragon was his father and Queen Igraine his mother. Then he</a>
<a id='line_2227'>said to Merlin, I will that my mother be sent for that I may speak with</a>
<a id='line_2228'>her; and if she say so herself then will I believe it. In all haste,</a>
<a id='line_2229'>the queen was sent for, and she came and brought with her Morgan le</a>
<a id='line_2230'>Fay, her daughter, that was as fair a lady as any might be, and the</a>
<a id='line_2231'>king welcomed Igraine in the best manner.</a>
<a id='line_2232'></a>
<a id='line_2233'></a>
<a id='line_2234'></a>
<a id='line_2235'>CHAPTER XXI. How Ulfius impeached Queen Igraine, Arthur’s mother, of</a>
<a id='line_2236'>treason; and how a knight came and desired to have the death of his</a>
<a id='line_2237'>master revenged.</a>
<a id='line_2238'></a>
<a id='line_2239'>Right so came Ulfius, and said openly, that the king and all might hear</a>
<a id='line_2240'>that were feasted that day, Ye are the falsest lady of the world, and</a>
<a id='line_2241'>the most traitress unto the king’s person. Beware, said Arthur, what</a>
<a id='line_2242'>thou sayest; thou speakest a great word. I am well ware, said Ulfius,</a>
<a id='line_2243'>what I speak, and here is my glove to prove it upon any man that will</a>
<a id='line_2244'>say the contrary, that this Queen Igraine is causer of your great</a>
<a id='line_2245'>damage, and of your great war. For, an she would have uttered it in the</a>
<a id='line_2246'>life of King Uther Pendragon, of the birth of you, and how ye were</a>
<a id='line_2247'>begotten ye had never had the mortal wars that ye have had; for the</a>
<a id='line_2248'>most part of your barons of your realm knew never whose son ye were,</a>
<a id='line_2249'>nor of whom ye were begotten; and she that bare you of her body should</a>
<a id='line_2250'>have made it known openly in excusing of her worship and yours, and in</a>
<a id='line_2251'>like wise to all the realm, wherefore I prove her false to God and to</a>
<a id='line_2252'>you and to all your realm, and who will say the contrary I will prove</a>
<a id='line_2253'>it on his body.</a>
<a id='line_2254'></a>
<a id='line_2255'>Then spake Igraine and said, I am a woman and I may not fight, but</a>
<a id='line_2256'>rather than I should be dishonoured, there would some good man take my</a>
<a id='line_2257'>quarrel. More, she said, Merlin knoweth well, and ye Sir Ulfius, how</a>
<a id='line_2258'>King Uther came to me in the Castle of Tintagil in the likeness of my</a>
<a id='line_2259'>lord, that was dead three hours to-fore, and thereby gat a child that</a>
<a id='line_2260'>night upon me. And after the thirteenth day King Uther wedded me, and</a>
<a id='line_2261'>by his commandment when the child was born it was delivered unto Merlin</a>
<a id='line_2262'>and nourished by him, and so I saw the child never after, nor wot not</a>
<a id='line_2263'>what is his name, for I knew him never yet. And there, Ulfius said to</a>
<a id='line_2264'>the queen, Merlin is more to blame than ye. Well I wot, said the queen,</a>
<a id='line_2265'>I bare a child by my lord King Uther, but I wot not where he is become.</a>
<a id='line_2266'>Then Merlin took the king by the hand, saying, This is your mother. And</a>
<a id='line_2267'>therewith Sir Ector bare witness how he nourished him by Uther’s</a>
<a id='line_2268'>commandment. And therewith King Arthur took his mother, Queen Igraine,</a>
<a id='line_2269'>in his arms and kissed her, and either wept upon other. And then the</a>
<a id='line_2270'>king let make a feast that lasted eight days.</a>
<a id='line_2271'></a>
<a id='line_2272'>Then on a day there came in the court a squire on horseback, leading a</a>
<a id='line_2273'>knight before him wounded to the death, and told him how there was a</a>
<a id='line_2274'>knight in the forest had reared up a pavilion by a well, and hath slain</a>
<a id='line_2275'>my master, a good knight, his name was Miles; wherefore I beseech you</a>
<a id='line_2276'>that my master may be buried, and that some knight may revenge my</a>
<a id='line_2277'>master’s death. Then the noise was great of that knight’s death in the</a>
<a id='line_2278'>court, and every man said his advice. Then came Griflet that was but a</a>
<a id='line_2279'>squire, and he was but young, of the age of the king Arthur, so he</a>
<a id='line_2280'>besought the king for all his service that he had done him to give the</a>
<a id='line_2281'>order of knighthood.</a>
<a id='line_2282'></a>
<a id='line_2283'></a>
<a id='line_2284'></a>
<a id='line_2285'>CHAPTER XXII. How Griflet was made knight, and jousted with a knight.</a>
<a id='line_2286'></a>
<a id='line_2287'>Thou art full young and tender of age, said Arthur, for to take so high</a>
<a id='line_2288'>an order on thee. Sir, said Griflet, I beseech you make me knight. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_2289'>said Merlin, it were great pity to lose Griflet, for he will be a</a>
<a id='line_2290'>passing good man when he is of age, abiding with you the term of his</a>
<a id='line_2291'>life. And if he adventure his body with yonder knight at the fountain,</a>
<a id='line_2292'>it is in great peril if ever he come again, for he is one of the best</a>
<a id='line_2293'>knights of the world, and the strongest man of arms. Well, said Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_2294'>So at the desire of Griflet the king made him knight. Now, said Arthur</a>
<a id='line_2295'>unto Sir Griflet, sith I have made you knight thou must give me a gift.</a>
<a id='line_2296'>What ye will, said Griflet. Thou shalt promise me by the faith of thy</a>
<a id='line_2297'>body, when thou hast jousted with the knight at the fountain, whether</a>
<a id='line_2298'>it fall ye be on foot or on horseback, that right so ye shall come</a>
<a id='line_2299'>again unto me without making any more debate. I will promise you, said</a>
<a id='line_2300'>Griflet, as you desire. Then took Griflet his horse in great haste, and</a>
<a id='line_2301'>dressed his shield and took a spear in his hand, and so he rode a great</a>
<a id='line_2302'>wallop till he came to the fountain, and thereby he saw a rich</a>
<a id='line_2303'>pavilion, and thereby under a cloth stood a fair horse well saddled and</a>
<a id='line_2304'>bridled, and on a tree a shield of divers colours and a great spear.</a>
<a id='line_2305'>Then Griflet smote on the shield with the butt of his spear, that the</a>
<a id='line_2306'>shield fell down to the ground. With that the knight came out of the</a>
<a id='line_2307'>pavilion, and said, Fair knight, why smote ye down my shield? For I</a>
<a id='line_2308'>will joust with you, said Griflet. It is better ye do not, said the</a>
<a id='line_2309'>knight, for ye are but young, and late made knight, and your might is</a>
<a id='line_2310'>nothing to mine. As for that, said Griflet, I will joust with you. That</a>
<a id='line_2311'>is me loath, said the knight, but sith I must needs, I will dress me</a>
<a id='line_2312'>thereto. Of whence be ye? said the knight. Sir, I am of Arthur’s court.</a>
<a id='line_2313'>So the two knights ran together that Griflet’s spear all to-shivered;</a>
<a id='line_2314'>and there withal he smote Griflet through the shield and the left side,</a>
<a id='line_2315'>and brake the spear that the truncheon stuck in his body, that horse</a>
<a id='line_2316'>and knight fell down.</a>
<a id='line_2317'></a>
<a id='line_2318'></a>
<a id='line_2319'></a>
<a id='line_2320'>CHAPTER XXIII. How twelve knights came from Rome and asked truage for</a>
<a id='line_2321'>this land of Arthur, and how Arthur fought with a knight.</a>
<a id='line_2322'></a>
<a id='line_2323'>When the knight saw him lie so on the ground, he alighted, and was</a>
<a id='line_2324'>passing heavy, for he weened he had slain him, and then he unlaced his</a>
<a id='line_2325'>helm and gat him wind, and so with the truncheon he set him on his</a>
<a id='line_2326'>horse, and so betook him to God, and said he had a mighty heart, and if</a>
<a id='line_2327'>he might live he would prove a passing good knight. And so Sir Griflet</a>
<a id='line_2328'>rode to the court, where great dole was made for him. But through good</a>
<a id='line_2329'>leeches he was healed and saved. Right so came into the court twelve</a>
<a id='line_2330'>knights, and were aged men, and they came from the Emperor of Rome, and</a>
<a id='line_2331'>they asked of Arthur truage for this realm, other else the emperor</a>
<a id='line_2332'>would destroy him and his land. Well, said King Arthur, ye are</a>
<a id='line_2333'>messengers, therefore ye may say what ye will, other else ye should die</a>
<a id='line_2334'>therefore. But this is mine answer: I owe the emperor no truage, nor</a>
<a id='line_2335'>none will I hold him, but on a fair field I shall give him my truage</a>
<a id='line_2336'>that shall be with a sharp spear, or else with a sharp sword, and that</a>
<a id='line_2337'>shall not be long, by my father’s soul, Uther Pendragon. And therewith</a>
<a id='line_2338'>the messengers departed passingly wroth, and King Arthur as wroth, for</a>
<a id='line_2339'>in evil time came they then; for the king was passingly wroth for the</a>
<a id='line_2340'>hurt of Sir Griflet. And so he commanded a privy man of his chamber</a>
<a id='line_2341'>that or it be day his best horse and armour, with all that longeth unto</a>
<a id='line_2342'>his person, be without the city or to-morrow day. Right so or to-morrow</a>
<a id='line_2343'>day he met with his man and his horse, and so mounted up and dressed</a>
<a id='line_2344'>his shield and took his spear, and bade his chamberlain tarry there</a>
<a id='line_2345'>till he came again. And so Arthur rode a soft pace till it was day, and</a>
<a id='line_2346'>then was he ware of three churls chasing Merlin, and would have slain</a>
<a id='line_2347'>him. Then the king rode unto them, and bade them: Flee, churls! then</a>
<a id='line_2348'>were they afeard when they saw a knight, and fled. O Merlin, said</a>
<a id='line_2349'>Arthur, here hadst thou been slain for all thy crafts had I not been.</a>
<a id='line_2350'>Nay, said Merlin, not so, for I could save myself an I would; and thou</a>
<a id='line_2351'>art more near thy death than I am, for thou goest to the deathward, an</a>
<a id='line_2352'>God be not thy friend.</a>
<a id='line_2353'></a>
<a id='line_2354'>So as they went thus talking they came to the fountain, and the rich</a>
<a id='line_2355'>pavilion there by it. Then King Arthur was ware where sat a knight</a>
<a id='line_2356'>armed in a chair. Sir knight, said Arthur, for what cause abidest thou</a>
<a id='line_2357'>here, that there may no knight ride this way but if he joust with thee?</a>
<a id='line_2358'>said the king. I rede thee leave that custom, said Arthur. This custom,</a>
<a id='line_2359'>said the knight, have I used and will use maugre who saith nay, and who</a>
<a id='line_2360'>is grieved with my custom let him amend it that will. I will amend it,</a>
<a id='line_2361'>said Arthur. I shall defend thee, said the knight. Anon he took his</a>
<a id='line_2362'>horse and dressed his shield and took a spear, and they met so hard</a>
<a id='line_2363'>either in other’s shields, that all to-shivered their spears. Therewith</a>
<a id='line_2364'>anon Arthur pulled out his sword. Nay, not so, said the knight; it is</a>
<a id='line_2365'>fairer, said the knight, that we twain run more together with sharp</a>
<a id='line_2366'>spears. I will well, said Arthur, an I had any more spears. I have</a>
<a id='line_2367'>enow, said the knight; so there came a squire and brought two good</a>
<a id='line_2368'>spears, and Arthur chose one and he another; so they spurred their</a>
<a id='line_2369'>horses and came together with all their mights, that either brake their</a>
<a id='line_2370'>spears to their hands. Then Arthur set hand on his sword. Nay, said the</a>
<a id='line_2371'>knight, ye shall do better, ye are a passing good jouster as ever I met</a>
<a id='line_2372'>withal, and once for the love of the high order of knighthood let us</a>
<a id='line_2373'>joust once again. I assent me, said Arthur. Anon there were brought two</a>
<a id='line_2374'>great spears, and every knight gat a spear, and therewith they ran</a>
<a id='line_2375'>together that Arthur’s spear all to-shivered. But the other knight hit</a>
<a id='line_2376'>him so hard in midst of the shield, that horse and man fell to the</a>
<a id='line_2377'>earth, and therewith Arthur was eager, and pulled out his sword, and</a>
<a id='line_2378'>said, I will assay thee, sir knight, on foot, for I have lost the</a>
<a id='line_2379'>honour on horseback. I will be on horseback, said the knight. Then was</a>
<a id='line_2380'>Arthur wroth, and dressed his shield toward him with his sword drawn.</a>
<a id='line_2381'>When the knight saw that, he alighted, for him thought no worship to</a>
<a id='line_2382'>have a knight at such avail, he to be on horseback and he on foot, and</a>
<a id='line_2383'>so he alighted and dressed his shield unto Arthur. And there began a</a>
<a id='line_2384'>strong battle with many great strokes, and so hewed with their swords</a>
<a id='line_2385'>that the cantels flew in the fields, and much blood they bled both,</a>
<a id='line_2386'>that all the place there as they fought was overbled with blood, and</a>
<a id='line_2387'>thus they fought long and rested them, and then they went to the battle</a>
<a id='line_2388'>again, and so hurtled together like two rams that either fell to the</a>
<a id='line_2389'>earth. So at the last they smote together that both their swords met</a>
<a id='line_2390'>even together. But the sword of the knight smote King Arthur’s sword in</a>
<a id='line_2391'>two pieces, wherefore he was heavy. Then said the knight unto Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_2392'>Thou art in my daunger whether me list to save thee or slay thee, and</a>
<a id='line_2393'>but thou yield thee as overcome and recreant, thou shalt die. As for</a>
<a id='line_2394'>death, said King Arthur, welcome be it when it cometh, but to yield me</a>
<a id='line_2395'>unto thee as recreant I had liefer die than to be so shamed. And</a>
<a id='line_2396'>therewithal the king leapt unto Pellinore, and took him by the middle</a>
<a id='line_2397'>and threw him down, and raced off his helm. When the knight felt that</a>
<a id='line_2398'>he was adread, for he was a passing big man of might, and anon he</a>
<a id='line_2399'>brought Arthur under him, and raced off his helm and would have smitten</a>
<a id='line_2400'>off his head.</a>

<a id='line_2405'>on King Pellinore and made him to sleep.</a>
<a id='line_2406'></a>
<a id='line_2407'>Therewithal came Merlin and said, Knight, hold thy hand, for an thou</a>
<a id='line_2408'>slay that knight thou puttest this realm in the greatest damage that</a>
<a id='line_2409'>ever was realm: for this knight is a man of more worship than thou</a>
<a id='line_2410'>wotest of. Why, who is he? said the knight. It is King Arthur. Then</a>
<a id='line_2411'>would he have slain him for dread of his wrath, and heaved up his</a>
<a id='line_2412'>sword, and therewith Merlin cast an enchantment to the knight, that he</a>
<a id='line_2413'>fell to the earth in a great sleep. Then Merlin took up King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_2414'>and rode forth on the knight’s horse. Alas! said Arthur, what hast thou</a>
<a id='line_2415'>done, Merlin? hast thou slain this good knight by thy crafts? There</a>
<a id='line_2416'>liveth not so worshipful a knight as he was; I had liefer than the</a>
<a id='line_2417'>stint of my land a year that he were alive. Care ye not, said Merlin,</a>
<a id='line_2418'>for he is wholer than ye; for he is but asleep, and will awake within</a>
<a id='line_2419'>three hours. I told you, said Merlin, what a knight he was; here had ye</a>
<a id='line_2420'>been slain had I not been. Also there liveth not a bigger knight than</a>
<a id='line_2421'>he is one, and he shall hereafter do you right good service; and his</a>
<a id='line_2422'>name is Pellinore, and he shall have two sons that shall be passing</a>
<a id='line_2423'>good men; save one they shall have no fellow of prowess and of good</a>
<a id='line_2424'>living, and their names shall be Percivale of Wales and Lamerake of</a>
<a id='line_2425'>Wales, and he shall tell you the name of your own son, begotten of your</a>
<a id='line_2426'>sister, that shall be the destruction of all this realm.</a>

<a id='line_2430'>CHAPTER XXV. How Arthur by the mean of Merlin gat Excalibur his sword</a>
<a id='line_2431'>of the Lady of the Lake.</a>
<a id='line_2432'></a>
<a id='line_2433'>Right so the king and he departed, and went unto an hermit that was a</a>
<a id='line_2434'>good man and a great leech. So the hermit searched all his wounds and</a>
<a id='line_2435'>gave him good salves; so the king was there three days, and then were</a>
<a id='line_2436'>his wounds well amended that he might ride and go, and so departed. And</a>
<a id='line_2437'>as they rode, Arthur said, I have no sword. No force, said Merlin,</a>
<a id='line_2438'>hereby is a sword that shall be yours, an I may. So they rode till they</a>
<a id='line_2439'>came to a lake, the which was a fair water and broad, and in the midst</a>
<a id='line_2440'>of the lake Arthur was ware of an arm clothed in white samite, that</a>
<a id='line_2441'>held a fair sword in that hand. Lo! said Merlin, yonder is that sword</a>
<a id='line_2442'>that I spake of. With that they saw a damosel going upon the lake. What</a>
<a id='line_2443'>damosel is that? said Arthur. That is the Lady of the Lake, said</a>
<a id='line_2444'>Merlin; and within that lake is a rock, and therein is as fair a place</a>
<a id='line_2445'>as any on earth, and richly beseen; and this damosel will come to you</a>
<a id='line_2446'>anon, and then speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword.</a>
<a id='line_2447'>Anon withal came the damosel unto Arthur, and saluted him, and he her</a>
<a id='line_2448'>again. Damosel, said Arthur, what sword is that, that yonder the arm</a>
<a id='line_2449'>holdeth above the water? I would it were mine, for I have no sword. Sir</a>
<a id='line_2450'>Arthur, king, said the damosel, that sword is mine, and if ye will give</a>
<a id='line_2451'>me a gift when I ask it you, ye shall have it. By my faith, said</a>
<a id='line_2452'>Arthur, I will give you what gift ye will ask. Well! said the damosel,</a>
<a id='line_2453'>go ye into yonder barge, and row yourself to the sword, and take it and</a>
<a id='line_2454'>the scabbard with you, and I will ask my gift when I see my time. So</a>
<a id='line_2455'>Sir Arthur and Merlin alighted and tied their horses to two trees, and</a>
<a id='line_2456'>so they went into the ship, and when they came to the sword that the</a>
<a id='line_2457'>hand held, Sir Arthur took it up by the handles, and took it with him,</a>
<a id='line_2458'>and the arm and the hand went under the water. And so [they] came unto</a>
<a id='line_2459'>the land and rode forth, and then Sir Arthur saw a rich pavilion. What</a>
<a id='line_2460'>signifieth yonder pavilion? It is the knight’s pavilion, said Merlin,</a>
<a id='line_2461'>that ye fought with last, Sir Pellinore; but he is out, he is not</a>
<a id='line_2462'>there. He hath ado with a knight of yours that hight Egglame, and they</a>
<a id='line_2463'>have foughten together, but at the last Egglame fled, and else he had</a>
<a id='line_2464'>been dead, and he hath chased him even to Carlion, and we shall meet</a>
<a id='line_2465'>with him anon in the highway. That is well said, said Arthur, now have</a>
<a id='line_2466'>I a sword, now will I wage battle with him, and be avenged on him. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_2467'>you shall not so, said Merlin, for the knight is weary of fighting and</a>
<a id='line_2468'>chasing, so that ye shall have no worship to have ado with him; also he</a>
<a id='line_2469'>will not be lightly matched of one knight living, and therefore it is</a>
<a id='line_2470'>my counsel, let him pass, for he shall do you good service in short</a>
<a id='line_2471'>time, and his sons after his days. Also ye shall see that day in short</a>
<a id='line_2472'>space, you shall be right glad to give him your sister to wed. When I</a>
<a id='line_2473'>see him, I will do as ye advise, said Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_2474'></a>
<a id='line_2475'>Then Sir Arthur looked on the sword, and liked it passing well. Whether</a>
<a id='line_2476'>liketh you better, said Merlin, the sword or the scabbard? Me liketh</a>
<a id='line_2477'>better the sword, said Arthur. Ye are more unwise, said Merlin, for the</a>
<a id='line_2478'>scabbard is worth ten of the swords, for whiles ye have the scabbard</a>
<a id='line_2479'>upon you, ye shall never lose no blood, be ye never so sore wounded;</a>
<a id='line_2480'>therefore keep well the scabbard always with you. So they rode unto</a>
<a id='line_2481'>Carlion, and by the way they met with Sir Pellinore; but Merlin had</a>
<a id='line_2482'>done such a craft, that Pellinore saw not Arthur, and he passed by</a>
<a id='line_2483'>without any words. I marvel, said Arthur, that the knight would not</a>
<a id='line_2484'>speak. Sir, said Merlin, he saw you not, for an he had seen you, ye had</a>
<a id='line_2485'>not lightly departed. So they came unto Carlion, whereof his knights</a>
<a id='line_2486'>were passing glad. And when they heard of his adventures, they</a>
<a id='line_2487'>marvelled that he would jeopard his person so, alone. But all men of</a>
<a id='line_2488'>worship said it was merry to be under such a chieftain, that would put</a>
<a id='line_2489'>his person in adventure as other poor knights did.</a>

<a id='line_2492'></a>
<a id='line_2493'>CHAPTER XXVI. How tidings came to Arthur that King Rience had overcome</a>
<a id='line_2494'>eleven kings, and how he desired Arthur’s beard to trim his mantle.</a>
<a id='line_2495'></a>
<a id='line_2496'>This meanwhile came a messenger from King Rience of North Wales, and</a>
<a id='line_2497'>king he was of all Ireland, and of many isles. And this was his</a>
<a id='line_2498'>message, greeting well King Arthur in this manner wise, saying that</a>
<a id='line_2499'>King Rience had discomfited and overcome eleven kings, and everych of</a>
<a id='line_2500'>them did him homage, and that was this, they gave him their beards</a>
<a id='line_2501'>clean flayed off, as much as there was; wherefore the messenger came</a>
<a id='line_2502'>for King Arthur’s beard. For King Rience had purfled a mantle with</a>
<a id='line_2503'>kings’ beards, and there lacked one place of the mantle; wherefore he</a>
<a id='line_2504'>sent for his beard, or else he would enter into his lands, and burn and</a>
<a id='line_2505'>slay, and never leave till he have the head and the beard. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_2506'>Arthur, thou hast said thy message, the which is the most villainous</a>
<a id='line_2507'>and lewdest message that ever man heard sent unto a king; also thou</a>
<a id='line_2508'>mayest see my beard is full young yet to make a purfle of it. But tell</a>
<a id='line_2509'>thou thy king this: I owe him none homage, nor none of mine elders; but</a>
<a id='line_2510'>or it be long to, he shall do me homage on both his knees, or else he</a>
<a id='line_2511'>shall lose his head, by the faith of my body, for this is the most</a>
<a id='line_2512'>shamefulest message that ever I heard speak of. I have espied thy king</a>
<a id='line_2513'>met never yet with worshipful man, but tell him, I will have his head</a>
<a id='line_2514'>without he do me homage. Then the messenger departed.</a>
<a id='line_2515'></a>
<a id='line_2516'>Now is there any here, said Arthur, that knoweth King Rience? Then</a>
<a id='line_2517'>answered a knight that hight Naram, Sir, I know the king well; he is a</a>
<a id='line_2518'>passing good man of his body, as few be living, and a passing proud</a>
<a id='line_2519'>man, and Sir, doubt ye not he will make war on you with a mighty</a>
<a id='line_2520'>puissance. Well, said Arthur, I shall ordain for him in short time.</a>

<a id='line_2527'>Then King Arthur let send for all the children born on May-day,</a>
<a id='line_2528'>begotten of lords and born of ladies; for Merlin told King Arthur that</a>
<a id='line_2529'>he that should destroy him should be born on May-day, wherefore he sent</a>
<a id='line_2530'>for them all, upon pain of death; and so there were found many lords’</a>
<a id='line_2531'>sons, and all were sent unto the king, and so was Mordred sent by King</a>
<a id='line_2532'>Lot’s wife, and all were put in a ship to the sea, and some were four</a>
<a id='line_2533'>weeks old, and some less. And so by fortune the ship drave unto a</a>
<a id='line_2534'>castle, and was all to-riven, and destroyed the most part, save that</a>
<a id='line_2535'>Mordred was cast up, and a good man found him, and nourished him till</a>
<a id='line_2536'>he was fourteen year old, and then he brought him to the court, as it</a>
<a id='line_2537'>rehearseth afterward, toward the end of the Death of Arthur. So many</a>
<a id='line_2538'>lords and barons of this realm were displeased, for their children were</a>
<a id='line_2539'>so lost, and many put the wite on Merlin more than on Arthur; so what</a>
<a id='line_2540'>for dread and for love, they held their peace. But when the messenger</a>
<a id='line_2541'>came to King Rience, then was he wood out of measure, and purveyed him</a>

<a id='line_2554'>CHAPTER I. Of a damosel which came girt with a sword for to find a man</a>
<a id='line_2555'>of such virtue to draw it out of the scabbard.</a>
<a id='line_2556'></a>
<a id='line_2557'>After the death of Uther Pendragon reigned Arthur his son, the which</a>
<a id='line_2558'>had great war in his days for to get all England into his hand. For</a>
<a id='line_2559'>there were many kings within the realm of England, and in Wales,</a>
<a id='line_2560'>Scotland, and Cornwall. So it befell on a time when King Arthur was at</a>
<a id='line_2561'>London, there came a knight and told the king tidings how that the King</a>
<a id='line_2562'>Rience of North Wales had reared a great number of people, and were</a>
<a id='line_2563'>entered into the land, and burnt and slew the king’s true liege people.</a>
<a id='line_2564'>If this be true, said Arthur, it were great shame unto mine estate but</a>
<a id='line_2565'>that he were mightily withstood. It is truth, said the knight, for I</a>
<a id='line_2566'>saw the host myself. Well, said the king, let make a cry, that all the</a>
<a id='line_2567'>lords, knights, and gentlemen of arms, should draw unto a castle called</a>
<a id='line_2568'>Camelot in those days, and there the king would let make a</a>
<a id='line_2569'>council-general and a great jousts.</a>
<a id='line_2570'></a>
<a id='line_2571'>So when the king was come thither with all his baronage, and lodged as</a>
<a id='line_2572'>they seemed best, there was come a damosel the which was sent on</a>
<a id='line_2573'>message from the great lady Lile of Avelion. And when she came before</a>
<a id='line_2574'>King Arthur, she told from whom she came, and how she was sent on</a>
<a id='line_2575'>message unto him for these causes. Then she let her mantle fall that</a>
<a id='line_2576'>was richly furred; and then was she girt with a noble sword whereof the</a>
<a id='line_2577'>king had marvel, and said, Damosel, for what cause are ye girt with</a>
<a id='line_2578'>that sword? it beseemeth you not. Now shall I tell you, said the</a>
<a id='line_2579'>damosel; this sword that I am girt withal doth me great sorrow and</a>
<a id='line_2580'>cumbrance, for I may not be delivered of this sword but by a knight,</a>
<a id='line_2581'>but he must be a passing good man of his hands and of his deeds, and</a>
<a id='line_2582'>without villainy or treachery, and without treason. And if I may find</a>
<a id='line_2583'>such a knight that hath all these virtues, he may draw out this sword</a>
<a id='line_2584'>out of the sheath, for I have been at King Rience’s it was told me</a>
<a id='line_2585'>there were passing good knights, and he and all his knights have</a>
<a id='line_2586'>assayed it and none can speed. This is a great marvel, said Arthur, if</a>
<a id='line_2587'>this be sooth; I will myself assay to draw out the sword, not presuming</a>
<a id='line_2588'>upon myself that I am the best knight, but that I will begin to draw at</a>
<a id='line_2589'>your sword in giving example to all the barons that they shall assay</a>
<a id='line_2590'>everych one after other when I have assayed it. Then Arthur took the</a>
<a id='line_2591'>sword by the sheath and by the girdle and pulled at it eagerly, but the</a>
<a id='line_2592'>sword would not out.</a>
<a id='line_2593'></a>
<a id='line_2594'>Sir, said the damosel, you need not to pull half so hard, for he that</a>
<a id='line_2595'>shall pull it out shall do it with little might. Ye say well, said</a>
<a id='line_2596'>Arthur; now assay ye all my barons; but beware ye be not defiled with</a>
<a id='line_2597'>shame, treachery, nor guile. Then it will not avail, said the damosel,</a>
<a id='line_2598'>for he must be a clean knight without villainy, and of a gentle strain</a>
<a id='line_2599'>of father side and mother side. Most of all the barons of the Round</a>
<a id='line_2600'>Table that were there at that time assayed all by row, but there might</a>
<a id='line_2601'>none speed; wherefore the damosel made great sorrow out of measure, and</a>
<a id='line_2602'>said, Alas! I weened in this court had been the best knights without</a>
<a id='line_2603'>treachery or treason. By my faith, said Arthur, here are good knights,</a>
<a id='line_2604'>as I deem, as any be in the world, but their grace is not to help you,</a>
<a id='line_2605'>wherefore I am displeased.</a>

<a id='line_2613'>that had been prisoner with him half a year and more for slaying of a</a>
<a id='line_2614'>knight, the which was cousin unto King Arthur. The name of this knight</a>
<a id='line_2615'>was called Balin, and by good means of the barons he was delivered out</a>
<a id='line_2616'>of prison, for he was a good man named of his body, and he was born in</a>
<a id='line_2617'>Northumberland. And so he went privily into the court, and saw this</a>
<a id='line_2618'>adventure, whereof it raised his heart, and he would assay it as other</a>
<a id='line_2619'>knights did, but for he was poor and poorly arrayed he put him not far</a>
<a id='line_2620'>in press. But in his heart he was fully assured to do as well, if his</a>
<a id='line_2621'>grace happed him, as any knight that there was. And as the damosel took</a>
<a id='line_2622'>her leave of Arthur and of all the barons, so departing, this knight</a>
<a id='line_2623'>Balin called unto her, and said, Damosel, I pray you of your courtesy,</a>
<a id='line_2624'>suffer me as well to assay as these lords; though that I be so poorly</a>
<a id='line_2625'>clothed, in my heart meseemeth I am fully assured as some of these</a>
<a id='line_2626'>others, and meseemeth in my heart to speed right well. The damosel</a>
<a id='line_2627'>beheld the poor knight, and saw he was a likely man, but for his poor</a>
<a id='line_2628'>arrayment she thought he should be of no worship without villainy or</a>
<a id='line_2629'>treachery. And then she said unto the knight, Sir, it needeth not to</a>
<a id='line_2630'>put me to more pain or labour, for it seemeth not you to speed there as</a>
<a id='line_2631'>other have failed. Ah! fair damosel, said Balin, worthiness, and good</a>
<a id='line_2632'>tatches, and good deeds, are not only in arrayment, but manhood and</a>
<a id='line_2633'>worship is hid within man’s person, and many a worshipful knight is not</a>
<a id='line_2634'>known unto all people, and therefore worship and hardiness is not in</a>
<a id='line_2635'>arrayment. By God, said the damosel, ye say sooth; therefore ye shall</a>
<a id='line_2636'>assay to do what ye may. Then Balin took the sword by the girdle and</a>
<a id='line_2637'>sheath, and drew it out easily; and when he looked on the sword it</a>
<a id='line_2638'>pleased him much. Then had the king and all the barons great marvel</a>
<a id='line_2639'>that Balin had done that adventure, and many knights had great despite</a>
<a id='line_2640'>of Balin. Certes, said the damosel, this is a passing good knight, and</a>
<a id='line_2641'>the best that ever I found, and most of worship without treason,</a>
<a id='line_2642'>treachery, or villainy, and many marvels shall he do. Now, gentle and</a>
<a id='line_2643'>courteous knight, give me the sword again. Nay, said Balin, for this</a>
<a id='line_2644'>sword will I keep, but it be taken from me with force. Well, said the</a>
<a id='line_2645'>damosel, ye are not wise to keep the sword from me, for ye shall slay</a>
<a id='line_2646'>with the sword the best friend that ye have, and the man that ye most</a>
<a id='line_2647'>love in the world, and the sword shall be your destruction. I shall</a>
<a id='line_2648'>take the adventure, said Balin, that God will ordain me, but the sword</a>
<a id='line_2649'>ye shall not have at this time, by the faith of my body. Ye shall</a>
<a id='line_2650'>repent it within short time, said the damosel, for I would have the</a>
<a id='line_2651'>sword more for your avail than for mine, for I am passing heavy for</a>
<a id='line_2652'>your sake; for ye will not believe that sword shall be your</a>
<a id='line_2653'>destruction, and that is great pity. With that the damosel departed,</a>
<a id='line_2654'>making great sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_2655'></a>
<a id='line_2656'>Anon after, Balin sent for his horse and armour, and so would depart</a>
<a id='line_2657'>from the court, and took his leave of King Arthur. Nay, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_2658'>I suppose ye will not depart so lightly from this fellowship, I suppose</a>
<a id='line_2659'>ye are displeased that I have shewed you unkindness; blame me the less,</a>
<a id='line_2660'>for I was misinformed against you, but I weened ye had not been such a</a>
<a id='line_2661'>knight as ye are, of worship and prowess, and if ye will abide in this</a>
<a id='line_2662'>court among my fellowship, I shall so advance you as ye shall be</a>
<a id='line_2663'>pleased. God thank your highness, said Balin, your bounty and highness</a>
<a id='line_2664'>may no man praise half to the value; but at this time I must needs</a>
<a id='line_2665'>depart, beseeching you alway of your good grace. Truly, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_2666'>I am right wroth for your departing; I pray you, fair knight, that ye</a>
<a id='line_2667'>tarry not long, and ye shall be right welcome to me, and to my barons,</a>
<a id='line_2668'>and I shall amend all miss that I have done against you; God thank your</a>
<a id='line_2669'>great lordship, said Balin, and therewith made him ready to depart.</a>
<a id='line_2670'>Then the most part of the knights of the Round Table said that Balin</a>
<a id='line_2671'>did not this adventure all only by might, but by witchcraft.</a>

<a id='line_2674'></a>
<a id='line_2675'>CHAPTER III. How the Lady of the Lake demanded the knight’s head that</a>
<a id='line_2676'>had won the sword, or the maiden’s head.</a>
<a id='line_2677'></a>
<a id='line_2678'>The meanwhile, that this knight was making him ready to depart, there</a>
<a id='line_2679'>came into the court a lady that hight the Lady of the Lake. And she</a>
<a id='line_2680'>came on horseback, richly beseen, and saluted King Arthur, and there</a>
<a id='line_2681'>asked him a gift that he promised her when she gave him the sword. That</a>
<a id='line_2682'>is sooth, said Arthur, a gift I promised you, but I have forgotten the</a>
<a id='line_2683'>name of my sword that ye gave me. The name of it, said the lady, is</a>
<a id='line_2684'>Excalibur, that is as much to say as Cut-steel. Ye say well, said the</a>
<a id='line_2685'>king; ask what ye will and ye shall have it, an it lie in my power to</a>
<a id='line_2686'>give it. Well, said the lady, I ask the head of the knight that hath</a>
<a id='line_2687'>won the sword, or else the damosel’s head that brought it; I take no</a>
<a id='line_2688'>force though I have both their heads, for he slew my brother, a good</a>
<a id='line_2689'>knight and a true, and that gentlewoman was causer of my father’s</a>
<a id='line_2690'>death. Truly, said King Arthur, I may not grant neither of their heads</a>
<a id='line_2691'>with my worship, therefore ask what ye will else, and I shall fulfil</a>
<a id='line_2692'>your desire. I will ask none other thing, said the lady. When Balin was</a>
<a id='line_2693'>ready to depart, he saw the Lady of the Lake, that by her means had</a>
<a id='line_2694'>slain Balin’s mother, and he had sought her three years; and when it</a>
<a id='line_2695'>was told him that she asked his head of King Arthur, he went to her</a>
<a id='line_2696'>straight and said, Evil be you found; ye would have my head, and</a>
<a id='line_2697'>therefore ye shall lose yours, and with his sword lightly he smote off</a>
<a id='line_2698'>her head before King Arthur. Alas, for shame! said Arthur, why have ye</a>
<a id='line_2699'>done so? ye have shamed me and all my court, for this was a lady that I</a>
<a id='line_2700'>was beholden to, and hither she came under my safe-conduct; I shall</a>
<a id='line_2701'>never forgive you that trespass. Sir, said Balin, me forthinketh of</a>
<a id='line_2702'>your displeasure, for this same lady was the untruest lady living, and</a>
<a id='line_2703'>by enchantment and sorcery she hath been the destroyer of many good</a>
<a id='line_2704'>knights, and she was causer that my mother was burnt, through her</a>
<a id='line_2705'>falsehood and treachery. What cause soever ye had, said Arthur, ye</a>
<a id='line_2706'>should have forborne her in my presence; therefore, think not the</a>
<a id='line_2707'>contrary, ye shall repent it, for such another despite had I never in</a>
<a id='line_2708'>my court; therefore withdraw you out of my court in all haste ye may.</a>
<a id='line_2709'></a>
<a id='line_2710'>Then Balin took up the head of the lady, and bare it with him to his</a>
<a id='line_2711'>hostelry, and there he met with his squire, that was sorry he had</a>
<a id='line_2712'>displeased King Arthur and so they rode forth out of the town. Now,</a>
<a id='line_2713'>said Balin, we must depart, take thou this head and bear it to my</a>
<a id='line_2714'>friends, and tell them how I have sped, and tell my friends in</a>
<a id='line_2715'>Northumberland that my most foe is dead. Also tell them how I am out of</a>
<a id='line_2716'>prison, and what adventure befell me at the getting of this sword.</a>
<a id='line_2717'>Alas! said the squire, ye are greatly to blame for to displease King</a>
<a id='line_2718'>Arthur. As for that, said Balin, I will hie me, in all the haste that I</a>
<a id='line_2719'>may, to meet with King Rience and destroy him, either else to die</a>
<a id='line_2720'>therefore; and if it may hap me to win him, then will King Arthur be my</a>
<a id='line_2721'>good and gracious lord. Where shall I meet with you? said the squire.</a>
<a id='line_2722'>In King Arthur’s court, said Balin. So his squire and he departed at</a>
<a id='line_2723'>that time. Then King Arthur and all the court made great dole and had</a>
<a id='line_2724'>shame of the death of the Lady of the Lake. Then the king buried her</a>
<a id='line_2725'>richly.</a>

<a id='line_2729'>CHAPTER IV. How Merlin told the adventure of this damosel.</a>
<a id='line_2730'></a>
<a id='line_2731'>At that time there was a knight, the which was the king’s son of</a>
<a id='line_2732'>Ireland, and his name was Lanceor, the which was an orgulous knight,</a>
<a id='line_2733'>and counted himself one of the best of the court; and he had great</a>
<a id='line_2734'>despite at Balin for the achieving of the sword, that any should be</a>
<a id='line_2735'>accounted more hardy, or more of prowess; and he asked King Arthur if</a>
<a id='line_2736'>he would give him leave to ride after Balin and to revenge the despite</a>
<a id='line_2737'>that he had done. Do your best, said Arthur, I am right wroth with</a>
<a id='line_2738'>Balin; I would he were quit of the despite that he hath done to me and</a>
<a id='line_2739'>to my court. Then this Lanceor went to his hostelry to make him ready.</a>
<a id='line_2740'>In the meanwhile came Merlin unto the court of King Arthur, and there</a>
<a id='line_2741'>was told him the adventure of the sword, and the death of the Lady of</a>
<a id='line_2742'>the Lake. Now shall I say you, said Merlin; this same damosel that here</a>
<a id='line_2743'>standeth, that brought the sword unto your court, I shall tell you the</a>
<a id='line_2744'>cause of her coming: she was the falsest damosel that liveth. Say not</a>
<a id='line_2745'>so, said they. She hath a brother, a passing good knight of prowess and</a>
<a id='line_2746'>a full true man; and this damosel loved another knight that held her to</a>
<a id='line_2747'>paramour, and this good knight her brother met with the knight that</a>
<a id='line_2748'>held her to paramour, and slew him by force of his hands. When this</a>
<a id='line_2749'>false damosel understood this, she went to the Lady Lile of Avelion,</a>
<a id='line_2750'>and besought her of help, to be avenged on her own brother.</a>
<a id='line_2751'></a>
<a id='line_2752'></a>
<a id='line_2753'></a>
<a id='line_2754'>CHAPTER V. How Balin was pursued by Sir Lanceor, knight of Ireland, and</a>
<a id='line_2755'>how he jousted and slew him.</a>
<a id='line_2756'></a>
<a id='line_2757'>And so this Lady Lile of Avelion took her this sword that she brought</a>
<a id='line_2758'>with her, and told there should no man pull it out of the sheath but if</a>
<a id='line_2759'>he be one of the best knights of this realm, and he should be hard and</a>
<a id='line_2760'>full of prowess, and with that sword he should slay her brother. This</a>
<a id='line_2761'>was the cause that the damosel came into this court. I know it as well</a>
<a id='line_2762'>as ye. Would God she had not come into this court, but she came never</a>
<a id='line_2763'>in fellowship of worship to do good, but always great harm; and that</a>
<a id='line_2764'>knight that hath achieved the sword shall be destroyed by that sword,</a>
<a id='line_2765'>for the which will be great damage, for there liveth not a knight of</a>
<a id='line_2766'>more prowess than he is, and he shall do unto you, my Lord Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_2767'>great honour and kindness; and it is great pity he shall not endure but</a>
<a id='line_2768'>a while, for of his strength and hardiness I know not his match living.</a>
<a id='line_2769'></a>
<a id='line_2770'>So the knight of Ireland armed him at all points, and dressed his</a>
<a id='line_2771'>shield on his shoulder, and mounted upon horseback, and took his spear</a>
<a id='line_2772'>in his hand, and rode after a great pace, as much as his horse might</a>
<a id='line_2773'>go; and within a little space on a mountain he had a sight of Balin,</a>
<a id='line_2774'>and with a loud voice he cried, Abide, knight, for ye shall abide</a>
<a id='line_2775'>whether ye will or nill, and the shield that is to-fore you shall not</a>
<a id='line_2776'>help. When Balin heard the noise, he turned his horse fiercely, and</a>
<a id='line_2777'>said, Fair knight, what will ye with me, will ye joust with me? Yea,</a>
<a id='line_2778'>said the Irish knight, therefore come I after you. Peradventure, said</a>
<a id='line_2779'>Balin, it had been better to have holden you at home, for many a man</a>
<a id='line_2780'>weeneth to put his enemy to a rebuke, and oft it falleth to himself. Of</a>
<a id='line_2781'>what court be ye sent from? said Balin. I am come from the court of</a>
<a id='line_2782'>King Arthur, said the knight of Ireland, that come hither for to</a>
<a id='line_2783'>revenge the despite ye did this day to King Arthur and to his court.</a>
<a id='line_2784'>Well, said Balin, I see well I must have ado with you, that me</a>
<a id='line_2785'>forthinketh for to grieve King Arthur, or any of his court; and your</a>
<a id='line_2786'>quarrel is full simple, said Balin, unto me, for the lady that is dead,</a>
<a id='line_2787'>did me great damage, and else would I have been loath as any knight</a>
<a id='line_2788'>that liveth for to slay a lady. Make you ready, said the knight</a>
<a id='line_2789'>Lanceor, and dress you unto me, for that one shall abide in the field.</a>
<a id='line_2790'>Then they took their spears, and came together as much as their horses</a>
<a id='line_2791'>might drive, and the Irish knight smote Balin on the shield, that all</a>
<a id='line_2792'>went shivers off his spear, and Balin hit him through the shield, and</a>
<a id='line_2793'>the hauberk perished, and so pierced through his body and the horse’s</a>
<a id='line_2794'>croup, and anon turned his horse fiercely, and drew out his sword, and</a>
<a id='line_2795'>wist not that he had slain him; and then he saw him lie as a dead</a>
<a id='line_2796'>corpse.</a>

<a id='line_2799'></a>
<a id='line_2800'>CHAPTER VI. How a damosel, which was love to Lanceor, slew herself for</a>
<a id='line_2801'>love, and how Balin met with his brother Balan.</a>
<a id='line_2802'></a>
<a id='line_2803'>Then he looked by him, and was ware of a damosel that came riding full</a>
<a id='line_2804'>fast as the horse might ride, on a fair palfrey. And when she espied</a>
<a id='line_2805'>that Lanceor was slain, she made sorrow out of measure, and said, O</a>
<a id='line_2806'>Balin, two bodies thou hast slain and one heart, and two hearts in one</a>
<a id='line_2807'>body, and two souls thou hast lost. And therewith she took the sword</a>
<a id='line_2808'>from her love that lay dead, and fell to the ground in a swoon. And</a>
<a id='line_2809'>when she arose she made great dole out of measure, the which sorrow</a>
<a id='line_2810'>grieved Balin passingly sore, and he went unto her for to have taken</a>
<a id='line_2811'>the sword out of her hand, but she held it so fast he might not take it</a>
<a id='line_2812'>out of her hand unless he should have hurt her, and suddenly she set</a>
<a id='line_2813'>the pommel to the ground, and rove herself through the body. When Balin</a>
<a id='line_2814'>espied her deeds, he was passing heavy in his heart, and ashamed that</a>
<a id='line_2815'>so fair a damosel had destroyed herself for the love of his death.</a>
<a id='line_2816'>Alas, said Balin, me repenteth sore the death of this knight, for the</a>
<a id='line_2817'>love of this damosel, for there was much true love betwixt them both,</a>
<a id='line_2818'>and for sorrow might not longer behold him, but turned his horse and</a>
<a id='line_2819'>looked toward a great forest, and there he was ware, by the arms, of</a>
<a id='line_2820'>his brother Balan. And when they were met they put off their helms and</a>
<a id='line_2821'>kissed together, and wept for joy and pity. Then Balan said, I little</a>
<a id='line_2822'>weened to have met with you at this sudden adventure; I am right glad</a>
<a id='line_2823'>of your deliverance out of your dolorous prisonment, for a man told me,</a>
<a id='line_2824'>in the castle of Four Stones, that ye were delivered, and that man had</a>
<a id='line_2825'>seen you in the court of King Arthur, and therefore I came hither into</a>
<a id='line_2826'>this country, for here I supposed to find you. Anon the knight Balin</a>
<a id='line_2827'>told his brother of his adventure of the sword, and of the death of the</a>
<a id='line_2828'>Lady of the Lake, and how King Arthur was displeased with him.</a>
<a id='line_2829'>Wherefore he sent this knight after me, that lieth here dead, and the</a>
<a id='line_2830'>death of this damosel grieveth me sore. So doth it me, said Balan, but</a>
<a id='line_2831'>ye must take the adventure that God will ordain you. Truly, said Balin,</a>
<a id='line_2832'>I am right heavy that my Lord Arthur is displeased with me, for he is</a>
<a id='line_2833'>the most worshipful knight that reigneth now on earth, and his love</a>
<a id='line_2834'>will I get or else will I put my life in adventure. For the King Rience</a>
<a id='line_2835'>lieth at a siege at the Castle Terrabil, and thither will we draw in</a>
<a id='line_2836'>all haste, to prove our worship and prowess upon him. I will well, said</a>
<a id='line_2837'>Balan, that we do, and we will help each other as brethren ought to do.</a>

<a id='line_2842'>how King Mark of Cornwall found them, and made a tomb over them.</a>
<a id='line_2843'></a>
<a id='line_2844'>Now go we hence, said Balin, and well be we met. The meanwhile as they</a>
<a id='line_2845'>talked, there came a dwarf from the city of Camelot on horseback, as</a>
<a id='line_2846'>much as he might; and found the dead bodies, wherefore he made great</a>
<a id='line_2847'>dole, and pulled out his hair for sorrow, and said, Which of you</a>
<a id='line_2848'>knights have done this deed? Whereby askest thou it? said Balan. For I</a>
<a id='line_2849'>would wit it, said the dwarf. It was I, said Balin, that slew this</a>
<a id='line_2850'>knight in my defence, for hither he came to chase me, and either I must</a>
<a id='line_2851'>slay him or he me; and this damosel slew herself for his love, which</a>
<a id='line_2852'>repenteth me, and for her sake I shall owe all women the better love.</a>
<a id='line_2853'>Alas, said the dwarf, thou hast done great damage unto thyself, for</a>
<a id='line_2854'>this knight that is here dead was one of the most valiantest men that</a>
<a id='line_2855'>lived, and trust well, Balin, the kin of this knight will chase you</a>
<a id='line_2856'>through the world till they have slain you. As for that, said Balin, I</a>
<a id='line_2857'>fear not greatly, but I am right heavy that I have displeased my lord</a>
<a id='line_2858'>King Arthur, for the death of this knight. So as they talked together,</a>
<a id='line_2859'>there came a king of Cornwall riding, the which hight King Mark. And</a>
<a id='line_2860'>when he saw these two bodies dead, and understood how they were dead,</a>
<a id='line_2861'>by the two knights above said, then made the king great sorrow for the</a>
<a id='line_2862'>true love that was betwixt them, and said, I will not depart till I</a>
<a id='line_2863'>have on this earth made a tomb, and there he pight his pavilions and</a>
<a id='line_2864'>sought through all the country to find a tomb, and in a church they</a>
<a id='line_2865'>found one was fair and rich, and then the king let put them both in the</a>
<a id='line_2866'>earth, and put the tomb upon them, and wrote the names of them both on</a>
<a id='line_2867'>the tomb. How here lieth Lanceor the king’s son of Ireland, that at his</a>
<a id='line_2868'>own request was slain by the hands of Balin; and how his lady, Colombe,</a>
<a id='line_2869'>and paramour, slew herself with her love’s sword for dole and sorrow.</a>

<a id='line_2880'>wrote their names upon the tomb with letters of gold that should fight</a>
<a id='line_2881'>in that place, whose names were Launcelot de Lake, and Tristram. Thou</a>
<a id='line_2882'>art a marvellous man, said King Mark unto Merlin, that speakest of such</a>
<a id='line_2883'>marvels, thou art a boistous man and an unlikely to tell of such deeds.</a>
<a id='line_2884'>What is thy name? said King Mark. At this time, said Merlin, I will not</a>
<a id='line_2885'>tell, but at that time when Sir Tristram is taken with his sovereign</a>
<a id='line_2886'>lady, then ye shall hear and know my name, and at that time ye shall</a>
<a id='line_2887'>hear tidings that shall not please you. Then said Merlin to Balin, Thou</a>
<a id='line_2888'>hast done thyself great hurt, because that thou savest not this lady</a>
<a id='line_2889'>that slew herself, that might have saved her an thou wouldest. By the</a>
<a id='line_2890'>faith of my body, said Balin, I might not save her, for she slew</a>
<a id='line_2891'>herself suddenly. Me repenteth, said Merlin; because of the death of</a>
<a id='line_2892'>that lady thou shalt strike a stroke most dolorous that ever man</a>
<a id='line_2893'>struck, except the stroke of our Lord, for thou shalt hurt the truest</a>
<a id='line_2894'>knight and the man of most worship that now liveth, and through that</a>
<a id='line_2895'>stroke three kingdoms shall be in great poverty, misery and</a>
<a id='line_2896'>wretchedness twelve years, and the knight shall not be whole of that</a>
<a id='line_2897'>wound for many years. Then Merlin took his leave of Balin. And Balin</a>
<a id='line_2898'>said, If I wist it were sooth that ye say I should do such a perilous</a>
<a id='line_2899'>deed as that, I would slay myself to make thee a liar. Therewith Merlin</a>
<a id='line_2900'>vanished away suddenly. And then Balan and his brother took their leave</a>
<a id='line_2901'>of King Mark. First, said the king, tell me your name. Sir, said Balan,</a>
<a id='line_2902'>ye may see he beareth two swords, thereby ye may call him the Knight</a>
<a id='line_2903'>with the Two Swords. And so departed King Mark unto Camelot to King</a>
<a id='line_2904'>Arthur, and Balin took the way toward King Rience; and as they rode</a>
<a id='line_2905'>together they met with Merlin disguised, but they knew him not. Whither</a>
<a id='line_2906'>ride you? said Merlin. We have little to do, said the two knights, to</a>
<a id='line_2907'>tell thee. But what is thy name? said Balin. At this time, said Merlin,</a>
<a id='line_2908'>I will not tell it thee. It is evil seen, said the knights, that thou</a>
<a id='line_2909'>art a true man that thou wilt not tell thy name. As for that, said</a>
<a id='line_2910'>Merlin, be it as it be may, I can tell you wherefore ye ride this way,</a>
<a id='line_2911'>for to meet King Rience; but it will not avail you without ye have my</a>
<a id='line_2912'>counsel. Ah! said Balin, ye are Merlin; we will be ruled by your</a>
<a id='line_2913'>counsel. Come on, said Merlin, ye shall have great worship, and look</a>
<a id='line_2914'>that ye do knightly, for ye shall have great need. As for that, said</a>
<a id='line_2915'>Balin, dread you not, we will do what we may.</a>
<a id='line_2916'></a>
<a id='line_2917'></a>
<a id='line_2918'></a>
<a id='line_2919'>CHAPTER IX. How Balin and his brother, by the counsel of Merlin, took</a>
<a id='line_2920'>King Rience and brought him to King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_2921'></a>
<a id='line_2922'>Then Merlin lodged them in a wood among leaves beside the highway, and</a>
<a id='line_2923'>took off the bridles of their horses and put them to grass and laid</a>
<a id='line_2924'>them down to rest them till it was nigh midnight. Then Merlin bade them</a>
<a id='line_2925'>rise, and make them ready, for the king was nigh them, that was stolen</a>
<a id='line_2926'>away from his host with a three score horses of his best knights, and</a>
<a id='line_2927'>twenty of them rode to-fore to warn the Lady de Vance that the king was</a>
<a id='line_2928'>coming; for that night King Rience should have lain with her. Which is</a>
<a id='line_2929'>the king? said Balin. Abide, said Merlin, here in a strait way ye shall</a>
<a id='line_2930'>meet with him; and therewith he showed Balin and his brother where he</a>
<a id='line_2931'>rode.</a>
<a id='line_2932'></a>
<a id='line_2933'>Anon Balin and his brother met with the king, and smote him down, and</a>
<a id='line_2934'>wounded him fiercely, and laid him to the ground; and there they slew</a>
<a id='line_2935'>on the right hand and the left hand, and slew more than forty of his</a>
<a id='line_2936'>men, and the remnant fled. Then went they again to King Rience and</a>
<a id='line_2937'>would have slain him had he not yielded him unto their grace. Then said</a>
<a id='line_2938'>he thus: Knights full of prowess, slay me not, for by my life ye may</a>
<a id='line_2939'>win, and by my death ye shall win nothing. Then said these two knights,</a>
<a id='line_2940'>Ye say sooth and truth, and so laid him on a horse-litter. With that</a>
<a id='line_2941'>Merlin was vanished, and came to King Arthur aforehand, and told him</a>
<a id='line_2942'>how his most enemy was taken and discomfited. By whom? said King</a>
<a id='line_2943'>Arthur. By two knights, said Merlin, that would please your lordship,</a>
<a id='line_2944'>and to-morrow ye shall know what knights they are. Anon after came the</a>
<a id='line_2945'>Knight with the Two Swords and Balan his brother, and brought with them</a>
<a id='line_2946'>King Rience of North Wales, and there delivered him to the porters, and</a>
<a id='line_2947'>charged them with him; and so they two returned again in the dawning of</a>
<a id='line_2948'>the day. King Arthur came then to King Rience, and said, Sir king, ye</a>
<a id='line_2949'>are welcome: by what adventure come ye hither? Sir, said King Rience, I</a>
<a id='line_2950'>came hither by an hard adventure. Who won you? said King Arthur. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_2951'>said the king, the Knight with the Two Swords and his brother, which</a>
<a id='line_2952'>are two marvellous knights of prowess. I know them not, said Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_2953'>but much I am beholden to them. Ah, said Merlin, I shall tell you: it</a>
<a id='line_2954'>is Balin that achieved the sword, and his brother Balan, a good knight,</a>
<a id='line_2955'>there liveth not a better of prowess and of worthiness, and it shall be</a>
<a id='line_2956'>the greatest dole of him that ever I knew of knight, for he shall not</a>
<a id='line_2957'>long endure. Alas, said King Arthur, that is great pity; for I am much</a>
<a id='line_2958'>beholden unto him, and I have ill deserved it unto him for his</a>
<a id='line_2959'>kindness. Nay, said Merlin, he shall do much more for you, and that</a>
<a id='line_2960'>shall ye know in haste. But, sir, are ye purveyed, said Merlin, for</a>
<a id='line_2961'>to-morn the host of Nero, King Rience’s brother, will set on you or</a>
<a id='line_2962'>noon with a great host, and therefore make you ready, for I will depart</a>
<a id='line_2963'>from you.</a>
<a id='line_2964'></a>
<a id='line_2965'></a>
<a id='line_2966'></a>
<a id='line_2967'>CHAPTER X. How King Arthur had a battle against Nero and King Lot of</a>
<a id='line_2968'>Orkney, and how King Lot was deceived by Merlin, and how twelve kings</a>
<a id='line_2969'>were slain.</a>
<a id='line_2970'></a>
<a id='line_2971'>Then King Arthur made ready his host in ten battles and Nero was ready</a>
<a id='line_2972'>in the field afore the Castle Terrabil with a great host, and he had</a>
<a id='line_2973'>ten battles, with many more people than Arthur had. Then Nero had the</a>
<a id='line_2974'>vanguard with the most part of his people, and Merlin came to King Lot</a>
<a id='line_2975'>of the Isle of Orkney, and held him with a tale of prophecy, till Nero</a>
<a id='line_2976'>and his people were destroyed. And there Sir Kay the seneschal did</a>
<a id='line_2977'>passingly well, that the days of his life the worship went never from</a>
<a id='line_2978'>him; and Sir Hervis de Revel did marvellous deeds with King Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_2979'>King Arthur slew that day twenty knights and maimed forty. At that time</a>
<a id='line_2980'>came in the Knight with the Two Swords and his brother Balan, but they</a>
<a id='line_2981'>two did so marvellously that the king and all the knights marvelled of</a>
<a id='line_2982'>them, and all they that beheld them said they were sent from heaven as</a>
<a id='line_2983'>angels, or devils from hell; and King Arthur said himself they were the</a>
<a id='line_2984'>best knights that ever he saw, for they gave such strokes that all men</a>
<a id='line_2985'>had wonder of them.</a>
<a id='line_2986'></a>
<a id='line_2987'>In the meanwhile came one to King Lot, and told him while he tarried</a>
<a id='line_2988'>there Nero was destroyed and slain with all his people. Alas, said King</a>
<a id='line_2989'>Lot, I am ashamed, for by my default there is many a worshipful man</a>
<a id='line_2990'>slain, for an we had been together there had been none host under the</a>
<a id='line_2991'>heaven that had been able for to have matched with us; this faiter with</a>
<a id='line_2992'>his prophecy hath mocked me. All that did Merlin, for he knew well that</a>
<a id='line_2993'>an King Lot had been with his body there at the first battle, King</a>
<a id='line_2994'>Arthur had been slain, and all his people destroyed; and well Merlin</a>
<a id='line_2995'>knew that one of the kings should be dead that day, and loath was</a>
<a id='line_2996'>Merlin that any of them both should be slain; but of the twain, he had</a>
<a id='line_2997'>liefer King Lot had been slain than King Arthur. Now what is best to</a>
<a id='line_2998'>do? said King Lot of Orkney; whether is me better to treat with King</a>
<a id='line_2999'>Arthur or to fight, for the greater part of our people are slain and</a>
<a id='line_3000'>destroyed? Sir, said a knight, set on Arthur for they are weary and</a>
<a id='line_3001'>forfoughten and we be fresh. As for me, said King Lot, I would every</a>
<a id='line_3002'>knight would do his part as I would do mine. And then they advanced</a>
<a id='line_3003'>banners and smote together and all to-shivered their spears; and</a>
<a id='line_3004'>Arthur’s knights, with the help of the Knight with the Two Swords and</a>
<a id='line_3005'>his brother Balan put King Lot and his host to the worse. But always</a>
<a id='line_3006'>King Lot held him in the foremost front, and did marvellous deeds of</a>
<a id='line_3007'>arms, for all his host was borne up by his hands, for he abode all</a>
<a id='line_3008'>knights. Alas he might not endure, the which was great pity, that so</a>
<a id='line_3009'>worthy a knight as he was one should be overmatched, that of late time</a>
<a id='line_3010'>afore had been a knight of King Arthur’s, and wedded the sister of King</a>
<a id='line_3011'>Arthur; and for King Arthur lay by King Lot’s wife, the which was</a>
<a id='line_3012'>Arthur’s sister, and gat on her Mordred, therefore King Lot held</a>
<a id='line_3013'>against Arthur. So there was a knight that was called the Knight with</a>
<a id='line_3014'>the Strange Beast, and at that time his right name was called</a>
<a id='line_3015'>Pellinore, the which was a good man of prowess, and he smote a mighty</a>
<a id='line_3016'>stroke at King Lot as he fought with all his enemies, and he failed of</a>
<a id='line_3017'>his stroke, and smote the horse’s neck, that he fell to the ground with</a>
<a id='line_3018'>King Lot. And therewith anon Pellinore smote him a great stroke through</a>
<a id='line_3019'>the helm and head unto the brows. And then all the host of Orkney fled</a>
<a id='line_3020'>for the death of King Lot, and there were slain many mothers’ sons. But</a>
<a id='line_3021'>King Pellinore bare the wite of the death of King Lot, wherefore Sir</a>
<a id='line_3022'>Gawaine revenged the death of his father the tenth year after he was</a>
<a id='line_3023'>made knight, and slew King Pellinore with his own hands. Also there</a>
<a id='line_3024'>were slain at that battle twelve kings on the side of King Lot with</a>
<a id='line_3025'>Nero, and all were buried in the Church of Saint Stephen’s in Camelot,</a>
<a id='line_3026'>and the remnant of knights and of others were buried in a great rock.</a>
<a id='line_3027'></a>
<a id='line_3028'></a>
<a id='line_3029'></a>
<a id='line_3030'>CHAPTER XI. Of the interment of twelve kings, and of the prophecy of</a>
<a id='line_3031'>Merlin, and how Balin should give the dolorous stroke.</a>
<a id='line_3032'></a>
<a id='line_3033'>So at the interment came King Lot’s wife Margawse with her four sons,</a>
<a id='line_3034'>Gawaine, Agravaine, Gaheris, and Gareth. Also there came thither King</a>
<a id='line_3035'>Uriens, Sir Ewaine’s father, and Morgan le Fay his wife that was King</a>
<a id='line_3036'>Arthur’s sister. All these came to the interment. But of all these</a>
<a id='line_3037'>twelve kings King Arthur let make the tomb of King Lot passing richly,</a>
<a id='line_3038'>and made his tomb by his own; and then Arthur let make twelve images of</a>
<a id='line_3039'>latten and copper, and over-gilt it with gold, in the sign of twelve</a>
<a id='line_3040'>kings, and each one of them held a taper of wax that burnt day and</a>
<a id='line_3041'>night; and King Arthur was made in sign of a figure standing above them</a>
<a id='line_3042'>with a sword drawn in his hand, and all the twelve figures had</a>
<a id='line_3043'>countenance like unto men that were overcome. All this made Merlin by</a>
<a id='line_3044'>his subtle craft, and there he told the king, When I am dead these</a>
<a id='line_3045'>tapers shall burn no longer, and soon after the adventures of the</a>
<a id='line_3046'>Sangreal shall come among you and be achieved. Also he told Arthur how</a>
<a id='line_3047'>Balin the worshipful knight shall give the dolorous stroke, whereof</a>
<a id='line_3048'>shall fall great vengeance. Oh, where is Balin and Balan and Pellinore?</a>
<a id='line_3049'>said King Arthur. As for Pellinore, said Merlin, he will meet with you</a>
<a id='line_3050'>soon; and as for Balin he will not be long from you; but the other</a>
<a id='line_3051'>brother will depart, ye shall see him no more. By my faith, said</a>
<a id='line_3052'>Arthur, they are two marvellous knights, and namely Balin passeth of</a>
<a id='line_3053'>prowess of any knight that ever I found, for much beholden am I unto</a>
<a id='line_3054'>him; would God he would abide with me. Sir, said Merlin, look ye keep</a>
<a id='line_3055'>well the scabbard of Excalibur, for ye shall lose no blood while ye</a>
<a id='line_3056'>have the scabbard upon you, though ye have as many wounds upon you as</a>
<a id='line_3057'>ye may have. So after, for great trust, Arthur betook the scabbard to</a>
<a id='line_3058'>Morgan le Fay his sister, and she loved another knight better than her</a>
<a id='line_3059'>husband King Uriens or King Arthur, and she would have had Arthur her</a>
<a id='line_3060'>brother slain, and therefore she let make another scabbard like it by</a>
<a id='line_3061'>enchantment, and gave the scabbard Excalibur to her love; and the</a>
<a id='line_3062'>knight’s name was called Accolon, that after had near slain King</a>
<a id='line_3063'>Arthur. After this Merlin told unto King Arthur of the prophecy that</a>
<a id='line_3064'>there should be a great battle beside Salisbury, and Mordred his own</a>
<a id='line_3065'>son should be against him. Also he told him that Bagdemegus was his</a>
<a id='line_3066'>cousin, and germain unto King Uriens.</a>
<a id='line_3067'></a>
<a id='line_3068'></a>
<a id='line_3069'></a>
<a id='line_3070'>CHAPTER XII. How a sorrowful knight came before Arthur, and how Balin</a>
<a id='line_3071'>fetched him, and how that knight was slain by a knight invisible.</a>
<a id='line_3072'></a>
<a id='line_3073'>Within a day or two King Arthur was somewhat sick, and he let pitch his</a>
<a id='line_3074'>pavilion in a meadow, and there he laid him down on a pallet to sleep,</a>
<a id='line_3075'>but he might have no rest. Right so he heard a great noise of an horse,</a>
<a id='line_3076'>and therewith the king looked out at the porch of the pavilion, and saw</a>
<a id='line_3077'>a knight coming even by him, making great dole. Abide, fair sir, said</a>
<a id='line_3078'>Arthur, and tell me wherefore thou makest this sorrow. Ye may little</a>
<a id='line_3079'>amend me, said the knight, and so passed forth to the castle of Meliot.</a>
<a id='line_3080'>Anon after there came Balin, and when he saw King Arthur he alighted</a>
<a id='line_3081'>off his horse, and came to the King on foot, and saluted him. By my</a>
<a id='line_3082'>head, said Arthur, ye be welcome. Sir, right now came riding this way a</a>
<a id='line_3083'>knight making great mourn, for what cause I cannot tell; wherefore I</a>
<a id='line_3084'>would desire of you of your courtesy and of your gentleness to fetch</a>
<a id='line_3085'>again that knight either by force or else by his good will. I will do</a>
<a id='line_3086'>more for your lordship than that, said Balin; and so he rode more than</a>
<a id='line_3087'>a pace, and found the knight with a damosel in a forest, and said, Sir</a>
<a id='line_3088'>knight, ye must come with me unto King Arthur, for to tell him of your</a>
<a id='line_3089'>sorrow. That will I not, said the knight, for it will scathe me</a>
<a id='line_3090'>greatly, and do you none avail. Sir, said Balin, I pray you make you</a>
<a id='line_3091'>ready, for ye must go with me, or else I must fight with you and bring</a>
<a id='line_3092'>you by force, and that were me loath to do. Will ye be my warrant, said</a>
<a id='line_3093'>the knight, an I go with you? Yea, said Balin, or else I will die</a>
<a id='line_3094'>therefore. And so he made him ready to go with Balin, and left the</a>
<a id='line_3095'>damosel still. And as they were even afore King Arthur’s pavilion,</a>
<a id='line_3096'>there came one invisible, and smote this knight that went with Balin</a>
<a id='line_3097'>throughout the body with a spear. Alas, said the knight, I am slain</a>
<a id='line_3098'>under your conduct with a knight called Garlon; therefore take my horse</a>
<a id='line_3099'>that is better than yours, and ride to the damosel, and follow the</a>
<a id='line_3100'>quest that I was in as she will lead you, and revenge my death when ye</a>
<a id='line_3101'>may. That shall I do, said Balin, and that I make vow unto knighthood;</a>
<a id='line_3102'>and so he departed from this knight with great sorrow. So King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_3103'>let bury this knight richly, and made a mention on his tomb, how there</a>
<a id='line_3104'>was slain Herlews le Berbeus, and by whom the treachery was done, the</a>
<a id='line_3105'>knight Garlon. But ever the damosel bare the truncheon of the spear</a>
<a id='line_3106'>with her that Sir Herlews was slain withal.</a>
<a id='line_3107'></a>
<a id='line_3108'></a>
<a id='line_3109'></a>
<a id='line_3110'>CHAPTER XIII. How Balin and the damosel met with a knight which was in</a>
<a id='line_3111'>likewise slain, and how the damosel bled for the custom of a castle.</a>
<a id='line_3112'></a>
<a id='line_3113'>So Balin and the damosel rode into a forest, and there met with a</a>
<a id='line_3114'>knight that had been a-hunting, and that knight asked Balin for what</a>
<a id='line_3115'>cause he made so great sorrow. Me list not to tell you, said Balin.</a>
<a id='line_3116'>Now, said the knight, an I were armed as ye be I would fight with you.</a>
<a id='line_3117'>That should little need, said Balin, I am not afeard to tell you, and</a>
<a id='line_3118'>told him all the cause how it was. Ah, said the knight, is this all?</a>
<a id='line_3119'>here I ensure you by the faith of my body never to depart from you</a>
<a id='line_3120'>while my life lasteth. And so they went to the hostelry and armed them,</a>
<a id='line_3121'>and so rode forth with Balin. And as they came by an hermitage even by</a>
<a id='line_3122'>a churchyard, there came the knight Garlon invisible, and smote this</a>
<a id='line_3123'>knight, Perin de Mountbeliard, through the body with a spear. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_3124'>said the knight, I am slain by this traitor knight that rideth</a>
<a id='line_3125'>invisible. Alas, said Balin, it is not the first despite he hath done</a>
<a id='line_3126'>me; and there the hermit and Balin buried the knight under a rich stone</a>
<a id='line_3127'>and a tomb royal. And on the morn they found letters of gold written,</a>
<a id='line_3128'>how Sir Gawaine shall revenge his father’s death, King Lot, on the King</a>
<a id='line_3129'>Pellinore. Anon after this Balin and the damosel rode till they came to</a>
<a id='line_3130'>a castle, and there Balin alighted, and he and the damosel went to go</a>
<a id='line_3131'>into the castle, and anon as Balin came within the castle’s gate the</a>
<a id='line_3132'>portcullis fell down at his back, and there fell many men about the</a>
<a id='line_3133'>damosel, and would have slain her. When Balin saw that, he was sore</a>
<a id='line_3134'>aggrieved, for he might not help the damosel. Then he went up into the</a>
<a id='line_3135'>tower, and leapt over walls into the ditch, and hurt him not; and anon</a>
<a id='line_3136'>he pulled out his sword and would have foughten with them. And they all</a>
<a id='line_3137'>said nay, they would not fight with him, for they did nothing but the</a>
<a id='line_3138'>old custom of the castle; and told him how their lady was sick, and had</a>
<a id='line_3139'>lain many years, and she might not be whole but if she had a dish of</a>
<a id='line_3140'>silver full of blood of a clean maid and a king’s daughter; and</a>
<a id='line_3141'>therefore the custom of this castle is, there shall no damosel pass</a>
<a id='line_3142'>this way but she shall bleed of her blood in a silver dish full. Well,</a>
<a id='line_3143'>said Balin, she shall bleed as much as she may bleed, but I will not</a>
<a id='line_3144'>lose the life of her whiles my life lasteth. And so Balin made her to</a>
<a id='line_3145'>bleed by her good will, but her blood helped not the lady. And so he</a>
<a id='line_3146'>and she rested there all night, and had there right good cheer, and on</a>
<a id='line_3147'>the morn they passed on their ways. And as it telleth after in the</a>
<a id='line_3148'>Sangreal, that Sir Percivale’s sister helped that lady with her blood,</a>
<a id='line_3149'>whereof she was dead.</a>
<a id='line_3150'></a>
<a id='line_3151'></a>
<a id='line_3152'></a>
<a id='line_3153'>CHAPTER XIV. How Balin met with that knight named Garlon at a feast,</a>
<a id='line_3154'>and there he slew him, to have his blood to heal therewith the son of</a>
<a id='line_3155'>his host.</a>
<a id='line_3156'></a>
<a id='line_3157'>Then they rode three or four days and never met with adventure, and by</a>
<a id='line_3158'>hap they were lodged with a gentle man that was a rich man and well at</a>
<a id='line_3159'>ease. And as they sat at their supper Balin overheard one complain</a>
<a id='line_3160'>grievously by him in a chair. What is this noise? said Balin. Forsooth,</a>
<a id='line_3161'>said his host, I will tell you. I was but late at a jousting, and there</a>
<a id='line_3162'>I jousted with a knight that is brother unto King Pellam, and twice</a>
<a id='line_3163'>smote I him down, and then he promised to quit me on my best friend;</a>
<a id='line_3164'>and so he wounded my son, that cannot be whole till I have of that</a>
<a id='line_3165'>knight’s blood, and he rideth alway invisible; but I know not his name.</a>
<a id='line_3166'>Ah! said Balin, I know that knight, his name is Garlon, he hath slain</a>
<a id='line_3167'>two knights of mine in the same manner, therefore I had liefer meet</a>
<a id='line_3168'>with that knight than all the gold in this realm, for the despite he</a>
<a id='line_3169'>hath done me. Well, said his host, I shall tell you, King Pellam of</a>
<a id='line_3170'>Listeneise hath made do cry in all this country a great feast that</a>
<a id='line_3171'>shall be within these twenty days, and no knight may come there but if</a>
<a id='line_3172'>he bring his wife with him, or his paramour; and that knight, your</a>
<a id='line_3173'>enemy and mine, ye shall see that day. Then I behote you, said Balin,</a>
<a id='line_3174'>part of his blood to heal your son withal. We will be forward to-morn,</a>
<a id='line_3175'>said his host. So on the morn they rode all three toward Pellam, and</a>
<a id='line_3176'>they had fifteen days’ journey or they came thither; and that same day</a>
<a id='line_3177'>began the great feast. And so they alighted and stabled their horses,</a>
<a id='line_3178'>and went into the castle; but Balin’s host might not be let in because</a>
<a id='line_3179'>he had no lady. Then Balin was well received and brought unto a chamber</a>
<a id='line_3180'>and unarmed him; and there were brought him robes to his pleasure, and</a>
<a id='line_3181'>would have had Balin leave his sword behind him. Nay, said Balin, that</a>
<a id='line_3182'>do I not, for it is the custom of my country a knight always to keep</a>
<a id='line_3183'>his weapon with him, and that custom will I keep, or else I will depart</a>
<a id='line_3184'>as I came. Then they gave him leave to wear his sword, and so he went</a>
<a id='line_3185'>unto the castle, and was set among knights of worship, and his lady</a>
<a id='line_3186'>afore him.</a>
<a id='line_3187'></a>
<a id='line_3188'>Soon Balin asked a knight, Is there not a knight in this court whose</a>
<a id='line_3189'>name is Garlon? Yonder he goeth, said a knight, he with the black face;</a>
<a id='line_3190'>he is the marvellest knight that is now living, for he destroyeth many</a>
<a id='line_3191'>good knights, for he goeth invisible. Ah well, said Balin, is that he?</a>
<a id='line_3192'>Then Balin advised him long: If I slay him here I shall not escape, and</a>
<a id='line_3193'>if I leave him now, peradventure I shall never meet with him again at</a>
<a id='line_3194'>such a steven, and much harm he will do an he live. Therewith this</a>
<a id='line_3195'>Garlon espied that this Balin beheld him, and then he came and smote</a>
<a id='line_3196'>Balin on the face with the back of his hand, and said, Knight, why</a>
<a id='line_3197'>beholdest me so? for shame therefore, eat thy meat and do that thou</a>
<a id='line_3198'>came for. Thou sayest sooth, said Balin, this is not the first despite</a>
<a id='line_3199'>that thou hast done me, and therefore I will do what I came for, and</a>
<a id='line_3200'>rose up fiercely and clave his head to the shoulders. Give me the</a>
<a id='line_3201'>truncheon, said Balin to his lady, wherewith he slew your knight. Anon</a>
<a id='line_3202'>she gave it him, for alway she bare the truncheon with her. And</a>
<a id='line_3203'>therewith Balin smote him through the body, and said openly, With that</a>
<a id='line_3204'>truncheon thou hast slain a good knight, and now it sticketh in thy</a>
<a id='line_3205'>body. And then Balin called unto him his host, saying, Now may ye fetch</a>
<a id='line_3206'>blood enough to heal your son withal.</a>
<a id='line_3207'></a>
<a id='line_3208'></a>
<a id='line_3209'></a>
<a id='line_3210'>CHAPTER XV. How Balin fought with King Pellam, and how his sword brake,</a>
<a id='line_3211'>and how he gat a spear wherewith he smote the dolorous stroke.</a>
<a id='line_3212'></a>
<a id='line_3213'>Anon all the knights arose from the table for to set on Balin, and King</a>
<a id='line_3214'>Pellam himself arose up fiercely, and said, Knight, hast thou slain my</a>
<a id='line_3215'>brother? thou shalt die therefore or thou depart. Well, said Balin, do</a>
<a id='line_3216'>it yourself. Yes, said King Pellam, there shall no man have ado with</a>
<a id='line_3217'>thee but myself, for the love of my brother. Then King Pellam caught in</a>
<a id='line_3218'>his hand a grim weapon and smote eagerly at Balin; but Balin put the</a>
<a id='line_3219'>sword betwixt his head and the stroke, and therewith his sword burst in</a>
<a id='line_3220'>sunder. And when Balin was weaponless he ran into a chamber for to seek</a>
<a id='line_3221'>some weapon, and so from chamber to chamber, and no weapon he could</a>
<a id='line_3222'>find, and always King Pellam after him. And at the last he entered into</a>
<a id='line_3223'>a chamber that was marvellously well dight and richly, and a bed</a>
<a id='line_3224'>arrayed with cloth of gold, the richest that might be thought, and one</a>
<a id='line_3225'>lying therein, and thereby stood a table of clean gold with four</a>
<a id='line_3226'>pillars of silver that bare up the table, and upon the table stood a</a>
<a id='line_3227'>marvellous spear strangely wrought. And when Balin saw that spear, he</a>
<a id='line_3228'>gat it in his hand and turned him to King Pellam, and smote him</a>
<a id='line_3229'>passingly sore with that spear, that King Pellam fell down in a swoon,</a>
<a id='line_3230'>and therewith the castle roof and walls brake and fell to the earth,</a>
<a id='line_3231'>and Balin fell down so that he might not stir foot nor hand. And so the</a>
<a id='line_3232'>most part of the castle, that was fallen down through that dolorous</a>
<a id='line_3233'>stroke, lay upon Pellam and Balin three days.</a>
<a id='line_3234'></a>
<a id='line_3235'></a>
<a id='line_3236'></a>
<a id='line_3237'>CHAPTER XVI. How Balin was delivered by Merlin, and saved a knight that</a>
<a id='line_3238'>would have slain himself for love.</a>
<a id='line_3239'></a>
<a id='line_3240'>Then Merlin came thither and took up Balin, and gat him a good horse,</a>
<a id='line_3241'>for his was dead, and bade him ride out of that country. I would have</a>
<a id='line_3242'>my damosel, said Balin. Lo, said Merlin, where she lieth dead. And King</a>
<a id='line_3243'>Pellam lay so, many years sore wounded, and might never be whole till</a>
<a id='line_3244'>Galahad the haut prince healed him in the quest of the Sangreal, for in</a>
<a id='line_3245'>that place was part of the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, that Joseph</a>
<a id='line_3246'>of Arimathea brought into this land, and there himself lay in that rich</a>
<a id='line_3247'>bed. And that was the same spear that Longius smote our Lord to the</a>
<a id='line_3248'>heart; and King Pellam was nigh of Joseph’s kin, and that was the most</a>
<a id='line_3249'>worshipful man that lived in those days, and great pity it was of his</a>
<a id='line_3250'>hurt, for through that stroke, turned to great dole, tray and tene.</a>
<a id='line_3251'>Then departed Balin from Merlin, and said, In this world we meet never</a>
<a id='line_3252'>no more. So he rode forth through the fair countries and cities, and</a>
<a id='line_3253'>found the people dead, slain on every side. And all that were alive</a>
<a id='line_3254'>cried, O Balin, thou hast caused great damage in these countries; for</a>
<a id='line_3255'>the dolorous stroke thou gavest unto King Pellam three countries are</a>
<a id='line_3256'>destroyed, and doubt not but the vengeance will fall on thee at the</a>
<a id='line_3257'>last. When Balin was past those countries he was passing fain.</a>
<a id='line_3258'></a>
<a id='line_3259'>So he rode eight days or he met with adventure. And at the last he came</a>
<a id='line_3260'>into a fair forest in a valley, and was ware of a tower, and there</a>
<a id='line_3261'>beside he saw a great horse of war, tied to a tree, and there beside</a>
<a id='line_3262'>sat a fair knight on the ground and made great mourning, and he was a</a>
<a id='line_3263'>likely man, and a well made. Balin said, God save you, why be ye so</a>
<a id='line_3264'>heavy? tell me and I will amend it, an I may, to my power. Sir knight,</a>
<a id='line_3265'>said he again, thou dost me great grief, for I was in merry thoughts,</a>
<a id='line_3266'>and now thou puttest me to more pain. Balin went a little from him, and</a>
<a id='line_3267'>looked on his horse; then heard Balin him say thus: Ah, fair lady, why</a>
<a id='line_3268'>have ye broken my promise, for thou promisest me to meet me here by</a>
<a id='line_3269'>noon, and I may curse thee that ever ye gave me this sword, for with</a>
<a id='line_3270'>this sword I slay myself, and pulled it out. And therewith Balin stert</a>
<a id='line_3271'>unto him and took him by the hand. Let go my hand, said the knight, or</a>
<a id='line_3272'>else I shall slay thee. That shall not need, said Balin, for I shall</a>
<a id='line_3273'>promise you my help to get you your lady, an ye will tell me where she</a>
<a id='line_3274'>is. What is your name? said the knight. My name is Balin le Savage. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_3275'>sir, I know you well enough, ye are the Knight with the Two Swords, and</a>
<a id='line_3276'>the man of most prowess of your hands living. What is your name? said</a>
<a id='line_3277'>Balin. My name is Garnish of the Mount, a poor man’s son, but by my</a>
<a id='line_3278'>prowess and hardiness a duke hath made me knight, and gave me lands;</a>
<a id='line_3279'>his name is Duke Hermel, and his daughter is she that I love, and she</a>
<a id='line_3280'>me as I deemed. How far is she hence? said Balin. But six mile, said</a>
<a id='line_3281'>the knight. Now ride we hence, said these two knights. So they rode</a>
<a id='line_3282'>more than a pace, till that they came to a fair castle well walled and</a>
<a id='line_3283'>ditched. I will into the castle, said Balin, and look if she be there.</a>
<a id='line_3284'>So he went in and searched from chamber to chamber, and found her bed,</a>
<a id='line_3285'>but she was not there. Then Balin looked into a fair little garden, and</a>
<a id='line_3286'>under a laurel tree he saw her lie upon a quilt of green samite and a</a>
<a id='line_3287'>knight in her arms, fast halsing either other, and under their heads</a>
<a id='line_3288'>grass and herbs. When Balin saw her lie so with the foulest knight that</a>
<a id='line_3289'>ever he saw, and she a fair lady, then Balin went through all the</a>
<a id='line_3290'>chambers again, and told the knight how he found her as she had slept</a>
<a id='line_3291'>fast, and so brought him in the place there she lay fast sleeping.</a>
<a id='line_3292'></a>
<a id='line_3293'></a>
<a id='line_3294'></a>
<a id='line_3295'>CHAPTER XVII. How that knight slew his love and a knight lying by her,</a>
<a id='line_3296'>and after, how he slew himself with his own sword, and how Balin rode</a>
<a id='line_3297'>toward a castle where he lost his life.</a>
<a id='line_3298'></a>
<a id='line_3299'>And when Garnish beheld her so lying, for pure sorrow his mouth and</a>
<a id='line_3300'>nose burst out a-bleeding, and with his sword he smote off both their</a>
<a id='line_3301'>heads, and then he made sorrow out of measure, and said, O Balin, much</a>
<a id='line_3302'>sorrow hast thou brought unto me, for hadst thou not shewed me that</a>
<a id='line_3303'>sight I should have passed my sorrow. Forsooth, said Balin, I did it to</a>
<a id='line_3304'>this intent that it should better thy courage, and that ye might see</a>
<a id='line_3305'>and know her falsehood, and to cause you to leave love of such a lady;</a>
<a id='line_3306'>God knoweth I did none other but as I would ye did to me. Alas, said</a>
<a id='line_3307'>Garnish, now is my sorrow double that I may not endure, now have I</a>
<a id='line_3308'>slain that I most loved in all my life; and therewith suddenly he rove</a>
<a id='line_3309'>himself on his own sword unto the hilts. When Balin saw that, he</a>
<a id='line_3310'>dressed him thenceward, lest folk would say he had slain them; and so</a>
<a id='line_3311'>he rode forth, and within three days he came by a cross, and thereon</a>
<a id='line_3312'>were letters of gold written, that said, It is not for no knight alone</a>
<a id='line_3313'>to ride toward this castle. Then saw he an old hoar gentleman coming</a>
<a id='line_3314'>toward him, that said, Balin le Savage, thou passest thy bounds to come</a>
<a id='line_3315'>this way, therefore turn again and it will avail thee. And he vanished</a>
<a id='line_3316'>away anon; and so he heard an horn blow as it had been the death of a</a>
<a id='line_3317'>beast. That blast, said Balin, is blown for me, for I am the prize and</a>
<a id='line_3318'>yet am I not dead. Anon withal he saw an hundred ladies and many</a>
<a id='line_3319'>knights, that welcomed him with fair semblant, and made him passing</a>
<a id='line_3320'>good cheer unto his sight, and led him into the castle, and there was</a>
<a id='line_3321'>dancing and minstrelsy and all manner of joy. Then the chief lady of</a>
<a id='line_3322'>the castle said, Knight with the Two Swords, ye must have ado and joust</a>
<a id='line_3323'>with a knight hereby that keepeth an island, for there may no man pass</a>
<a id='line_3324'>this way but he must joust or he pass. That is an unhappy custom, said</a>
<a id='line_3325'>Balin, that a knight may not pass this way but if he joust. Ye shall</a>
<a id='line_3326'>not have ado but with one knight, said the lady.</a>
<a id='line_3327'></a>
<a id='line_3328'>Well, said Balin, since I shall thereto I am ready, but travelling men</a>
<a id='line_3329'>are oft weary and their horses too, but though my horse be weary my</a>
<a id='line_3330'>heart is not weary, I would be fain there my death should be. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_3331'>a knight to Balin, methinketh your shield is not good, I will lend you</a>
<a id='line_3332'>a bigger. Thereof I pray you. And so he took the shield that was</a>
<a id='line_3333'>unknown and left his own, and so rode unto the island, and put him and</a>
<a id='line_3334'>his horse in a great boat; and when he came on the other side he met</a>
<a id='line_3335'>with a damosel, and she said, O knight Balin, why have ye left your own</a>
<a id='line_3336'>shield? alas ye have put yourself in great danger, for by your shield</a>
<a id='line_3337'>ye should have been known; it is great pity of you as ever was of</a>
<a id='line_3338'>knight, for of thy prowess and hardiness thou hast no fellow living. Me</a>
<a id='line_3339'>repenteth, said Balin, that ever I came within this country, but I may</a>
<a id='line_3340'>not turn now again for shame, and what adventure shall fall to me, be</a>
<a id='line_3341'>it life or death, I will take the adventure that shall come to me. And</a>
<a id='line_3342'>then he looked on his armour, and understood he was well armed, and</a>
<a id='line_3343'>therewith blessed him and mounted upon his horse.</a>
<a id='line_3344'></a>
<a id='line_3345'></a>
<a id='line_3346'></a>
<a id='line_3347'>CHAPTER XVIII. How Balin met with his brother Balan, and how each of</a>
<a id='line_3348'>them slew other unknown, till they were wounded to death.</a>
<a id='line_3349'></a>
<a id='line_3350'>Then afore him he saw come riding out of a castle a knight, and his</a>
<a id='line_3351'>horse trapped all red, and himself in the same colour. When this knight</a>
<a id='line_3352'>in the red beheld Balin, him thought it should be his brother Balin by</a>
<a id='line_3353'>cause of his two swords, but by cause he knew not his shield he deemed</a>
<a id='line_3354'>it was not he. And so they aventryd their spears and came marvellously</a>
<a id='line_3355'>fast together, and they smote each other in the shields, but their</a>
<a id='line_3356'>spears and their course were so big that it bare down horse and man,</a>
<a id='line_3357'>that they lay both in a swoon. But Balin was bruised sore with the fall</a>
<a id='line_3358'>of his horse, for he was weary of travel. And Balan was the first that</a>
<a id='line_3359'>rose on foot and drew his sword, and went toward Balin, and he arose</a>
<a id='line_3360'>and went against him; but Balan smote Balin first, and he put up his</a>
<a id='line_3361'>shield and smote him through the shield and tamed his helm. Then Balin</a>
<a id='line_3362'>smote him again with that unhappy sword, and well-nigh had felled his</a>
<a id='line_3363'>brother Balan, and so they fought there together till their breaths</a>
<a id='line_3364'>failed. Then Balin looked up to the castle and saw the towers stand</a>
<a id='line_3365'>full of ladies. So they went unto battle again, and wounded everych</a>
<a id='line_3366'>other dolefully, and then they breathed ofttimes, and so went unto</a>
<a id='line_3367'>battle that all the place there as they fought was blood red. And at</a>
<a id='line_3368'>that time there was none of them both but they had either smitten other</a>
<a id='line_3369'>seven great wounds, so that the least of them might have been the death</a>
<a id='line_3370'>of the mightiest giant in this world.</a>
<a id='line_3371'></a>
<a id='line_3372'>Then they went to battle again so marvellously that doubt it was to</a>
<a id='line_3373'>hear of that battle for the great blood-shedding, and their hauberks</a>
<a id='line_3374'>unnailed that naked they were on every side. At last Balan the younger</a>
<a id='line_3375'>brother withdrew him a little and laid him down. Then said Balin le</a>
<a id='line_3376'>Savage, What knight art thou? for or now I found never no knight that</a>
<a id='line_3377'>matched me. My name is, said he, Balan, brother unto the good knight,</a>
<a id='line_3378'>Balin. Alas, said Balin, that ever I should see this day, and therewith</a>
<a id='line_3379'>he fell backward in a swoon. Then Balan yede on all four feet and</a>
<a id='line_3380'>hands, and put off the helm off his brother, and might not know him by</a>
<a id='line_3381'>the visage it was so ful hewn and bled; but when he awoke he said, O</a>
<a id='line_3382'>Balan, my brother, thou hast slain me and I thee, wherefore all the</a>
<a id='line_3383'>wide world shall speak of us both. Alas, said Balan, that ever I saw</a>
<a id='line_3384'>this day, that through mishap I might not know you, for I espied well</a>
<a id='line_3385'>your two swords, but by cause ye had another shield I deemed ye had</a>
<a id='line_3386'>been another knight. Alas, said Balin, all that made an unhappy knight</a>
<a id='line_3387'>in the castle, for he caused me to leave my own shield to our both’s</a>
<a id='line_3388'>destruction, and if I might live I would destroy that castle for ill</a>
<a id='line_3389'>customs. That were well done, said Balan, for I had never grace to</a>
<a id='line_3390'>depart from them since that I came hither, for here it happed me to</a>
<a id='line_3391'>slay a knight that kept this island, and since might I never depart,</a>
<a id='line_3392'>and no more should ye, brother, an ye might have slain me as ye have,</a>
<a id='line_3393'>and escaped yourself with the life.</a>
<a id='line_3394'></a>
<a id='line_3395'>Right so came the lady of the tower with four knights and six ladies</a>
<a id='line_3396'>and six yeomen unto them, and there she heard how they made their moan</a>
<a id='line_3397'>either to other, and said, We came both out of one tomb, that is to say</a>
<a id='line_3398'>one mother’s belly, and so shall we lie both in one pit. So Balan</a>
<a id='line_3399'>prayed the lady of her gentleness, for his true service, that she would</a>
<a id='line_3400'>bury them both in that same place there the battle was done. And she</a>
<a id='line_3401'>granted them, with weeping, it should be done richly in the best</a>
<a id='line_3402'>manner. Now, will ye send for a priest, that we may receive our</a>
<a id='line_3403'>sacrament, and receive the blessed body of our Lord Jesus Christ? Yea,</a>
<a id='line_3404'>said the lady, it shall be done; and so she sent for a priest and gave</a>
<a id='line_3405'>them their rights. Now, said Balin, when we are buried in one tomb, and</a>
<a id='line_3406'>the mention made over us how two brethren slew each other, there will</a>
<a id='line_3407'>never good knight, nor good man, see our tomb but they will pray for</a>
<a id='line_3408'>our souls. And so all the ladies and gentlewomen wept for pity. Then</a>
<a id='line_3409'>anon Balan died, but Balin died not till the midnight after, and so</a>
<a id='line_3410'>were they buried both, and the lady let make a mention of Balan how he</a>
<a id='line_3411'>was there slain by his brother’s hands, but she knew not Balin’s name.</a>

<a id='line_3415'>CHAPTER XIX. How Merlin buried them both in one tomb, and of Balin’s</a>
<a id='line_3416'>sword.</a>
<a id='line_3417'></a>
<a id='line_3418'>In the morn came Merlin and let write Balin’s name on the tomb with</a>
<a id='line_3419'>letters of gold, that Here lieth Balin le Savage that was the Knight</a>
<a id='line_3420'>with the Two Swords, and he that smote the Dolorous Stroke. Also Merlin</a>
<a id='line_3421'>let make there a bed, that there should never man lie therein but he</a>
<a id='line_3422'>went out of his wit, yet Launcelot de Lake fordid that bed through his</a>
<a id='line_3423'>noblesse. And anon after Balin was dead, Merlin took his sword, and</a>
<a id='line_3424'>took off the pommel and set on another pommel. So Merlin bade a knight</a>
<a id='line_3425'>that stood afore him handle that sword, and he assayed, and he might</a>
<a id='line_3426'>not handle it. Then Merlin laughed. Why laugh ye? said the knight. This</a>
<a id='line_3427'>is the cause, said Merlin: there shall never man handle this sword but</a>
<a id='line_3428'>the best knight of the world, and that shall be Sir Launcelot or else</a>
<a id='line_3429'>Galahad his son, and Launcelot with this sword shall slay the man that</a>
<a id='line_3430'>in the world he loved best, that shall be Sir Gawaine. All this he let</a>
<a id='line_3431'>write in the pommel of the sword. Then Merlin let make a bridge of iron</a>
<a id='line_3432'>and of steel into that island, and it was but half a foot broad, and</a>
<a id='line_3433'>there shall never man pass that bridge, nor have hardiness to go over,</a>
<a id='line_3434'>but if he were a passing good man and a good knight without treachery</a>
<a id='line_3435'>or villainy. Also the scabbard of Balin’s sword Merlin left it on this</a>
<a id='line_3436'>side the island, that Galahad should find it. Also Merlin let make by</a>
<a id='line_3437'>his subtilty that Balin’s sword was put in a marble stone standing</a>
<a id='line_3438'>upright as great as a mill stone, and the stone hoved always above the</a>
<a id='line_3439'>water and did many years, and so by adventure it swam down the stream</a>
<a id='line_3440'>to the City of Camelot, that is in English Winchester. And that same</a>
<a id='line_3441'>day Galahad the haut prince came with King Arthur, and so Galahad</a>
<a id='line_3442'>brought with him the scabbard and achieved the sword that was there in</a>
<a id='line_3443'>the marble stone hoving upon the water. And on Whitsunday he achieved</a>
<a id='line_3444'>the sword as it is rehearsed in the book of Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_3445'></a>
<a id='line_3446'>Soon after this was done Merlin came to King Arthur and told him of the</a>
<a id='line_3447'>dolorous stroke that Balin gave to King Pellam, and how Balin and Balan</a>
<a id='line_3448'>fought together the marvellest battle that ever was heard of, and how</a>
<a id='line_3449'>they were buried both in one tomb. Alas, said King Arthur, this is the</a>
<a id='line_3450'>greatest pity that ever I heard tell of two knights, for in the world I</a>
<a id='line_3451'>know not such two knights. Thus endeth the tale of Balin and of Balan,</a>
<a id='line_3452'>two brethren born in Northumberland, good knights.</a>

<a id='line_3462'>CHAPTER I. How King Arthur took a wife, and wedded Guenever, daughter</a>
<a id='line_3463'>to Leodegrance, King of the Land of Cameliard, with whom he had the</a>
<a id='line_3464'>Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_3465'></a>
<a id='line_3466'>In the beginning of Arthur, after he was chosen king by adventure and</a>
<a id='line_3467'>by grace; for the most part of the barons knew not that he was Uther</a>
<a id='line_3468'>Pendragon’s son, but as Merlin made it openly known. But yet many kings</a>
<a id='line_3469'>and lords held great war against him for that cause, but well Arthur</a>
<a id='line_3470'>overcame them all, for the most part the days of his life he was ruled</a>
<a id='line_3471'>much by the counsel of Merlin. So it fell on a time King Arthur said</a>
<a id='line_3472'>unto Merlin, My barons will let me have no rest, but needs I must take</a>
<a id='line_3473'>a wife, and I will none take but by thy counsel and by thine advice. It</a>
<a id='line_3474'>is well done, said Merlin, that ye take a wife, for a man of your</a>
<a id='line_3475'>bounty and noblesse should not be without a wife. Now is there any that</a>
<a id='line_3476'>ye love more than another? Yea, said King Arthur, I love Guenever the</a>
<a id='line_3477'>king’s daughter, Leodegrance of the land of Cameliard, the which</a>
<a id='line_3478'>holdeth in his house the Table Round that ye told he had of my father</a>
<a id='line_3479'>Uther. And this damosel is the most valiant and fairest lady that I</a>
<a id='line_3480'>know living, or yet that ever I could find. Sir, said Merlin, as of her</a>
<a id='line_3481'>beauty and fairness she is one of the fairest alive, but, an ye loved</a>
<a id='line_3482'>her not so well as ye do, I should find you a damosel of beauty and of</a>
<a id='line_3483'>goodness that should like you and please you, an your heart were not</a>
<a id='line_3484'>set; but there as a man’s heart is set, he will be loath to return.</a>
<a id='line_3485'>That is truth, said King Arthur. But Merlin warned the king covertly</a>
<a id='line_3486'>that Guenever was not wholesome for him to take to wife, for he warned</a>
<a id='line_3487'>him that Launcelot should love her, and she him again; and so he turned</a>
<a id='line_3488'>his tale to the adventures of Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_3489'></a>
<a id='line_3490'>Then Merlin desired of the king for to have men with him that should</a>
<a id='line_3491'>enquire of Guenever, and so the king granted him, and Merlin went forth</a>
<a id='line_3492'>unto King Leodegrance of Cameliard, and told him of the desires of the</a>
<a id='line_3493'>king that he would have unto his wife Guenever his daughter. That is to</a>
<a id='line_3494'>me, said King Leodegrance, the best tidings that ever I heard, that so</a>
<a id='line_3495'>worthy a king of prowess and noblesse will wed my daughter. And as for</a>
<a id='line_3496'>my lands, I will give him, wist I it might please him, but he hath</a>
<a id='line_3497'>lands enow, him needeth none; but I shall send him a gift shall please</a>
<a id='line_3498'>him much more, for I shall give him the Table Round, the which Uther</a>
<a id='line_3499'>Pendragon gave me, and when it is full complete, there is an hundred</a>
<a id='line_3500'>knights and fifty. And as for an hundred good knights I have myself,</a>
<a id='line_3501'>but I faute fifty, for so many have been slain in my days. And so</a>
<a id='line_3502'>Leodegrance delivered his daughter Guenever unto Merlin, and the Table</a>
<a id='line_3503'>Round with the hundred knights, and so they rode freshly, with great</a>
<a id='line_3504'>royalty, what by water and what by land, till that they came nigh unto</a>

<a id='line_3509'>CHAPTER II. How the Knights of the Round Table were ordained and their</a>
<a id='line_3510'>sieges blessed by the Bishop of Canterbury.</a>
<a id='line_3511'></a>
<a id='line_3512'>When King Arthur heard of the coming of Guenever and the hundred</a>
<a id='line_3513'>knights with the Table Round, then King Arthur made great joy for her</a>
<a id='line_3514'>coming, and that rich present, and said openly, This fair lady is</a>
<a id='line_3515'>passing welcome unto me, for I have loved her long, and therefore there</a>
<a id='line_3516'>is nothing so lief to me. And these knights with the Round Table please</a>
<a id='line_3517'>me more than right great riches. And in all haste the king let ordain</a>
<a id='line_3518'>for the marriage and the coronation in the most honourable wise that</a>
<a id='line_3519'>could be devised. Now, Merlin, said King Arthur, go thou and espy me in</a>
<a id='line_3520'>all this land fifty knights which be of most prowess and worship.</a>
<a id='line_3521'>Within short time Merlin had found such knights that should fulfil</a>
<a id='line_3522'>twenty and eight knights, but no more he could find. Then the Bishop of</a>
<a id='line_3523'>Canterbury was fetched, and he blessed the sieges with great royalty</a>
<a id='line_3524'>and devotion, and there set the eight and twenty knights in their</a>
<a id='line_3525'>sieges. And when this was done Merlin said, Fair sirs, ye must all</a>
<a id='line_3526'>arise and come to King Arthur for to do him homage; he will have the</a>
<a id='line_3527'>better will to maintain you. And so they arose and did their homage,</a>
<a id='line_3528'>and when they were gone Merlin found in every sieges letters of gold</a>
<a id='line_3529'>that told the knights’ names that had sitten therein. But two sieges</a>
<a id='line_3530'>were void. And so anon came young Gawaine and asked the king a gift.</a>
<a id='line_3531'>Ask, said the king, and I shall grant it you. Sir, I ask that ye will</a>
<a id='line_3532'>make me knight that same day ye shall wed fair Guenever. I will do it</a>
<a id='line_3533'>with a good will, said King Arthur, and do unto you all the worship</a>
<a id='line_3534'>that I may, for I must by reason ye are my nephew, my sister’s son.</a>
<a id='line_3535'></a>

<a id='line_3538'>CHAPTER III. How a poor man riding upon a lean mare desired King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_3539'>to make his son knight.</a>
<a id='line_3540'></a>
<a id='line_3541'>Forthwithal there came a poor man into the court, and brought with him</a>
<a id='line_3542'>a fair young man of eighteen years of age riding upon a lean mare; and</a>
<a id='line_3543'>the poor man asked all men that he met, Where shall I find King Arthur?</a>
<a id='line_3544'>Yonder he is, said the knights, wilt thou anything with him? Yea, said</a>
<a id='line_3545'>the poor man, therefore I came hither. Anon as he came before the king,</a>
<a id='line_3546'>he saluted him and said: O King Arthur, the flower of all knights and</a>
<a id='line_3547'>kings, I beseech Jesu save thee. Sir, it was told me that at this time</a>
<a id='line_3548'>of your marriage ye would give any man the gift that he would ask, out</a>
<a id='line_3549'>except that were unreasonable. That is truth, said the king, such cries</a>
<a id='line_3550'>I let make, and that will I hold, so it apair not my realm nor mine</a>
<a id='line_3551'>estate. Ye say well and graciously, said the poor man; Sir, I ask</a>
<a id='line_3552'>nothing else but that ye will make my son here a knight. It is a great</a>
<a id='line_3553'>thing thou askest of me, said the king. What is thy name? said the king</a>
<a id='line_3554'>to the poor man. Sir, my name is Aries the cowherd. Whether cometh this</a>
<a id='line_3555'>of thee or of thy son? said the king. Nay, sir, said Aries, this desire</a>
<a id='line_3556'>cometh of my son and not of me, for I shall tell you I have thirteen</a>
<a id='line_3557'>sons, and all they will fall to what labour I put them, and will be</a>
<a id='line_3558'>right glad to do labour, but this child will not labour for me, for</a>
<a id='line_3559'>anything that my wife or I may do, but always he will be shooting or</a>
<a id='line_3560'>casting darts, and glad for to see battles and to behold knights, and</a>
<a id='line_3561'>always day and night he desireth of me to be made a knight. What is thy</a>
<a id='line_3562'>name? said the king unto the young man. Sir, my name is Tor. The king</a>
<a id='line_3563'>beheld him fast, and saw he was passingly well-visaged and passingly</a>
<a id='line_3564'>well made of his years. Well, said King Arthur unto Aries the cowherd,</a>
<a id='line_3565'>fetch all thy sons afore me that I may see them. And so the poor man</a>
<a id='line_3566'>did, and all were shaped much like the poor man. But Tor was not like</a>
<a id='line_3567'>none of them all in shape nor in countenance, for he was much more than</a>
<a id='line_3568'>any of them. Now, said King Arthur unto the cow herd, where is the</a>
<a id='line_3569'>sword he shall be made knight withal? It is here, said Tor. Take it out</a>
<a id='line_3570'>of the sheath, said the king, and require me to make you a knight.</a>
<a id='line_3571'></a>
<a id='line_3572'>Then Tor alighted off his mare and pulled out his sword, kneeling, and</a>
<a id='line_3573'>requiring the king that he would make him knight, and that he might be</a>
<a id='line_3574'>a knight of the Table Round. As for a knight I will make you, and</a>
<a id='line_3575'>therewith smote him in the neck with the sword, saying, Be ye a good</a>
<a id='line_3576'>knight, and so I pray to God so ye may be, and if ye be of prowess and</a>
<a id='line_3577'>of worthiness ye shall be a knight of the Table Round. Now Merlin, said</a>
<a id='line_3578'>Arthur, say whether this Tor shall be a good knight or no. Yea, sir, he</a>
<a id='line_3579'>ought to be a good knight, for he is come of as good a man as any is</a>
<a id='line_3580'>alive, and of kings’ blood. How so, sir? said the king. I shall tell</a>
<a id='line_3581'>you, said Merlin: This poor man, Aries the cowherd, is not his father;</a>
<a id='line_3582'>he is nothing sib to him, for King Pellinore is his father. I suppose</a>
<a id='line_3583'>nay, said the cowherd. Fetch thy wife afore me, said Merlin, and she</a>
<a id='line_3584'>shall not say nay. Anon the wife was fetched, which was a fair</a>
<a id='line_3585'>housewife, and there she answered Merlin full womanly, and there she</a>
<a id='line_3586'>told the king and Merlin that when she was a maid, and went to milk</a>
<a id='line_3587'>kine, there met with her a stern knight, and half by force he had my</a>
<a id='line_3588'>maidenhead, and at that time he begat my son Tor, and he took away from</a>
<a id='line_3589'>me my greyhound that I had that time with me, and said that he would</a>
<a id='line_3590'>keep the greyhound for my love. Ah, said the cowherd, I weened not</a>
<a id='line_3591'>this, but I may believe it well, for he had never no tatches of me.</a>
<a id='line_3592'>Sir, said Tor unto Merlin, dishonour not my mother. Sir, said Merlin,</a>
<a id='line_3593'>it is more for your worship than hurt, for your father is a good man</a>
<a id='line_3594'>and a king, and he may right well advance you and your mother, for ye</a>
<a id='line_3595'>were begotten or ever she was wedded. That is truth, said the wife. It</a>
<a id='line_3596'>is the less grief unto me, said the cowherd.</a>
<a id='line_3597'></a>
<a id='line_3598'></a>
<a id='line_3599'></a>
<a id='line_3600'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Tor was known for son of King Pellinore, and how</a>
<a id='line_3601'>Gawaine was made knight.</a>
<a id='line_3602'></a>
<a id='line_3603'>So on the morn King Pellinore came to the court of King Arthur, which</a>
<a id='line_3604'>had great joy of him, and told him of Tor, how he was his son, and how</a>
<a id='line_3605'>he had made him knight at the request of the cowherd. When Pellinore</a>
<a id='line_3606'>beheld Tor, he pleased him much. So the king made Gawaine knight, but</a>
<a id='line_3607'>Tor was the first he made at the feast. What is the cause, said King</a>
<a id='line_3608'>Arthur, that there be two places void in the sieges? Sir, said Merlin,</a>
<a id='line_3609'>there shall no man sit in those places but they that shall be of most</a>
<a id='line_3610'>worship. But in the Siege Perilous there shall no man sit therein but</a>
<a id='line_3611'>one, and if there be any so hardy to do it he shall be destroyed, and</a>
<a id='line_3612'>he that shall sit there shall have no fellow. And therewith Merlin took</a>
<a id='line_3613'>King Pellinore by the hand, and in the one hand next the two sieges and</a>
<a id='line_3614'>the Siege Perilous he said, in open audience, This is your place and</a>
<a id='line_3615'>best ye are worthy to sit therein of any that is here. Thereat sat Sir</a>
<a id='line_3616'>Gawaine in great envy and told Gaheris his brother, yonder knight is</a>
<a id='line_3617'>put to great worship, the which grieveth me sore, for he slew our</a>
<a id='line_3618'>father King Lot, therefore I will slay him, said Gawaine, with a sword</a>
<a id='line_3619'>that was sent me that is passing trenchant. Ye shall not so, said</a>
<a id='line_3620'>Gaheris, at this time, for at this time I am but a squire, and when I</a>
<a id='line_3621'>am made knight I will be avenged on him, and therefore, brother, it is</a>
<a id='line_3622'>best ye suffer till another time, that we may have him out of the</a>
<a id='line_3623'>court, for an we did so we should trouble this high feast. I will well,</a>
<a id='line_3624'>said Gawaine, as ye will.</a>
<a id='line_3625'></a>
<a id='line_3626'></a>
<a id='line_3627'></a>
<a id='line_3628'>CHAPTER V. How at feast of the wedding of King Arthur to Guenever, a</a>
<a id='line_3629'>white hart came into the hall, and thirty couple hounds, and how a</a>
<a id='line_3630'>brachet pinched the hart which was taken away.</a>
<a id='line_3631'></a>
<a id='line_3632'>Then was the high feast made ready, and the king was wedded at Camelot</a>
<a id='line_3633'>unto Dame Guenever in the church of Saint Stephen’s, with great</a>
<a id='line_3634'>solemnity. And as every man was set after his degree, Merlin went to</a>
<a id='line_3635'>all the knights of the Round Table, and bade them sit still, that none</a>
<a id='line_3636'>of them remove. For ye shall see a strange and a marvellous adventure.</a>
<a id='line_3637'>Right so as they sat there came running in a white hart into the hall,</a>
<a id='line_3638'>and a white brachet next him, and thirty couple of black running hounds</a>
<a id='line_3639'>came after with a great cry, and the hart went about the Table Round as</a>
<a id='line_3640'>he went by other boards. The white brachet bit him by the buttock and</a>
<a id='line_3641'>pulled out a piece, wherethrough the hart leapt a great leap and</a>
<a id='line_3642'>overthrew a knight that sat at the board side; and therewith the knight</a>
<a id='line_3643'>arose and took up the brachet, and so went forth out of the hall, and</a>
<a id='line_3644'>took his horse and rode his way with the brachet. Right so anon came in</a>
<a id='line_3645'>a lady on a white palfrey, and cried aloud to King Arthur, Sir, suffer</a>
<a id='line_3646'>me not to have this despite, for the brachet was mine that the knight</a>
<a id='line_3647'>led away. I may not do therewith, said the king.</a>
<a id='line_3648'></a>
<a id='line_3649'>With this there came a knight riding all armed on a great horse, and</a>
<a id='line_3650'>took the lady away with him with force, and ever she cried and made</a>
<a id='line_3651'>great dole. When she was gone the king was glad, for she made such a</a>
<a id='line_3652'>noise. Nay, said Merlin, ye may not leave these adventures so lightly;</a>
<a id='line_3653'>for these adventures must be brought again or else it would be</a>
<a id='line_3654'>disworship to you and to your feast. I will, said the king, that all be</a>
<a id='line_3655'>done by your advice. Then, said Merlin, let call Sir Gawaine, for he</a>
<a id='line_3656'>must bring again the white hart. Also, sir, ye must let call Sir Tor,</a>
<a id='line_3657'>for he must bring again the brachet and the knight, or else slay him.</a>
<a id='line_3658'>Also let call King Pellinore, for he must bring again the lady and the</a>
<a id='line_3659'>knight, or else slay him. And these three knights shall do marvellous</a>
<a id='line_3660'>adventures or they come again. Then were they called all three as it</a>
<a id='line_3661'>rehearseth afore, and each of them took his charge, and armed them</a>
<a id='line_3662'>surely. But Sir Gawaine had the first request, and therefore we will</a>
<a id='line_3663'>begin at him.</a>
<a id='line_3664'></a>
<a id='line_3665'></a>
<a id='line_3666'></a>
<a id='line_3667'>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Gawaine rode for to fetch again the hart, and how</a>
<a id='line_3668'>two brethren fought each against other for the hart.</a>
<a id='line_3669'></a>
<a id='line_3670'>Sir Gawaine rode more than a pace, and Gaheris his brother that rode</a>
<a id='line_3671'>with him instead of a squire to do him service. So as they rode they</a>
<a id='line_3672'>saw two knights fight on horseback passing sore, so Sir Gawaine and his</a>
<a id='line_3673'>brother rode betwixt them, and asked them for what cause they fought</a>
<a id='line_3674'>so. The one knight answered and said, We fight for a simple matter, for</a>
<a id='line_3675'>we two be two brethren born and begotten of one man and of one woman.</a>
<a id='line_3676'>Alas, said Sir Gawaine, why do ye so? Sir, said the elder, there came a</a>
<a id='line_3677'>white hart this way this day, and many hounds chased him, and a white</a>
<a id='line_3678'>brachet was alway next him, and we understood it was adventure made for</a>
<a id='line_3679'>the high feast of King Arthur, and therefore I would have gone after to</a>
<a id='line_3680'>have won me worship; and here my younger brother said he would go after</a>
<a id='line_3681'>the hart, for he was better knight than I: and for this cause we fell</a>
<a id='line_3682'>at debate, and so we thought to prove which of us both was better</a>
<a id='line_3683'>knight. This is a simple cause, said Sir Gawaine; uncouth men ye should</a>
<a id='line_3684'>debate withal, and not brother with brother; therefore but if you will</a>
<a id='line_3685'>do by my counsel I will have ado with you, that is ye shall yield you</a>
<a id='line_3686'>unto me, and that ye go unto King Arthur and yield you unto his grace.</a>
<a id='line_3687'>Sir knight, said the two brethren, we are forfoughten and much blood</a>
<a id='line_3688'>have we lost through our wilfulness, and therefore we would be loath to</a>
<a id='line_3689'>have ado with you. Then do as I will have you, said Sir Gawaine. We</a>
<a id='line_3690'>will agree to fulfil your will; but by whom shall we say that we be</a>
<a id='line_3691'>thither sent? Ye may say, By the knight that followeth the quest of the</a>
<a id='line_3692'>hart that was white. Now what is your name? said Gawaine. Sorlouse of</a>
<a id='line_3693'>the Forest, said the elder. And my name is, said the younger, Brian of</a>
<a id='line_3694'>the Forest. And so they departed and went to the king’s court, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_3695'>Gawaine on his quest.</a>
<a id='line_3696'></a>
<a id='line_3697'>And as Gawaine followed the hart by the cry of the hounds, even afore</a>
<a id='line_3698'>him there was a great river, and the hart swam over; and as Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_3699'>would follow after, there stood a knight over the other side, and said,</a>
<a id='line_3700'>Sir knight, come not over after this hart but if thou wilt joust with</a>
<a id='line_3701'>me. I will not fail as for that, said Sir Gawaine, to follow the quest</a>
<a id='line_3702'>that I am in, and so made his horse to swim over the water. And anon</a>
<a id='line_3703'>they gat their spears and ran together full hard; but Sir Gawaine smote</a>
<a id='line_3704'>him off his horse, and then he turned his horse and bade him yield him.</a>
<a id='line_3705'>Nay, said the knight, not so, though thou have the better of me on</a>
<a id='line_3706'>horseback. I pray thee, valiant knight, alight afoot, and match we</a>
<a id='line_3707'>together with swords. What is your name? said Sir Gawaine. Allardin of</a>
<a id='line_3708'>the Isles, said the other. Then either dressed their shields and smote</a>
<a id='line_3709'>together, but Sir Gawaine smote him so hard through the helm that it</a>
<a id='line_3710'>went to the brains, and the knight fell down dead. Ah! said Gaheris,</a>
<a id='line_3711'>that was a mighty stroke of a young knight.</a>
<a id='line_3712'></a>
<a id='line_3713'></a>
<a id='line_3714'></a>
<a id='line_3715'>CHAPTER VII How the hart was chased into a castle and there slain, and</a>
<a id='line_3716'>how Sir Gawaine slew a lady.</a>
<a id='line_3717'></a>
<a id='line_3718'>Then Gawaine and Gaheris rode more than a pace after the white hart,</a>
<a id='line_3719'>and let slip at the hart three couple of greyhounds, and so they chased</a>
<a id='line_3720'>the hart into a castle, and in the chief place of the castle they slew</a>
<a id='line_3721'>the hart; Sir Gawaine and Gaheris followed after. Right so there came a</a>
<a id='line_3722'>knight out of a chamber with a sword drawn in his hand and slew two of</a>
<a id='line_3723'>the greyhounds, even in the sight of Sir Gawaine, and the remnant he</a>
<a id='line_3724'>chased them with his sword out of the castle. And when he came again,</a>
<a id='line_3725'>he said, O my white hart, me repenteth that thou art dead, for my</a>
<a id='line_3726'>sovereign lady gave thee to me, and evil have I kept thee, and thy</a>
<a id='line_3727'>death shall be dear bought an I live. And anon he went into his chamber</a>
<a id='line_3728'>and armed him, and came out fiercely, and there met he with Sir</a>
<a id='line_3729'>Gawaine. Why have ye slain my hounds? said Sir Gawaine, for they did</a>
<a id='line_3730'>but their kind, and liefer I had ye had wroken your anger upon me than</a>
<a id='line_3731'>upon a dumb beast. Thou sayest truth, said the knight, I have avenged</a>
<a id='line_3732'>me on thy hounds, and so I will on thee or thou go. Then Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_3733'>alighted afoot and dressed his shield, and struck together mightily,</a>
<a id='line_3734'>and clave their shields, and stoned their helms, and brake their</a>
<a id='line_3735'>hauberks that the blood ran down to their feet.</a>
<a id='line_3736'></a>
<a id='line_3737'>At the last Sir Gawaine smote the knight so hard that he fell to the</a>
<a id='line_3738'>earth, and then he cried mercy, and yielded him, and besought him as he</a>
<a id='line_3739'>was a knight and gentleman, to save his life. Thou shalt die, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_3740'>Gawaine, for slaying of my hounds. I will make amends, said the knight,</a>
<a id='line_3741'>unto my power. Sir Gawaine would no mercy have, but unlaced his helm to</a>
<a id='line_3742'>have stricken off his head. Right so came his lady out of a chamber and</a>
<a id='line_3743'>fell over him, and so he smote off her head by misadventure. Alas, said</a>
<a id='line_3744'>Gaheris, that is foully and shamefully done, that shame shall never</a>
<a id='line_3745'>from you; also ye should give mercy unto them that ask mercy, for a</a>
<a id='line_3746'>knight without mercy is without worship. Sir Gawaine was so stonied of</a>
<a id='line_3747'>the death of this fair lady that he wist not what he did, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_3748'>the knight, Arise, I will give thee mercy. Nay, nay, said the knight, I</a>
<a id='line_3749'>take no force of mercy now, for thou hast slain my love and my lady</a>
<a id='line_3750'>that I loved best of all earthly things. Me sore repenteth it, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_3751'>Gawaine, for I thought to strike unto thee; but now thou shalt go unto</a>
<a id='line_3752'>King Arthur and tell him of thine adventures, and how thou art overcome</a>
<a id='line_3753'>by the knight that went in the quest of the white hart. I take no</a>
<a id='line_3754'>force, said the knight, whether I live or I die; but so for dread of</a>
<a id='line_3755'>death he swore to go unto King Arthur, and he made him to bear one</a>
<a id='line_3756'>greyhound before him on his horse, and another behind him. What is your</a>
<a id='line_3757'>name? said Sir Gawaine, or we depart. My name is, said the knight,</a>
<a id='line_3758'>Ablamar of the Marsh. So he departed toward Camelot.</a>

<a id='line_3762'>CHAPTER VIII. How four knights fought against Gawaine and Gaheris, and</a>
<a id='line_3763'>how they were overcome, and their lives saved at request of four</a>
<a id='line_3764'>ladies.</a>
<a id='line_3765'></a>
<a id='line_3766'>And Sir Gawaine went into the castle, and made him ready to lie there</a>
<a id='line_3767'>all night, and would have unarmed him. What will ye do, said Gaheris,</a>
<a id='line_3768'>will ye unarm you in this country? Ye may think ye have many enemies</a>
<a id='line_3769'>here. They had not sooner said that word but there came four knights</a>
<a id='line_3770'>well armed, and assailed Sir Gawaine hard, and said unto him, Thou</a>
<a id='line_3771'>new-made knight, thou hast shamed thy knighthood, for a knight without</a>
<a id='line_3772'>mercy is dishonoured. Also thou hast slain a fair lady to thy great</a>
<a id='line_3773'>shame to the world’s end, and doubt thou not thou shalt have great need</a>
<a id='line_3774'>of mercy or thou depart from us. And therewith one of them smote Sir</a>
<a id='line_3775'>Gawaine a great stroke that nigh he fell to the earth, and Gaheris</a>
<a id='line_3776'>smote him again sore, and so they were on the one side and on the</a>
<a id='line_3777'>other, that Sir Gawaine and Gaheris were in jeopardy of their lives;</a>
<a id='line_3778'>and one with a bow, an archer, smote Sir Gawaine through the arm that</a>
<a id='line_3779'>it grieved him wonderly sore. And as they should have been slain, there</a>
<a id='line_3780'>came four fair ladies, and besought the knights of grace for Sir</a>
<a id='line_3781'>Gawaine; and goodly at request of the ladies they gave Sir Gawaine and</a>
<a id='line_3782'>Gaheris their lives, and made them to yield them as prisoners. Then</a>
<a id='line_3783'>Gawaine and Gaheris made great dole. Alas! said Sir Gawaine, mine arm</a>
<a id='line_3784'>grieveth me sore, I am like to be maimed; and so made his complaint</a>
<a id='line_3785'>piteously.</a>
<a id='line_3786'></a>
<a id='line_3787'>Early on the morrow there came to Sir Gawaine one of the four ladies</a>
<a id='line_3788'>that had heard all his complaint, and said, Sir knight, what cheer? Not</a>
<a id='line_3789'>good, said he. It is your own default, said the lady, for ye have done</a>
<a id='line_3790'>a passing foul deed in the slaying of the lady, the which will be great</a>
<a id='line_3791'>villainy unto you. But be ye not of King Arthur’s kin? said the lady.</a>
<a id='line_3792'>Yes truly, said Sir Gawaine. What is your name? said the lady, ye must</a>
<a id='line_3793'>tell it me or ye pass. My name is Gawaine, the King Lot of Orkney’s</a>
<a id='line_3794'>son, and my mother is King Arthur’s sister. Ah! then are ye nephew unto</a>
<a id='line_3795'>King Arthur, said the lady, and I shall so speak for you that ye shall</a>
<a id='line_3796'>have conduct to go to King Arthur for his love. And so she departed and</a>
<a id='line_3797'>told the four knights how their prisoner was King Arthur’s nephew, and</a>
<a id='line_3798'>his name is Sir Gawaine, King Lot’s son of Orkney. And they gave him</a>
<a id='line_3799'>the hart’s head because it was in his quest. Then anon they delivered</a>
<a id='line_3800'>Sir Gawaine under this promise, that he should bear the dead lady with</a>
<a id='line_3801'>him in this manner; the head of her was hanged about his neck, and the</a>
<a id='line_3802'>whole body of her lay before him on his horse’s mane. Right so rode he</a>
<a id='line_3803'>forth unto Camelot. And anon as he was come, Merlin desired of King</a>
<a id='line_3804'>Arthur that Sir Gawaine should be sworn to tell of all his adventures,</a>
<a id='line_3805'>and how he slew the lady, and how he would give no mercy unto the</a>
<a id='line_3806'>knight, wherethrough the lady was slain. Then the king and the queen</a>
<a id='line_3807'>were greatly displeased with Sir Gawaine for the slaying of the lady.</a>
<a id='line_3808'>And there by ordinance of the queen there was set a quest of ladies on</a>
<a id='line_3809'>Sir Gawaine, and they judged him for ever while he lived to be with all</a>
<a id='line_3810'>ladies, and to fight for their quarrels; and that ever he should be</a>
<a id='line_3811'>courteous, and never to refuse mercy to him that asketh mercy. Thus was</a>
<a id='line_3812'>Gawaine sworn upon the Four Evangelists that he should never be against</a>
<a id='line_3813'>lady nor gentlewoman, but if he fought for a lady and his adversary</a>
<a id='line_3814'>fought for another. And thus endeth the adventure of Sir Gawaine that</a>
<a id='line_3815'>he did at the marriage of King Arthur. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_3816'></a>
<a id='line_3817'></a>
<a id='line_3818'></a>
<a id='line_3819'>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Tor rode after the knight with the brachet, and of</a>
<a id='line_3820'>his adventure by the way.</a>
<a id='line_3821'></a>
<a id='line_3822'>When Sir Tor was ready, he mounted upon his horseback, and rode after</a>
<a id='line_3823'>the knight with the brachet. So as he rode he met with a dwarf suddenly</a>
<a id='line_3824'>that smote his horse on the head with a staff, that he went backward</a>
<a id='line_3825'>his spear length. Why dost thou so? said Sir Tor. For thou shalt not</a>
<a id='line_3826'>pass this way, but if thou joust with yonder knights of the pavilions.</a>
<a id='line_3827'>Then was Tor ware where two pavilions were, and great spears stood out,</a>
<a id='line_3828'>and two shields hung on trees by the pavilions. I may not tarry, said</a>
<a id='line_3829'>Sir Tor, for I am in a quest that I must needs follow. Thou shalt not</a>
<a id='line_3830'>pass, said the dwarf, and therewithal he blew his horn. Then there came</a>
<a id='line_3831'>one armed on horseback, and dressed his shield, and came fast toward</a>
<a id='line_3832'>Tor, and he dressed him against him, and so ran together that Tor bare</a>
<a id='line_3833'>him from his horse. And anon the knight yielded him to his mercy. But,</a>
<a id='line_3834'>sir, I have a fellow in yonder pavilion that will have ado with you</a>
<a id='line_3835'>anon. He shall be welcome, said Sir Tor. Then was he ware of another</a>
<a id='line_3836'>knight coming with great raundon, and each of them dressed to other,</a>
<a id='line_3837'>that marvel it was to see; but the knight smote Sir Tor a great stroke</a>
<a id='line_3838'>in midst of the shield that his spear all to-shivered. And Sir Tor</a>
<a id='line_3839'>smote him through the shield below of the shield that it went through</a>
<a id='line_3840'>the cost of the knight, but the stroke slew him not. And therewith Sir</a>
<a id='line_3841'>Tor alighted and smote him on the helm a great stroke, and therewith</a>
<a id='line_3842'>the knight yielded him and besought him of mercy. I will well, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_3843'>Tor, but thou and thy fellow must go unto King Arthur, and yield you</a>
<a id='line_3844'>prisoners unto him. By whom shall we say are we thither sent? Ye shall</a>
<a id='line_3845'>say by the knight that went in the quest of the knight that went with</a>
<a id='line_3846'>the brachet. Now, what be your two names? said Sir Tor. My name is,</a>
<a id='line_3847'>said the one, Sir Felot of Langduk; and my name is, said the other, Sir</a>
<a id='line_3848'>Petipase of Winchelsea. Now go ye forth, said Sir Tor, and God speed</a>
<a id='line_3849'>you and me. Then came the dwarf and said unto Sir Tor, I pray you give</a>
<a id='line_3850'>me a gift. I will well, said Sir Tor, ask. I ask no more, said the</a>
<a id='line_3851'>dwarf, but that ye will suffer me to do you service, for I will serve</a>
<a id='line_3852'>no more recreant knights. Take an horse, said Sir Tor, and ride on with</a>
<a id='line_3853'>me. I wot ye ride after the knight with the white brachet, and I shall</a>
<a id='line_3854'>bring you where he is, said the dwarf. And so they rode throughout a</a>
<a id='line_3855'>forest, and at the last they were ware of two pavilions, even by a</a>
<a id='line_3856'>priory, with two shields, and the one shield was enewed with white, and</a>
<a id='line_3857'>the other shield was red.</a>

<a id='line_3862'>assailed him for the said brachet.</a>
<a id='line_3863'></a>
<a id='line_3864'>Therewith Sir Tor alighted and took the dwarf his glaive, and so he</a>
<a id='line_3865'>came to the white pavilion, and saw three damosels lie in it, on one</a>
<a id='line_3866'>pallet, sleeping, and so he went to the other pavilion, and found a</a>
<a id='line_3867'>lady lying sleeping therein, but there was the white brachet that bayed</a>
<a id='line_3868'>at her fast, and therewith the lady yede out of the pavilion and all</a>
<a id='line_3869'>her damosels. But anon as Sir Tor espied the white brachet, he took her</a>
<a id='line_3870'>by force and took her to the dwarf. What, will ye so, said the lady,</a>
<a id='line_3871'>take my brachet from me? Yea, said Sir Tor, this brachet have I sought</a>
<a id='line_3872'>from King Arthur’s court hither. Well, said the lady, knight, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_3873'>not go far with her, but that ye shall be met and grieved. I shall</a>
<a id='line_3874'>abide what adventure that cometh by the grace of God, and so mounted</a>
<a id='line_3875'>upon his horse, and passed on his way toward Camelot; but it was so</a>
<a id='line_3876'>near night he might not pass but little further. Know ye any lodging?</a>
<a id='line_3877'>said Tor. I know none, said the dwarf, but here beside is an hermitage,</a>
<a id='line_3878'>and there ye must take lodging as ye find. And within a while they came</a>
<a id='line_3879'>to the hermitage and took lodging; and was there grass, oats and bread</a>
<a id='line_3880'>for their horses; soon it was sped, and full hard was their supper; but</a>
<a id='line_3881'>there they rested them all night till on the morn, and heard a mass</a>
<a id='line_3882'>devoutly, and took their leave of the hermit, and Sir Tor prayed the</a>
<a id='line_3883'>hermit to pray for him. He said he would, and betook him to God. And so</a>
<a id='line_3884'>mounted upon horseback and rode towards Camelot a long while.</a>
<a id='line_3885'></a>
<a id='line_3886'>With that they heard a knight call loud that came after them, and he</a>
<a id='line_3887'>said, Knight, abide and yield my brachet that thou took from my lady.</a>
<a id='line_3888'>Sir Tor returned again, and beheld him how he was a seemly knight and</a>
<a id='line_3889'>well horsed, and well armed at all points; then Sir Tor dressed his</a>
<a id='line_3890'>shield, and took his spear in his hands, and the other came fiercely</a>
<a id='line_3891'>upon him, and smote both horse and man to the earth. Anon they arose</a>
<a id='line_3892'>lightly and drew their swords as eagerly as lions, and put their</a>
<a id='line_3893'>shields afore them, and smote through the shields, that the cantels</a>
<a id='line_3894'>fell off both parties. Also they tamed their helms that the hot blood</a>
<a id='line_3895'>ran out, and the thick mails of their hauberks they carved and rove in</a>
<a id='line_3896'>sunder that the hot blood ran to the earth, and both they had many</a>
<a id='line_3897'>wounds and were passing weary. But Sir Tor espied that the other knight</a>
<a id='line_3898'>fainted, and then he sued fast upon him, and doubled his strokes, and</a>
<a id='line_3899'>gart him go to the earth on the one side. Then Sir Tor bade him yield</a>
<a id='line_3900'>him. That will I not, said Abelleus, while my life lasteth and the soul</a>
<a id='line_3901'>is within my body, unless that thou wilt give me the brachet. That will</a>
<a id='line_3902'>I not do, said Sir Tor, for it was my quest to bring again thy brachet,</a>
<a id='line_3903'>thee, or both.</a>

<a id='line_3905'></a>

<a id='line_3907'>CHAPTER XI. How Sir Tor overcame the knight, and how he lost his head</a>
<a id='line_3908'>at the request of a lady.</a>
<a id='line_3909'></a>
<a id='line_3910'>With that came a damosel riding on a palfrey as fast as she might</a>
<a id='line_3911'>drive, and cried with a loud voice unto Sir Tor. What will ye with me?</a>
<a id='line_3912'>said Sir Tor. I beseech thee, said the damosel, for King Arthur’s love,</a>
<a id='line_3913'>give me a gift; I require thee, gentle knight, as thou art a gentleman.</a>
<a id='line_3914'>Now, said Tor, ask a gift and I will give it you. Gramercy, said the</a>
<a id='line_3915'>damosel; now I ask the head of the false knight Abelleus, for he is the</a>
<a id='line_3916'>most outrageous knight that liveth, and the greatest murderer. I am</a>
<a id='line_3917'>loath, said Sir Tor, of that gift I have given you; let him make amends</a>
<a id='line_3918'>in that he hath trespassed unto you. Now, said the damosel, he may not,</a>
<a id='line_3919'>for he slew mine own brother before mine own eyes, that was a better</a>
<a id='line_3920'>knight than he, an he had had grace; and I kneeled half an hour afore</a>
<a id='line_3921'>him in the mire for to save my brother’s life, that had done him no</a>
<a id='line_3922'>damage, but fought with him by adventure of arms, and so for all that I</a>
<a id='line_3923'>could do he struck off his head; wherefore I require thee, as thou art</a>
<a id='line_3924'>a true knight, to give me my gift, or else I shall shame thee in all</a>
<a id='line_3925'>the court of King Arthur; for he is the falsest knight living, and a</a>
<a id='line_3926'>great destroyer of good knights. Then when Abelleus heard this, he was</a>
<a id='line_3927'>more afeard, and yielded him and asked mercy. I may not now, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_3928'>Tor, but if I should be found false of my promise; for while I would</a>
<a id='line_3929'>have taken you to mercy ye would none ask, but if ye had the brachet</a>
<a id='line_3930'>again, that was my quest. And therewith he took off his helm, and he</a>
<a id='line_3931'>arose and fled, and Sir Tor after him, and smote off his head quite.</a>
<a id='line_3932'></a>
<a id='line_3933'>Now sir, said the damosel, it is near night; I pray you come and lodge</a>
<a id='line_3934'>with me here at my place, it is here fast by. I will well, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_3935'>Tor, for his horse and he had fared evil since they departed from</a>
<a id='line_3936'>Camelot, and so he rode with her, and had passing good cheer with her;</a>
<a id='line_3937'>and she had a passing fair old knight to her husband that made him</a>
<a id='line_3938'>passing good cheer, and well eased both his horse and him. And on the</a>
<a id='line_3939'>morn he heard his mass, and brake his fast, and took his leave of the</a>
<a id='line_3940'>knight and of the lady, that besought him to tell them his name. Truly,</a>
<a id='line_3941'>he said, my name is Sir Tor that was late made knight, and this was the</a>
<a id='line_3942'>first quest of arms that ever I did, to bring again that this knight</a>
<a id='line_3943'>Abelleus took away from King Arthur’s court. O fair knight, said the</a>
<a id='line_3944'>lady and her husband, an ye come here in our marches, come and see our</a>
<a id='line_3945'>poor lodging, and it shall be always at your commandment. So Sir Tor</a>
<a id='line_3946'>departed and came to Camelot on the third day by noon, and the king and</a>
<a id='line_3947'>the queen and all the court was passing fain of his coming, and made</a>
<a id='line_3948'>great joy that he was come again; for he went from the court with</a>
<a id='line_3949'>little succour, but as King Pellinore his father gave him an old</a>
<a id='line_3950'>courser, and King Arthur gave him armour and a sword, and else had he</a>
<a id='line_3951'>none other succour, but rode so forth himself alone. And then the king</a>
<a id='line_3952'>and the queen by Merlin’s advice made him to swear to tell of his</a>
<a id='line_3953'>adventures, and so he told and made proofs of his deeds as it is afore</a>
<a id='line_3954'>rehearsed, wherefore the king and the queen made great joy. Nay, nay,</a>
<a id='line_3955'>said Merlin, these be but japes to that he shall do; for he shall prove</a>
<a id='line_3956'>a noble knight of prowess, as good as any is living, and gentle and</a>
<a id='line_3957'>courteous, and of good tatches, and passing true of his promise, and</a>
<a id='line_3958'>never shall outrage. Wherethrough Merlin’s words King Arthur gave him</a>
<a id='line_3959'>an earldom of lands that fell unto him. And here endeth the quest of</a>
<a id='line_3960'>Sir Tor, King Pellinore’s son.</a>

<a id='line_3962'></a>
<a id='line_3963'></a>
<a id='line_3964'>CHAPTER XII. How King Pellinore rode after the lady and the knight that</a>
<a id='line_3965'>led her away, and how a lady desired help of him, and how he fought</a>
<a id='line_3966'>with two knights for that lady, of whom he slew the one at the first</a>
<a id='line_3967'>stroke.</a>
<a id='line_3968'></a>
<a id='line_3969'>Then King Pellinore armed him and mounted upon his horse, and rode more</a>
<a id='line_3970'>than a pace after the lady that the knight led away. And as he rode in</a>
<a id='line_3971'>a forest, he saw in a valley a damosel sit by a well, and a wounded</a>
<a id='line_3972'>knight in her arms, and Pellinore saluted her. And when she was ware of</a>
<a id='line_3973'>him, she cried overloud, Help me, knight; for Christ’s sake, King</a>
<a id='line_3974'>Pellinore. And he would not tarry, he was so eager in his quest, and</a>
<a id='line_3975'>ever she cried an hundred times after help. When she saw he would not</a>
<a id='line_3976'>abide, she prayed unto God to send him as much need of help as she had,</a>
<a id='line_3977'>and that he might feel it or he died. So, as the book telleth, the</a>
<a id='line_3978'>knight there died that there was wounded, wherefore the lady for pure</a>
<a id='line_3979'>sorrow slew herself with his sword. As King Pellinore rode in that</a>
<a id='line_3980'>valley he met with a poor man, a labourer. Sawest thou not, said</a>
<a id='line_3981'>Pellinore, a knight riding and leading away a lady? Yea, said the man,</a>
<a id='line_3982'>I saw that knight, and the lady that made great dole; and yonder</a>
<a id='line_3983'>beneath in a valley there shall ye see two pavilions, and one of the</a>
<a id='line_3984'>knights of the pavilions challenged that lady of that knight, and said</a>
<a id='line_3985'>she was his cousin near, wherefore he should lead her no farther. And</a>
<a id='line_3986'>so they waged battle in that quarrel, the one said he would have her by</a>
<a id='line_3987'>force, and the other said he would have the rule of her, by cause he</a>
<a id='line_3988'>was her kinsman, and would lead her to her kin. For this quarrel he</a>
<a id='line_3989'>left them fighting. And if ye will ride a pace ye shall find them</a>
<a id='line_3990'>fighting, and the lady was beleft with the two squires in the</a>
<a id='line_3991'>pavilions. God thank thee, said King Pellinore.</a>
<a id='line_3992'></a>
<a id='line_3993'>Then he rode a wallop till he had a sight of the two pavilions, and the</a>
<a id='line_3994'>two knights fighting. Anon he rode unto the pavilions, and saw the lady</a>
<a id='line_3995'>that was his quest, and said, Fair lady, ye must go with me unto the</a>
<a id='line_3996'>court of King Arthur. Sir knight, said the two squires that were with</a>
<a id='line_3997'>her, yonder are two knights that fight for this lady, go thither and</a>
<a id='line_3998'>depart them, and be agreed with them, and then may ye have her at your</a>
<a id='line_3999'>pleasure. Ye say well, said King Pellinore. And anon he rode betwixt</a>
<a id='line_4000'>them, and departed them, and asked them the causes why that they</a>
<a id='line_4001'>fought? Sir knight, said the one, I shall tell you, this lady is my</a>
<a id='line_4002'>kinswoman nigh, mine aunt’s daughter, and when I heard her complain</a>
<a id='line_4003'>that she was with him maugre her head, I waged battle to fight with</a>
<a id='line_4004'>him. Sir knight, said the other, whose name was Hontzlake of Wentland,</a>
<a id='line_4005'>and this lady I gat by my prowess of arms this day at Arthur’s court.</a>
<a id='line_4006'>That is untruly said, said King Pellinore, for ye came in suddenly</a>
<a id='line_4007'>there as we were at the high feast, and took away this lady or any man</a>
<a id='line_4008'>might make him ready; and therefore it was my quest to bring her again</a>
<a id='line_4009'>and you both, or else the one of us to abide in the field; therefore</a>
<a id='line_4010'>the lady shall go with me, or I will die for it, for I have promised it</a>
<a id='line_4011'>King Arthur. And therefore fight ye no more, for none of you shall have</a>
<a id='line_4012'>no part of her at this time; and if ye list to fight for her, fight</a>
<a id='line_4013'>with me, and I will defend her. Well, said the knights, make you ready,</a>
<a id='line_4014'>and we shall assail you with all our power. And as King Pellinore would</a>
<a id='line_4015'>have put his horse from them, Sir Hontzlake rove his horse through with</a>
<a id='line_4016'>a sword, and said: Now art thou on foot as well as we are. When King</a>
<a id='line_4017'>Pellinore espied that his horse was slain, lightly he leapt from his</a>
<a id='line_4018'>horse and pulled out his sword, and put his shield afore him, and said,</a>
<a id='line_4019'>Knight, keep well thy head, for thou shalt have a buffet for the</a>
<a id='line_4020'>slaying of my horse. So King Pellinore gave him such a stroke upon the</a>
<a id='line_4021'>helm that he clave the head down to the chin, that he fell to the earth</a>
<a id='line_4022'>dead.</a>

<a id='line_4026'>CHAPTER XIII. How King Pellinore gat the lady and brought her to</a>
<a id='line_4027'>Camelot to the court of King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_4028'></a>
<a id='line_4029'>And then he turned him to the other knight, that was sore wounded. But</a>
<a id='line_4030'>when he saw the other’s buffet, he would not fight, but kneeled down</a>
<a id='line_4031'>and said, Take my cousin the lady with you at your request, and I</a>
<a id='line_4032'>require you, as ye be a true knight, put her to no shame nor villainy.</a>
<a id='line_4033'>What, said King Pellinore, will ye not fight for her? No, sir, said the</a>
<a id='line_4034'>knight, I will not fight with such a knight of prowess as ye be. Well,</a>
<a id='line_4035'>said Pellinore, ye say well; I promise you she shall have no villainy</a>
<a id='line_4036'>by me, as I am true knight; but now me lacketh an horse, said</a>
<a id='line_4037'>Pellinore, but I will have Hontzlake’s horse. Ye shall not need, said</a>
<a id='line_4038'>the knight, for I shall give you such an horse as shall please you, so</a>
<a id='line_4039'>that you will lodge with me, for it is near night. I will well, said</a>
<a id='line_4040'>King Pellinore, abide with you all night. And there he had with him</a>
<a id='line_4041'>right good cheer, and fared of the best with passing good wine, and had</a>
<a id='line_4042'>merry rest that night. And on the morn he heard a mass and dined; and</a>
<a id='line_4043'>then was brought him a fair bay courser, and King Pellinore’s saddle</a>
<a id='line_4044'>set upon him. Now, what shall I call you? said the knight, inasmuch as</a>
<a id='line_4045'>ye have my cousin at your desire of your quest. Sir, I shall tell you,</a>
<a id='line_4046'>my name is King Pellinore of the Isles and knight of the Table Round.</a>
<a id='line_4047'>Now I am glad, said the knight, that such a noble man shall have the</a>
<a id='line_4048'>rule of my cousin. Now, what is your name? said Pellinore, I pray you</a>
<a id='line_4049'>tell me. Sir, my name is Sir Meliot of Logurs, and this lady my cousin</a>
<a id='line_4050'>hight Nimue, and the knight that was in the other pavilion is my sworn</a>
<a id='line_4051'>brother, a passing good knight, and his name is Brian of the Isles, and</a>
<a id='line_4052'>he is full loath to do wrong, and full loath to fight with any man, but</a>
<a id='line_4053'>if he be sore sought on, so that for shame he may not leave it. It is</a>
<a id='line_4054'>marvel, said Pellinore, that he will not have ado with me. Sir, he will</a>
<a id='line_4055'>not have ado with no man but if it be at his request. Bring him to the</a>
<a id='line_4056'>court, said Pellinore, one of these days. Sir, we will come together.</a>
<a id='line_4057'>And ye shall be welcome, said Pellinore, to the court of King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_4058'>and greatly allowed for your coming. And so he departed with the lady,</a>
<a id='line_4059'>and brought her to Camelot.</a>
<a id='line_4060'></a>
<a id='line_4061'>So as they rode in a valley it was full of stones, and there the lady’s</a>
<a id='line_4062'>horse stumbled and threw her down, that her arm was sore bruised and</a>
<a id='line_4063'>near she swooned for pain. Alas! sir, said the lady, mine arm is out of</a>
<a id='line_4064'>lithe, wherethrough I must needs rest me. Ye shall well, said King</a>
<a id='line_4065'>Pellinore. And so he alighted under a fair tree where was fair grass,</a>
<a id='line_4066'>and he put his horse thereto, and so laid him under the tree and slept</a>
<a id='line_4067'>till it was nigh night. And when he awoke he would have ridden. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_4068'>said the lady, it is so dark that ye may as well ride backward as</a>
<a id='line_4069'>forward. So they abode still and made there their lodging. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_4070'>Pellinore put off his armour; then a little afore midnight they heard</a>
<a id='line_4071'>the trotting of an horse. Be ye still, said King Pellinore, for we</a>
<a id='line_4072'>shall hear of some adventure.</a>
<a id='line_4073'></a>
<a id='line_4074'></a>
<a id='line_4075'></a>
<a id='line_4076'>CHAPTER XIV. How on the way he heard two knights, as he lay by night in</a>
<a id='line_4077'>a valley, and of their adventures.</a>
<a id='line_4078'></a>
<a id='line_4079'>And therewith he armed him. So right even afore him there met two</a>
<a id='line_4080'>knights, the one came froward Camelot, and the other from the north,</a>
<a id='line_4081'>and either saluted other. What tidings at Camelot? said the one. By my</a>
<a id='line_4082'>head, said the other, there have I been and espied the court of King</a>
<a id='line_4083'>Arthur, and there is such a fellowship they may never be broken, and</a>
<a id='line_4084'>well-nigh all the world holdeth with Arthur, for there is the flower of</a>
<a id='line_4085'>chivalry. Now for this cause I am riding into the north, to tell our</a>
<a id='line_4086'>chieftains of the fellowship that is withholden with King Arthur. As</a>
<a id='line_4087'>for that, said the other knight, I have brought a remedy with me, that</a>
<a id='line_4088'>is the greatest poison that ever ye heard speak of, and to Camelot will</a>
<a id='line_4089'>I with it, for we have a friend right nigh King Arthur, and well</a>
<a id='line_4090'>cherished, that shall poison King Arthur; for so he hath promised our</a>
<a id='line_4091'>chieftains, and received great gifts for to do it. Beware, said the</a>
<a id='line_4092'>other knight, of Merlin, for he knoweth all things by the devil’s</a>
<a id='line_4093'>craft. Therefore will I not let it, said the knight. And so they</a>
<a id='line_4094'>departed asunder. Anon after Pellinore made him ready, and his lady,</a>
<a id='line_4095'>[and] rode toward Camelot; and as they came by the well there as the</a>
<a id='line_4096'>wounded knight was and the lady, there he found the knight, and the</a>
<a id='line_4097'>lady eaten with lions or wild beasts, all save the head, wherefore he</a>
<a id='line_4098'>made great sorrow, and wept passing sore, and said, Alas! her life</a>
<a id='line_4099'>might I have saved; but I was so fierce in my quest, therefore I would</a>
<a id='line_4100'>not abide. Wherefore make ye such dole? said the lady. I wot not, said</a>
<a id='line_4101'>Pellinore, but my heart mourneth sore of the death of her, for she was</a>
<a id='line_4102'>a passing fair lady and a young. Now, will ye do by mine advice? said</a>
<a id='line_4103'>the lady, take this knight and let him be buried in an hermitage, and</a>
<a id='line_4104'>then take the lady’s head and bear it with you unto Arthur. So King</a>
<a id='line_4105'>Pellinore took this dead knight on his shoulders, and brought him to</a>
<a id='line_4106'>the hermitage, and charged the hermit with the corpse, that service</a>
<a id='line_4107'>should be done for the soul; and take his harness for your pain. It</a>
<a id='line_4108'>shall be done, said the hermit, as I will answer unto God.</a>
<a id='line_4109'></a>
<a id='line_4110'></a>
<a id='line_4111'></a>
<a id='line_4112'>CHAPTER XV. How when he was come to Camelot he was sworn upon a book to</a>
<a id='line_4113'>tell the truth of his quest.</a>
<a id='line_4114'></a>
<a id='line_4115'>And therewith they departed, and came there as the head of the lady lay</a>
<a id='line_4116'>with a fair yellow hair that grieved King Pellinore passingly sore when</a>
<a id='line_4117'>he looked on it, for much he cast his heart on the visage. And so by</a>
<a id='line_4118'>noon they came to Camelot; and the king and the queen were passing fain</a>
<a id='line_4119'>of his coming to the court. And there he was made to swear upon the</a>
<a id='line_4120'>Four Evangelists, to tell the truth of his quest from the one to the</a>
<a id='line_4121'>other. Ah! Sir Pellinore, said Queen Guenever, ye were greatly to blame</a>
<a id='line_4122'>that ye saved not this lady’s life. Madam, said Pellinore, ye were</a>
<a id='line_4123'>greatly to blame an ye would not save your own life an ye might, but,</a>
<a id='line_4124'>save your pleasure, I was so furious in my quest that I would not</a>
<a id='line_4125'>abide, and that repenteth me, and shall the days of my life. Truly,</a>
<a id='line_4126'>said Merlin, ye ought sore to repent it, for that lady was your own</a>
<a id='line_4127'>daughter begotten on the lady of the Rule, and that knight that was</a>
<a id='line_4128'>dead was her love, and should have wedded her, and he was a right good</a>
<a id='line_4129'>knight of a young man, and would have proved a good man, and to this</a>
<a id='line_4130'>court was he coming, and his name was Sir Miles of the Launds, and a</a>
<a id='line_4131'>knight came behind him and slew him with a spear, and his name is</a>
<a id='line_4132'>Loraine le Savage, a false knight and a coward; and she for great</a>
<a id='line_4133'>sorrow and dole slew herself with his sword, and her name was Eleine.</a>
<a id='line_4134'>And because ye would not abide and help her, ye shall see your best</a>
<a id='line_4135'>friend fail you when ye be in the greatest distress that ever ye were</a>
<a id='line_4136'>or shall be. And that penance God hath ordained you for that deed, that</a>
<a id='line_4137'>he that ye shall most trust to of any man alive, he shall leave you</a>
<a id='line_4138'>there ye shall be slain. Me forthinketh, said King Pellinore, that this</a>
<a id='line_4139'>shall me betide, but God may fordo well destiny.</a>
<a id='line_4140'></a>
<a id='line_4141'>Thus, when the quest was done of the white hart, the which followed Sir</a>
<a id='line_4142'>Gawaine; and the quest of the brachet, followed of Sir Tor, Pellinore’s</a>
<a id='line_4143'>son; and the quest of the lady that the knight took away, the which</a>
<a id='line_4144'>King Pellinore at that time followed; then the king stablished all his</a>
<a id='line_4145'>knights, and them that were of lands not rich he gave them lands, and</a>
<a id='line_4146'>charged them never to do outrageousity nor murder, and always to flee</a>
<a id='line_4147'>treason; also, by no means to be cruel, but to give mercy unto him that</a>
<a id='line_4148'>asketh mercy, upon pain of forfeiture of their worship and lordship of</a>
<a id='line_4149'>King Arthur for evermore; and always to do ladies, damosels, and</a>
<a id='line_4150'>gentlewomen succour, upon pain of death. Also, that no man take no</a>
<a id='line_4151'>battles in a wrongful quarrel for no law, nor for no world’s goods.</a>
<a id='line_4152'>Unto this were all the knights sworn of the Table Round, both old and</a>
<a id='line_4153'>young. And every year were they sworn at the high feast of Pentecost.</a>

<a id='line_4165'></a>
<a id='line_4166'>So after these quests of Sir Gawaine, Sir Tor, and King Pellinore, it</a>
<a id='line_4167'>fell so that Merlin fell in a dotage on the damosel that King Pellinore</a>
<a id='line_4168'>brought to court, and she was one of the damosels of the lake, that</a>
<a id='line_4169'>hight Nimue. But Merlin would let her have no rest, but always he would</a>
<a id='line_4170'>be with her. And ever she made Merlin good cheer till she had learned</a>
<a id='line_4171'>of him all manner thing that she desired; and he was assotted upon her,</a>
<a id='line_4172'>that he might not be from her. So on a time he told King Arthur that he</a>
<a id='line_4173'>should not dure long, but for all his crafts he should be put in the</a>
<a id='line_4174'>earth quick. And so he told the king many things that should befall,</a>
<a id='line_4175'>but always he warned the king to keep well his sword and the scabbard,</a>
<a id='line_4176'>for he told him how the sword and the scabbard should be stolen by a</a>
<a id='line_4177'>woman from him that he most trusted. Also he told King Arthur that he</a>
<a id='line_4178'>should miss him,—Yet had ye liefer than all your lands to have me</a>
<a id='line_4179'>again. Ah, said the king, since ye know of your adventure, purvey for</a>
<a id='line_4180'>it, and put away by your crafts that misadventure. Nay, said Merlin, it</a>
<a id='line_4181'>will not be; so he departed from the king. And within a while the</a>
<a id='line_4182'>Damosel of the Lake departed, and Merlin went with her evermore</a>
<a id='line_4183'>wheresomever she went. And ofttimes Merlin would have had her privily</a>
<a id='line_4184'>away by his subtle crafts; then she made him to swear that he should</a>
<a id='line_4185'>never do none enchantment upon her if he would have his will. And so he</a>
<a id='line_4186'>sware; so she and Merlin went over the sea unto the land of Benwick,</a>
<a id='line_4187'>whereas King Ban was king that had great war against King Claudas, and</a>
<a id='line_4188'>there Merlin spake with King Ban’s wife, a fair lady and a good, and</a>
<a id='line_4189'>her name was Elaine, and there he saw young Launcelot. There the queen</a>
<a id='line_4190'>made great sorrow for the mortal war that King Claudas made on her lord</a>
<a id='line_4191'>and on her lands. Take none heaviness, said Merlin, for this same child</a>
<a id='line_4192'>within this twenty year shall revenge you on King Claudas, that all</a>
<a id='line_4193'>Christendom shall speak of it; and this same child shall be the most</a>
<a id='line_4194'>man of worship of the world, and his first name is Galahad, that know I</a>
<a id='line_4195'>well, said Merlin, and since ye have confirmed him Launcelot. That is</a>
<a id='line_4196'>truth, said the queen, his first name was Galahad. O Merlin, said the</a>
<a id='line_4197'>queen, shall I live to see my son such a man of prowess? Yea, lady, on</a>
<a id='line_4198'>my peril ye shall see it, and live many winters after.</a>
<a id='line_4199'></a>
<a id='line_4200'>And so, soon after, the lady and Merlin departed, and by the way Merlin</a>
<a id='line_4201'>showed her many wonders, and came into Cornwall. And always Merlin lay</a>
<a id='line_4202'>about the lady to have her maidenhood, and she was ever passing weary</a>
<a id='line_4203'>of him, and fain would have been delivered of him, for she was afeard</a>
<a id='line_4204'>of him because he was a devil’s son, and she could not beskift him by</a>
<a id='line_4205'>no mean. And so on a time it happed that Merlin showed to her in a rock</a>
<a id='line_4206'>whereas was a great wonder, and wrought by enchantment, that went under</a>
<a id='line_4207'>a great stone. So by her subtle working she made Merlin to go under</a>
<a id='line_4208'>that stone to let her wit of the marvels there; but she wrought so</a>
<a id='line_4209'>there for him that he came never out for all the craft he could do. And</a>
<a id='line_4210'>so she departed and left Merlin.</a>

<a id='line_4221'>Soleise, and the king of the Isle of Longtains, all these five kings</a>
<a id='line_4222'>with a great host were entered into the land of King Arthur, and burnt</a>
<a id='line_4223'>and slew clean afore them, both cities and castles, that it was pity to</a>
<a id='line_4224'>hear. Alas, said Arthur, yet had I never rest one month since I was</a>
<a id='line_4225'>crowned king of this land. Now shall I never rest till I meet with</a>
<a id='line_4226'>those kings in a fair field, that I make mine avow; for my true liege</a>
<a id='line_4227'>people shall not be destroyed in my default, go with me who will, and</a>
<a id='line_4228'>abide who that will. Then the king let write unto King Pellinore, and</a>
<a id='line_4229'>prayed him in all haste to make him ready with such people as he might</a>
<a id='line_4230'>lightliest rear and hie him after in all haste. All the barons were</a>
<a id='line_4231'>privily wroth that the king would depart so suddenly; but the king by</a>
<a id='line_4232'>no mean would abide, but made writing unto them that were not there,</a>
<a id='line_4233'>and bade them hie after him, such as were not at that time in the</a>
<a id='line_4234'>court. Then the king came to Queen Guenever, and said, Lady, make you</a>
<a id='line_4235'>ready, for ye shall go with me, for I may not long miss you; ye shall</a>
<a id='line_4236'>cause me to be the more hardy, what adventure so befall me; I will not</a>
<a id='line_4237'>wit my lady to be in no jeopardy. Sir, said she, I am at your</a>
<a id='line_4238'>commandment, and shall be ready what time so ye be ready. So on the</a>
<a id='line_4239'>morn the king and the queen departed with such fellowship as they had,</a>
<a id='line_4240'>and came into the north, into a forest beside Humber, and there lodged</a>
<a id='line_4241'>them. When the word and tiding came unto the five kings above said,</a>
<a id='line_4242'>that Arthur was beside Humber in a forest, there was a knight, brother</a>
<a id='line_4243'>unto one of the five kings, that gave them this counsel: Ye know well</a>
<a id='line_4244'>that Sir Arthur hath the flower of chivalry of the world with him, as</a>
<a id='line_4245'>it is proved by the great battle he did with the eleven kings; and</a>
<a id='line_4246'>therefore hie unto him night and day till that we be nigh him, for the</a>
<a id='line_4247'>longer he tarrieth the bigger he is, and we ever the weaker; and he is</a>
<a id='line_4248'>so courageous of himself that he is come to the field with little</a>
<a id='line_4249'>people, and therefore let us set upon him or day and we shall slay</a>
<a id='line_4250'>down; of his knights there shall none escape.</a>
<a id='line_4251'></a>
<a id='line_4252'></a>
<a id='line_4253'></a>
<a id='line_4254'>CHAPTER III. How King Arthur had ado with them and overthrew them, and</a>
<a id='line_4255'>slew the five kings and made the remnant to flee.</a>
<a id='line_4256'></a>
<a id='line_4257'>Unto this counsel these five kings assented, and so they passed forth</a>
<a id='line_4258'>with their host through North Wales, and came upon Arthur by night, and</a>
<a id='line_4259'>set upon his host as the king and his knights were in their pavilions.</a>
<a id='line_4260'>King Arthur was unarmed, and had laid him to rest with his Queen</a>
<a id='line_4261'>Guenever. Sir, said Sir Kay, it is not good we be unarmed. We shall</a>
<a id='line_4262'>have no need, said Sir Gawaine and Sir Griflet, that lay in a little</a>
<a id='line_4263'>pavilion by the king. With that they heard a great noise, and many</a>
<a id='line_4264'>cried, Treason, treason! Alas, said King Arthur, we be betrayed! Unto</a>
<a id='line_4265'>arms, fellows, then he cried. So they were armed anon at all points.</a>
<a id='line_4266'>Then came there a wounded knight unto the king, and said, Sir, save</a>
<a id='line_4267'>yourself and my lady the queen, for our host is destroyed, and much</a>
<a id='line_4268'>people of ours slain. So anon the king and the queen and the three</a>
<a id='line_4269'>knights took their horses, and rode toward Humber to pass over it, and</a>
<a id='line_4270'>the water was so rough that they were afraid to pass over. Now may ye</a>
<a id='line_4271'>choose, said King Arthur, whether ye will abide and take the adventure</a>
<a id='line_4272'>on this side, for an ye be taken they will slay you. It were me liefer,</a>
<a id='line_4273'>said the queen, to die in the water than to fall in your enemies’ hands</a>
<a id='line_4274'>and there be slain.</a>
<a id='line_4275'></a>
<a id='line_4276'>And as they stood so talking, Sir Kay saw the five kings coming on</a>
<a id='line_4277'>horseback by themselves alone, with their spears in their hands even</a>
<a id='line_4278'>toward them. Lo, said Sir Kay, yonder be the five kings; let us go to</a>
<a id='line_4279'>them and match them. That were folly, said Sir Gawaine, for we are but</a>
<a id='line_4280'>three and they be five. That is truth, said Sir Griflet. No force, said</a>
<a id='line_4281'>Sir Kay, I will undertake for two of them, and then may ye three</a>
<a id='line_4282'>undertake for the other three. And therewithal, Sir Kay let his horse</a>
<a id='line_4283'>run as fast as he might, and struck one of them through the shield and</a>
<a id='line_4284'>the body a fathom, that the king fell to the earth stark dead. That saw</a>
<a id='line_4285'>Sir Gawaine, and ran unto another king so hard that he smote him</a>
<a id='line_4286'>through the body. And therewithal King Arthur ran to another, and smote</a>
<a id='line_4287'>him through the body with a spear, that he fell to the earth dead. Then</a>
<a id='line_4288'>Sir Griflet ran unto the fourth king, and gave him such a fall that his</a>
<a id='line_4289'>neck brake. Anon Sir Kay ran unto the fifth king, and smote him so hard</a>
<a id='line_4290'>on the helm that the stroke clave the helm and the head to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_4291'>That was well stricken, said King Arthur, and worshipfully hast thou</a>
<a id='line_4292'>holden thy promise, therefore I shall honour thee while that I live.</a>
<a id='line_4293'>And therewithal they set the queen in a barge into Humber; but always</a>
<a id='line_4294'>Queen Guenever praised Sir Kay for his deeds, and said, What lady that</a>
<a id='line_4295'>ye love, and she love you not again she were greatly to blame; and</a>
<a id='line_4296'>among ladies, said the queen, I shall bear your noble fame, for ye</a>
<a id='line_4297'>spake a great word, and fulfilled it worshipfully. And therewith the</a>
<a id='line_4298'>queen departed.</a>
<a id='line_4299'></a>
<a id='line_4300'>Then the king and the three knights rode into the forest, for there</a>
<a id='line_4301'>they supposed to hear of them that were escaped; and there he found the</a>
<a id='line_4302'>most part of his people, and told them all how the five kings were</a>
<a id='line_4303'>dead. And therefore let us hold us together till it be day, and when</a>
<a id='line_4304'>their host have espied that their chieftains be slain, they will make</a>
<a id='line_4305'>such dole that they shall no more help themselves. And right so as the</a>
<a id='line_4306'>king said, so it was; for when they found the five kings dead, they</a>
<a id='line_4307'>made such dole that they fell from their horses. Therewithal came King</a>
<a id='line_4308'>Arthur but with a few people, and slew on the left hand and on the</a>
<a id='line_4309'>right hand, that well-nigh there escaped no man, but all were slain to</a>
<a id='line_4310'>the number thirty thousand. And when the battle was all ended, the king</a>
<a id='line_4311'>kneeled down and thanked God meekly. And then he sent for the queen,</a>
<a id='line_4312'>and soon she was come, and she made great joy of the overcoming of that</a>
<a id='line_4313'>battle.</a>
<a id='line_4314'></a>
<a id='line_4315'></a>
<a id='line_4316'></a>
<a id='line_4317'>CHAPTER IV. How the battle was finished or he came, and how King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_4318'>founded an abbey where the battle was.</a>
<a id='line_4319'></a>
<a id='line_4320'>Therewithal came one to King Arthur, and told him that King Pellinore</a>
<a id='line_4321'>was within three mile with a great host; and he said, Go unto him, and</a>
<a id='line_4322'>let him understand how we have sped. So within a while King Pellinore</a>
<a id='line_4323'>came with a great host, and saluted the people and the king, and there</a>
<a id='line_4324'>was great joy made on every side. Then the king let search how much</a>
<a id='line_4325'>people of his party there was slain; and there were found but little</a>
<a id='line_4326'>past two hundred men slain and eight knights of the Table Round in</a>
<a id='line_4327'>their pavilions. Then the king let rear and devise in the same place</a>
<a id='line_4328'>whereat the battle was done a fair abbey, and endowed it with great</a>
<a id='line_4329'>livelihood, and let it call the Abbey of La Beale Adventure. But when</a>
<a id='line_4330'>some of them came into their countries, whereof the five kings were</a>
<a id='line_4331'>kings, and told them how they were slain, there was made great dole.</a>
<a id='line_4332'>And all King Arthur’s enemies, as the King of North Wales, and the</a>
<a id='line_4333'>kings of the North, [when they] wist of the battle, they were passing</a>
<a id='line_4334'>heavy. And so the king returned unto Camelot in haste.</a>
<a id='line_4335'></a>
<a id='line_4336'>And when he was come to Camelot he called King Pellinore unto him, and</a>
<a id='line_4337'>said, Ye understand well that we have lost eight knights of the best of</a>
<a id='line_4338'>the Table Round, and by your advice we will choose eight again of the</a>
<a id='line_4339'>best we may find in this court. Sir, said Pellinore, I shall counsel</a>
<a id='line_4340'>you after my conceit the best: there are in your court full noble</a>
<a id='line_4341'>knights both of old and young; and therefore by mine advice ye shall</a>
<a id='line_4342'>choose half of the old and half of the young. Which be the old? said</a>
<a id='line_4343'>King Arthur. Sir, said King Pellinore, meseemeth that King Uriens that</a>
<a id='line_4344'>hath wedded your sister Morgan le Fay, and the King of the Lake, and</a>
<a id='line_4345'>Sir Hervise de Revel, a noble knight, and Sir Galagars, the fourth.</a>
<a id='line_4346'>This is well devised, said King Arthur, and right so shall it be. Now,</a>
<a id='line_4347'>which are the four young knights? said Arthur. Sir, said Pellinore, the</a>
<a id='line_4348'>first is Sir Gawaine, your nephew, that is as good a knight of his time</a>
<a id='line_4349'>as any is in this land; and the second as meseemeth best is Sir Griflet</a>
<a id='line_4350'>le Fise de Dieu, that is a good knight and full desirous in arms, and</a>
<a id='line_4351'>who may see him live he shall prove a good knight; and the third as</a>
<a id='line_4352'>meseemeth is well to be one of the knights of the Round Table, Sir Kay</a>
<a id='line_4353'>the Seneschal, for many times he hath done full worshipfully, and now</a>
<a id='line_4354'>at your last battle he did full honourably for to undertake to slay two</a>
<a id='line_4355'>kings. By my head, said Arthur, he is best worth to be a knight of the</a>
<a id='line_4356'>Round Table of any that ye have rehearsed, an he had done no more</a>
<a id='line_4357'>prowess in his life days.</a>
<a id='line_4358'></a>
<a id='line_4359'></a>
<a id='line_4360'></a>
<a id='line_4361'>CHAPTER V. How Sir Tor was made knight of the Round Table, and how</a>
<a id='line_4362'>Bagdemagus was displeased.</a>
<a id='line_4363'></a>
<a id='line_4364'>Now, said King Pellinore, I shall put to you two knights, and ye shall</a>
<a id='line_4365'>choose which is most worthy, that is Sir Bagdemagus, and Sir Tor, my</a>
<a id='line_4366'>son. But because Sir Tor is my son I may not praise him, but else, an</a>
<a id='line_4367'>he were not my son, I durst say that of his age there is not in this</a>
<a id='line_4368'>land a better knight than he is, nor of better conditions and loath to</a>
<a id='line_4369'>do any wrong, and loath to take any wrong. By my head, said Arthur, he</a>
<a id='line_4370'>is a passing good knight as any ye spake of this day, that wot I well,</a>
<a id='line_4371'>said the king; for I have seen him proved, but he saith little and he</a>
<a id='line_4372'>doth much more, for I know none in all this court an he were as well</a>
<a id='line_4373'>born on his mother’s side as he is on your side, that is like him of</a>
<a id='line_4374'>prowess and of might: and therefore I will have him at this time, and</a>
<a id='line_4375'>leave Sir Bagdemagus till another time. So when they were so chosen by</a>
<a id='line_4376'>the assent of all the barons, so were there found in their sieges every</a>
<a id='line_4377'>knights’ names that here are rehearsed, and so were they set in their</a>
<a id='line_4378'>sieges; whereof Sir Bagdemagus was wonderly wroth, that Sir Tor was</a>
<a id='line_4379'>advanced afore him, and therefore suddenly he departed from the court,</a>
<a id='line_4380'>and took his squire with him, and rode long in a forest till they came</a>
<a id='line_4381'>to a cross, and there alighted and said his prayers devoutly. The</a>
<a id='line_4382'>meanwhile his squire found written upon the cross, that Bagdemagus</a>
<a id='line_4383'>should never return unto the court again, till he had won a knight’s</a>
<a id='line_4384'>body of the Round Table, body for body. So, sir, said the squire, here</a>
<a id='line_4385'>I find writing of you, therefore I rede you return again to the court.</a>
<a id='line_4386'>That shall I never, said Bagdemagus, till men speak of me great</a>
<a id='line_4387'>worship, and that I be worthy to be a knight of the Round Table. And so</a>
<a id='line_4388'>he rode forth, and there by the way he found a branch of an holy herb</a>
<a id='line_4389'>that was the sign of the Sangreal, and no knight found such tokens but</a>
<a id='line_4390'>he were a good liver.</a>
<a id='line_4391'></a>
<a id='line_4392'>So, as Sir Bagdemagus rode to see many adventures, it happed him to</a>
<a id='line_4393'>come to the rock whereas the Lady of the Lake had put Merlin under the</a>
<a id='line_4394'>stone, and there he heard him make great dole; whereof Sir Bagdemagus</a>
<a id='line_4395'>would have holpen him, and went unto the great stone, and it was so</a>
<a id='line_4396'>heavy that an hundred men might not lift it up. When Merlin wist he was</a>
<a id='line_4397'>there, he bade leave his labour, for all was in vain, for he might</a>
<a id='line_4398'>never be holpen but by her that put him there. And so Bagdemagus</a>
<a id='line_4399'>departed and did many adventures, and proved after a full good knight,</a>
<a id='line_4400'>and came again to the court and was made knight of the Round Table. So</a>
<a id='line_4401'>on the morn there fell new tidings and other adventures.</a>
<a id='line_4402'></a>
<a id='line_4403'></a>
<a id='line_4404'></a>
<a id='line_4405'>CHAPTER VI. How King Arthur, King Uriens, and Sir Accolon of Gaul,</a>
<a id='line_4406'>chased an hart, and of their marvellous adventures.</a>
<a id='line_4407'></a>
<a id='line_4408'>Then it befell that Arthur and many of his knights rode a-hunting into</a>
<a id='line_4409'>a great forest, and it happed King Arthur, King Uriens, and Sir Accolon</a>
<a id='line_4410'>of Gaul, followed a great hart, for they three were well horsed, and so</a>
<a id='line_4411'>they chased so fast that within a while they three were then ten mile</a>
<a id='line_4412'>from their fellowship. And at the last they chased so sore that they</a>
<a id='line_4413'>slew their horses underneath them. Then were they all three on foot,</a>
<a id='line_4414'>and ever they saw the hart afore them passing weary and enbushed. What</a>
<a id='line_4415'>will we do? said King Arthur, we are hard bestead. Let us go on foot,</a>
<a id='line_4416'>said King Uriens, till we may meet with some lodging. Then were they</a>
<a id='line_4417'>ware of the hart that lay on a great water bank, and a brachet biting</a>
<a id='line_4418'>on his throat, and more other hounds came after. Then King Arthur blew</a>
<a id='line_4419'>the prise and dight the hart.</a>
<a id='line_4420'></a>
<a id='line_4421'>Then the king looked about the world, and saw afore him in a great</a>
<a id='line_4422'>water a little ship, all apparelled with silk down to the water, and</a>
<a id='line_4423'>the ship came right unto them and landed on the sands. Then Arthur went</a>
<a id='line_4424'>to the bank and looked in, and saw none earthly creature therein. Sirs,</a>
<a id='line_4425'>said the king, come thence, and let us see what is in this ship. So</a>
<a id='line_4426'>they went in all three, and found it richly behanged with cloth of</a>
<a id='line_4427'>silk. By then it was dark night, and there suddenly were about them an</a>
<a id='line_4428'>hundred torches set upon all the sides of the ship boards, and it gave</a>
<a id='line_4429'>great light; and therewithal there came out twelve fair damosels and</a>
<a id='line_4430'>saluted King Arthur on their knees, and called him by his name, and</a>
<a id='line_4431'>said he was right welcome, and such cheer as they had he should have of</a>
<a id='line_4432'>the best. The king thanked them fair. Therewithal they led the king and</a>
<a id='line_4433'>his two fellows into a fair chamber, and there was a cloth laid, richly</a>
<a id='line_4434'>beseen of all that longed unto a table, and there were they served of</a>
<a id='line_4435'>all wines and meats that they could think; of that the king had great</a>
<a id='line_4436'>marvel, for he fared never better in his life as for one supper. And so</a>
<a id='line_4437'>when they had supped at their leisure, King Arthur was led into a</a>
<a id='line_4438'>chamber, a richer beseen chamber saw he never none, and so was King</a>
<a id='line_4439'>Uriens served, and led into such another chamber, and Sir Accolon was</a>
<a id='line_4440'>led into the third chamber passing richly and well beseen; and so they</a>
<a id='line_4441'>were laid in their beds easily. And anon they fell asleep, and slept</a>
<a id='line_4442'>marvellously sore all the night. And on the morrow King Uriens was in</a>
<a id='line_4443'>Camelot abed in his wife’s arms, Morgan le Fay. And when he awoke he</a>
<a id='line_4444'>had great marvel, how he came there, for on the even afore he was two</a>
<a id='line_4445'>days’ journey from Camelot. And when King Arthur awoke he found himself</a>
<a id='line_4446'>in a dark prison, hearing about him many complaints of woful knights.</a>
<a id='line_4447'></a>
<a id='line_4448'></a>
<a id='line_4449'></a>
<a id='line_4450'>CHAPTER VII. How Arthur took upon him to fight to be delivered out of</a>
<a id='line_4451'>prison, and also for to deliver twenty knights that were in prison.</a>
<a id='line_4452'></a>
<a id='line_4453'>What are ye that so complain? said King Arthur. We be here twenty</a>
<a id='line_4454'>knights, prisoners, said they, and some of us have lain here seven</a>
<a id='line_4455'>year, and some more and some less. For what cause? said Arthur. We</a>
<a id='line_4456'>shall tell you, said the knights; this lord of this castle, his name is</a>
<a id='line_4457'>Sir Damas, and he is the falsest knight that liveth, and full of</a>
<a id='line_4458'>treason, and a very coward as any liveth, and he hath a younger</a>
<a id='line_4459'>brother, a good knight of prowess, his name is Sir Ontzlake; and this</a>
<a id='line_4460'>traitor Damas, the elder brother will give him no part of his</a>
<a id='line_4461'>livelihood, but as Sir Ontzlake keepeth thorough prowess of his hands,</a>
<a id='line_4462'>and so he keepeth from him a full fair manor and a rich, and therein</a>
<a id='line_4463'>Sir Ontzlake dwelleth worshipfully, and is well beloved of all people.</a>
<a id='line_4464'>And this Sir Damas, our master is as evil beloved, for he is without</a>
<a id='line_4465'>mercy, and he is a coward, and great war hath been betwixt them both,</a>
<a id='line_4466'>but Ontzlake hath ever the better, and ever he proffereth Sir Damas to</a>
<a id='line_4467'>fight for the livelihood, body for body, but he will not do; other-else</a>
<a id='line_4468'>to find a knight to fight for him. Unto that Sir Damas had granted to</a>
<a id='line_4469'>find a knight, but he is so evil beloved and hated, that there is never</a>
<a id='line_4470'>a knight will fight for him. And when Damas saw this, that there was</a>
<a id='line_4471'>never a knight would fight for him, he hath daily lain await with many</a>
<a id='line_4472'>knights with him, and taken all the knights in this country to see and</a>
<a id='line_4473'>espy their adventures, he hath taken them by force and brought them to</a>
<a id='line_4474'>his prison. And so he took us separately as we rode on our adventures,</a>
<a id='line_4475'>and many good knights have died in this prison for hunger, to the</a>
<a id='line_4476'>number of eighteen knights; and if any of us all that here is, or hath</a>
<a id='line_4477'>been, would have foughten with his brother Ontzlake, he would have</a>
<a id='line_4478'>delivered us, but for because this Damas is so false and so full of</a>
<a id='line_4479'>treason we would never fight for him to die for it. And we be so lean</a>
<a id='line_4480'>for hunger that unnethe we may stand on our feet. God deliver you, for</a>
<a id='line_4481'>his mercy, said Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_4482'></a>
<a id='line_4483'>Anon, therewithal there came a damosel unto Arthur, and asked him, What</a>
<a id='line_4484'>cheer? I cannot say, said he. Sir, said she, an ye will fight for my</a>
<a id='line_4485'>lord, ye shall be delivered out of prison, and else ye escape never the</a>
<a id='line_4486'>life. Now, said Arthur, that is hard, yet had I liefer to fight with a</a>
<a id='line_4487'>knight than to die in prison; with this, said Arthur, I may be</a>
<a id='line_4488'>delivered and all these prisoners, I will do the battle. Yes, said the</a>
<a id='line_4489'>damosel. I am ready, said Arthur, an I had horse and armour. Ye shall</a>
<a id='line_4490'>lack none, said the damosel. Meseemeth, damosel, I should have seen you</a>
<a id='line_4491'>in the court of Arthur. Nay said the damosel, I came never there, I am</a>
<a id='line_4492'>the lord’s daughter of this castle. Yet was she false, for she was one</a>
<a id='line_4493'>of the damosels of Morgan le Fay.</a>
<a id='line_4494'></a>
<a id='line_4495'>Anon she went unto Sir Damas, and told him how he would do battle for</a>
<a id='line_4496'>him, and so he sent for Arthur. And when he came he was well coloured,</a>
<a id='line_4497'>and well made of his limbs, that all knights that saw him said it were</a>
<a id='line_4498'>pity that such a knight should die in prison. So Sir Damas and he were</a>
<a id='line_4499'>agreed that he should fight for him upon this covenant, that all other</a>
<a id='line_4500'>knights should be delivered; and unto that was Sir Damas sworn unto</a>
<a id='line_4501'>Arthur, and also to do the battle to the uttermost. And with that all</a>
<a id='line_4502'>the twenty knights were brought out of the dark prison into the hall,</a>
<a id='line_4503'>and delivered, and so they all abode to see the battle.</a>
<a id='line_4504'></a>
<a id='line_4505'></a>
<a id='line_4506'></a>
<a id='line_4507'>CHAPTER VIII. How Accolon found himself by a well, and he took upon him</a>
<a id='line_4508'>to do battle against Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_4509'></a>
<a id='line_4510'>Now turn we unto Accolon of Gaul, that when he awoke he found himself</a>
<a id='line_4511'>by a deep well-side, within half a foot, in great peril of death. And</a>
<a id='line_4512'>there came out of that fountain a pipe of silver, and out of that pipe</a>
<a id='line_4513'>ran water all on high in a stone of marble. When Sir Accolon saw this,</a>
<a id='line_4514'>he blessed him and said, Jesus save my lord King Arthur, and King</a>
<a id='line_4515'>Uriens, for these damosels in this ship have betrayed us, they were</a>
<a id='line_4516'>devils and no women; and if I may escape this misadventure, I shall</a>
<a id='line_4517'>destroy all where I may find these false damosels that use</a>
<a id='line_4518'>enchantments. Right with that there came a dwarf with a great mouth and</a>
<a id='line_4519'>a flat nose, and saluted Sir Accolon, and said how he came from Queen</a>
<a id='line_4520'>Morgan le Fay, and she greeteth you well, and biddeth you be of strong</a>
<a id='line_4521'>heart, for ye shall fight to morrow with a knight at the hour of prime,</a>
<a id='line_4522'>and therefore she hath sent you here Excalibur, Arthur’s sword, and the</a>
<a id='line_4523'>scabbard, and she biddeth you as ye love her, that ye do the battle to</a>
<a id='line_4524'>the uttermost, without any mercy, like as ye had promised her when ye</a>
<a id='line_4525'>spake together in privity; and what damosel that bringeth her the</a>
<a id='line_4526'>knight’s head, which ye shall fight withal, she will make her a queen.</a>
<a id='line_4527'>Now I understand you well, said Accolon, I shall hold that I have</a>
<a id='line_4528'>promised her now I have the sword: when saw ye my lady Queen Morgan le</a>
<a id='line_4529'>Fay? Right late, said the dwarf. Then Accolon took him in his arms and</a>
<a id='line_4530'>said, Recommend me unto my lady queen, and tell her all shall be done</a>
<a id='line_4531'>that I have promised her, and else I will die for it. Now I suppose,</a>
<a id='line_4532'>said Accolon, she hath made all these crafts and enchantments for this</a>
<a id='line_4533'>battle. Ye may well believe it, said the dwarf. Right so there came a</a>
<a id='line_4534'>knight and a lady with six squires, and saluted Accolon, and prayed him</a>
<a id='line_4535'>for to arise, and come and rest him at his manor. And so Accolon</a>
<a id='line_4536'>mounted upon a void horse, and went with the knight unto a fair manor</a>
<a id='line_4537'>by a priory, and there he had passing good cheer.</a>
<a id='line_4538'></a>
<a id='line_4539'>Then Sir Damas sent unto his brother Sir Ontzlake, and bade make him</a>
<a id='line_4540'>ready by to-morn at the hour of prime, and to be in the field to fight</a>
<a id='line_4541'>with a good knight, for he had found a good knight that was ready to do</a>
<a id='line_4542'>battle at all points. When this word came unto Sir Ontzlake he was</a>
<a id='line_4543'>passing heavy, for he was wounded a little to-fore through both his</a>
<a id='line_4544'>thighs with a spear, and made great dole; but as he was wounded, he</a>
<a id='line_4545'>would have taken the battle on hand. So it happed at that time, by the</a>
<a id='line_4546'>means of Morgan le Fay, Accolon was with Sir Ontzlake lodged; and when</a>
<a id='line_4547'>he heard of that battle, and how Ontzlake was wounded, he said that he</a>
<a id='line_4548'>would fight for him. Because Morgan le Fay had sent him Excalibur and</a>
<a id='line_4549'>the sheath for to fight with the knight on the morn: this was the cause</a>
<a id='line_4550'>Sir Accolon took the battle on hand. Then Sir Ontzlake was passing</a>
<a id='line_4551'>glad, and thanked Sir Accolon with all his heart that he would do so</a>
<a id='line_4552'>much for him. And therewithal Sir Ontzlake sent word unto his brother</a>
<a id='line_4553'>Sir Damas, that he had a knight that for him should be ready in the</a>
<a id='line_4554'>field by the hour of prime.</a>
<a id='line_4555'></a>
<a id='line_4556'>So on the morn Sir Arthur was armed and well horsed, and asked Sir</a>
<a id='line_4557'>Damas, When shall we to the field? Sir, said Sir Damas, ye shall hear</a>
<a id='line_4558'>mass. And so Arthur heard a mass, and when mass was done there came a</a>
<a id='line_4559'>squire on a great horse, and asked Sir Damas if his knight were ready,</a>
<a id='line_4560'>for our knight is ready in the field. Then Sir Arthur mounted upon</a>
<a id='line_4561'>horseback, and there were all the knights and commons of that country;</a>
<a id='line_4562'>and so by all advices there were chosen twelve good men of the country</a>
<a id='line_4563'>for to wait upon the two knights. And right as Arthur was on horseback</a>
<a id='line_4564'>there came a damosel from Morgan le Fay, and brought unto Sir Arthur a</a>
<a id='line_4565'>sword like unto Excalibur, and the scabbard, and said unto Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_4566'>Morgan le Fay sendeth here your sword for great love. And he thanked</a>
<a id='line_4567'>her, and weened it had been so, but she was false, for the sword and</a>
<a id='line_4568'>the scabbard was counterfeit, and brittle, and false.</a>
<a id='line_4569'></a>
<a id='line_4570'></a>
<a id='line_4571'></a>
<a id='line_4572'>CHAPTER IX. Of the battle between King Arthur and Accolon.</a>
<a id='line_4573'></a>
<a id='line_4574'>And then they dressed them on both parties of the field, and let their</a>
<a id='line_4575'>horses run so fast that either smote other in the midst of the shield</a>
<a id='line_4576'>with their spear-heads, that both horse and man went to the earth; and</a>
<a id='line_4577'>then they started up both, and pulled out their swords. The meanwhile</a>
<a id='line_4578'>that they were thus at the battle, came the Damosel of the Lake into</a>
<a id='line_4579'>the field, that put Merlin under the stone; and she came thither for</a>
<a id='line_4580'>love of King Arthur, for she knew how Morgan le Fay had so ordained</a>
<a id='line_4581'>that King Arthur should have been slain that day, and therefore she</a>
<a id='line_4582'>came to save his life. And so they went eagerly to the battle, and gave</a>
<a id='line_4583'>many great strokes, but always Arthur’s sword bit not like Accolon’s</a>
<a id='line_4584'>sword; but for the most part, every stroke that Accolon gave he wounded</a>
<a id='line_4585'>sore Arthur, that it was marvel he stood, and always his blood fell</a>
<a id='line_4586'>from him fast.</a>
<a id='line_4587'></a>
<a id='line_4588'>When Arthur beheld the ground so sore be-bled he was dismayed, and then</a>
<a id='line_4589'>he deemed treason that his sword was changed; for his sword bit not</a>
<a id='line_4590'>steel as it was wont to do, therefore he dreaded him sore to be dead,</a>
<a id='line_4591'>for ever him seemed that the sword in Accolon’s hand was Excalibur, for</a>
<a id='line_4592'>at every stroke that Accolon struck he drew blood on Arthur. Now,</a>
<a id='line_4593'>knight, said Accolon unto Arthur, keep thee well from me; but Arthur</a>
<a id='line_4594'>answered not again, and gave him such a buffet on the helm that it made</a>
<a id='line_4595'>him to stoop, nigh falling down to the earth. Then Sir Accolon withdrew</a>
<a id='line_4596'>him a little, and came on with Excalibur on high, and smote Sir Arthur</a>
<a id='line_4597'>such a buffet that he fell nigh to the earth. Then were they wroth</a>
<a id='line_4598'>both, and gave each other many sore strokes, but always Sir Arthur lost</a>
<a id='line_4599'>so much blood that it was marvel he stood on his feet, but he was so</a>
<a id='line_4600'>full of knighthood that knightly he endured the pain. And Sir Accolon</a>
<a id='line_4601'>lost not a deal of blood, therefore he waxed passing light, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_4602'>Arthur was passing feeble, and weened verily to have died; but for all</a>
<a id='line_4603'>that he made countenance as though he might endure, and held Accolon as</a>
<a id='line_4604'>short as he might. But Accolon was so bold because of Excalibur that he</a>
<a id='line_4605'>waxed passing hardy. But all men that beheld him said they saw never</a>
<a id='line_4606'>knight fight so well as Arthur did considering the blood that he bled.</a>
<a id='line_4607'>So was all the people sorry for him, but the two brethren would not</a>
<a id='line_4608'>accord. Then always they fought together as fierce knights, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_4609'>Arthur withdrew him a little for to rest him, and Sir Accolon called</a>
<a id='line_4610'>him to battle and said, It is no time for me to suffer thee to rest.</a>
<a id='line_4611'>And therewith he came fiercely upon Arthur, and Sir Arthur was wroth</a>
<a id='line_4612'>for the blood that he had lost, and smote Accolon on high upon the</a>
<a id='line_4613'>helm, so mightily, that he made him nigh to fall to the earth; and</a>
<a id='line_4614'>therewith Arthur’s sword brast at the cross, and fell in the grass</a>
<a id='line_4615'>among the blood, and the pommel and the sure handles he held in his</a>
<a id='line_4616'>hands. When Sir Arthur saw that, he was in great fear to die, but</a>
<a id='line_4617'>always he held up his shield and lost no ground, nor bated no cheer.</a>
<a id='line_4618'></a>
<a id='line_4619'></a>
<a id='line_4620'></a>
<a id='line_4621'>CHAPTER X. How King Arthur’s sword that he fought with brake, and how</a>
<a id='line_4622'>he recovered of Accolon his own sword Excalibur, and overcame his</a>
<a id='line_4623'>enemy.</a>
<a id='line_4624'></a>
<a id='line_4625'>Then Sir Accolon began with words of treason, and said, Knight, thou</a>
<a id='line_4626'>art overcome, and mayst not endure, and also thou art weaponless, and</a>
<a id='line_4627'>thou hast lost much of thy blood, and I am full loath to slay thee,</a>
<a id='line_4628'>therefore yield thee to me as recreant. Nay, said Sir Arthur, I may not</a>
<a id='line_4629'>so, for I have promised to do the battle to the uttermost by the faith</a>
<a id='line_4630'>of my body, while me lasteth the life, and therefore I had liefer to</a>
<a id='line_4631'>die with honour than to live with shame; and if it were possible for me</a>
<a id='line_4632'>to die an hundred times, I had liefer to die so oft than yield me to</a>
<a id='line_4633'>thee; for though I lack weapon, I shall lack no worship, and if thou</a>
<a id='line_4634'>slay me weaponless that shall be thy shame. Well, said Accolon, as for</a>
<a id='line_4635'>the shame I will not spare, now keep thee from me, for thou art but a</a>
<a id='line_4636'>dead man. And therewith Accolon gave him such a stroke that he fell</a>
<a id='line_4637'>nigh to the earth, and would have had Arthur to have cried him mercy.</a>
<a id='line_4638'>But Sir Arthur pressed unto Accolon with his shield, and gave him with</a>
<a id='line_4639'>the pommel in his hand such a buffet that he went three strides aback.</a>
<a id='line_4640'></a>
<a id='line_4641'>When the Damosel of the Lake beheld Arthur, how full of prowess his</a>
<a id='line_4642'>body was, and the false treason that was wrought for him to have had</a>
<a id='line_4643'>him slain, she had great pity that so good a knight and such a man of</a>
<a id='line_4644'>worship should so be destroyed. And at the next stroke Sir Accolon</a>
<a id='line_4645'>struck him such a stroke that by the damosel’s enchantment the sword</a>
<a id='line_4646'>Excalibur fell out of Accolon’s hand to the earth. And therewithal Sir</a>
<a id='line_4647'>Arthur lightly leapt to it, and gat it in his hand, and forthwithal he</a>
<a id='line_4648'>knew that it was his sword Excalibur, and said, Thou hast been from me</a>
<a id='line_4649'>all too long, and much damage hast thou done me; and therewith he</a>
<a id='line_4650'>espied the scabbard hanging by his side, and suddenly he sterte to him</a>
<a id='line_4651'>and pulled the scabbard from him, and threw it from him as far as he</a>
<a id='line_4652'>might throw it. O knight, said Arthur, this day hast thou done me great</a>
<a id='line_4653'>damage with this sword; now are ye come unto your death, for I shall</a>
<a id='line_4654'>not warrant you but ye shall as well be rewarded with this sword, or</a>
<a id='line_4655'>ever we depart, as thou hast rewarded me; for much pain have ye made me</a>
<a id='line_4656'>to endure, and much blood have I lost. And therewith Sir Arthur rushed</a>
<a id='line_4657'>on him with all his might and pulled him to the earth, and then rushed</a>
<a id='line_4658'>off his helm, and gave him such a buffet on the head that the blood</a>
<a id='line_4659'>came out at his ears, his nose, and his mouth. Now will I slay thee,</a>
<a id='line_4660'>said Arthur. Slay me ye may well, said Accolon, an it please you, for</a>
<a id='line_4661'>ye are the best knight that ever I found, and I see well that God is</a>
<a id='line_4662'>with you. But for I promised to do this battle, said Accolon, to the</a>
<a id='line_4663'>uttermost, and never to be recreant while I lived, therefore shall I</a>
<a id='line_4664'>never yield me with my mouth, but God do with my body what he will.</a>
<a id='line_4665'>Then Sir Arthur remembered him, and thought he should have seen this</a>
<a id='line_4666'>knight. Now tell me, said Arthur, or I will slay thee, of what country</a>
<a id='line_4667'>art thou, and of what court? Sir Knight, said Sir Accolon, I am of the</a>
<a id='line_4668'>court of King Arthur, and my name is Accolon of Gaul. Then was Arthur</a>
<a id='line_4669'>more dismayed than he was beforehand; for then he remembered him of his</a>
<a id='line_4670'>sister Morgan le Fay, and of the enchantment of the ship. O sir knight,</a>
<a id='line_4671'>said he, I pray you tell me who gave you this sword, and by whom ye had</a>
<a id='line_4672'>it.</a>
<a id='line_4673'></a>
<a id='line_4674'></a>
<a id='line_4675'></a>
<a id='line_4676'>CHAPTER XI. How Accolon confessed the treason of Morgan le Fay, King</a>
<a id='line_4677'>Arthur’s sister, and how she would have done slay him.</a>
<a id='line_4678'></a>
<a id='line_4679'>Then Sir Accolon bethought him, and said, Woe worth this sword, for by</a>
<a id='line_4680'>it have I got my death. It may well be, said the king. Now, sir, said</a>
<a id='line_4681'>Accolon, I will tell you; this sword hath been in my keeping the most</a>
<a id='line_4682'>part of this twelvemonth; and Morgan le Fay, King Uriens’ wife, sent it</a>
<a id='line_4683'>me yesterday by a dwarf, to this intent, that I should slay King</a>
<a id='line_4684'>Arthur, her brother. For ye shall understand King Arthur is the man in</a>
<a id='line_4685'>the world that she most hateth, because he is most of worship and of</a>
<a id='line_4686'>prowess of any of her blood; also she loveth me out of measure as</a>
<a id='line_4687'>paramour, and I her again; and if she might bring about to slay Arthur</a>
<a id='line_4688'>by her crafts, she would slay her husband King Uriens lightly, and then</a>
<a id='line_4689'>had she me devised to be king in this land, and so to reign, and she to</a>
<a id='line_4690'>be my queen; but that is now done, said Accolon, for I am sure of my</a>
<a id='line_4691'>death. Well, said Sir Arthur, I feel by you ye would have been king in</a>
<a id='line_4692'>this land. It had been great damage to have destroyed your lord, said</a>
<a id='line_4693'>Arthur. It is truth, said Accolon, but now I have told you truth,</a>
<a id='line_4694'>wherefore I pray you tell me of whence ye are, and of what court? O</a>
<a id='line_4695'>Accolon, said King Arthur, now I let thee wit that I am King Arthur, to</a>
<a id='line_4696'>whom thou hast done great damage. When Accolon heard that he cried</a>
<a id='line_4697'>aloud, Fair, sweet lord, have mercy on me, for I knew not you. O Sir</a>
<a id='line_4698'>Accolon, said King Arthur, mercy shalt thou have, because I feel by thy</a>
<a id='line_4699'>words at this time thou knewest not my person; but I understand well by</a>
<a id='line_4700'>thy words that thou hast agreed to the death of my person, and</a>
<a id='line_4701'>therefore thou art a traitor; but I wite thee the less, for my sister</a>
<a id='line_4702'>Morgan le Fay by her false crafts made thee to agree and consent to her</a>
<a id='line_4703'>false lusts, but I shall be sore avenged upon her an I live, that all</a>
<a id='line_4704'>Christendom shall speak of it; God knoweth I have honoured her and</a>
<a id='line_4705'>worshipped her more than all my kin, and more have I trusted her than</a>
<a id='line_4706'>mine own wife and all my kin after.</a>
<a id='line_4707'></a>
<a id='line_4708'>Then Sir Arthur called the keepers of the field, and said, Sirs, come</a>
<a id='line_4709'>hither, for here are we two knights that have fought unto a great</a>
<a id='line_4710'>damage unto us both, and like each one of us to have slain other, if it</a>
<a id='line_4711'>had happed so; and had any of us known other, here had been no battle,</a>
<a id='line_4712'>nor stroke stricken. Then all aloud cried Accolon unto all the knights</a>
<a id='line_4713'>and men that were then there gathered together, and said to them in</a>
<a id='line_4714'>this manner, O lords, this noble knight that I have fought withal, the</a>
<a id='line_4715'>which me sore repenteth, is the most man of prowess, of manhood, and of</a>
<a id='line_4716'>worship in the world, for it is himself King Arthur, our alther liege</a>
<a id='line_4717'>lord, and with mishap and with misadventure have I done this battle</a>
<a id='line_4718'>with the king and lord that I am holden withal.</a>

<a id='line_4720'></a>
<a id='line_4721'></a>
<a id='line_4722'>CHAPTER XII. How Arthur accorded the two brethren, and delivered the</a>
<a id='line_4723'>twenty knights, and how Sir Accolon died.</a>
<a id='line_4724'></a>
<a id='line_4725'>Then all the people fell down on their knees and cried King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_4726'>mercy. Mercy shall ye have, said Arthur: here may ye see what</a>
<a id='line_4727'>adventures befall ofttime of errant knights, how that I have fought</a>
<a id='line_4728'>with a knight of mine own unto my great damage and his both. But, sirs,</a>
<a id='line_4729'>because I am sore hurt, and he both, and I had great need of a little</a>
<a id='line_4730'>rest, ye shall understand the opinion betwixt you two brethren: As to</a>
<a id='line_4731'>thee, Sir Damas, for whom I have been champion and won the field of</a>
<a id='line_4732'>this knight, yet will I judge because ye, Sir Damas, are called an</a>
<a id='line_4733'>orgulous knight, and full of villainy, and not worth of prowess your</a>
<a id='line_4734'>deeds, therefore I will that ye give unto your brother all the whole</a>
<a id='line_4735'>manor with the appurtenance, under this form, that Sir Ontzlake hold</a>
<a id='line_4736'>the manor of you, and yearly to give you a palfrey to ride upon, for</a>
<a id='line_4737'>that will become you better to ride on than upon a courser. Also I</a>
<a id='line_4738'>charge thee, Sir Damas, upon pain of death, that thou never distress no</a>
<a id='line_4739'>knights errant that ride on their adventure. And also that thou restore</a>
<a id='line_4740'>these twenty knights that thou hast long kept prisoners, of all their</a>
<a id='line_4741'>harness, that they be content for; and if any of them come to my court</a>
<a id='line_4742'>and complain of thee, by my head thou shalt die therefore. Also, Sir</a>
<a id='line_4743'>Ontzlake, as to you, because ye are named a good knight, and full of</a>
<a id='line_4744'>prowess, and true and gentle in all your deeds, this shall be your</a>
<a id='line_4745'>charge I will give you, that in all goodly haste ye come unto me and my</a>
<a id='line_4746'>court, and ye shall be a knight of mine, and if your deeds be</a>
<a id='line_4747'>thereafter I shall so prefer you, by the grace of God, that ye shall in</a>
<a id='line_4748'>short time be in ease for to live as worshipfully as your brother Sir</a>
<a id='line_4749'>Damas. God thank your largeness of your goodness and of your bounty, I</a>
<a id='line_4750'>shall be from henceforward at all times at your commandment; for, sir,</a>
<a id='line_4751'>said Sir Ontzlake, as God would, as I was hurt but late with an</a>
<a id='line_4752'>adventurous knight through both my thighs, that grieved me sore, and</a>
<a id='line_4753'>else had I done this battle with you. God would, said Arthur, it had</a>
<a id='line_4754'>been so, for then had not I been hurt as I am. I shall tell you the</a>
<a id='line_4755'>cause why: for I had not been hurt as I am, had it not been mine own</a>
<a id='line_4756'>sword, that was stolen from me by treason; and this battle was ordained</a>
<a id='line_4757'>aforehand to have slain me, and so it was brought to the purpose by</a>
<a id='line_4758'>false treason, and by false enchantment. Alas, said Sir Ontzlake, that</a>
<a id='line_4759'>is great pity that ever so noble a man as ye are of your deeds and</a>
<a id='line_4760'>prowess, that any man or woman might find in their hearts to work any</a>
<a id='line_4761'>treason against you. I shall reward them, said Arthur, in short time,</a>
<a id='line_4762'>by the grace of God. Now, tell me, said Arthur, how far am I from</a>
<a id='line_4763'>Camelot? Sir, ye are two days’ journey therefrom. I would fain be at</a>
<a id='line_4764'>some place of worship, said Sir Arthur, that I might rest me. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_4765'>Sir Ontzlake, hereby is a rich abbey of your elders’ foundation, of</a>
<a id='line_4766'>nuns, but three miles hence. So the king took his leave of all the</a>
<a id='line_4767'>people, and mounted upon horseback, and Sir Accolon with him. And when</a>
<a id='line_4768'>they were come to the abbey, he let fetch leeches and search his wounds</a>
<a id='line_4769'>and Accolon’s both; but Sir Accolon died within four days, for he had</a>
<a id='line_4770'>bled so much blood that he might not live, but King Arthur was well</a>
<a id='line_4771'>recovered. So when Accolon was dead he let send him on an horse-bier</a>
<a id='line_4772'>with six knights unto Camelot, and said: Bear him to my sister Morgan</a>
<a id='line_4773'>le Fay, and say that I send her him to a present, and tell her I have</a>
<a id='line_4774'>my sword Excalibur and the scabbard; so they departed with the body.</a>

<a id='line_4780'></a>
<a id='line_4781'>The meanwhile Morgan le Fay had weened King Arthur had been dead. So on</a>
<a id='line_4782'>a day she espied King Uriens lay in his bed sleeping. Then she called</a>
<a id='line_4783'>unto her a maiden of her counsel, and said, Go fetch me my lord’s</a>
<a id='line_4784'>sword, for I saw never better time to slay him than now. O madam, said</a>
<a id='line_4785'>the damosel, an ye slay my lord ye can never escape. Care not you, said</a>
<a id='line_4786'>Morgan le Fay, for now I see my time in the which it is best to do it,</a>
<a id='line_4787'>and therefore hie thee fast and fetch me the sword. Then the damosel</a>
<a id='line_4788'>departed, and found Sir Uwaine sleeping upon a bed in another chamber,</a>
<a id='line_4789'>so she went unto Sir Uwaine, and awaked him, and bade him, Arise, and</a>
<a id='line_4790'>wait on my lady your mother, for she will slay the king your father</a>
<a id='line_4791'>sleeping in his bed, for I go to fetch his sword. Well, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4792'>Uwaine, go on your way, and let me deal. Anon the damosel brought</a>
<a id='line_4793'>Morgan the sword with quaking hands, and she lightly took the sword,</a>
<a id='line_4794'>and pulled it out, and went boldly unto the bed’s side, and awaited how</a>
<a id='line_4795'>and where she might slay him best. And as she lifted up the sword to</a>
<a id='line_4796'>smite, Sir Uwaine leapt unto his mother, and caught her by the hand,</a>
<a id='line_4797'>and said, Ah, fiend, what wilt thou do? An thou wert not my mother,</a>
<a id='line_4798'>with this sword I should smite off thy head. Ah, said Sir Uwaine, men</a>
<a id='line_4799'>saith that Merlin was begotten of a devil, but I may say an earthly</a>
<a id='line_4800'>devil bare me. O fair son, Uwaine, have mercy upon me, I was tempted</a>
<a id='line_4801'>with a devil, wherefore I cry thee mercy; I will never more do so; and</a>
<a id='line_4802'>save my worship and discover me not. On this covenant, said Sir Uwaine,</a>
<a id='line_4803'>I will forgive it you, so ye will never be about to do such deeds. Nay,</a>
<a id='line_4804'>son, said she, and that I make you assurance.</a>

<a id='line_4809'>Accolon, and how she stole away the scabbard from Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_4810'></a>
<a id='line_4811'>Then came tidings unto Morgan le Fay that Accolon was dead, and his</a>
<a id='line_4812'>body brought unto the church, and how King Arthur had his sword again.</a>
<a id='line_4813'>But when Queen Morgan wist that Accolon was dead, she was so sorrowful</a>
<a id='line_4814'>that near her heart to-brast. But because she would not it were known,</a>
<a id='line_4815'>outward she kept her countenance, and made no semblant of sorrow. But</a>
<a id='line_4816'>well she wist an she abode till her brother Arthur came thither, there</a>
<a id='line_4817'>should no gold go for her life.</a>
<a id='line_4818'></a>
<a id='line_4819'>Then she went unto Queen Guenever, and asked her leave to ride into the</a>
<a id='line_4820'>country. Ye may abide, said Queen Guenever, till your brother the king</a>
<a id='line_4821'>come home. I may not, said Morgan le Fay, for I have such hasty</a>
<a id='line_4822'>tidings, that I may not tarry. Well, said Guenever, ye may depart when</a>
<a id='line_4823'>ye will. So early on the morn, or it was day, she took her horse and</a>
<a id='line_4824'>rode all that day and most part of the night, and on the morn by noon</a>
<a id='line_4825'>she came to the same abbey of nuns whereas lay King Arthur; and she</a>
<a id='line_4826'>knowing he was there, she asked where he was. And they answered how he</a>
<a id='line_4827'>had laid him in his bed to sleep, for he had had but little rest these</a>
<a id='line_4828'>three nights. Well, said she, I charge you that none of you awake him</a>
<a id='line_4829'>till I do, and then she alighted off her horse, and thought for to</a>
<a id='line_4830'>steal away Excalibur his sword, and so she went straight unto his</a>
<a id='line_4831'>chamber, and no man durst disobey her commandment, and there she found</a>
<a id='line_4832'>Arthur asleep in his bed, and Excalibur in his right hand naked. When</a>
<a id='line_4833'>she saw that she was passing heavy that she might not come by the sword</a>
<a id='line_4834'>without she had awaked him, and then she wist well she had been dead.</a>
<a id='line_4835'>Then she took the scabbard and went her way on horseback. When the king</a>
<a id='line_4836'>awoke and missed his scabbard, he was wroth, and he asked who had been</a>
<a id='line_4837'>there, and they said his sister, Queen Morgan had been there, and had</a>
<a id='line_4838'>put the scabbard under her mantle and was gone. Alas, said Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_4839'>falsely ye have watched me. Sir, said they all, we durst not disobey</a>
<a id='line_4840'>your sister’s commandment. Ah, said the king, let fetch the best horse</a>
<a id='line_4841'>may be found, and bid Sir Ontzlake arm him in all haste, and take</a>
<a id='line_4842'>another good horse and ride with me. So anon the king and Ontzlake were</a>
<a id='line_4843'>well armed, and rode after this lady, and so they came by a cross and</a>
<a id='line_4844'>found a cowherd, and they asked the poor man if there came any lady</a>
<a id='line_4845'>riding that way. Sir, said this poor man, right late came a lady riding</a>
<a id='line_4846'>with a forty horses, and to yonder forest she rode. Then they spurred</a>
<a id='line_4847'>their horses, and followed fast, and within a while Arthur had a sight</a>
<a id='line_4848'>of Morgan le Fay; then he chased as fast as he might. When she espied</a>
<a id='line_4849'>him following her, she rode a greater pace through the forest till she</a>
<a id='line_4850'>came to a plain, and when she saw she might not escape, she rode unto a</a>
<a id='line_4851'>lake thereby, and said, Whatsoever come of me, my brother shall not</a>
<a id='line_4852'>have this scabbard. And then she let throw the scabbard in the deepest</a>
<a id='line_4853'>of the water so it sank, for it was heavy of gold and precious stones.</a>
<a id='line_4854'></a>
<a id='line_4855'>Then she rode into a valley where many great stones were, and when she</a>
<a id='line_4856'>saw she must be overtaken, she shaped herself, horse and man, by</a>
<a id='line_4857'>enchantment unto a great marble stone. Anon withal came Sir Arthur and</a>
<a id='line_4858'>Sir Ontzlake whereas the king might know his sister and her men, and</a>
<a id='line_4859'>one knight from another. Ah, said the king, here may ye see the</a>
<a id='line_4860'>vengeance of God, and now am I sorry that this misadventure is</a>
<a id='line_4861'>befallen. And then he looked for the scabbard, but it would not be</a>
<a id='line_4862'>found, so he returned to the abbey where he came from. So when Arthur</a>
<a id='line_4863'>was gone she turned all into the likeliness as she and they were</a>
<a id='line_4864'>before, and said, Sirs, now may we go where we will.</a>

<a id='line_4867'></a>
<a id='line_4868'>CHAPTER XV. How Morgan le Fay saved a knight that should have been</a>
<a id='line_4869'>drowned, and how King Arthur returned home again.</a>
<a id='line_4870'></a>
<a id='line_4871'>Then said Morgan, Saw ye Arthur, my brother? Yea, said her knights,</a>
<a id='line_4872'>right well, and that ye should have found an we might have stirred from</a>
<a id='line_4873'>one stead, for by his armyvestal countenance he would have caused us to</a>
<a id='line_4874'>have fled. I believe you, said Morgan. Anon after as she rode she met a</a>
<a id='line_4875'>knight leading another knight on his horse before him, bound hand and</a>
<a id='line_4876'>foot, blindfold, to have drowned him in a fountain. When she saw this</a>
<a id='line_4877'>knight so bound, she asked him, What will ye do with that knight? Lady,</a>
<a id='line_4878'>said he, I will drown him. For what cause? she asked. For I found him</a>
<a id='line_4879'>with my wife, and she shall have the same death anon. That were pity,</a>
<a id='line_4880'>said Morgan le Fay. Now, what say ye, knight, is it truth that he saith</a>
<a id='line_4881'>of you? she said to the knight that should be drowned. Nay truly,</a>
<a id='line_4882'>madam, he saith not right on me. Of whence be ye, said Morgan le Fay,</a>
<a id='line_4883'>and of what country? I am of the court of King Arthur, and my name is</a>
<a id='line_4884'>Manassen, cousin unto Accolon of Gaul. Ye say well, said she, and for</a>
<a id='line_4885'>the love of him ye shall be delivered, and ye shall have your adversary</a>
<a id='line_4886'>in the same case ye be in. So Manassen was loosed and the other knight</a>
<a id='line_4887'>bound. And anon Manassen unarmed him, and armed himself in his harness,</a>
<a id='line_4888'>and so mounted on horseback, and the knight afore him, and so threw him</a>
<a id='line_4889'>into the fountain and drowned him. And then he rode unto Morgan again,</a>
<a id='line_4890'>and asked if she would anything unto King Arthur. Tell him that I</a>
<a id='line_4891'>rescued thee, not for the love of him but for the love of Accolon, and</a>
<a id='line_4892'>tell him I fear him not while I can make me and them that be with me in</a>
<a id='line_4893'>likeness of stones; and let him wit I can do much more when I see my</a>
<a id='line_4894'>time. And so she departed into the country of Gore, and there was she</a>
<a id='line_4895'>richly received, and made her castles and towns passing strong, for</a>
<a id='line_4896'>always she dreaded much King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_4897'></a>
<a id='line_4898'>When the king had well rested him at the abbey, he rode unto Camelot,</a>
<a id='line_4899'>and found his queen and his barons right glad of his coming. And when</a>
<a id='line_4900'>they heard of his strange adventures as is afore rehearsed, then all</a>
<a id='line_4901'>had marvel of the falsehood of Morgan le Fay; many knights wished her</a>
<a id='line_4902'>burnt. Then came Manassen to court and told the king of his adventure.</a>
<a id='line_4903'>Well, said the king, she is a kind sister; I shall so be avenged on her</a>
<a id='line_4904'>an I live, that all Christendom shall speak of it. So on the morn there</a>
<a id='line_4905'>came a damosel from Morgan to the king, and she brought with her the</a>
<a id='line_4906'>richest mantle that ever was seen in that court, for it was set as full</a>
<a id='line_4907'>of precious stones as one might stand by another, and there were the</a>
<a id='line_4908'>richest stones that ever the king saw. And the damosel said, Your</a>
<a id='line_4909'>sister sendeth you this mantle, and desireth that ye should take this</a>
<a id='line_4910'>gift of her; and in what thing she hath offended you, she will amend it</a>
<a id='line_4911'>at your own pleasure. When the king beheld this mantle it pleased him</a>
<a id='line_4912'>much, but he said but little.</a>

<a id='line_4916'>CHAPTER XVI. How the Damosel of the Lake saved King Arthur from mantle</a>
<a id='line_4917'>that should have burnt him.</a>
<a id='line_4918'></a>
<a id='line_4919'>With that came the Damosel of the Lake unto the king, and said, Sir, I</a>
<a id='line_4920'>must speak with you in privity. Say on, said the king, what ye will.</a>
<a id='line_4921'>Sir, said the damosel, put not on you this mantle till ye have seen</a>
<a id='line_4922'>more, and in no wise let it not come on you, nor on no knight of yours,</a>
<a id='line_4923'>till ye command the bringer thereof to put it upon her. Well, said King</a>
<a id='line_4924'>Arthur, it shall be done as ye counsel me. And then he said unto the</a>
<a id='line_4925'>damosel that came from his sister, Damosel, this mantle that ye have</a>
<a id='line_4926'>brought me, I will see it upon you. Sir, she said, It will not beseem</a>
<a id='line_4927'>me to wear a king’s garment. By my head, said Arthur, ye shall wear it</a>
<a id='line_4928'>or it come on my back, or any man’s that here is. And so the king made</a>
<a id='line_4929'>it to be put upon her, and forth withal she fell down dead, and never</a>
<a id='line_4930'>more spake word after and burnt to coals. Then was the king wonderly</a>
<a id='line_4931'>wroth, more than he was to-forehand, and said unto King Uriens, My</a>
<a id='line_4932'>sister, your wife, is alway about to betray me, and well I wot either</a>
<a id='line_4933'>ye, or my nephew, your son, is of counsel with her to have me</a>
<a id='line_4934'>destroyed; but as for you, said the king to King Uriens, I deem not</a>
<a id='line_4935'>greatly that ye be of her counsel, for Accolon confessed to me by his</a>
<a id='line_4936'>own mouth, that she would have destroyed you as well as me, therefore I</a>
<a id='line_4937'>hold you excused; but as for your son, Sir Uwaine, I hold him suspect,</a>
<a id='line_4938'>therefore I charge you put him out of my court. So Sir Uwaine was</a>
<a id='line_4939'>discharged. And when Sir Gawaine wist that, he made him ready to go</a>
<a id='line_4940'>with him; and said, Whoso banisheth my cousin-germain shall banish me.</a>
<a id='line_4941'>So they two departed, and rode into a great forest, and so they came to</a>
<a id='line_4942'>an abbey of monks, and there were well lodged. But when the king wist</a>
<a id='line_4943'>that Sir Gawaine was departed from the court, there was made great</a>
<a id='line_4944'>sorrow among all the estates. Now, said Gaheris, Gawaine’s brother, we</a>
<a id='line_4945'>have lost two good knights for the love of one. So on the morn they</a>
<a id='line_4946'>heard their masses in the abbey, and so they rode forth till that they</a>
<a id='line_4947'>came to a great forest. Then was Sir Gawaine ware in a valley by a</a>
<a id='line_4948'>turret [of] twelve fair damosels, and two knights armed on great</a>
<a id='line_4949'>horses, and the damosels went to and fro by a tree. And then was Sir</a>
<a id='line_4950'>Gawaine ware how there hung a white shield on that tree, and ever as</a>
<a id='line_4951'>the damosels came by it they spit upon it, and some threw mire upon the</a>
<a id='line_4952'>shield.</a>

<a id='line_4956'>CHAPTER XVII. How Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine met with twelve fair</a>
<a id='line_4957'>damosels, and how they complained on Sir Marhaus.</a>
<a id='line_4958'></a>
<a id='line_4959'>Then Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine went and saluted them, and asked why</a>
<a id='line_4960'>they did that despite to the shield. Sir, said the damosels, we shall</a>
<a id='line_4961'>tell you. There is a knight in this country that owneth this white</a>
<a id='line_4962'>shield, and he is a passing good man of his hands, but he hateth all</a>
<a id='line_4963'>ladies and gentlewomen, and therefore we do all this despite to the</a>
<a id='line_4964'>shield. I shall say you, said Sir Gawaine, it beseemeth evil a good</a>
<a id='line_4965'>knight to despise all ladies and gentlewomen, and peradventure though</a>
<a id='line_4966'>he hate you he hath some certain cause, and peradventure he loveth in</a>
<a id='line_4967'>some other places ladies and gentlewomen, and to be loved again, an he</a>
<a id='line_4968'>be such a man of prowess as ye speak of. Now, what is his name? Sir,</a>
<a id='line_4969'>said they, his name is Marhaus, the king’s son of Ireland. I know him</a>
<a id='line_4970'>well, said Sir Uwaine, he is a passing good knight as any is alive, for</a>
<a id='line_4971'>I saw him once proved at a jousts where many knights were gathered, and</a>
<a id='line_4972'>that time there might no man withstand him. Ah! said Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_4973'>damosels, methinketh ye are to blame, for it is to suppose, he that</a>
<a id='line_4974'>hung that shield there, he will not be long therefrom, and then may</a>
<a id='line_4975'>those knights match him on horseback, and that is more your worship</a>
<a id='line_4976'>than thus; for I will abide no longer to see a knight’s shield</a>
<a id='line_4977'>dishonoured. And therewith Sir Uwaine and Gawaine departed a little</a>
<a id='line_4978'>from them, and then were they ware where Sir Marhaus came riding on a</a>
<a id='line_4979'>great horse straight toward them. And when the twelve damosels saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_4980'>Marhaus they fled into the turret as they were wild, so that some of</a>
<a id='line_4981'>them fell by the way. Then the one of the knights of the tower dressed</a>
<a id='line_4982'>his shield, and said on high, Sir Marhaus, defend thee. And so they ran</a>
<a id='line_4983'>together that the knight brake his spear on Marhaus, and Marhaus smote</a>
<a id='line_4984'>him so hard that he brake his neck and the horse’s back. That saw the</a>
<a id='line_4985'>other knight of the turret, and dressed him toward Marhaus, and they</a>
<a id='line_4986'>met so eagerly together that the knight of the turret was soon smitten</a>
<a id='line_4987'>down, horse and man, stark dead.</a>
<a id='line_4988'></a>
<a id='line_4989'></a>
<a id='line_4990'></a>
<a id='line_4991'>CHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Marhaus jousted with Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine,</a>
<a id='line_4992'>and overthrew them both.</a>
<a id='line_4993'></a>
<a id='line_4994'>And then Sir Marhaus rode unto his shield, and saw how it was defouled,</a>
<a id='line_4995'>and said, Of this despite I am a part avenged, but for her love that</a>
<a id='line_4996'>gave me this white shield I shall wear thee, and hang mine where thou</a>
<a id='line_4997'>wast; and so he hanged it about his neck. Then he rode straight unto</a>
<a id='line_4998'>Sir Gawaine and to Sir Uwaine, and asked them what they did there? They</a>
<a id='line_4999'>answered him that they came from King Arthur’s court to see adventures.</a>
<a id='line_5000'>Well, said Sir Marhaus, here am I ready, an adventurous knight that</a>
<a id='line_5001'>will fulfil any adventure that ye will desire; and so departed from</a>
<a id='line_5002'>them, to fetch his range. Let him go, said Sir Uwaine unto Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_5003'>for he is a passing good knight as any is living; I would not by my</a>
<a id='line_5004'>will that any of us were matched with him. Nay, said Sir Gawaine, not</a>
<a id='line_5005'>so, it were shame to us were he not assayed, were he never so good a</a>
<a id='line_5006'>knight. Well, said Sir Uwaine, I will assay him afore you, for I am</a>
<a id='line_5007'>more weaker than ye, and if he smite me down then may ye revenge me. So</a>
<a id='line_5008'>these two knights came together with great raundon, that Sir Uwaine</a>
<a id='line_5009'>smote Sir Marhaus that his spear brast in pieces on the shield, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_5010'>Marhaus smote him so sore that horse and man he bare to the earth, and</a>
<a id='line_5011'>hurt Sir Uwaine on the left side.</a>
<a id='line_5012'></a>
<a id='line_5013'>Then Sir Marhaus turned his horse and rode toward Gawaine with his</a>
<a id='line_5014'>spear, and when Sir Gawaine saw that he dressed his shield, and they</a>
<a id='line_5015'>aventred their spears, and they came together with all the might of</a>
<a id='line_5016'>their horses, that either knight smote other so hard in midst of their</a>
<a id='line_5017'>shields, but Sir Gawaine’s spear brake, but Sir Marhaus’ spear held;</a>
<a id='line_5018'>and therewith Sir Gawaine and his horse rushed down to the earth. And</a>
<a id='line_5019'>lightly Sir Gawaine rose on his feet, and pulled out his sword, and</a>
<a id='line_5020'>dressed him toward Sir Marhaus on foot, and Sir Marhaus saw that, and</a>
<a id='line_5021'>pulled out his sword and began to come to Sir Gawaine on horseback. Sir</a>
<a id='line_5022'>knight, said Sir Gawaine, alight on foot, or else I will slay thy</a>
<a id='line_5023'>horse. Gramercy, said Sir Marhaus, of your gentleness ye teach me</a>
<a id='line_5024'>courtesy, for it is not for one knight to be on foot, and the other on</a>
<a id='line_5025'>horseback. And therewith Sir Marhaus set his spear against a tree and</a>
<a id='line_5026'>alighted and tied his horse to a tree, and dressed his shield, and</a>
<a id='line_5027'>either came unto other eagerly, and smote together with their swords</a>
<a id='line_5028'>that their shields flew in cantels, and they bruised their helms and</a>
<a id='line_5029'>their hauberks, and wounded either other. But Sir Gawaine from it</a>
<a id='line_5030'>passed nine of the clock waxed ever stronger and stronger, for then it</a>
<a id='line_5031'>came to the hour of noon, and thrice his might was increased. All this</a>
<a id='line_5032'>espied Sir Marhaus and had great wonder how his might increased, and so</a>
<a id='line_5033'>they wounded other passing sore. And then when it was past noon, and</a>
<a id='line_5034'>when it drew toward evensong, Sir Gawaine’s strength feebled, and waxed</a>
<a id='line_5035'>passing faint that unnethes he might dure any longer, and Sir Marhaus</a>
<a id='line_5036'>was then bigger and bigger. Sir knight, said Sir Marhaus, I have well</a>
<a id='line_5037'>felt that ye are a passing good knight and a marvellous man of might as</a>
<a id='line_5038'>ever I felt any, while it lasteth, and our quarrels are not great, and</a>
<a id='line_5039'>therefore it were pity to do you hurt, for I feel ye are passing</a>
<a id='line_5040'>feeble. Ah, said Sir Gawaine, gentle knight, ye say the word that I</a>
<a id='line_5041'>should say. And therewith they took off their helms, and either kissed</a>
<a id='line_5042'>other, and there they swore together either to love other as brethren.</a>
<a id='line_5043'>And Sir Marhaus prayed Sir Gawaine to lodge with him that night. And so</a>
<a id='line_5044'>they took their horses, and rode toward Sir Marhaus’ house. And as they</a>
<a id='line_5045'>rode by the way, Sir knight, said Sir Gawaine, I have marvel that so</a>
<a id='line_5046'>valiant a man as ye be love no ladies nor damosels. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5047'>Marhaus, they name me wrongfully those that give me that name, but well</a>
<a id='line_5048'>I wot it be the damosels of the turret that so name me, and other such</a>
<a id='line_5049'>as they be. Now shall I tell you for what cause I hate them: for they</a>
<a id='line_5050'>be sorceresses and enchanters many of them, and be a knight never so</a>
<a id='line_5051'>good of his body and full of prowess as man may be, they will make him</a>
<a id='line_5052'>a stark coward to have the better of him, and this is the principal</a>
<a id='line_5053'>cause that I hate them; and to all good ladies and gentlewomen I owe my</a>
<a id='line_5054'>service as a knight ought to do.</a>
<a id='line_5055'></a>
<a id='line_5056'>As the book rehearseth in French, there were many knights that</a>
<a id='line_5057'>overmatched Sir Gawaine, for all the thrice might that he had: Sir</a>
<a id='line_5058'>Launcelot de Lake, Sir Tristram, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Percivale, Sir</a>
<a id='line_5059'>Pelleas, and Sir Marhaus, these six knights had the better of Sir</a>
<a id='line_5060'>Gawaine. Then within a little while they came to Sir Marhaus’ place,</a>
<a id='line_5061'>which was in a little priory, and there they alighted, and ladies and</a>
<a id='line_5062'>damosels unarmed them, and hastily looked to their hurts, for they were</a>
<a id='line_5063'>all three hurt. And so they had all three good lodging with Sir</a>
<a id='line_5064'>Marhaus, and good cheer; for when he wist that they were King Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_5065'>sister’s sons he made them all the cheer that lay in his power, and so</a>
<a id='line_5066'>they sojourned there a sennight, and were well eased of their wounds,</a>
<a id='line_5067'>and at the last departed. Now, said Sir Marhaus, we will not depart so</a>
<a id='line_5068'>lightly, for I will bring you through the forest; and rode day by day</a>
<a id='line_5069'>well a seven days or they found any adventure. At the last they came</a>
<a id='line_5070'>into a great forest, that was named the country and forest of Arroy,</a>
<a id='line_5071'>and the country of strange adventures. In this country, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5072'>Marhaus, came never knight since it was christened but he found strange</a>
<a id='line_5073'>adventures; and so they rode, and came into a deep valley full of</a>
<a id='line_5074'>stones, and thereby they saw a fair stream of water; above thereby was</a>
<a id='line_5075'>the head of the stream a fair fountain, and three damosels sitting</a>
<a id='line_5076'>thereby. And then they rode to them, and either saluted other, and the</a>
<a id='line_5077'>eldest had a garland of gold about her head, and she was three score</a>
<a id='line_5078'>winter of age or more, and her hair was white under the garland. The</a>
<a id='line_5079'>second damosel was of thirty winter of age, with a circlet of gold</a>
<a id='line_5080'>about her head. The third damosel was but fifteen year of age, and a</a>
<a id='line_5081'>garland of flowers about her head. When these knights had so beheld</a>
<a id='line_5082'>them, they asked them the cause why they sat at that fountain? We be</a>
<a id='line_5083'>here, said the damosels, for this cause: if we may see any errant</a>
<a id='line_5084'>knights, to teach them unto strange adventures; and ye be three knights</a>
<a id='line_5085'>that seek adventures, and we be three damosels, and therefore each one</a>
<a id='line_5086'>of you must choose one of us; and when ye have done so we will lead you</a>
<a id='line_5087'>unto three highways, and there each of you shall choose a way and his</a>
<a id='line_5088'>damosel with him. And this day twelvemonth ye must meet here again, and</a>
<a id='line_5089'>God send you your lives, and thereto ye must plight your troth. This is</a>
<a id='line_5090'>well said, said Sir Marhaus.</a>
<a id='line_5091'></a>
<a id='line_5092'></a>
<a id='line_5093'></a>
<a id='line_5094'>CHAPTER XIX. How Sir Marhaus, Sir Gawaine, and Sir Uwaine met three</a>
<a id='line_5095'>damosels, and each of them took one.</a>
<a id='line_5096'></a>
<a id='line_5097'>Now shall everych of us choose a damosel. I shall tell you, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5098'>Uwaine, I am the youngest and most weakest of you both, therefore I</a>
<a id='line_5099'>will have the eldest damosel, for she hath seen much, and can best help</a>
<a id='line_5100'>me when I have need, for I have most need of help of you both. Now,</a>
<a id='line_5101'>said Sir Marhaus, I will have the damosel of thirty winter age, for she</a>
<a id='line_5102'>falleth best to me. Well, said Sir Gawaine, I thank you, for ye have</a>
<a id='line_5103'>left me the youngest and the fairest, and she is most liefest to me.</a>
<a id='line_5104'>Then every damosel took her knight by the reins of his bridle, and</a>
<a id='line_5105'>brought him to the three ways, and there was their oath made to meet at</a>
<a id='line_5106'>the fountain that day twelvemonth an they were living, and so they</a>
<a id='line_5107'>kissed and departed, and each knight set his lady behind him. And Sir</a>
<a id='line_5108'>Uwaine took the way that lay west, and Sir Marhaus took the way that</a>
<a id='line_5109'>lay south, and Sir Gawaine took the way that lay north. Now will we</a>
<a id='line_5110'>begin at Sir Gawaine, that held that way till that he came unto a fair</a>
<a id='line_5111'>manor, where dwelled an old knight and a good householder, and there</a>
<a id='line_5112'>Sir Gawaine asked the knight if he knew any adventures in that country.</a>
<a id='line_5113'>I shall show you some to-morn, said the old knight, and that</a>
<a id='line_5114'>marvellous. So, on the morn they rode into the forest of adventures to</a>
<a id='line_5115'>a laund, and thereby they found a cross, and as they stood and hoved</a>
<a id='line_5116'>there came by them the fairest knight and the seemliest man that ever</a>
<a id='line_5117'>they saw, making the greatest dole that ever man made. And then he was</a>
<a id='line_5118'>ware of Sir Gawaine, and saluted him, and prayed God to send him much</a>
<a id='line_5119'>worship. As to that, said Sir Gawaine, gramercy; also I pray to God</a>
<a id='line_5120'>that he send you honour and worship. Ah, said the knight, I may lay</a>
<a id='line_5121'>that aside, for sorrow and shame cometh to me after worship.</a>
<a id='line_5122'></a>
<a id='line_5123'></a>
<a id='line_5124'></a>
<a id='line_5125'>CHAPTER XX. How a knight and a dwarf strove for a lady.</a>
<a id='line_5126'></a>
<a id='line_5127'>And therewith he passed unto the one side of the laund; and on the</a>
<a id='line_5128'>other side saw Sir Gawaine ten knights that hoved still and made them</a>
<a id='line_5129'>ready with their shields and spears against that one knight that came</a>
<a id='line_5130'>by Sir Gawaine.</a>
<a id='line_5131'></a>
<a id='line_5132'>Then this one knight aventred a great spear, and one of the ten knights</a>
<a id='line_5133'>encountered with him, but this woful knight smote him so hard that he</a>
<a id='line_5134'>fell over his horse’s tail. So this same dolorous knight served them</a>
<a id='line_5135'>all, that at the leastway he smote down horse and man, and all he did</a>
<a id='line_5136'>with one spear; and so when they were all ten on foot, they went to</a>
<a id='line_5137'>that one knight, and he stood stone still, and suffered them to pull</a>
<a id='line_5138'>him down off his horse, and bound him hand and foot, and tied him under</a>
<a id='line_5139'>the horse’s belly, and so led him with them. O Jesu! said Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_5140'>this is a doleful sight, to see the yonder knight so to be entreated,</a>
<a id='line_5141'>and it seemeth by the knight that he suffereth them to bind him so, for</a>
<a id='line_5142'>he maketh no resistance. No, said his host, that is truth, for an he</a>
<a id='line_5143'>would they all were too weak so to do him. Sir, said the damosel unto</a>
<a id='line_5144'>Sir Gawaine, meseemeth it were your worship to help that dolorous</a>
<a id='line_5145'>knight, for methinketh he is one of the best knights that ever I saw. I</a>
<a id='line_5146'>would do for him, said Sir Gawaine, but it seemeth he will have no</a>
<a id='line_5147'>help. Then, said the damosel, methinketh ye have no lust to help him.</a>
<a id='line_5148'></a>
<a id='line_5149'>Thus as they talked they saw a knight on the other side of the laund</a>
<a id='line_5150'>all armed save the head. And on the other side there came a dwarf on</a>
<a id='line_5151'>horseback all armed save the head, with a great mouth and a short nose;</a>
<a id='line_5152'>and when the dwarf came nigh he said, Where is the lady should meet us</a>
<a id='line_5153'>here? and therewithal she came forth out of the wood. And then they</a>
<a id='line_5154'>began to strive for the lady; for the knight said he would have her,</a>
<a id='line_5155'>and the dwarf said he would have her. Will we do well? said the dwarf;</a>
<a id='line_5156'>yonder is a knight at the cross, let us put it both upon him, and as he</a>
<a id='line_5157'>deemeth so shall it be. I will well, said the knight, and so they went</a>
<a id='line_5158'>all three unto Sir Gawaine and told him wherefore they strove. Well,</a>
<a id='line_5159'>sirs, said he, will ye put the matter in my hand? Yea, they said both.</a>
<a id='line_5160'>Now damosel, said Sir Gawaine, ye shall stand betwixt them both, and</a>
<a id='line_5161'>whether ye list better to go to, he shall have you. And when she was</a>
<a id='line_5162'>set between them both, she left the knight and went to the dwarf, and</a>
<a id='line_5163'>the dwarf took her and went his way singing, and the knight went his</a>
<a id='line_5164'>way with great mourning.</a>
<a id='line_5165'></a>
<a id='line_5166'>Then came there two knights all armed, and cried on high, Sir Gawaine!</a>
<a id='line_5167'>knight of King Arthur’s, make thee ready in all haste and joust with</a>
<a id='line_5168'>me. So they ran together, that either fell down, and then on foot they</a>
<a id='line_5169'>drew their swords, and did full actually. The meanwhile the other</a>
<a id='line_5170'>knight went to the damosel, and asked her why she abode with that</a>
<a id='line_5171'>knight, and if ye would abide with me, I will be your faithful knight.</a>
<a id='line_5172'>And with you will I be, said the damosel, for with Sir Gawaine I may</a>
<a id='line_5173'>not find in mine heart to be with him; for now here was one knight</a>
<a id='line_5174'>discomfited ten knights, and at the last he was cowardly led away; and</a>
<a id='line_5175'>therefore let us two go whilst they fight. And Sir Gawaine fought with</a>
<a id='line_5176'>that other knight long, but at the last they accorded both. And then</a>
<a id='line_5177'>the knight prayed Sir Gawaine to lodge with him that night. So as Sir</a>
<a id='line_5178'>Gawaine went with this knight he asked him, What knight is he in this</a>
<a id='line_5179'>country that smote down the ten knights? For when he had done so</a>
<a id='line_5180'>manfully he suffered them to bind him hand and foot, and so led him</a>
<a id='line_5181'>away. Ah, said the knight, that is the best knight I trow in the world,</a>
<a id='line_5182'>and the most man of prowess, and he hath been served so as he was even</a>
<a id='line_5183'>more than ten times, and his name hight Sir Pelleas, and he loveth a</a>
<a id='line_5184'>great lady in this country and her name is Ettard. And so when he loved</a>
<a id='line_5185'>her there was cried in this country a great jousts three days, and all</a>
<a id='line_5186'>the knights of this country were there and gentlewomen, and who that</a>
<a id='line_5187'>proved him the best knight should have a passing good sword and a</a>
<a id='line_5188'>circlet of gold, and the circlet the knight should give it to the</a>
<a id='line_5189'>fairest lady that was at the jousts. And this knight Sir Pelleas was</a>
<a id='line_5190'>the best knight that was there, and there were five hundred knights,</a>
<a id='line_5191'>but there was never man that ever Sir Pelleas met withal but he struck</a>
<a id='line_5192'>him down, or else from his horse; and every day of three days he struck</a>
<a id='line_5193'>down twenty knights, therefore they gave him the prize, and forthwithal</a>
<a id='line_5194'>he went thereas the Lady Ettard was, and gave her the circlet, and said</a>
<a id='line_5195'>openly she was the fairest lady that there was, and that would he prove</a>
<a id='line_5196'>upon any knight that would say nay.</a>
<a id='line_5197'></a>
<a id='line_5198'></a>
<a id='line_5199'></a>
<a id='line_5200'>CHAPTER XXI. How King Pelleas suffered himself to be taken prisoner</a>
<a id='line_5201'>because he would have a sight of his lady, and how Sir Gawaine promised</a>
<a id='line_5202'>him to get to him the love of his lady.</a>
<a id='line_5203'></a>
<a id='line_5204'>And so he chose her for his sovereign lady, and never to love other but</a>
<a id='line_5205'>her, but she was so proud that she had scorn of him, and said that she</a>
<a id='line_5206'>would never love him though he would die for her. Wherefore all ladies</a>
<a id='line_5207'>and gentlewomen had scorn of her that she was so proud, for there were</a>
<a id='line_5208'>fairer than she, and there was none that was there but an Sir Pelleas</a>
<a id='line_5209'>would have proffered them love, they would have loved him for his noble</a>
<a id='line_5210'>prowess. And so this knight promised the Lady Ettard to follow her into</a>
<a id='line_5211'>this country, and never to leave her till she loved him. And thus he is</a>
<a id='line_5212'>here the most part nigh her, and lodged by a priory, and every week she</a>
<a id='line_5213'>sendeth knights to fight with him. And when he hath put them to the</a>
<a id='line_5214'>worse, then will he suffer them wilfully to take him prisoner, because</a>
<a id='line_5215'>he would have a sight of this lady. And always she doth him great</a>
<a id='line_5216'>despite, for sometime she maketh her knights to tie him to his horse’s</a>
<a id='line_5217'>tail, and some to bind him under the horse’s belly; thus in the most</a>
<a id='line_5218'>shamefullest ways that she can think he is brought to her. And all she</a>
<a id='line_5219'>doth it for to cause him to leave this country, and to leave his</a>
<a id='line_5220'>loving; but all this cannot make him to leave, for an he would have</a>
<a id='line_5221'>fought on foot he might have had the better of the ten knights as well</a>
<a id='line_5222'>on foot as on horseback. Alas, said Sir Gawaine, it is great pity of</a>
<a id='line_5223'>him; and after this night I will seek him to-morrow, in this forest, to</a>
<a id='line_5224'>do him all the help I can. So on the morn Sir Gawaine took his leave of</a>
<a id='line_5225'>his host Sir Carados, and rode into the forest; and at the last he met</a>
<a id='line_5226'>with Sir Pelleas, making great moan out of measure, so each of them</a>
<a id='line_5227'>saluted other, and asked him why he made such sorrow. And as it is</a>
<a id='line_5228'>above rehearsed, Sir Pelleas told Sir Gawaine: But always I suffer her</a>
<a id='line_5229'>knights to fare so with me as ye saw yesterday, in trust at the last to</a>
<a id='line_5230'>win her love, for she knoweth well all her knights should not lightly</a>
<a id='line_5231'>win me, an me list to fight with them to the uttermost. Wherefore an I</a>
<a id='line_5232'>loved her not so sore, I had liefer die an hundred times, an I might</a>
<a id='line_5233'>die so oft, rather than I would suffer that despite; but I trust she</a>
<a id='line_5234'>will have pity upon me at the last, for love causeth many a good knight</a>
<a id='line_5235'>to suffer to have his entent, but alas I am unfortunate. And therewith</a>
<a id='line_5236'>he made so great dole and sorrow that unnethe he might hold him on</a>
<a id='line_5237'>horseback.</a>
<a id='line_5238'></a>
<a id='line_5239'>Now, said Sir Gawaine, leave your mourning and I shall promise you by</a>
<a id='line_5240'>the faith of my body to do all that lieth in my power to get you the</a>
<a id='line_5241'>love of your lady, and thereto I will plight you my troth. Ah, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5242'>Pelleas, of what court are ye? tell me, I pray you, my good friend. And</a>
<a id='line_5243'>then Sir Gawaine said, I am of the court of King Arthur, and his</a>
<a id='line_5244'>sister’s son, and King Lot of Orkney was my father, and my name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_5245'>Gawaine. And then he said, My name is Sir Pelleas, born in the Isles,</a>
<a id='line_5246'>and of many isles I am lord, and never have I loved lady nor damosel</a>
<a id='line_5247'>till now in an unhappy time; and, sir knight, since ye are so nigh</a>
<a id='line_5248'>cousin unto King Arthur, and a king’s son, therefore betray me not but</a>
<a id='line_5249'>help me, for I may never come by her but by some good knight, for she</a>
<a id='line_5250'>is in a strong castle here, fast by within this four mile, and over all</a>
<a id='line_5251'>this country she is lady of. And so I may never come to her presence,</a>
<a id='line_5252'>but as I suffer her knights to take me, and but if I did so that I</a>
<a id='line_5253'>might have a sight of her, I had been dead long or this time; and yet</a>
<a id='line_5254'>fair word had I never of her, but when I am brought to-fore her she</a>
<a id='line_5255'>rebuketh me in the foulest manner. And then they take my horse and</a>
<a id='line_5256'>harness and put me out of the gates, and she will not suffer me to eat</a>
<a id='line_5257'>nor drink; and always I offer me to be her prisoner, but that she will</a>
<a id='line_5258'>not suffer me, for I would desire no more, what pains so ever I had, so</a>
<a id='line_5259'>that I might have a sight of her daily. Well, said Sir Gawaine, all</a>
<a id='line_5260'>this shall I amend an ye will do as I shall devise: I will have your</a>
<a id='line_5261'>horse and your armour, and so will I ride unto her castle and tell her</a>
<a id='line_5262'>that I have slain you, and so shall I come within her to cause her to</a>
<a id='line_5263'>cherish me, and then shall I do my true part that ye shall not fail to</a>
<a id='line_5264'>have the love of her.</a>
<a id='line_5265'></a>
<a id='line_5266'></a>
<a id='line_5267'></a>
<a id='line_5268'>CHAPTER XXII. How Sir Gawaine came to the Lady Ettard, and how Sir</a>
<a id='line_5269'>Pelleas found them sleeping.</a>
<a id='line_5270'></a>
<a id='line_5271'>And therewith Sir Gawaine plight his troth unto Sir Pelleas to be true</a>
<a id='line_5272'>and faithful unto him; so each one plight their troth to other, and so</a>
<a id='line_5273'>they changed horses and harness, and Sir Gawaine departed, and came to</a>
<a id='line_5274'>the castle whereas stood the pavilions of this lady without the gate.</a>
<a id='line_5275'>And as soon as Ettard had espied Sir Gawaine she fled in toward the</a>
<a id='line_5276'>castle. Sir Gawaine spake on high, and bade her abide, for he was not</a>
<a id='line_5277'>Sir Pelleas; I am another knight that have slain Sir Pelleas. Do off</a>
<a id='line_5278'>your helm, said the Lady Ettard, that I may see your visage. And so</a>
<a id='line_5279'>when she saw that it was not Sir Pelleas, she bade him alight and led</a>
<a id='line_5280'>him unto her castle, and asked him faithfully whether he had slain Sir</a>
<a id='line_5281'>Pelleas. And he said her yea, and told her his name was Sir Gawaine of</a>
<a id='line_5282'>the court of King Arthur, and his sister’s son. Truly, said she, that</a>
<a id='line_5283'>is great pity, for he was a passing good knight of his body, but of all</a>
<a id='line_5284'>men alive I hated him most, for I could never be quit of him; and for</a>
<a id='line_5285'>ye have slain him I shall be your woman, and to do anything that might</a>
<a id='line_5286'>please you. So she made Sir Gawaine good cheer. Then Sir Gawaine said</a>
<a id='line_5287'>that he loved a lady and by no means she would love him. She is to</a>
<a id='line_5288'>blame, said Ettard, an she will not love you, for ye that be so well</a>
<a id='line_5289'>born a man, and such a man of prowess, there is no lady in the world</a>
<a id='line_5290'>too good for you. Will ye, said Sir Gawaine, promise me to do all that</a>
<a id='line_5291'>ye may, by the faith of your body, to get me the love of my lady? Yea,</a>
<a id='line_5292'>sir, said she, and that I promise you by the faith of my body. Now,</a>
<a id='line_5293'>said Sir Gawaine, it is yourself that I love so well, therefore I pray</a>
<a id='line_5294'>you hold your promise. I may not choose, said the Lady Ettard, but if I</a>
<a id='line_5295'>should be forsworn; and so she granted him to fulfil all his desire.</a>
<a id='line_5296'></a>
<a id='line_5297'>So it was then in the month of May that she and Sir Gawaine went out of</a>
<a id='line_5298'>the castle and supped in a pavilion, and there was made a bed, and</a>
<a id='line_5299'>there Sir Gawaine and the Lady Ettard went to bed together, and in</a>
<a id='line_5300'>another pavilion she laid her damosels, and in the third pavilion she</a>
<a id='line_5301'>laid part of her knights, for then she had no dread of Sir Pelleas. And</a>
<a id='line_5302'>there Sir Gawaine lay with her in that pavilion two days and two</a>
<a id='line_5303'>nights. And on the third day, in the morning early, Sir Pelleas armed</a>
<a id='line_5304'>him, for he had never slept since Sir Gawaine departed from him; for</a>
<a id='line_5305'>Sir Gawaine had promised him by the faith of his body, to come to him</a>
<a id='line_5306'>unto his pavilion by that priory within the space of a day and a night.</a>
<a id='line_5307'></a>
<a id='line_5308'>Then Sir Pelleas mounted upon horseback, and came to the pavilions that</a>
<a id='line_5309'>stood without the castle, and found in the first pavilion three knights</a>
<a id='line_5310'>in three beds, and three squires lying at their feet. Then went he to</a>
<a id='line_5311'>the second pavilion and found four gentlewomen lying in four beds. And</a>
<a id='line_5312'>then he yede to the third pavilion and found Sir Gawaine lying in bed</a>
<a id='line_5313'>with his Lady Ettard, and either clipping other in arms, and when he</a>
<a id='line_5314'>saw that his heart well-nigh brast for sorrow, and said: Alas! that</a>
<a id='line_5315'>ever a knight should be found so false; and then he took his horse and</a>
<a id='line_5316'>might not abide no longer for pure sorrow. And when he had ridden nigh</a>
<a id='line_5317'>half a mile he turned again and thought to slay them both; and when he</a>
<a id='line_5318'>saw them both so lie sleeping fast, unnethe he might hold him on</a>
<a id='line_5319'>horseback for sorrow, and said thus to himself, Though this knight be</a>
<a id='line_5320'>never so false, I will never slay him sleeping, for I will never</a>
<a id='line_5321'>destroy the high order of knighthood; and therewith he departed again.</a>
<a id='line_5322'>And or he had ridden half a mile he returned again, and thought then to</a>
<a id='line_5323'>slay them both, making the greatest sorrow that ever man made. And when</a>
<a id='line_5324'>he came to the pavilions, he tied his horse unto a tree, and pulled out</a>
<a id='line_5325'>his sword naked in his hand, and went to them thereas they lay, and yet</a>
<a id='line_5326'>he thought it were shame to slay them sleeping, and laid the naked</a>
<a id='line_5327'>sword overthwart both their throats, and so took his horse and rode his</a>
<a id='line_5328'>way.</a>
<a id='line_5329'></a>
<a id='line_5330'>And when Sir Pelleas came to his pavilions he told his knights and his</a>
<a id='line_5331'>squires how he had sped, and said thus to them, For your true and good</a>
<a id='line_5332'>service ye have done me I shall give you all my goods, for I will go</a>
<a id='line_5333'>unto my bed and never arise until I am dead. And when that I am dead I</a>
<a id='line_5334'>charge you that ye take the heart out of my body and bear it her</a>
<a id='line_5335'>betwixt two silver dishes, and tell her how I saw her lie with the</a>
<a id='line_5336'>false knight Sir Gawaine. Right so Sir Pelleas unarmed himself, and</a>
<a id='line_5337'>went unto his bed making marvellous dole and sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_5338'></a>
<a id='line_5339'>When Sir Gawaine and Ettard awoke of their sleep, and found the naked</a>
<a id='line_5340'>sword overthwart their throats, then she knew well it was Sir Pelleas’</a>
<a id='line_5341'>sword. Alas! said she to Sir Gawaine, ye have betrayed me and Sir</a>
<a id='line_5342'>Pelleas both, for ye told me ye had slain him, and now I know well it</a>
<a id='line_5343'>is not so, he is alive. And if Sir Pelleas had been as uncourteous to</a>
<a id='line_5344'>you as ye have been to him ye had been a dead knight; but ye have</a>
<a id='line_5345'>deceived me and betrayed me falsely, that all ladies and damosels may</a>
<a id='line_5346'>beware by you and me. And therewith Sir Gawaine made him ready, and</a>
<a id='line_5347'>went into the forest. So it happed then that the Damosel of the Lake,</a>
<a id='line_5348'>Nimue, met with a knight of Sir Pelleas, that went on his foot in the</a>
<a id='line_5349'>forest making great dole, and she asked him the cause. And so the woful</a>
<a id='line_5350'>knight told her how his master and lord was betrayed through a knight</a>
<a id='line_5351'>and lady, and how he will never arise out of his bed till he be dead.</a>
<a id='line_5352'>Bring me to him, said she anon, and I will warrant his life he shall</a>
<a id='line_5353'>not die for love, and she that hath caused him so to love, she shall be</a>
<a id='line_5354'>in as evil plight as he is or it be long to, for it is no joy of such a</a>
<a id='line_5355'>proud lady that will have no mercy of such a valiant knight. Anon that</a>
<a id='line_5356'>knight brought her unto him, and when she saw him lie in his bed, she</a>
<a id='line_5357'>thought she saw never so likely a knight; and therewith she threw an</a>
<a id='line_5358'>enchantment upon him, and he fell asleep. And therewhile she rode unto</a>
<a id='line_5359'>the Lady Ettard, and charged no man to awake him till she came again.</a>
<a id='line_5360'>So within two hours she brought the Lady Ettard thither, and both</a>
<a id='line_5361'>ladies found him asleep: Lo, said the Damosel of the Lake, ye ought to</a>
<a id='line_5362'>be ashamed for to murder such a knight. And therewith she threw such an</a>
<a id='line_5363'>enchantment upon her that she loved him sore, that well-nigh she was</a>
<a id='line_5364'>out of her mind. O Lord Jesu, said the Lady Ettard, how is it befallen</a>
<a id='line_5365'>unto me that I love now him that I have most hated of any man alive?</a>
<a id='line_5366'>That is the righteous judgment of God, said the damosel. And then anon</a>
<a id='line_5367'>Sir Pelleas awaked and looked upon Ettard; and when he saw her he knew</a>
<a id='line_5368'>her, and then he hated her more than any woman alive, and said: Away,</a>
<a id='line_5369'>traitress, come never in my sight. And when she heard him say so, she</a>
<a id='line_5370'>wept and made great sorrow out of measure.</a>
<a id='line_5371'></a>
<a id='line_5372'></a>
<a id='line_5373'></a>
<a id='line_5374'>CHAPTER XXIII. How Sir Pelleas loved no more Ettard by means of the</a>
<a id='line_5375'>Damosel of the Lake, whom he loved ever after.</a>
<a id='line_5376'></a>
<a id='line_5377'>Sir knight Pelleas, said the Damosel of the Lake, take your horse and</a>
<a id='line_5378'>come forth with me out of this country, and ye shall love a lady that</a>
<a id='line_5379'>shall love you. I will well, said Sir Pelleas, for this Lady Ettard</a>
<a id='line_5380'>hath done me great despite and shame, and there he told her the</a>
<a id='line_5381'>beginning and ending, and how he had purposed never to have arisen till</a>
<a id='line_5382'>that he had been dead. And now such grace God hath sent me, that I hate</a>
<a id='line_5383'>her as much as ever I loved her, thanked be our Lord Jesus! Thank me,</a>
<a id='line_5384'>said the Damosel of the Lake. Anon Sir Pelleas armed him, and took his</a>
<a id='line_5385'>horse, and commanded his men to bring after his pavilions and his stuff</a>
<a id='line_5386'>where the Damosel of the Lake would assign. So the Lady Ettard died for</a>
<a id='line_5387'>sorrow, and the Damosel of the Lake rejoiced Sir Pelleas, and loved</a>
<a id='line_5388'>together during their life days.</a>
<a id='line_5389'></a>
<a id='line_5390'></a>
<a id='line_5391'></a>
<a id='line_5392'>CHAPTER XXIV. How Sir Marhaus rode with the damosel, and how he came to</a>
<a id='line_5393'>the Duke of the South Marches.</a>
<a id='line_5394'></a>
<a id='line_5395'>Now turn we unto Sir Marhaus, that rode with the damosel of thirty</a>
<a id='line_5396'>winter of age, southward. And so they came into a deep forest, and by</a>
<a id='line_5397'>fortune they were nighted, and rode long in a deep way, and at the last</a>
<a id='line_5398'>they came unto a courtelage, and there they asked harbour. But the man</a>
<a id='line_5399'>of the courtelage would not lodge them for no treatise that they could</a>
<a id='line_5400'>treat, but thus much the good man said, An ye will take the adventure</a>
<a id='line_5401'>of your lodging, I shall bring you where ye shall be lodged. What</a>
<a id='line_5402'>adventure is that that I shall have for my lodging? said Sir Marhaus.</a>
<a id='line_5403'>Ye shall wit when ye come there, said the good man. Sir, what adventure</a>
<a id='line_5404'>so it be, bring me thither I pray thee, said Sir Marhaus; for I am</a>
<a id='line_5405'>weary, my damosel, and my horse. So the good man went and opened the</a>
<a id='line_5406'>gate, and within an hour he brought him unto a fair castle, and then</a>
<a id='line_5407'>the poor man called the porter, and anon he was let into the castle,</a>
<a id='line_5408'>and so he told the lord how he brought him a knight errant and a</a>
<a id='line_5409'>damosel that would be lodged with him. Let him in, said the lord, it</a>
<a id='line_5410'>may happen he shall repent that they took their lodging here.</a>
<a id='line_5411'></a>
<a id='line_5412'>So Sir Marhaus was let in with torchlight, and there was a goodly sight</a>
<a id='line_5413'>of young men that welcomed him. And then his horse was led into the</a>
<a id='line_5414'>stable, and he and the damosel were brought into the hall, and there</a>
<a id='line_5415'>stood a mighty duke and many goodly men about him. Then this lord asked</a>
<a id='line_5416'>him what he hight, and from whence he came, and with whom he dwelt.</a>
<a id='line_5417'>Sir, he said, I am a knight of King Arthur’s and knight of the Table</a>
<a id='line_5418'>Round, and my name is Sir Marhaus, and born I am in Ireland. And then</a>
<a id='line_5419'>said the duke to him, That me sore repenteth: the cause is this, for I</a>
<a id='line_5420'>love not thy lord nor none of thy fellows of the Table Round; and</a>
<a id='line_5421'>therefore ease thyself this night as well as thou mayest, for as</a>
<a id='line_5422'>to-morn I and my six sons shall match with you. Is there no remedy but</a>
<a id='line_5423'>that I must have ado with you and your six sons at once? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5424'>Marhaus. No, said the duke, for this cause I made mine avow, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_5425'>Gawaine slew my seven sons in a recounter, therefore I made mine avow,</a>
<a id='line_5426'>there should never knight of King Arthur’s court lodge with me, or come</a>
<a id='line_5427'>thereas I might have ado with him, but that I would have a revenging of</a>
<a id='line_5428'>my sons’ death. What is your name? said Sir Marhaus; I require you tell</a>
<a id='line_5429'>me, an it please you. Wit thou well I am the Duke of South Marches. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_5430'>said Sir Marhaus, I have heard say that ye have been long time a great</a>
<a id='line_5431'>foe unto my lord Arthur and to his knights. That shall ye feel to-morn,</a>
<a id='line_5432'>said the duke. Shall I have ado with you? said Sir Marhaus. Yea, said</a>
<a id='line_5433'>the duke, thereof shalt thou not choose, and therefore take you to your</a>
<a id='line_5434'>chamber, and ye shall have all that to you longeth. So Sir Marhaus</a>
<a id='line_5435'>departed and was led to a chamber, and his damosel was led unto her</a>
<a id='line_5436'>chamber. And on the morn the duke sent unto Sir Marhaus and bade make</a>
<a id='line_5437'>him ready. And so Sir Marhaus arose and armed him, and then there was a</a>
<a id='line_5438'>mass sung afore him, and brake his fast, and so mounted on horseback in</a>
<a id='line_5439'>the court of the castle where they should do the battle. So there was</a>
<a id='line_5440'>the duke all ready on horseback, clean armed, and his six sons by him,</a>
<a id='line_5441'>and everych had a spear in his hand, and so they encountered, whereas</a>
<a id='line_5442'>the duke and his two sons brake their spears upon him, but Sir Marhaus</a>
<a id='line_5443'>held up his spear and touched none of them.</a>
<a id='line_5444'></a>

<a id='line_5446'></a>
<a id='line_5447'>CHAPTER XXV. How Sir Marhaus fought with the duke and his four sons and</a>
<a id='line_5448'>made them to yield them.</a>
<a id='line_5449'></a>
<a id='line_5450'>Then came the four sons by couple, and two of them brake their spears,</a>
<a id='line_5451'>and so did the other two. And all this while Sir Marhaus touched them</a>
<a id='line_5452'>not. Then Sir Marhaus ran to the duke, and smote him with his spear</a>
<a id='line_5453'>that horse and man fell to the earth, and so he served his sons; and</a>
<a id='line_5454'>then Sir Marhaus alighted down and bade the duke yield him or else he</a>
<a id='line_5455'>would slay him. And then some of his sons recovered, and would have set</a>
<a id='line_5456'>upon Sir Marhaus; then Sir Marhaus said to the duke, Cease thy sons, or</a>
<a id='line_5457'>else I will do the uttermost to you all. Then the duke saw he might not</a>
<a id='line_5458'>escape the death, he cried to his sons, and charged them to yield them</a>
<a id='line_5459'>to Sir Marhaus; and they kneeled all down and put the pommels of their</a>
<a id='line_5460'>swords to the knight, and so he received them. And then they helped up</a>
<a id='line_5461'>their father, and so by their cominal assent promised to Sir Marhaus</a>
<a id='line_5462'>never to be foes unto King Arthur, and thereupon at Whitsuntide after</a>
<a id='line_5463'>to come, he and his sons, and put them in the king’s grace.</a>
<a id='line_5464'></a>
<a id='line_5465'>Then Sir Marhaus departed, and within two days his damosel brought him</a>
<a id='line_5466'>whereas was a great tournament that the Lady de Vawse had cried. And</a>
<a id='line_5467'>who that did best should have a rich circlet of gold worth a thousand</a>
<a id='line_5468'>besants. And there Sir Marhaus did so nobly that he was renowned, and</a>
<a id='line_5469'>had sometime down forty knights, and so the circlet of gold was</a>
<a id='line_5470'>rewarded him. Then he departed from them with great worship; and so</a>
<a id='line_5471'>within seven nights his damosel brought him to an earl’s place, his</a>
<a id='line_5472'>name was the Earl Fergus, that after was Sir Tristram’s knight; and</a>
<a id='line_5473'>this earl was but a young man, and late come into his lands, and there</a>
<a id='line_5474'>was a giant fast by him that hight Taulurd, and he had another brother</a>
<a id='line_5475'>in Cornwall that hight Taulas, that Sir Tristram slew when he was out</a>
<a id='line_5476'>of his mind. So this earl made his complaint unto Sir Marhaus, that</a>
<a id='line_5477'>there was a giant by him that destroyed all his lands, and how he durst</a>
<a id='line_5478'>nowhere ride nor go for him. Sir, said the knight, whether useth he to</a>
<a id='line_5479'>fight on horseback or on foot? Nay, said the earl, there may no horse</a>
<a id='line_5480'>bear him. Well, said Sir Marhaus, then will I fight with him on foot;</a>
<a id='line_5481'>so on the morn Sir Marhaus prayed the earl that one of his men might</a>
<a id='line_5482'>bring him whereas the giant was; and so he was, for he saw him sit</a>
<a id='line_5483'>under a tree of holly, and many clubs of iron and gisarms about him. So</a>
<a id='line_5484'>this knight dressed him to the giant, putting his shield afore him, and</a>
<a id='line_5485'>the giant took an iron club in his hand, and at the first stroke he</a>
<a id='line_5486'>clave Sir Marhaus’ shield in two pieces. And there he was in great</a>
<a id='line_5487'>peril, for the giant was a wily fighter, but at last Sir Marhaus smote</a>
<a id='line_5488'>off his right arm above the elbow.</a>
<a id='line_5489'></a>
<a id='line_5490'>Then the giant fled and the knight after him, and so he drove him into</a>
<a id='line_5491'>a water, but the giant was so high that he might not wade after him.</a>
<a id='line_5492'>And then Sir Marhaus made the Earl Fergus’ man to fetch him stones, and</a>
<a id='line_5493'>with those stones the knight gave the giant many sore knocks, till at</a>
<a id='line_5494'>the last he made him fall down into the water, and so was he there</a>
<a id='line_5495'>dead. Then Sir Marhaus went unto the giant’s castle, and there he</a>
<a id='line_5496'>delivered twenty-four ladies and twelve knights out of the giant’s</a>
<a id='line_5497'>prison, and there he had great riches without number, so that the days</a>
<a id='line_5498'>of his life he was never poor man. Then he returned to the Earl Fergus,</a>
<a id='line_5499'>the which thanked him greatly, and would have given him half his lands,</a>
<a id='line_5500'>but he would none take. So Sir Marhaus dwelled with the earl nigh half</a>
<a id='line_5501'>a year, for he was sore bruised with the giant, and at the last he took</a>
<a id='line_5502'>his leave. And as he rode by the way, he met with Sir Gawaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_5503'>Uwaine, and so by adventure he met with four knights of Arthur’s court,</a>
<a id='line_5504'>the first was Sir Sagramore le Desirous, Sir Osanna, Sir Dodinas le</a>
<a id='line_5505'>Savage, and Sir Felot of Listinoise; and there Sir Marhaus with one</a>
<a id='line_5506'>spear smote down these four knights, and hurt them sore. So he departed</a>
<a id='line_5507'>to meet at his day aforeset.</a>

<a id='line_5511'>CHAPTER XXVI. How Sir Uwaine rode with the damosel of sixty year of</a>
<a id='line_5512'>age, and how he gat the prize at tourneying.</a>
<a id='line_5513'></a>
<a id='line_5514'>Now turn we unto Sir Uwaine, that rode westward with his damosel of</a>
<a id='line_5515'>three score winter of age, and she brought him thereas was a tournament</a>
<a id='line_5516'>nigh the march of Wales. And at that tournament Sir Uwaine smote down</a>
<a id='line_5517'>thirty knights, therefore was given him the prize, and that was a</a>
<a id='line_5518'>gerfalcon, and a white steed trapped with cloth of gold. So then Sir</a>
<a id='line_5519'>Uwaine did many strange adventures by the means of the old damosel, and</a>
<a id='line_5520'>so she brought him to a lady that was called the Lady of the Rock, the</a>
<a id='line_5521'>which was much courteous. So there were in the country two knights that</a>
<a id='line_5522'>were brethren, and they were called two perilous knights, the one</a>
<a id='line_5523'>knight hight Sir Edward of the Red Castle, and the other Sir Hue of the</a>
<a id='line_5524'>Red Castle; and these two brethren had disherited the Lady of the Rock</a>
<a id='line_5525'>of a barony of lands by their extortion. And as this knight was lodged</a>
<a id='line_5526'>with this lady she made her complaint to him of these two knights.</a>
<a id='line_5527'></a>
<a id='line_5528'>Madam, said Sir Uwaine, they are to blame, for they do against the high</a>
<a id='line_5529'>order of knighthood, and the oath that they made; and if it like you I</a>
<a id='line_5530'>will speak with them, because I am a knight of King Arthur’s, and I</a>
<a id='line_5531'>will entreat them with fairness; and if they will not, I shall do</a>
<a id='line_5532'>battle with them, and in the defence of your right. Gramercy said the</a>
<a id='line_5533'>lady, and thereas I may not acquit you, God shall. So on the morn the</a>
<a id='line_5534'>two knights were sent for, that they should come thither to speak with</a>
<a id='line_5535'>the Lady of the Rock, and wit ye well they failed not, for they came</a>
<a id='line_5536'>with an hundred horse. But when this lady saw them in this manner so</a>
<a id='line_5537'>big, she would not suffer Sir Uwaine to go out to them upon no surety</a>
<a id='line_5538'>nor for no fair language, but she made him speak with them over a</a>
<a id='line_5539'>tower, but finally these two brethren would not be entreated, and</a>
<a id='line_5540'>answered that they would keep that they had. Well, said Sir Uwaine,</a>
<a id='line_5541'>then will I fight with one of you, and prove that ye do this lady</a>
<a id='line_5542'>wrong. That will we not, said they, for an we do battle, we two will</a>
<a id='line_5543'>fight with one knight at once, and therefore if ye will fight so, we</a>
<a id='line_5544'>will be ready at what hour ye will assign. And if ye win us in battle</a>
<a id='line_5545'>the lady shall have her lands again. Ye say well, said Sir Uwaine,</a>
<a id='line_5546'>therefore make you ready so that ye be here to-morn in the defence of</a>
<a id='line_5547'>the lady’s right.</a>

<a id='line_5552'>them.</a>
<a id='line_5553'></a>
<a id='line_5554'>So was there sikerness made on both parties that no treason should be</a>
<a id='line_5555'>wrought on neither party; so then the knights departed and made them</a>
<a id='line_5556'>ready, and that night Sir Uwaine had great cheer. And on the morn he</a>
<a id='line_5557'>arose early and heard mass, and brake his fast, and so he rode unto the</a>
<a id='line_5558'>plain without the gates, where hoved the two brethren abiding him. So</a>
<a id='line_5559'>they rode together passing sore, that Sir Edward and Sir Hue brake</a>
<a id='line_5560'>their spears upon Sir Uwaine. And Sir Uwaine smote Sir Edward that he</a>
<a id='line_5561'>fell over his horse and yet his spear brast not. And then he spurred</a>
<a id='line_5562'>his horse and came upon Sir Hue and overthrew him, but they soon</a>
<a id='line_5563'>recovered and dressed their shields and drew their swords and bade Sir</a>
<a id='line_5564'>Uwaine alight and do his battle to the uttermost. Then Sir Uwaine</a>
<a id='line_5565'>devoided his horse suddenly, and put his shield afore him and drew his</a>
<a id='line_5566'>sword, and so they dressed together, and either gave other such</a>
<a id='line_5567'>strokes, and there these two brethren wounded Sir Uwaine passing</a>
<a id='line_5568'>grievously that the Lady of the Rock weened he should have died. And</a>
<a id='line_5569'>thus they fought together five hours as men raged out of reason. And at</a>
<a id='line_5570'>the last Sir Uwaine smote Sir Edward upon the helm such a stroke that</a>
<a id='line_5571'>his sword carved unto his canel bone, and then Sir Hue abated his</a>
<a id='line_5572'>courage, but Sir Uwaine pressed fast to have slain him. That saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_5573'>Hue: he kneeled down and yielded him to Sir Uwaine. And he of his</a>
<a id='line_5574'>gentleness received his sword, and took him by the hand, and went into</a>
<a id='line_5575'>the castle together. Then the Lady of the Rock was passing glad, and</a>
<a id='line_5576'>the other brother made great sorrow for his brother’s death. Then the</a>
<a id='line_5577'>lady was restored of all her lands, and Sir Hue was commanded to be at</a>
<a id='line_5578'>the court of King Arthur at the next feast of Pentecost. So Sir Uwaine</a>
<a id='line_5579'>dwelt with the lady nigh half a year, for it was long or he might be</a>
<a id='line_5580'>whole of his great hurts. And so when it drew nigh the term-day that</a>
<a id='line_5581'>Sir Gawaine, Sir Marhaus, and Sir Uwaine should meet at the cross-way,</a>
<a id='line_5582'>then every knight drew him thither to hold his promise that they had</a>
<a id='line_5583'>made; and Sir Marhaus and Sir Uwaine brought their damosels with them,</a>
<a id='line_5584'>but Sir Gawaine had lost his damosel, as it is afore rehearsed.</a>
<a id='line_5585'></a>
<a id='line_5586'></a>
<a id='line_5587'></a>
<a id='line_5588'>CHAPTER XXVIII. How at the year’s end all three knights with their</a>
<a id='line_5589'>three damosels met at the fountain.</a>
<a id='line_5590'></a>
<a id='line_5591'>Right so at the twelvemonths’ end they met all three knights at the</a>
<a id='line_5592'>fountain and their damosels, but the damosel that Sir Gawaine had could</a>
<a id='line_5593'>say but little worship of him so they departed from the damosels and</a>
<a id='line_5594'>rode through a great forest, and there they met with a messenger that</a>
<a id='line_5595'>came from King Arthur, that had sought them well-nigh a twelvemonth</a>
<a id='line_5596'>throughout all England, Wales, and Scotland, and charged if ever he</a>
<a id='line_5597'>might find Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine to bring them to the court again.</a>
<a id='line_5598'>And then were they all glad, and so prayed they Sir Marhaus to ride</a>
<a id='line_5599'>with them to the king’s court. And so within twelve days they came to</a>
<a id='line_5600'>Camelot, and the king was passing glad of their coming, and so was all</a>
<a id='line_5601'>the court. Then the king made them to swear upon a book to tell him all</a>
<a id='line_5602'>their adventures that had befallen them that twelvemonth, and so they</a>
<a id='line_5603'>did. And there was Sir Marhaus well known, for there were knights that</a>
<a id='line_5604'>he had matched aforetime, and he was named one of the best knights</a>
<a id='line_5605'>living.</a>
<a id='line_5606'></a>
<a id='line_5607'>Against the feast of Pentecost came the Damosel of the Lake and brought</a>
<a id='line_5608'>with her Sir Pelleas; and at that high feast there was great jousting</a>
<a id='line_5609'>of knights, and of all knights that were at that jousts, Sir Pelleas</a>
<a id='line_5610'>had the prize, and Sir Marhaus was named the next; but Sir Pelleas was</a>
<a id='line_5611'>so strong there might but few knights sit him a buffet with a spear.</a>
<a id='line_5612'>And at that next feast Sir Pelleas and Sir Marhaus were made knights of</a>
<a id='line_5613'>the Table Round, for there were two sieges void, for two knights were</a>
<a id='line_5614'>slain that twelvemonth, and great joy had King Arthur of Sir Pelleas</a>
<a id='line_5615'>and of Sir Marhaus. But Pelleas loved never after Sir Gawaine, but as</a>
<a id='line_5616'>he spared him for the love of King Arthur; but ofttimes at jousts and</a>
<a id='line_5617'>tournaments Sir Pelleas quit Sir Gawaine, for so it rehearseth in the</a>
<a id='line_5618'>book of French. So Sir Tristram many days after fought with Sir Marhaus</a>
<a id='line_5619'>in an island, and there they did a great battle, but at the last Sir</a>
<a id='line_5620'>Tristram slew him, so Sir Tristram was wounded that unnethe he might</a>
<a id='line_5621'>recover, and lay at a nunnery half a year. And Sir Pelleas was a</a>
<a id='line_5622'>worshipful knight, and was one of the four that achieved the Sangreal,</a>
<a id='line_5623'>and the Damosel of the Lake made by her means that never he had ado</a>
<a id='line_5624'>with Sir Launcelot de Lake, for where Sir Launcelot was at any jousts</a>
<a id='line_5625'>or any tournament, she would not suffer him be there that day, but if</a>
<a id='line_5626'>it were on the side of Sir Launcelot.</a>

<a id='line_5637'>CHAPTER I. How twelve aged ambassadors of Rome came to King Arthur to</a>
<a id='line_5638'>demand truage for Britain.</a>
<a id='line_5639'></a>
<a id='line_5640'>When King Arthur had after long war rested, and held a royal feast and</a>
<a id='line_5641'>Table Round with his allies of kings, princes, and noble knights all of</a>
<a id='line_5642'>the Round Table, there came into his hall, he sitting in his throne</a>
<a id='line_5643'>royal, twelve ancient men, bearing each of them a branch of olive, in</a>
<a id='line_5644'>token that they came as ambassadors and messengers from the Emperor</a>
<a id='line_5645'>Lucius, which was called at that time, Dictator or Procuror of the</a>
<a id='line_5646'>Public Weal of Rome. Which said messengers, after their entering and</a>
<a id='line_5647'>coming into the presence of King Arthur, did to him their obeisance in</a>
<a id='line_5648'>making to him reverence, and said to him in this wise: The high and</a>
<a id='line_5649'>mighty Emperor Lucius sendeth to the King of Britain greeting,</a>
<a id='line_5650'>commanding thee to acknowledge him for thy lord, and to send him the</a>
<a id='line_5651'>truage due of this realm unto the Empire, which thy father and other</a>
<a id='line_5652'>to-fore thy precessors have paid as is of record, and thou as rebel not</a>
<a id='line_5653'>knowing him as thy sovereign, withholdest and retainest contrary to the</a>
<a id='line_5654'>statutes and decrees made by the noble and worthy Julius Cesar,</a>
<a id='line_5655'>conqueror of this realm, and first Emperor of Rome. And if thou refuse</a>
<a id='line_5656'>his demand and commandment know thou for certain that he shall make</a>
<a id='line_5657'>strong war against thee, thy realms and lands, and shall chastise thee</a>
<a id='line_5658'>and thy subjects, that it shall be ensample perpetual unto all kings</a>
<a id='line_5659'>and princes, for to deny their truage unto that noble empire which</a>
<a id='line_5660'>domineth upon the universal world. Then when they had showed the effect</a>
<a id='line_5661'>of their message, the king commanded them to withdraw them, and said he</a>
<a id='line_5662'>should take advice of council and give to them an answer. Then some of</a>
<a id='line_5663'>the young knights, hearing this their message, would have run on them</a>
<a id='line_5664'>to have slain them, saying that it was a rebuke to all the knights</a>
<a id='line_5665'>there being present to suffer them to say so to the king. And anon the</a>
<a id='line_5666'>king commanded that none of them, upon pain of death, to missay them</a>
<a id='line_5667'>nor do them any harm, and commanded a knight to bring them to their</a>
<a id='line_5668'>lodging, and see that they have all that is necessary and requisite for</a>
<a id='line_5669'>them, with the best cheer, and that no dainty be spared, for the Romans</a>
<a id='line_5670'>be great lords, and though their message please me not nor my court,</a>
<a id='line_5671'>yet I must remember mine honour.</a>
<a id='line_5672'></a>
<a id='line_5673'>After this the king let call all his lords and knights of the Round</a>
<a id='line_5674'>Table to counsel upon this matter, and desired them to say their</a>
<a id='line_5675'>advice. Then Sir Cador of Cornwall spake first and said, Sir, this</a>
<a id='line_5676'>message liketh me well, for we have many days rested us and have been</a>
<a id='line_5677'>idle, and now I hope ye shall make sharp war on the Romans, where I</a>
<a id='line_5678'>doubt not we shall get honour. I believe well, said Arthur, that this</a>
<a id='line_5679'>matter pleaseth thee well, but these answers may not be answered, for</a>
<a id='line_5680'>the demand grieveth me sore, for truly I will never pay truage to Rome,</a>
<a id='line_5681'>wherefore I pray you to counsel me. I have understood that Belinus and</a>
<a id='line_5682'>Brenius, kings of Britain, have had the empire in their hands many</a>
<a id='line_5683'>days, and also Constantine the son of Heleine, which is an open</a>
<a id='line_5684'>evidence that we owe no tribute to Rome but of right we that be</a>
<a id='line_5685'>descended of them have right to claim the title of the empire.</a>

<a id='line_5689'>CHAPTER II. How the kings and lords promised to King Arthur aid and</a>
<a id='line_5690'>help against the Romans.</a>
<a id='line_5691'></a>
<a id='line_5692'>Then answered King Anguish of Scotland, Sir, ye ought of right to be</a>
<a id='line_5693'>above all other kings, for unto you is none like nor pareil in</a>
<a id='line_5694'>Christendom, of knighthood nor of dignity, and I counsel you never to</a>
<a id='line_5695'>obey the Romans, for when they reigned on us they distressed our</a>
<a id='line_5696'>elders, and put this land to great extortions and tallies, wherefore I</a>
<a id='line_5697'>make here mine avow to avenge me on them; and for to strengthen your</a>
<a id='line_5698'>quarrel I shall furnish twenty thousand good men of war, and wage them</a>
<a id='line_5699'>on my costs, which shall await on you with myself when it shall please</a>
<a id='line_5700'>you. And the king of Little Britain granted him to the same thirty</a>
<a id='line_5701'>thousand; wherefore King Arthur thanked them. And then every man agreed</a>
<a id='line_5702'>to make war, and to aid after their power; that is to wit, the lord of</a>
<a id='line_5703'>West Wales promised to bring thirty thousand men, and Sir Uwaine, Sir</a>
<a id='line_5704'>Ider his son, with their cousins, promised to bring thirty thousand.</a>
<a id='line_5705'>Then Sir Launcelot with all other promised in likewise every man a</a>
<a id='line_5706'>great multitude.</a>
<a id='line_5707'></a>
<a id='line_5708'>And when King Arthur understood their courages and good wills he</a>
<a id='line_5709'>thanked them heartily, and after let call the ambassadors to hear their</a>
<a id='line_5710'>answer. And in presence of all his lords and knights he said to them in</a>
<a id='line_5711'>this wise: I will that ye return unto your lord and Procuror of the</a>
<a id='line_5712'>Common Weal for the Romans, and say ye to him, Of his demand and</a>
<a id='line_5713'>commandment I set nothing, and that I know of no truage nor tribute</a>
<a id='line_5714'>that I owe to him, nor to none earthly prince, Christian nor heathen;</a>
<a id='line_5715'>but I pretend to have and occupy the sovereignty of the empire, wherein</a>
<a id='line_5716'>I am entitled by the right of my predecessors, sometime kings of this</a>
<a id='line_5717'>land; and say to him that I am delibered and fully concluded, to go</a>
<a id='line_5718'>with mine army with strength and power unto Rome, by the grace of God,</a>
<a id='line_5719'>to take possession in the empire and subdue them that be rebel.</a>
<a id='line_5720'>Wherefore I command him and all them of Rome, that incontinent they</a>
<a id='line_5721'>make to me their homage, and to acknowledge me for their Emperor and</a>
<a id='line_5722'>Governor, upon pain that shall ensue. And then he commanded his</a>
<a id='line_5723'>treasurer to give to them great and large gifts, and to pay all their</a>
<a id='line_5724'>dispenses, and assigned Sir Cador to convey them out of the land. And</a>
<a id='line_5725'>so they took their leave and departed, and took their shipping at</a>
<a id='line_5726'>Sandwich, and passed forth by Flanders, Almaine, the mountains, and all</a>
<a id='line_5727'>Italy, until they came unto Lucius. And after the reverence made, they</a>
<a id='line_5728'>made relation of their answer, like as ye to-fore have heard.</a>
<a id='line_5729'></a>
<a id='line_5730'>When the Emperor Lucius had well understood their credence, he was sore</a>
<a id='line_5731'>moved as he had been all araged, and said, I had supposed that Arthur</a>
<a id='line_5732'>would have obeyed to my commandment, and have served you himself, as</a>
<a id='line_5733'>him well beseemed or any other king to do. O Sir, said one of the</a>
<a id='line_5734'>senators, let be such vain words, for we let you wit that I and my</a>
<a id='line_5735'>fellows were full sore afeard to behold his countenance; I fear me ye</a>
<a id='line_5736'>have made a rod for yourself, for he intendeth to be lord of this</a>
<a id='line_5737'>empire, which sore is to be doubted if he come, for he is all another</a>
<a id='line_5738'>man than ye ween, and holdeth the most noble court of the world, all</a>
<a id='line_5739'>other kings nor princes may not compare unto his noble maintenance. On</a>
<a id='line_5740'>New Year’s Day we saw him in his estate, which was the royalest that</a>
<a id='line_5741'>ever we saw, for he was served at his table with nine kings, and the</a>
<a id='line_5742'>noblest fellowship of other princes, lords, and knights that be in the</a>
<a id='line_5743'>world, and every knight approved and like a lord, and holdeth Table</a>
<a id='line_5744'>Round: and in his person the most manly man that liveth, and is like to</a>
<a id='line_5745'>conquer all the world, for unto his courage it is too little: wherefore</a>
<a id='line_5746'>I advise you to keep well your marches and straits in the mountains;</a>
<a id='line_5747'>for certainly he is a lord to be doubted. Well, said Lucius, before</a>
<a id='line_5748'>Easter I suppose to pass the mountains, and so forth into France, and</a>
<a id='line_5749'>there bereave him his lands with Genoese and other mighty warriors of</a>
<a id='line_5750'>Tuscany and Lombardy. And I shall send for them all that be subjects</a>
<a id='line_5751'>and allied to the empire of Rome to come to mine aid. And forthwith</a>
<a id='line_5752'>sent old wise knights unto these countries following: first to Ambage</a>
<a id='line_5753'>and Arrage, to Alexandria, to India, to Armenia, whereas the river of</a>
<a id='line_5754'>Euphrates runneth into Asia, to Africa, and Europe the Large, to</a>
<a id='line_5755'>Ertayne and Elamye, to Araby, Egypt, and to Damascus, to Damietta and</a>
<a id='line_5756'>Cayer, to Cappadocia, to Tarsus, Turkey, Pontus and Pamphylia, to Syria</a>
<a id='line_5757'>and Galatia. And all these were subject to Rome and many more, as</a>
<a id='line_5758'>Greece, Cyprus, Macedonia, Calabria, Cateland, Portugal, with many</a>
<a id='line_5759'>thousands of Spaniards. Thus all these kings, dukes, and admirals,</a>
<a id='line_5760'>assembled about Rome, with sixteen kings at once, with great multitude</a>
<a id='line_5761'>of people. When the emperor understood their coming he made ready his</a>
<a id='line_5762'>Romans and all the people between him and Flanders.</a>
<a id='line_5763'></a>
<a id='line_5764'>Also he had gotten with him fifty giants which had been engendered of</a>
<a id='line_5765'>fiends; and they were ordained to guard his person, and to break the</a>
<a id='line_5766'>front of the battle of King Arthur. And thus departed from Rome, and</a>
<a id='line_5767'>came down the mountains for to destroy the lands that Arthur had</a>
<a id='line_5768'>conquered, and came unto Cologne, and besieged a castle thereby, and</a>
<a id='line_5769'>won it soon, and stuffed it with two hundred Saracens or Infidels, and</a>
<a id='line_5770'>after destroyed many fair countries which Arthur had won of King</a>
<a id='line_5771'>Claudas. And thus Lucius came with all his host, which were disperplyd</a>
<a id='line_5772'>sixty mile in breadth, and commanded them to meet with him in Burgoyne,</a>
<a id='line_5773'>for he purposed to destroy the realm of Little Britain.</a>

<a id='line_5778'>ordained the realm should be governed in his absence.</a>
<a id='line_5779'></a>
<a id='line_5780'>Now leave we of Lucius the Emperor and speak we of King Arthur, that</a>
<a id='line_5781'>commanded all them of his retinue to be ready at the utas of Hilary for</a>
<a id='line_5782'>to hold a parliament at York. And at that parliament was concluded to</a>
<a id='line_5783'>arrest all the navy of the land, and to be ready within fifteen days at</a>
<a id='line_5784'>Sandwich, and there he showed to his army how he purposed to conquer</a>
<a id='line_5785'>the empire which he ought to have of right. And there he ordained two</a>
<a id='line_5786'>governors of this realm, that is to say, Sir Baudwin of Britain, for to</a>
<a id='line_5787'>counsel to the best, and Sir Constantine, son to Sir Cador of Cornwall,</a>
<a id='line_5788'>which after the death of Arthur was king of this realm. And in the</a>
<a id='line_5789'>presence of all his lords he resigned the rule of the realm and</a>
<a id='line_5790'>Guenever his queen to them, wherefore Sir Launcelot was wroth, for he</a>
<a id='line_5791'>left Sir Tristram with King Mark for the love of Beale Isould. Then the</a>
<a id='line_5792'>Queen Guenever made great sorrow for the departing of her lord and</a>
<a id='line_5793'>other, and swooned in such wise that the ladies bare her into her</a>
<a id='line_5794'>chamber. Thus the king with his great army departed, leaving the queen</a>
<a id='line_5795'>and realm in the governance of Sir Baudwin and Constantine. And when he</a>
<a id='line_5796'>was on his horse he said with an high voice, If I die in this journey I</a>
<a id='line_5797'>will that Sir Constantine be mine heir and king crowned of this realm</a>
<a id='line_5798'>as next of my blood. And after departed and entered into the sea at</a>
<a id='line_5799'>Sandwich with all his army, with a great multitude of ships, galleys,</a>
<a id='line_5800'>cogs, and dromounds, sailing on the sea.</a>

<a id='line_5803'></a>
<a id='line_5804'>CHAPTER IV. How King Arthur being shipped and lying in his cabin had a</a>
<a id='line_5805'>marvellous dream and of the exposition thereof.</a>
<a id='line_5806'></a>
<a id='line_5807'>And as the king lay in his cabin in the ship, he fell in a slumbering</a>
<a id='line_5808'>and dreamed a marvellous dream: him seemed that a dreadful dragon did</a>
<a id='line_5809'>drown much of his people, and he came flying out of the west, and his</a>
<a id='line_5810'>head was enamelled with azure, and his shoulders shone as gold, his</a>
<a id='line_5811'>belly like mails of a marvellous hue, his tail full of tatters, his</a>
<a id='line_5812'>feet full of fine sable, and his claws like fine gold; and an hideous</a>
<a id='line_5813'>flame of fire flew out of his mouth, like as the land and water had</a>
<a id='line_5814'>flamed all of fire. After, him seemed there came out of the orient, a</a>
<a id='line_5815'>grimly boar all black in a cloud, and his paws as big as a post; he was</a>
<a id='line_5816'>rugged looking roughly, he was the foulest beast that ever man saw, he</a>
<a id='line_5817'>roared and romed so hideously that it were marvel to hear. Then the</a>
<a id='line_5818'>dreadful dragon advanced him and came in the wind like a falcon giving</a>
<a id='line_5819'>great strokes on the boar, and the boar hit him again with his grizzly</a>
<a id='line_5820'>tusks that his breast was all bloody, and that the hot blood made all</a>
<a id='line_5821'>the sea red of his blood. Then the dragon flew away all on an height,</a>
<a id='line_5822'>and came down with such a swough, and smote the boar on the ridge,</a>
<a id='line_5823'>which was ten foot large from the head to the tail, and smote the boar</a>
<a id='line_5824'>all to powder both flesh and bones, that it flittered all abroad on the</a>
<a id='line_5825'>sea.</a>
<a id='line_5826'></a>
<a id='line_5827'>And therewith the king awoke anon, and was sore abashed of this dream,</a>
<a id='line_5828'>and sent anon for a wise philosopher, commanding to tell him the</a>
<a id='line_5829'>signification of his dream. Sir, said the philosopher, the dragon that</a>
<a id='line_5830'>thou dreamedst of betokeneth thine own person that sailest here, and</a>
<a id='line_5831'>the colours of his wings be thy realms that thou hast won, and his tail</a>
<a id='line_5832'>which is all to-tattered signifieth the noble knights of the Round</a>
<a id='line_5833'>Table; and the boar that the dragon slew coming from the clouds</a>
<a id='line_5834'>betokeneth some tyrant that tormenteth the people, or else thou art</a>
<a id='line_5835'>like to fight with some giant thyself, being horrible and abominable,</a>
<a id='line_5836'>whose peer ye saw never in your days, wherefore of this dreadful dream</a>
<a id='line_5837'>doubt thee nothing, but as a conqueror come forth thyself.</a>
<a id='line_5838'></a>
<a id='line_5839'>Then after this soon they had sight of land, and sailed till they</a>
<a id='line_5840'>arrived at Barflete in Flanders, and when they were there he found many</a>
<a id='line_5841'>of his great lords ready, as they had been commanded to wait upon him.</a>
<a id='line_5842'></a>
<a id='line_5843'></a>
<a id='line_5844'></a>
<a id='line_5845'>CHAPTER V. How a man of the country told to him of a marvellous giant,</a>
<a id='line_5846'>and how he fought and conquered him.</a>
<a id='line_5847'></a>
<a id='line_5848'>Then came to him an husbandman of the country, and told him how there</a>
<a id='line_5849'>was in the country of Constantine beside Brittany, a great giant which</a>
<a id='line_5850'>had slain, murdered and devoured much people of the country, and had</a>
<a id='line_5851'>been sustained seven year with the children of the commons of that</a>
<a id='line_5852'>land, insomuch that all the children be all slain and destroyed; and</a>
<a id='line_5853'>now late he hath taken the Duchess of Brittany as she rode with her</a>
<a id='line_5854'>meiny, and hath led her to his lodging which is in a mountain, for to</a>
<a id='line_5855'>ravish and lie by her to her life’s end, and many people followed her,</a>
<a id='line_5856'>more than five hundred, but all they might not rescue her, but they</a>
<a id='line_5857'>left her shrieking and crying lamentably, wherefore I suppose that he</a>
<a id='line_5858'>hath slain her in fulfilling his foul lust of lechery. She was wife</a>
<a id='line_5859'>unto thy cousin Sir Howell, whom we call full nigh of thy blood. Now,</a>
<a id='line_5860'>as thou art a rightful king, have pity on this lady, and revenge us all</a>
<a id='line_5861'>as thou art a noble conqueror. Alas, said King Arthur, this is a great</a>
<a id='line_5862'>mischief, I had liefer than the best realm that I have that I had been</a>
<a id='line_5863'>a furlong way to-fore him for to have rescued that lady. Now, fellow,</a>
<a id='line_5864'>said King Arthur, canst thou bring me thereas this giant haunteth? Yea,</a>
<a id='line_5865'>Sir, said the good man, look yonder whereas thou seest those two great</a>
<a id='line_5866'>fires, there shalt thou find him, and more treasure than I suppose is</a>
<a id='line_5867'>in all France. When the king had understood this piteous case, he</a>
<a id='line_5868'>returned into his tent.</a>
<a id='line_5869'></a>
<a id='line_5870'>Then he called to him Sir Kay and Sir Bedivere, and commanded them</a>
<a id='line_5871'>secretly to make ready horse and harness for himself and them twain;</a>
<a id='line_5872'>for after evensong he would ride on pilgrimage with them two only unto</a>
<a id='line_5873'>Saint Michael’s mount. And then anon he made him ready, and armed him</a>
<a id='line_5874'>at all points, and took his horse and his shield. And so they three</a>
<a id='line_5875'>departed thence and rode forth as fast as ever they might till that</a>
<a id='line_5876'>they came to the foreland of that mount. And there they alighted, and</a>
<a id='line_5877'>the king commanded them to tarry there, for he would himself go up into</a>
<a id='line_5878'>that mount. And so he ascended up into that hill till he came to a</a>
<a id='line_5879'>great fire, and there he found a careful widow wringing her hands and</a>
<a id='line_5880'>making great sorrow, sitting by a grave new made. And then King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_5881'>saluted her, and demanded of her wherefore she made such lamentation,</a>
<a id='line_5882'>to whom she answered and said, Sir knight, speak soft, for yonder is a</a>
<a id='line_5883'>devil, if he hear thee speak he will come and destroy thee; I hold thee</a>
<a id='line_5884'>unhappy; what dost thou here in this mountain? for if ye were such</a>
<a id='line_5885'>fifty as ye be, ye were not able to make resistance against this devil:</a>
<a id='line_5886'>here lieth a duchess dead, the which was the fairest of all the world,</a>
<a id='line_5887'>wife to Sir Howell, Duke of Brittany, he hath murdered her in forcing</a>
<a id='line_5888'>her, and hath slit her unto the navel.</a>
<a id='line_5889'></a>
<a id='line_5890'>Dame, said the king, I come from the noble conqueror King Arthur, for</a>
<a id='line_5891'>to treat with that tyrant for his liege people. Fie on such treaties,</a>
<a id='line_5892'>said she, he setteth not by the king nor by no man else; but an if thou</a>
<a id='line_5893'>have brought Arthur’s wife, dame Guenever, he shall be gladder than</a>
<a id='line_5894'>thou hadst given to him half France. Beware, approach him not too nigh,</a>
<a id='line_5895'>for he hath vanquished fifteen kings, and hath made him a coat full of</a>
<a id='line_5896'>precious stones embroidered with their beards, which they sent him to</a>
<a id='line_5897'>have his love for salvation of their people at this last Christmas. And</a>
<a id='line_5898'>if thou wilt, speak with him at yonder great fire at supper. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_5899'>Arthur, I will accomplish my message for all your fearful words; and</a>
<a id='line_5900'>went forth by the crest of that hill, and saw where he sat at supper</a>
<a id='line_5901'>gnawing on a limb of a man, baking his broad limbs by the fire, and</a>
<a id='line_5902'>breechless, and three fair damosels turning three broaches whereon were</a>
<a id='line_5903'>broached twelve young children late born, like young birds.</a>
<a id='line_5904'></a>
<a id='line_5905'>When King Arthur beheld that piteous sight he had great compassion on</a>
<a id='line_5906'>them, so that his heart bled for sorrow, and hailed him, saying in this</a>
<a id='line_5907'>wise: He that all the world wieldeth give thee short life and shameful</a>
<a id='line_5908'>death; and the devil have thy soul; why hast thou murdered these young</a>
<a id='line_5909'>innocent children, and murdered this duchess? Therefore, arise and</a>
<a id='line_5910'>dress thee, thou glutton, for this day shalt thou die of my hand. Then</a>
<a id='line_5911'>the glutton anon started up, and took a great club in his hand, and</a>
<a id='line_5912'>smote at the king that his coronal fell to the earth. And the king hit</a>
<a id='line_5913'>him again that he carved his belly and cut off his genitours, that his</a>
<a id='line_5914'>guts and his entrails fell down to the ground. Then the giant threw</a>
<a id='line_5915'>away his club, and caught the king in his arms that he crushed his</a>
<a id='line_5916'>ribs. Then the three maidens kneeled down and called to Christ for help</a>
<a id='line_5917'>and comfort of Arthur. And then Arthur weltered and wrung, that he was</a>
<a id='line_5918'>other while under and another time above. And so weltering and</a>
<a id='line_5919'>wallowing they rolled down the hill till they came to the sea mark, and</a>
<a id='line_5920'>ever as they so weltered Arthur smote him with his dagger.</a>
<a id='line_5921'></a>
<a id='line_5922'>And it fortuned they came to the place whereas the two knights were and</a>
<a id='line_5923'>kept Arthur’s horse; then when they saw the king fast in the giant’s</a>
<a id='line_5924'>arms they came and loosed him. And then the king commanded Sir Kay to</a>
<a id='line_5925'>smite off the giant’s head, and to set it upon a truncheon of a spear,</a>
<a id='line_5926'>and bear it to Sir Howell, and tell him that his enemy was slain; and</a>
<a id='line_5927'>after let this head be bound to a barbican that all the people may see</a>
<a id='line_5928'>and behold it; and go ye two up to the mountain, and fetch me my</a>
<a id='line_5929'>shield, my sword, and the club of iron; and as for the treasure, take</a>
<a id='line_5930'>ye it, for ye shall find there goods out of number; so I have the</a>
<a id='line_5931'>kirtle and the club I desire no more. This was the fiercest giant that</a>
<a id='line_5932'>ever I met with, save one in the mount of Araby, which I overcame, but</a>
<a id='line_5933'>this was greater and fiercer. Then the knights fetched the club and the</a>
<a id='line_5934'>kirtle, and some of the treasure they took to themselves, and returned</a>
<a id='line_5935'>again to the host. And anon this was known through all the country,</a>
<a id='line_5936'>wherefore the people came and thanked the king. And he said again, Give</a>
<a id='line_5937'>the thanks to God, and depart the goods among you.</a>
<a id='line_5938'></a>
<a id='line_5939'>And after that King Arthur said and commanded his cousin Howell, that</a>
<a id='line_5940'>he should ordain for a church to be builded on the same hill in the</a>
<a id='line_5941'>worship of Saint Michael. And on the morn the king removed with his</a>
<a id='line_5942'>great battle, and came into Champayne and in a valley, and there they</a>
<a id='line_5943'>pight their tents; and the king being set at his dinner, there came in</a>
<a id='line_5944'>two messengers, of whom that one was Marshal of France, and said to the</a>
<a id='line_5945'>king that the emperor was entered into France, and had destroyed a</a>
<a id='line_5946'>great part, and was in Burgoyne, and had destroyed and made great</a>
<a id='line_5947'>slaughter of people, and burnt towns and boroughs; wherefore, if thou</a>
<a id='line_5948'>come not hastily, they must yield up their bodies and goods.</a>
<a id='line_5949'></a>
<a id='line_5950'></a>
<a id='line_5951'></a>
<a id='line_5952'>CHAPTER VI. How King Arthur sent Sir Gawaine and other to Lucius, and</a>
<a id='line_5953'>how they were assailed and escaped with worship.</a>
<a id='line_5954'></a>
<a id='line_5955'>Then the king did do call Sir Gawaine, Sir Bors, Sir Lionel, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_5956'>Bedivere, and commanded them to go straight to Sir Lucius, and say ye</a>
<a id='line_5957'>to him that hastily he remove out of my land; and if he will not, bid</a>
<a id='line_5958'>him make him ready to battle and not distress the poor people. Then</a>
<a id='line_5959'>anon these noble knights dressed them to horseback, and when they came</a>
<a id='line_5960'>to the green wood, they saw many pavilions set in a meadow, of silk of</a>
<a id='line_5961'>divers colours, beside a river, and the emperor’s pavilion was in the</a>
<a id='line_5962'>middle with an eagle displayed above. To the which tent our knights</a>
<a id='line_5963'>rode toward, and ordained Sir Gawaine and Sir Bors to do the message,</a>
<a id='line_5964'>and left in a bushment Sir Lionel and Sir Bedivere. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_5965'>Gawaine and Sir Bors did their message, and commanded Lucius, in</a>
<a id='line_5966'>Arthur’s name to avoid his land, or shortly to address him to battle.</a>
<a id='line_5967'>To whom Lucius answered and said, Ye shall return to your lord, and say</a>
<a id='line_5968'>ye to him that I shall subdue him and all his lands. Then Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_5969'>was wroth and said, I had liefer than all France fight against thee;</a>
<a id='line_5970'>and so had I, said Sir Bors, liefer than all Brittany or Burgoyne.</a>
<a id='line_5971'></a>
<a id='line_5972'>Then a knight named Sir Gainus, nigh cousin to the emperor, said, Lo,</a>
<a id='line_5973'>how these Britons be full of pride and boast, and they brag as though</a>
<a id='line_5974'>they bare up all the world. Then Sir Gawaine was sore grieved with</a>
<a id='line_5975'>these words, and pulled out his sword and smote off his head. And</a>
<a id='line_5976'>therewith turned their horses and rode over waters and through woods</a>
<a id='line_5977'>till they came to their bushment, whereas Sir Lionel and Sir Bedivere</a>
<a id='line_5978'>were hoving. The Romans followed fast after, on horseback and on foot,</a>
<a id='line_5979'>over a champaign unto a wood; then Sir Bors turned his horse and saw a</a>
<a id='line_5980'>knight come fast on, whom he smote through the body with a spear that</a>
<a id='line_5981'>he fell dead down to the earth; then came Caliburn one of the strongest</a>
<a id='line_5982'>of Pavie, and smote down many of Arthur’s knights. And when Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_5983'>saw him do so much harm, he addressed toward him, and smote him through</a>
<a id='line_5984'>the breast, that he fell down dead to the earth. Then Sir Feldenak</a>
<a id='line_5985'>thought to revenge the death of Gainus upon Sir Gawaine, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_5986'>Gawaine was ware thereof, and smote him on the head, which stroke</a>
<a id='line_5987'>stinted not till it came to his breast. And then he returned and came</a>
<a id='line_5988'>to his fellows in the bushment. And there was a recounter, for the</a>
<a id='line_5989'>bushment brake on the Romans, and slew and hew down the Romans, and</a>
<a id='line_5990'>forced the Romans to flee and return, whom the noble knights chased</a>
<a id='line_5991'>unto their tents.</a>
<a id='line_5992'></a>
<a id='line_5993'>Then the Romans gathered more people, and also footmen came on, and</a>
<a id='line_5994'>there was a new battle, and so much people that Sir Bors and Sir Berel</a>
<a id='line_5995'>were taken. But when Sir Gawaine saw that, he took with him Sir Idrus</a>
<a id='line_5996'>the good knight, and said he would never see King Arthur but if he</a>
<a id='line_5997'>rescued them, and pulled out Galatine his good sword, and followed them</a>
<a id='line_5998'>that led those two knights away; and he smote him that led Sir Bors,</a>
<a id='line_5999'>and took Sir Bors from him and delivered him to his fellows. And Sir</a>
<a id='line_6000'>Idrus in likewise rescued Sir Berel. Then began the battle to be great,</a>
<a id='line_6001'>that our knights were in great jeopardy, wherefore Sir Gawaine sent to</a>
<a id='line_6002'>King Arthur for succour, and that he hie him, for I am sore wounded,</a>
<a id='line_6003'>and that our prisoners may pay goods out of number. And the messenger</a>
<a id='line_6004'>came to the king and told him his message. And anon the king did do</a>
<a id='line_6005'>assemble his army, but anon, or he departed the prisoners were come,</a>
<a id='line_6006'>and Sir Gawaine and his fellows gat the field and put the Romans to</a>
<a id='line_6007'>flight, and after returned and came with their fellowship in such wise</a>
<a id='line_6008'>that no man of worship was lost of them, save that Sir Gawaine was sore</a>
<a id='line_6009'>hurt. Then the king did do ransack his wounds and comforted him. And</a>
<a id='line_6010'>thus was the beginning of the first journey of the Britons and Romans,</a>
<a id='line_6011'>and there were slain of the Romans more than ten thousand, and great</a>
<a id='line_6012'>joy and mirth was made that night in the host of King Arthur. And on</a>
<a id='line_6013'>the morn he sent all the prisoners into Paris under the guard of Sir</a>
<a id='line_6014'>Launcelot, with many knights, and of Sir Cador.</a>
<a id='line_6015'></a>
<a id='line_6016'></a>
<a id='line_6017'></a>
<a id='line_6018'>CHAPTER VII. How Lucius sent certain spies in a bushment for to have</a>
<a id='line_6019'>taken his knights being prisoners, and how they were letted.</a>
<a id='line_6020'></a>
<a id='line_6021'>Now turn we to the Emperor of Rome, which espied that these prisoners</a>
<a id='line_6022'>should be sent to Paris, and anon he sent to lie in a bushment certain</a>
<a id='line_6023'>knights and princes with sixty thousand men, for to rescue his knights</a>
<a id='line_6024'>and lords that were prisoners. And so on the morn as Launcelot and Sir</a>
<a id='line_6025'>Cador, chieftains and governors of all them that conveyed the</a>
<a id='line_6026'>prisoners, as they should pass through a wood, Sir Launcelot sent</a>
<a id='line_6027'>certain knights to espy if any were in the woods to let them. And when</a>
<a id='line_6028'>the said knights came into the wood, anon they espied and saw the great</a>
<a id='line_6029'>embushment, and returned and told Sir Launcelot that there lay in await</a>
<a id='line_6030'>for them three score thousand Romans. And then Sir Launcelot with such</a>
<a id='line_6031'>knights as he had, and men of war to the number of ten thousand, put</a>
<a id='line_6032'>them in array, and met with them and fought with them manly, and slew</a>
<a id='line_6033'>and detrenched many of the Romans, and slew many knights and admirals</a>
<a id='line_6034'>of the party of the Romans and Saracens; there was slain the king of</a>
<a id='line_6035'>Lyly and three great lords, Aladuke, Herawd, and Heringdale. But Sir</a>
<a id='line_6036'>Launcelot fought so nobly that no man might endure a stroke of his</a>
<a id='line_6037'>hand, but where he came he showed his prowess and might, for he slew</a>
<a id='line_6038'>down right on every side; and the Romans and Saracens fled from him as</a>
<a id='line_6039'>the sheep from the wolf or from the lion, and put them, all that abode</a>
<a id='line_6040'>alive, to flight.</a>
<a id='line_6041'></a>
<a id='line_6042'>And so long they fought that tidings came to King Arthur, and anon he</a>
<a id='line_6043'>graithed him and came to the battle, and saw his knights how they had</a>
<a id='line_6044'>vanquished the battle, he embraced them knight by knight in his arms,</a>
<a id='line_6045'>and said, Ye be worthy to wield all your honour and worship; there was</a>
<a id='line_6046'>never king save myself that had so noble knights. Sir, said Cador,</a>
<a id='line_6047'>there was none of us failed other, but of the prowess and manhood of</a>
<a id='line_6048'>Sir Launcelot were more than wonder to tell, and also of his cousins</a>
<a id='line_6049'>which did that day many noble feats of war. And also Sir Cador told who</a>
<a id='line_6050'>of his knights were slain, as Sir Berel, and other Sir Moris and Sir</a>
<a id='line_6051'>Maurel, two good knights. Then the king wept, and dried his eyes with a</a>
<a id='line_6052'>kerchief, and said, Your courage had near-hand destroyed you, for</a>
<a id='line_6053'>though ye had returned again, ye had lost no worship; for I call it</a>
<a id='line_6054'>folly, knights to abide when they be overmatched. Nay, said Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_6055'>and the other, for once shamed may never be recovered.</a>

<a id='line_6057'></a>
<a id='line_6058'></a>
<a id='line_6059'>CHAPTER VIII. How a senator told to Lucius of their discomfiture, and</a>
<a id='line_6060'>also of the great battle between Arthur and Lucius.</a>
<a id='line_6061'></a>
<a id='line_6062'>Now leave we King Arthur and his noble knights which had won the field,</a>
<a id='line_6063'>and had brought their prisoners to Paris, and speak we of a senator</a>
<a id='line_6064'>which escaped from the battle, and came to Lucius the emperor, and said</a>
<a id='line_6065'>to him, Sir emperor, I advise thee for to withdraw thee; what dost thou</a>
<a id='line_6066'>here? thou shalt win nothing in these marches but great strokes out of</a>
<a id='line_6067'>all measure, for this day one of Arthur’s knights was worth in the</a>
<a id='line_6068'>battle an hundred of ours. Fie on thee, said Lucius, thou speakest</a>
<a id='line_6069'>cowardly; for thy words grieve me more than all the loss that I had</a>
<a id='line_6070'>this day. And anon he sent forth a king, which hight Sir Leomie, with a</a>
<a id='line_6071'>great army, and bade him hie him fast to-fore, and he would follow</a>
<a id='line_6072'>hastily after. King Arthur was warned privily, and sent his people to</a>
<a id='line_6073'>Sessoine, and took up the towns and castles from the Romans. Then the</a>
<a id='line_6074'>king commanded Sir Cador to take the rearward, and to take with him</a>
<a id='line_6075'>certain knights of the Round Table, and Sir Launcelot, Sir Bors, Sir</a>
<a id='line_6076'>Kay, Sir Marrok, with Sir Marhaus, shall await on our person. Thus the</a>
<a id='line_6077'>King Arthur disperpled his host in divers parties, to the end that his</a>
<a id='line_6078'>enemies should not escape.</a>
<a id='line_6079'></a>
<a id='line_6080'>When the emperor was entered into the vale of Sessoine, he might see</a>
<a id='line_6081'>where King Arthur was embattled and his banner displayed; and he was</a>
<a id='line_6082'>beset round about with his enemies, that needs he must fight or yield</a>
<a id='line_6083'>him, for he might not flee, but said openly unto the Romans, Sirs, I</a>
<a id='line_6084'>admonish you that this day ye fight and acquit you as men, and remember</a>
<a id='line_6085'>how Rome domineth and is chief and head over all the earth and</a>
<a id='line_6086'>universal world, and suffer not these Britons this day to abide against</a>
<a id='line_6087'>us; and therewith he did command his trumpets to blow the bloody</a>
<a id='line_6088'>sounds, in such wise that the ground trembled and dindled.</a>
<a id='line_6089'></a>
<a id='line_6090'>Then the battles approached and shoved and shouted on both sides, and</a>
<a id='line_6091'>great strokes were smitten on both sides, many men overthrown, hurt,</a>
<a id='line_6092'>and slain; and great valiances, prowesses and appertices of war were</a>
<a id='line_6093'>that day showed, which were over long to recount the noble feats of</a>
<a id='line_6094'>every man, for they should contain an whole volume. But in especial,</a>
<a id='line_6095'>King Arthur rode in the battle exhorting his knights to do well, and</a>
<a id='line_6096'>himself did as nobly with his hands as was possible a man to do; he</a>
<a id='line_6097'>drew out Excalibur his sword, and awaited ever whereas the Romans were</a>
<a id='line_6098'>thickest and most grieved his people, and anon he addressed him on that</a>
<a id='line_6099'>part, and hew and slew down right, and rescued his people; and he slew</a>
<a id='line_6100'>a great giant named Galapas, which was a man of an huge quantity and</a>
<a id='line_6101'>height, he shorted him and smote off both his legs by the knees,</a>
<a id='line_6102'>saying, Now art thou better of a size to deal with than thou were, and</a>
<a id='line_6103'>after smote off his head. There Sir Gawaine fought nobly and slew three</a>
<a id='line_6104'>admirals in that battle. And so did all the knights of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_6105'>Thus the battle between King Arthur and Lucius the Emperor endured</a>
<a id='line_6106'>long. Lucius had on his side many Saracens which were slain. And thus</a>
<a id='line_6107'>the battle was great, and oftsides that one party was at a fordeal and</a>
<a id='line_6108'>anon at an afterdeal, which endured so long till at the last King</a>
<a id='line_6109'>Arthur espied where Lucius the Emperor fought, and did wonder with his</a>
<a id='line_6110'>own hands. And anon he rode to him. And either smote other fiercely,</a>
<a id='line_6111'>and at last Lucius smote Arthur thwart the visage, and gave him a large</a>
<a id='line_6112'>wound. And when King Arthur felt himself hurt, anon he smote him again</a>
<a id='line_6113'>with Excalibur that it cleft his head, from the summit of his head, and</a>
<a id='line_6114'>stinted not till it came to his breast. And then the emperor fell down</a>
<a id='line_6115'>dead and there ended his life.</a>
<a id='line_6116'></a>
<a id='line_6117'>And when it was known that the emperor was slain, anon all the Romans</a>
<a id='line_6118'>with all their host put them to flight, and King Arthur with all his</a>
<a id='line_6119'>knights followed the chase, and slew down right all them that they</a>
<a id='line_6120'>might attain. And thus was the victory given to King Arthur, and the</a>
<a id='line_6121'>triumph; and there were slain on the part of Lucius more than an</a>
<a id='line_6122'>hundred thousand. And after King Arthur did do ransack the dead bodies,</a>
<a id='line_6123'>and did do bury them that were slain of his retinue, every man</a>
<a id='line_6124'>according to the estate and degree that he was of. And them that were</a>
<a id='line_6125'>hurt he let the surgeons do search their hurts and wounds, and</a>
<a id='line_6126'>commanded to spare no salves nor medicines till they were whole.</a>
<a id='line_6127'></a>
<a id='line_6128'>Then the king rode straight to the place where the Emperor Lucius lay</a>
<a id='line_6129'>dead, and with him he found slain the Soudan of Syria, the King of</a>
<a id='line_6130'>Egypt and of Ethiopia, which were two noble kings, with seventeen other</a>
<a id='line_6131'>kings of divers regions, and also sixty senators of Rome, all noble</a>
<a id='line_6132'>men, whom the king did do balm and gum with many good gums aromatic,</a>
<a id='line_6133'>and after did do cere them in sixty fold of cered cloth of sendal, and</a>
<a id='line_6134'>laid them in chests of lead, because they should not chafe nor savour,</a>
<a id='line_6135'>and upon all these bodies their shields with their arms and banners</a>
<a id='line_6136'>were set, to the end they should be known of what country they were.</a>
<a id='line_6137'>And after he found three senators which were alive, to whom he said,</a>
<a id='line_6138'>For to save your lives I will that ye take these dead bodies, and carry</a>
<a id='line_6139'>them with you unto great Rome, and present them to the Potestate on my</a>
<a id='line_6140'>behalf, shewing him my letters, and tell them that I in my person shall</a>
<a id='line_6141'>hastily be at Rome. And I suppose the Romans shall beware how they</a>
<a id='line_6142'>shall demand any tribute of me. And I command you to say when ye shall</a>
<a id='line_6143'>come to Rome, to the Potestate and all the Council and Senate, that I</a>
<a id='line_6144'>send to them these dead bodies for the tribute that they have demanded.</a>
<a id='line_6145'>And if they be not content with these, I shall pay more at my coming,</a>
<a id='line_6146'>for other tribute owe I none, nor none other will I pay. And methinketh</a>
<a id='line_6147'>this sufficeth for Britain, Ireland and all Almaine with Germany. And</a>
<a id='line_6148'>furthermore, I charge you to say to them, that I command them upon pain</a>
<a id='line_6149'>of their heads never to demand tribute nor tax of me nor of my lands.</a>
<a id='line_6150'>Then with this charge and commandment, the three senators aforesaid</a>
<a id='line_6151'>departed with all the said dead bodies, laying the body of Lucius in a</a>
<a id='line_6152'>car covered with the arms of the Empire all alone; and after alway two</a>
<a id='line_6153'>bodies of kings in a chariot, and then the bodies of the senators after</a>
<a id='line_6154'>them, and so went toward Rome, and showed their legation and message to</a>
<a id='line_6155'>the Potestate and Senate, recounting the battle done in France, and how</a>
<a id='line_6156'>the field was lost and much people and innumerable slain. Wherefore</a>
<a id='line_6157'>they advised them in no wise to move no more war against that noble</a>
<a id='line_6158'>conqueror Arthur, for his might and prowess is most to be doubted, seen</a>
<a id='line_6159'>the noble kings and great multitude of knights of the Round Table, to</a>
<a id='line_6160'>whom none earthly prince may compare.</a>

<a id='line_6163'></a>
<a id='line_6164'>CHAPTER IX. How Arthur, after he had achieved the battle against the</a>
<a id='line_6165'>Romans, entered into Almaine, and so into Italy.</a>
<a id='line_6166'></a>
<a id='line_6167'>Now turn we unto King Arthur and his noble knights, which, after the</a>
<a id='line_6168'>great battle achieved against the Romans, entered into Lorraine,</a>
<a id='line_6169'>Brabant and Flanders, and sithen returned into Haut Almaine, and so</a>
<a id='line_6170'>over the mountains into Lombardy, and after, into Tuscany wherein was a</a>
<a id='line_6171'>city which in no wise would yield themself nor obey, wherefore King</a>
<a id='line_6172'>Arthur besieged it, and lay long about it, and gave many assaults to</a>
<a id='line_6173'>the city; and they within defended them valiantly. Then, on a time, the</a>
<a id='line_6174'>king called Sir Florence, a knight, and said to him they lacked</a>
<a id='line_6175'>victual, And not far from hence be great forests and woods, wherein be</a>
<a id='line_6176'>many of mine enemies with much bestial: I will that thou make thee</a>
<a id='line_6177'>ready and go thither in foraying, and take with thee Sir Gawaine my</a>
<a id='line_6178'>nephew, Sir Wisshard, Sir Clegis, Sir Cleremond, and the Captain of</a>
<a id='line_6179'>Cardiff with other, and bring with you all the beasts that ye there can</a>
<a id='line_6180'>get.</a>
<a id='line_6181'></a>
<a id='line_6182'>And anon these knights made them ready, and rode over holts and hills,</a>
<a id='line_6183'>through forests and woods, till they came into a fair meadow full of</a>
<a id='line_6184'>fair flowers and grass; and there they rested them and their horses all</a>
<a id='line_6185'>that night. And in the springing of the day in the next morn, Sir</a>
<a id='line_6186'>Gawaine took his horse and stole away from his fellowship, to seek some</a>
<a id='line_6187'>adventures. And anon he was ware of a man armed, walking his horse</a>
<a id='line_6188'>easily by a wood’s side, and his shield laced to his shoulder, sitting</a>
<a id='line_6189'>on a strong courser, without any man saving a page bearing a mighty</a>
<a id='line_6190'>spear. The knight bare in his shield three griffins of gold, in sable</a>
<a id='line_6191'>carbuncle, the chief of silver. When Sir Gawaine espied this gay</a>
<a id='line_6192'>knight, he feutred his spear, and rode straight to him, and demanded of</a>
<a id='line_6193'>him from whence that he was. That other answered and said he was of</a>
<a id='line_6194'>Tuscany, and demanded of Sir Gawaine, What, profferest thou, proud</a>
<a id='line_6195'>knight, thee so boldly? here gettest thou no prey, thou mayest prove</a>
<a id='line_6196'>what thou wilt, for thou shalt be my prisoner or thou depart. Then said</a>
<a id='line_6197'>Gawaine, thou avauntest thee greatly and speakest proud words, I</a>
<a id='line_6198'>counsel thee for all thy boast that thou make thee ready, and take thy</a>
<a id='line_6199'>gear to thee, to-fore greater grame fall to thee.</a>

<a id='line_6203'>CHAPTER X. Of a battle done by Sir Gawaine against a Saracen, which</a>
<a id='line_6204'>after was yielden and became Christian.</a>
<a id='line_6205'></a>
<a id='line_6206'>Then they took their spears and ran each at other with all the might</a>
<a id='line_6207'>they had, and smote each other through their shields into their</a>
<a id='line_6208'>shoulders, wherefore anon they pulled out their swords, and smote great</a>
<a id='line_6209'>strokes that the fire sprang out of their helms. Then Sir Gawaine was</a>
<a id='line_6210'>all abashed, and with Galatine his good sword he smote through shield</a>
<a id='line_6211'>and thick hauberk made of thick mails, and all to-rushed and break the</a>
<a id='line_6212'>precious stones, and made him a large wound, that men might see both</a>
<a id='line_6213'>liver and lung. Then groaned that knight, and addressed him to Sir</a>
<a id='line_6214'>Gawaine, and with an awk stroke gave him a great wound and cut a vein,</a>
<a id='line_6215'>which grieved Gawaine sore, and he bled sore. Then the knight said to</a>
<a id='line_6216'>Sir Gawaine, bind thy wound or thy blee[ding] change, for thou</a>
<a id='line_6217'>be-bleedest all thy horse and thy fair arms, for all the barbers of</a>
<a id='line_6218'>Brittany shall not con staunch thy blood, for whosomever is hurt with</a>
<a id='line_6219'>this blade he shall never be staunched of bleeding. Then answered</a>
<a id='line_6220'>Gawaine, it grieveth me but little, thy great words shall not fear me</a>
<a id='line_6221'>nor lessen my courage, but thou shalt suffer teen and sorrow or we</a>
<a id='line_6222'>depart, but tell me in haste who may staunch my bleeding. That may I</a>
<a id='line_6223'>do, said the knight, if I will, and so will I if thou wilt succour and</a>
<a id='line_6224'>aid me, that I may be christened and believe on God, and thereof I</a>
<a id='line_6225'>require thee of thy manhood, and it shall be great merit for thy soul.</a>
<a id='line_6226'>I grant, said Gawaine, so God help me, to accomplish all thy desire,</a>
<a id='line_6227'>but first tell me what thou soughtest here thus alone, and of what land</a>
<a id='line_6228'>and liegiance thou art of. Sir, he said, my name is Priamus, and a</a>
<a id='line_6229'>great prince is my father, and he hath been rebel unto Rome and</a>
<a id='line_6230'>overridden many of their lands. My father is lineally descended of</a>
<a id='line_6231'>Alexander and of Hector by right line. And Duke Joshua and Maccabaeus</a>
<a id='line_6232'>were of our lineage. I am right inheritor of Alexandria and Africa, and</a>
<a id='line_6233'>all the out isles, yet will I believe on thy Lord that thou believest</a>
<a id='line_6234'>on; and for thy labour I shall give thee treasure enough. I was so</a>
<a id='line_6235'>elate and hauteyn in my heart that I thought no man my peer, nor to me</a>
<a id='line_6236'>semblable. I was sent into this war with seven score knights, and now I</a>
<a id='line_6237'>have encountered with thee, which hast given to me of fighting my fill,</a>
<a id='line_6238'>wherefore sir knight, I pray thee to tell me what thou art. I am no</a>
<a id='line_6239'>knight, said Gawaine, I have been brought up in the guardrobe with the</a>
<a id='line_6240'>noble King Arthur many years, for to take heed to his armour and his</a>
<a id='line_6241'>other array, and to point his paltocks that long to himself. At Yule</a>
<a id='line_6242'>last he made me yeoman, and gave to me horse and harness, and an</a>
<a id='line_6243'>hundred pound in money; and if fortune be my friend, I doubt not but to</a>
<a id='line_6244'>be well advanced and holpen by my liege lord. Ah, said Priamus, if his</a>
<a id='line_6245'>knaves be so keen and fierce, his knights be passing good: now for the</a>
<a id='line_6246'>King’s love of Heaven, whether thou be a knave or a knight, tell thou</a>
<a id='line_6247'>me thy name. By God, said Sir Gawaine, now I will say thee sooth, my</a>
<a id='line_6248'>name is Sir Gawaine, and known I am in his court and in his chamber,</a>
<a id='line_6249'>and one of the knights of the Round Table, he dubbed me a duke with his</a>
<a id='line_6250'>own hand. Therefore grudge not if this grace is to me fortuned, it is</a>
<a id='line_6251'>the goodness of God that lent to me my strength. Now am I better</a>
<a id='line_6252'>pleased, said Priamus, than thou hadst given to me all the Provence and</a>
<a id='line_6253'>Paris the rich. I had liefer to have been torn with wild horses, than</a>
<a id='line_6254'>any varlet had won such loos, or any page or priker should have had</a>
<a id='line_6255'>prize on me. But now sir knight I warn thee that hereby is a Duke of</a>
<a id='line_6256'>Lorraine with his army, and the noblest men of Dolphiny, and lords of</a>
<a id='line_6257'>Lombardy, with the garrison of Godard, and Saracens of Southland,</a>
<a id='line_6258'>y-numbered sixty thousand of good men of arms; wherefore but if we hie</a>
<a id='line_6259'>us hence, it will harm us both, for we be sore hurt, never like to</a>
<a id='line_6260'>recover; but take heed to my page, that he no horn blow, for if he do,</a>
<a id='line_6261'>there be hoving here fast by an hundred knights awaiting on my person,</a>
<a id='line_6262'>and if they take thee, there shall no ransom of gold nor silver acquit</a>
<a id='line_6263'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_6264'></a>
<a id='line_6265'>Then Sir Gawaine rode over a water for to save him, and the knight</a>
<a id='line_6266'>followed him, and so rode forth till they came to his fellows which</a>
<a id='line_6267'>were in the meadow, where they had been all the night. Anon as Sir</a>
<a id='line_6268'>Wisshard was ware of Sir Gawaine and saw that he was hurt, he ran to</a>
<a id='line_6269'>him sorrowfully weeping, and demanded of him who had so hurt him; and</a>
<a id='line_6270'>Gawaine told how he had foughten with that man, and each of them had</a>
<a id='line_6271'>hurt other, and how he had salves to heal them; but I can tell you</a>
<a id='line_6272'>other tidings, that soon we shall have ado with many enemies.</a>
<a id='line_6273'></a>
<a id='line_6274'>Then Sir Priamus and Sir Gawaine alighted, and let their horses graze</a>
<a id='line_6275'>in the meadow, and unarmed them, and then the blood ran freshly from</a>
<a id='line_6276'>their wounds. And Priamus took from his page a vial full of the four</a>
<a id='line_6277'>waters that came out of Paradise, and with certain balm anointed their</a>
<a id='line_6278'>wounds, and washed them with that water, and within an hour after they</a>
<a id='line_6279'>were both as whole as ever they were. And then with a trumpet were they</a>
<a id='line_6280'>all assembled to council, and there Priamus told unto them what lords</a>
<a id='line_6281'>and knights had sworn to rescue him, and that without fail they should</a>
<a id='line_6282'>be assailed with many thousands, wherefore he counselled them to</a>
<a id='line_6283'>withdraw them. Then Sir Gawaine said, it were great shame to them to</a>
<a id='line_6284'>avoid without any strokes; Wherefore I advise to take our arms and to</a>
<a id='line_6285'>make us ready to meet with these Saracens and misbelieving men, and</a>
<a id='line_6286'>with the help of God we shall overthrow them and have a fair day on</a>
<a id='line_6287'>them. And Sir Florence shall abide still in this field to keep the</a>
<a id='line_6288'>stale as a noble knight, and we shall not forsake yonder fellows. Now,</a>
<a id='line_6289'>said Priamus, cease your words, for I warn you ye shall find in yonder</a>
<a id='line_6290'>woods many perilous knights; they will put forth beasts to call you on,</a>
<a id='line_6291'>they be out of number, and ye are not past seven hundred, which be over</a>
<a id='line_6292'>few to fight with so many. Nevertheless, said Sir Gawaine, we shall</a>
<a id='line_6293'>once encounter them, and see what they can do, and the best shall have</a>
<a id='line_6294'>the victory.</a>
<a id='line_6295'></a>
<a id='line_6296'></a>
<a id='line_6297'></a>
<a id='line_6298'>CHAPTER XI. How the Saracens came out of a wood for to rescue their</a>
<a id='line_6299'>beasts, and of a great battle.</a>
<a id='line_6300'></a>
<a id='line_6301'>Then Sir Florence called to him Sir Floridas, with an hundred knights,</a>
<a id='line_6302'>and drove forth the herd of beasts. Then followed him seven hundred men</a>
<a id='line_6303'>of arms; and Sir Ferant of Spain on a fair steed came springing out of</a>
<a id='line_6304'>the woods, and came to Sir Florence and asked him why he fled. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_6305'>Florence took his spear and rode against him, and smote him in the</a>
<a id='line_6306'>forehead and brake his neck bone. Then all the other were moved, and</a>
<a id='line_6307'>thought to avenge the death of Sir Ferant, and smote in among them, and</a>
<a id='line_6308'>there was great fight, and many slain and laid down to ground, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_6309'>Florence with his hundred knights alway kept the stale, and fought</a>
<a id='line_6310'>manly.</a>
<a id='line_6311'></a>
<a id='line_6312'>Then when Priamus the good knight perceived the great fight, he went to</a>
<a id='line_6313'>Sir Gawaine, and bade him that he should go and succour his fellowship,</a>
<a id='line_6314'>which were sore bestead with their enemies. Sir, grieve you not, said</a>
<a id='line_6315'>Sir Gawaine, for their gree shall be theirs. I shall not once move my</a>
<a id='line_6316'>horse to them ward, but if I see more than there be; for they be strong</a>
<a id='line_6317'>enough to match them.</a>
<a id='line_6318'></a>
<a id='line_6319'>And with that he saw an earl called Sir Ethelwold and the duke of</a>
<a id='line_6320'>Dutchmen, came leaping out of a wood with many thousands, and Priamus’</a>
<a id='line_6321'>knights, and came straight unto the battle. Then Sir Gawaine comforted</a>
<a id='line_6322'>his knights, and bade them not to be abashed, for all shall be ours.</a>
<a id='line_6323'>Then they began to wallop and met with their enemies, there were men</a>
<a id='line_6324'>slain and overthrown on every side. Then thrust in among them the</a>
<a id='line_6325'>knights of the Table Round, and smote down to the earth all them that</a>
<a id='line_6326'>withstood them, in so much that they made them to recoil and flee. By</a>
<a id='line_6327'>God, said Sir Gawaine, this gladdeth my heart, for now be they less in</a>
<a id='line_6328'>number by twenty thousand. Then entered into the battle Jubance a</a>
<a id='line_6329'>giant, and fought and slew down right, and distressed many of our</a>
<a id='line_6330'>knights, among whom was slain Sir Gherard, a knight of Wales. Then our</a>
<a id='line_6331'>knights took heart to them, and slew many Saracens. And then came in</a>
<a id='line_6332'>Sir Priamus with his pennon, and rode with the knights of the Round</a>
<a id='line_6333'>Table, and fought so manfully that many of their enemies lost their</a>
<a id='line_6334'>lives. And there Sir Priamus slew the Marquis of Moises land, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_6335'>Gawaine with his fellows so quit them that they had the field, but in</a>
<a id='line_6336'>that stour was Sir Chestelaine, a child and ward of Sir Gawaine slain,</a>
<a id='line_6337'>wherefore was much sorrow made, and his death was soon avenged. Thus</a>
<a id='line_6338'>was the battle ended, and many lords of Lombardy and Saracens left dead</a>
<a id='line_6339'>in the field.</a>
<a id='line_6340'></a>
<a id='line_6341'>Then Sir Florence and Sir Gawaine harboured surely their people, and</a>
<a id='line_6342'>took great plenty of bestial, of gold and silver, and great treasure</a>
<a id='line_6343'>and riches, and returned unto King Arthur, which lay still at the</a>
<a id='line_6344'>siege. And when they came to the king they presented their prisoners</a>
<a id='line_6345'>and recounted their adventures, and how they had vanquished their</a>
<a id='line_6346'>enemies.</a>

<a id='line_6351'>prisoners, and how the King won a city, and how he was crowned Emperor.</a>
<a id='line_6352'></a>
<a id='line_6353'>Now thanked be God, said the noble King Arthur. But what manner man is</a>
<a id='line_6354'>he that standeth by himself, him seemeth no prisoner. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_6355'>Gawaine, this is a good man of arms, he hath matched me, but he is</a>
<a id='line_6356'>yielden unto God, and to me, for to become Christian; had not he have</a>
<a id='line_6357'>been we should never have returned, wherefore I pray you that he may be</a>
<a id='line_6358'>baptised, for there liveth not a nobler man nor better knight of his</a>
<a id='line_6359'>hands. Then the king let him anon be christened, and did do call him</a>
<a id='line_6360'>his first name Priamus, and made him a duke and knight of the Table</a>
<a id='line_6361'>Round. And then anon the king let do cry assault to the city, and there</a>
<a id='line_6362'>was rearing of ladders, breaking of walls, and the ditch filled, that</a>
<a id='line_6363'>men with little pain might enter into the city. Then came out a</a>
<a id='line_6364'>duchess, and Clarisin the countess, with many ladies and damosels, and</a>
<a id='line_6365'>kneeling before King Arthur, required him for the love of God to</a>
<a id='line_6366'>receive the city, and not to take it by assault, for then should many</a>
<a id='line_6367'>guiltless be slain. Then the king avaled his visor with a meek and</a>
<a id='line_6368'>noble countenance, and said, Madam, there shall none of my subjects</a>
<a id='line_6369'>misdo you nor your maidens, nor to none that to you belong, but the</a>
<a id='line_6370'>duke shall abide my judgment. Then anon the king commanded to leave the</a>
<a id='line_6371'>assault, and anon the duke’s oldest son brought out the keys, and</a>
<a id='line_6372'>kneeling delivered them to the king, and besought him of grace; and the</a>
<a id='line_6373'>king seized the town by assent of his lords, and took the duke and sent</a>
<a id='line_6374'>him to Dover, there for to abide prisoner term of his life, and</a>
<a id='line_6375'>assigned certain rents for the dower of the duchess and for her</a>
<a id='line_6376'>children.</a>
<a id='line_6377'></a>
<a id='line_6378'>Then he made lords to rule those lands, and laws as a lord ought to do</a>
<a id='line_6379'>in his own country; and after he took his journey toward Rome, and sent</a>
<a id='line_6380'>Sir Floris and Sir Floridas to-fore, with five hundred men of arms, and</a>
<a id='line_6381'>they came to the city of Urbino and laid there a bushment, thereas them</a>
<a id='line_6382'>seemed most best for them, and rode to-fore the town, where anon issued</a>
<a id='line_6383'>out much people and skirmished with the fore-riders. Then brake out the</a>
<a id='line_6384'>bushment and won the bridge, and after the town, and set upon the walls</a>
<a id='line_6385'>the king’s banner. Then came the king upon an hill, and saw the city</a>
<a id='line_6386'>and his banner on the walls, by which he knew that the city was won.</a>
<a id='line_6387'>And anon he sent and commanded that none of his liege men should defoul</a>
<a id='line_6388'>nor lie by no lady, wife nor maid; and when he came into the city, he</a>
<a id='line_6389'>passed to the castle, and comforted them that were in sorrow, and</a>
<a id='line_6390'>ordained there a captain, a knight of his own country.</a>
<a id='line_6391'></a>
<a id='line_6392'>And when they of Milan heard that thilk city was won, they sent to King</a>
<a id='line_6393'>Arthur great sums of money, and besought him as their lord to have pity</a>
<a id='line_6394'>on them, promising to be his subjects for ever, and yield to him homage</a>
<a id='line_6395'>and fealty for the lands of Pleasance and Pavia, Petersaint, and the</a>
<a id='line_6396'>Port of Tremble, and to give him yearly a million of gold all his</a>
<a id='line_6397'>lifetime. Then he rideth into Tuscany, and winneth towns and castles,</a>
<a id='line_6398'>and wasted all in his way that to him will not obey, and so to Spolute</a>
<a id='line_6399'>and Viterbe, and from thence he rode into the Vale of Vicecount among</a>
<a id='line_6400'>the vines. And from thence he sent to the senators, to wit whether they</a>
<a id='line_6401'>would know him for their lord. But soon after on a Saturday came unto</a>
<a id='line_6402'>King Arthur all the senators that were left alive, and the noblest</a>
<a id='line_6403'>cardinals that then dwelt in Rome, and prayed him of peace, and</a>
<a id='line_6404'>proferred him full large, and besought him as governor to give licence</a>
<a id='line_6405'>for six weeks for to assemble all the Romans, and then to crown him</a>
<a id='line_6406'>emperor with chrism as it belongeth to so high estate. I assent, said</a>
<a id='line_6407'>the king, like as ye have devised, and at Christmas there to be</a>
<a id='line_6408'>crowned, and to hold my Round Table with my knights as me liketh. And</a>
<a id='line_6409'>then the senators made ready for his enthronization. And at the day</a>
<a id='line_6410'>appointed, as the romance telleth, he came into Rome, and was crowned</a>
<a id='line_6411'>emperor by the pope’s hand, with all the royalty that could be made,</a>
<a id='line_6412'>and sojourned there a time, and established all his lands from Rome</a>
<a id='line_6413'>into France, and gave lands and realms unto his servants and knights,</a>
<a id='line_6414'>to everych after his desert, in such wise that none complained, rich</a>
<a id='line_6415'>nor poor. And he gave to Sir Priamus the duchy of Lorraine; and he</a>
<a id='line_6416'>thanked him, and said he would serve him the days of his life; and</a>
<a id='line_6417'>after made dukes and earls, and made every man rich.</a>
<a id='line_6418'></a>
<a id='line_6419'>Then after this all his knights and lords assembled them afore him, and</a>
<a id='line_6420'>said: Blessed be God, your war is finished and your conquest achieved,</a>
<a id='line_6421'>in so much that we know none so great nor mighty that dare make war</a>
<a id='line_6422'>against you: wherefore we beseech you to return homeward, and give us</a>
<a id='line_6423'>licence to go home to our wives, from whom we have been long, and to</a>
<a id='line_6424'>rest us, for your journey is finished with honour and worship. Then</a>
<a id='line_6425'>said the king, Ye say truth, and for to tempt God it is no wisdom, and</a>
<a id='line_6426'>therefore make you ready and return we into England. Then there was</a>
<a id='line_6427'>trussing of harness and baggage and great carriage. And after licence</a>
<a id='line_6428'>given, he returned and commanded that no man in pain of death should</a>
<a id='line_6429'>not rob nor take victual, nor other thing by the way but that he should</a>
<a id='line_6430'>pay therefore. And thus he came over the sea and landed at Sandwich,</a>
<a id='line_6431'>against whom Queen Guenever his wife came and met him, and he was nobly</a>
<a id='line_6432'>received of all his commons in every city and burgh, and great gifts</a>
<a id='line_6433'>presented to him at his home-coming to welcome him with.</a>
<a id='line_6434'></a>
<a id='line_6435'>Thus endeth the fifth book of the conquest that King Arthur had against</a>
<a id='line_6436'>Lucius the Emperor of Rome, and here followeth the sixth book, which is</a>
<a id='line_6437'>of Sir Launcelot du Lake.</a>
<a id='line_6438'></a>
<a id='line_6439'></a>
<a id='line_6440'></a>
<a id='line_6441'>BOOK VI.</a>
<a id='line_6442'></a>
<a id='line_6443'></a>
<a id='line_6444'></a>
<a id='line_6445'>CHAPTER I. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel departed from the court,</a>
<a id='line_6446'>and how Sir Lionel left him sleeping and was taken.</a>
<a id='line_6447'></a>
<a id='line_6448'>Soon after that King Arthur was come from Rome into England, then all</a>
<a id='line_6449'>the knights of the Table Round resorted unto the king, and made many</a>
<a id='line_6450'>jousts and tournaments, and some there were that were but knights,</a>
<a id='line_6451'>which increased so in arms and worship that they passed all their</a>
<a id='line_6452'>fellows in prowess and noble deeds, and that was well proved on many;</a>
<a id='line_6453'>but in especial it was proved on Sir Launcelot du Lake, for in all</a>
<a id='line_6454'>tournaments and jousts and deeds of arms, both for life and death, he</a>
<a id='line_6455'>passed all other knights, and at no time he was never overcome but if</a>
<a id='line_6456'>it were by treason or enchantment; so Sir Launcelot increased so</a>
<a id='line_6457'>marvellously in worship, and in honour, therefore is he the first</a>
<a id='line_6458'>knight that the French book maketh mention of after King Arthur came</a>
<a id='line_6459'>from Rome. Wherefore Queen Guenever had him in great favour above all</a>
<a id='line_6460'>other knights, and in certain he loved the queen again above all other</a>
<a id='line_6461'>ladies and damosels of his life, and for her he did many deeds of arms,</a>
<a id='line_6462'>and saved her from the fire through his noble chivalry.</a>
<a id='line_6463'></a>
<a id='line_6464'>Thus Sir Launcelot rested him long with play and game. And then he</a>
<a id='line_6465'>thought himself to prove himself in strange adventures, then he bade</a>
<a id='line_6466'>his nephew, Sir Lionel, for to make him ready; for we two will seek</a>
<a id='line_6467'>adventures. So they mounted on their horses, armed at all rights, and</a>
<a id='line_6468'>rode into a deep forest and so into a deep plain. And then the weather</a>
<a id='line_6469'>was hot about noon, and Sir Launcelot had great lust to sleep. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_6470'>Lionel espied a great apple-tree that stood by an hedge, and said,</a>
<a id='line_6471'>Brother, yonder is a fair shadow, there may we rest us [and] our</a>
<a id='line_6472'>horses. It is well said, fair brother, said Sir Launcelot, for this</a>
<a id='line_6473'>eight year I was not so sleepy as I am now; and so they there alighted</a>
<a id='line_6474'>and tied their horses unto sundry trees, and so Sir Launcelot laid him</a>
<a id='line_6475'>down under an appletree, and his helm he laid under his head. And Sir</a>
<a id='line_6476'>Lionel waked while he slept. So Sir Launcelot was asleep passing fast.</a>
<a id='line_6477'></a>
<a id='line_6478'>And in the meanwhile there came three knights riding, as fast fleeing</a>
<a id='line_6479'>as ever they might ride. And there followed them three but one knight.</a>
<a id='line_6480'>And when Sir Lionel saw him, him thought he saw never so great a</a>
<a id='line_6481'>knight, nor so well faring a man, neither so well apparelled unto all</a>
<a id='line_6482'>rights. So within a while this strong knight had overtaken one of these</a>
<a id='line_6483'>knights, and there he smote him to the cold earth that he lay still.</a>
<a id='line_6484'>And then he rode unto the second knight, and smote him so that man and</a>
<a id='line_6485'>horse fell down. And then straight to the third knight he rode, and</a>
<a id='line_6486'>smote him behind his horse’s arse a spear length. And then he alighted</a>
<a id='line_6487'>down and reined his horse on the bridle, and bound all the three</a>
<a id='line_6488'>knights fast with the reins of their own bridles. When Sir Lionel saw</a>
<a id='line_6489'>him do thus, he thought to assay him, and made him ready, and stilly</a>
<a id='line_6490'>and privily he took his horse, and thought not for to awake Sir</a>
<a id='line_6491'>Launcelot. And when he was mounted upon his horse, he overtook this</a>
<a id='line_6492'>strong knight, and bade him turn, and the other smote Sir Lionel so</a>
<a id='line_6493'>hard that horse and man he bare to the earth, and so he alighted down</a>
<a id='line_6494'>and bound him fast, and threw him overthwart his own horse, and so he</a>
<a id='line_6495'>served them all four, and rode with them away to his own castle. And</a>
<a id='line_6496'>when he came there he gart unarm them, and beat them with thorns all</a>
<a id='line_6497'>naked, and after put them in a deep prison where were many more</a>
<a id='line_6498'>knights, that made great dolour.</a>
<a id='line_6499'></a>
<a id='line_6500'></a>
<a id='line_6501'></a>
<a id='line_6502'>CHAPTER II. How Sir Ector followed for to seek Sir Launcelot, and how</a>
<a id='line_6503'>he was taken by Sir Turquine.</a>
<a id='line_6504'></a>
<a id='line_6505'>When Sir Ector de Maris wist that Sir Launcelot was passed out of the</a>
<a id='line_6506'>court to seek adventures, he was wroth with himself, and made him ready</a>
<a id='line_6507'>to seek Sir Launcelot, and as he had ridden long in a great forest he</a>
<a id='line_6508'>met with a man was like a forester. Fair fellow, said Sir Ector,</a>
<a id='line_6509'>knowest thou in this country any adventures that be here nigh hand?</a>
<a id='line_6510'>Sir, said the forester, this country know I well, and hereby, within</a>
<a id='line_6511'>this mile, is a strong manor, and well dyked, and by that manor, on the</a>
<a id='line_6512'>left hand, there is a fair ford for horses to drink of, and over that</a>
<a id='line_6513'>ford there groweth a fair tree, and thereon hang many fair shields that</a>
<a id='line_6514'>wielded sometime good knights, and at the hole of the tree hangeth a</a>
<a id='line_6515'>basin of copper and latten, and strike upon that basin with the butt of</a>
<a id='line_6516'>thy spear thrice, and soon after thou shalt hear new tidings, and else</a>
<a id='line_6517'>hast thou the fairest grace that many a year had ever knight that</a>
<a id='line_6518'>passed through this forest. Gramercy, said Sir Ector, and departed and</a>
<a id='line_6519'>came to the tree, and saw many fair shields. And among them he saw his</a>
<a id='line_6520'>brother’s shield, Sir Lionel, and many more that he knew that were his</a>
<a id='line_6521'>fellows of the Round Table, the which grieved his heart, and promised</a>
<a id='line_6522'>to revenge his brother.</a>
<a id='line_6523'></a>
<a id='line_6524'>Then anon Sir Ector beat on the basin as he were wood, and then he gave</a>
<a id='line_6525'>his horse drink at the ford, and there came a knight behind him and</a>
<a id='line_6526'>bade him come out of the water and make him ready; and Sir Ector anon</a>
<a id='line_6527'>turned him shortly, and in feuter cast his spear, and smote the other</a>
<a id='line_6528'>knight a great buffet that his horse turned twice about. This was well</a>
<a id='line_6529'>done, said the strong knight, and knightly thou hast stricken me; and</a>
<a id='line_6530'>therewith he rushed his horse on Sir Ector, and cleight him under his</a>
<a id='line_6531'>right arm, and bare him clean out of the saddle, and rode with him away</a>
<a id='line_6532'>into his own hall, and threw him down in midst of the floor. The name</a>
<a id='line_6533'>of this knight was Sir Turquine. Then he said unto Sir Ector, For thou</a>
<a id='line_6534'>hast done this day more unto me than any knight did these twelve years,</a>
<a id='line_6535'>now will I grant thee thy life, so thou wilt be sworn to be my prisoner</a>
<a id='line_6536'>all thy life days. Nay, said Sir Ector, that will I never promise thee,</a>
<a id='line_6537'>but that I will do mine advantage. That me repenteth, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_6538'>Turquine. And then he gart to unarm him, and beat him with thorns all</a>
<a id='line_6539'>naked, and sithen put him down in a deep dungeon, where he knew many of</a>
<a id='line_6540'>his fellows. But when Sir Ector saw Sir Lionel, then made he great</a>
<a id='line_6541'>sorrow. Alas, brother, said Sir Ector, where is my brother Sir</a>
<a id='line_6542'>Launcelot? Fair brother, I left him asleep when that I from him yode,</a>
<a id='line_6543'>under an apple-tree, and what is become of him I cannot tell you. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_6544'>said the knights, but Sir Launcelot help us we may never be delivered,</a>
<a id='line_6545'>for we know now no knight that is able to match our master Turquine.</a>
<a id='line_6546'></a>
<a id='line_6547'></a>
<a id='line_6548'></a>
<a id='line_6549'>CHAPTER III. How four queens found Launcelot sleeping, and how by</a>
<a id='line_6550'>enchantment he was taken and led into a castle.</a>
<a id='line_6551'></a>
<a id='line_6552'>Now leave we these knights prisoners, and speak we of Sir Launcelot du</a>
<a id='line_6553'>Lake that lieth under the apple-tree sleeping. Even about the noon</a>
<a id='line_6554'>there came by him four queens of great estate; and, for the heat should</a>
<a id='line_6555'>not annoy them, there rode four knights about them, and bare a cloth of</a>
<a id='line_6556'>green silk on four spears, betwixt them and the sun, and the queens</a>
<a id='line_6557'>rode on four white mules. Thus as they rode they heard by them a great</a>
<a id='line_6558'>horse grimly neigh, then were they ware of a sleeping knight, that lay</a>
<a id='line_6559'>all armed under an apple-tree; anon as these queens looked on his face,</a>
<a id='line_6560'>they knew it was Sir Launcelot. Then they began for to strive for that</a>
<a id='line_6561'>knight, everych one said they would have him to her love. We shall not</a>
<a id='line_6562'>strive, said Morgan le Fay, that was King Arthur’s sister, I shall put</a>
<a id='line_6563'>an enchantment upon him that he shall not awake in six hours, and then</a>
<a id='line_6564'>I will lead him away unto my castle, and when he is surely within my</a>
<a id='line_6565'>hold, I shall take the enchantment from him, and then let him choose</a>
<a id='line_6566'>which of us he will have unto paramour.</a>
<a id='line_6567'></a>
<a id='line_6568'>So this enchantment was cast upon Sir Launcelot, and then they laid him</a>
<a id='line_6569'>upon his shield, and bare him so on horseback betwixt two knights, and</a>
<a id='line_6570'>brought him unto the castle Chariot, and there they laid him in a</a>
<a id='line_6571'>chamber cold, and at night they sent unto him a fair damosel with his</a>
<a id='line_6572'>supper ready dight. By that the enchantment was past, and when she came</a>
<a id='line_6573'>she saluted him, and asked him what cheer. I cannot say, fair damosel,</a>
<a id='line_6574'>said Sir Launcelot, for I wot not how I came into this castle but it be</a>
<a id='line_6575'>by an enchantment. Sir, said she, ye must make good cheer, and if ye be</a>
<a id='line_6576'>such a knight as it is said ye be, I shall tell you more to-morn by</a>
<a id='line_6577'>prime of the day. Gramercy, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, of your</a>
<a id='line_6578'>good will I require you. And so she departed. And there he lay all that</a>
<a id='line_6579'>night without comfort of anybody. And on the morn early came these four</a>
<a id='line_6580'>queens, passingly well beseen, all they bidding him good morn, and he</a>
<a id='line_6581'>them again.</a>
<a id='line_6582'></a>
<a id='line_6583'>Sir knight, the four queens said, thou must understand thou art our</a>
<a id='line_6584'>prisoner, and we here know thee well that thou art Sir Launcelot du</a>
<a id='line_6585'>Lake, King Ban’s son, and because we understand your worthiness, that</a>
<a id='line_6586'>thou art the noblest knight living, and as we know well there can no</a>
<a id='line_6587'>lady have thy love but one, and that is Queen Guenever, and now thou</a>
<a id='line_6588'>shalt lose her for ever, and she thee, and therefore thee behoveth now</a>
<a id='line_6589'>to choose one of us four. I am the Queen Morgan le Fay, queen of the</a>
<a id='line_6590'>land of Gore, and here is the queen of Northgalis, and the queen of</a>
<a id='line_6591'>Eastland, and the queen of the Out Isles; now choose one of us which</a>
<a id='line_6592'>thou wilt have to thy paramour, for thou mayest not choose or else in</a>
<a id='line_6593'>this prison to die. This is an hard case, said Sir Launcelot, that</a>
<a id='line_6594'>either I must die or else choose one of you, yet had I liefer to die in</a>
<a id='line_6595'>this prison with worship, than to have one of you to my paramour maugre</a>
<a id='line_6596'>my head. And therefore ye be answered, I will none of you, for ye be</a>
<a id='line_6597'>false enchantresses, and as for my lady, Dame Guenever, were I at my</a>
<a id='line_6598'>liberty as I was, I would prove it on you or on yours, that she is the</a>
<a id='line_6599'>truest lady unto her lord living. Well, said the queens, is this your</a>
<a id='line_6600'>answer, that ye will refuse us. Yea, on my life, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_6601'>refused ye be of me. So they departed and left him there alone that</a>
<a id='line_6602'>made great sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_6603'></a>
<a id='line_6604'></a>
<a id='line_6605'></a>
<a id='line_6606'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Launcelot was delivered by the mean of a damosel.</a>
<a id='line_6607'></a>
<a id='line_6608'>Right so at the noon came the damosel unto him with his dinner, and</a>
<a id='line_6609'>asked him what cheer. Truly, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, in my</a>
<a id='line_6610'>life days never so ill. Sir, she said, that me repenteth, but an ye</a>
<a id='line_6611'>will be ruled by me, I shall help you out of this distress, and ye</a>
<a id='line_6612'>shall have no shame nor villainy, so that ye hold me a promise. Fair</a>
<a id='line_6613'>damosel, I will grant you, and sore I am of these queen-sorceresses</a>
<a id='line_6614'>afeard, for they have destroyed many a good knight. Sir, said she, that</a>
<a id='line_6615'>is sooth, and for the renown and bounty that they hear of you they</a>
<a id='line_6616'>would have your love, and Sir, they say, your name is Sir Launcelot du</a>
<a id='line_6617'>Lake, the flower of knights, and they be passing wroth with you that ye</a>
<a id='line_6618'>have refused them. But Sir, an ye would promise me to help my father on</a>
<a id='line_6619'>Tuesday next coming, that hath made a tournament betwixt him and the</a>
<a id='line_6620'>King of Northgalis—for the last Tuesday past my father lost the field</a>
<a id='line_6621'>through three knights of Arthur’s court—an ye will be there on Tuesday</a>
<a id='line_6622'>next coming, and help my father, to-morn or prime, by the grace of God,</a>
<a id='line_6623'>I shall deliver you clean. Fair maiden, said Sir Launcelot, tell me</a>
<a id='line_6624'>what is your father’s name, and then shall I give you an answer. Sir</a>
<a id='line_6625'>knight, she said, my father is King Bagdemagus, that was foul rebuked</a>
<a id='line_6626'>at the last tournament. I know your father well, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_6627'>for a noble king and a good knight, and by the faith of my body, ye</a>
<a id='line_6628'>shall have my body ready to do your father and you service at that day.</a>
<a id='line_6629'>Sir, she said, gramercy, and to-morn await ye be ready betimes and I</a>
<a id='line_6630'>shall be she that shall deliver you and take you your armour and your</a>
<a id='line_6631'>horse, shield and spear, and hereby within this ten mile, is an abbey</a>
<a id='line_6632'>of white monks, there I pray you that ye me abide, and thither shall I</a>
<a id='line_6633'>bring my father unto you. All this shall be done, said Sir Launcelot as</a>
<a id='line_6634'>I am true knight.</a>
<a id='line_6635'></a>
<a id='line_6636'>And so she departed, and came on the morn early, and found him ready;</a>
<a id='line_6637'>then she brought him out of twelve locks, and brought him unto his</a>
<a id='line_6638'>armour, and when he was clean armed, she brought him until his own</a>
<a id='line_6639'>horse, and lightly he saddled him and took a great spear in his hand</a>
<a id='line_6640'>and so rode forth, and said, Fair damosel, I shall not fail you, by the</a>
<a id='line_6641'>grace of God. And so he rode into a great forest all that day, and</a>
<a id='line_6642'>never could find no highway and so the night fell on him, and then was</a>
<a id='line_6643'>he ware in a slade, of a pavilion of red sendal. By my faith, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_6644'>Launcelot, in that pavilion will I lodge all this night, and so there</a>
<a id='line_6645'>he alighted down, and tied his horse to the pavilion, and there he</a>
<a id='line_6646'>unarmed him, and there he found a bed, and laid him therein and fell</a>
<a id='line_6647'>asleep sadly.</a>
<a id='line_6648'></a>
<a id='line_6649'></a>
<a id='line_6650'></a>
<a id='line_6651'>CHAPTER V. How a knight found Sir Launcelot lying in his leman’s bed,</a>
<a id='line_6652'>and how Sir Launcelot fought with the knight.</a>
<a id='line_6653'></a>
<a id='line_6654'>Then within an hour there came the knight to whom the pavilion ought,</a>
<a id='line_6655'>and he weened that his leman had lain in that bed, and so he laid him</a>
<a id='line_6656'>down beside Sir Launcelot, and took him in his arms and began to kiss</a>
<a id='line_6657'>him. And when Sir Launcelot felt a rough beard kissing him, he started</a>
<a id='line_6658'>out of the bed lightly, and the other knight after him, and either of</a>
<a id='line_6659'>them gat their swords in their hands, and out at the pavilion door went</a>
<a id='line_6660'>the knight of the pavilion, and Sir Launcelot followed him, and there</a>
<a id='line_6661'>by a little slake Sir Launcelot wounded him sore, nigh unto the death.</a>
<a id='line_6662'>And then he yielded him unto Sir Launcelot, and so he granted him, so</a>
<a id='line_6663'>that he would tell him why he came into the bed. Sir, said the knight,</a>
<a id='line_6664'>the pavilion is mine own, and there this night I had assigned my lady</a>
<a id='line_6665'>to have slept with me, and now I am likely to die of this wound. That</a>
<a id='line_6666'>me repenteth, said Launcelot, of your hurt, but I was adread of</a>
<a id='line_6667'>treason, for I was late beguiled, and therefore come on your way into</a>
<a id='line_6668'>your pavilion and take your rest, and as I suppose I shall staunch your</a>
<a id='line_6669'>blood. And so they went both into the pavilion, and anon Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_6670'>staunched his blood.</a>
<a id='line_6671'></a>
<a id='line_6672'>Therewithal came the knight’s lady, that was a passing fair lady, and</a>
<a id='line_6673'>when she espied that her lord Belleus was sore wounded, she cried out</a>
<a id='line_6674'>on Sir Launcelot, and made great dole out of measure. Peace, my lady</a>
<a id='line_6675'>and my love, said Belleus, for this knight is a good man, and a knight</a>
<a id='line_6676'>adventurous, and there he told her all the cause how he was wounded;</a>
<a id='line_6677'>And when that I yielded me unto him, he left me goodly and hath</a>
<a id='line_6678'>staunched my blood. Sir, said the lady, I require thee tell me what</a>
<a id='line_6679'>knight ye be, and what is your name? Fair lady, he said, my name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_6680'>Launcelot du Lake. So me thought ever by your speech, said the lady,</a>
<a id='line_6681'>for I have seen you oft or this, and I know you better than ye ween.</a>
<a id='line_6682'>But now an ye would promise me of your courtesy, for the harms that ye</a>
<a id='line_6683'>have done to me and my Lord Belleus, that when he cometh unto Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_6684'>court for to cause him to be made knight of the Round Table, for he is</a>
<a id='line_6685'>a passing good man of arms, and a mighty lord of lands of many out</a>
<a id='line_6686'>isles.</a>
<a id='line_6687'></a>
<a id='line_6688'>Fair lady, said Sir Launcelot, let him come unto the court the next</a>
<a id='line_6689'>high feast, and look that ye come with him, and I shall do my power, an</a>
<a id='line_6690'>ye prove you doughty of your hands, that ye shall have your desire. So</a>
<a id='line_6691'>thus within a while, as they thus talked, the night passed, and the day</a>
<a id='line_6692'>shone, and then Sir Launcelot armed him, and took his horse, and they</a>
<a id='line_6693'>taught him to the Abbey, and thither he rode within the space of two</a>
<a id='line_6694'>hours.</a>

<a id='line_6699'>daughter, and how he made his complaint to her father.</a>
<a id='line_6700'></a>
<a id='line_6701'>And soon as Sir Launcelot came within the abbey yard, the daughter of</a>
<a id='line_6702'>King Bagdemagus heard a great horse go on the pavement. And she then</a>
<a id='line_6703'>arose and yede unto a window, and there she saw Sir Launcelot, and anon</a>
<a id='line_6704'>she made men fast to take his horse from him and let lead him into a</a>
<a id='line_6705'>stable, and himself was led into a fair chamber, and unarmed him, and</a>
<a id='line_6706'>the lady sent him a long gown, and anon she came herself. And then she</a>
<a id='line_6707'>made Launcelot passing good cheer, and she said he was the knight in</a>
<a id='line_6708'>the world was most welcome to her. Then in all haste she sent for her</a>
<a id='line_6709'>father Bagdemagus that was within twelve mile of that Abbey, and afore</a>
<a id='line_6710'>even he came, with a fair fellowship of knights with him. And when the</a>
<a id='line_6711'>king was alighted off his horse he yode straight unto Sir Launcelot’s</a>
<a id='line_6712'>chamber and there he found his daughter, and then the king embraced Sir</a>
<a id='line_6713'>Launcelot in his arms, and either made other good cheer.</a>
<a id='line_6714'></a>
<a id='line_6715'>Anon Sir Launcelot made his complaint unto the king how he was</a>
<a id='line_6716'>betrayed, and how his brother Sir Lionel was departed from him he wist</a>
<a id='line_6717'>not where, and how his daughter had delivered him out of prison;</a>
<a id='line_6718'>Therefore while I live I shall do her service and all her kindred. Then</a>
<a id='line_6719'>am I sure of your help, said the king, on Tuesday next coming. Yea,</a>
<a id='line_6720'>sir, said Sir Launcelot, I shall not fail you, for so I have promised</a>
<a id='line_6721'>my lady your daughter. But, sir, what knights be they of my lord</a>
<a id='line_6722'>Arthur’s that were with the King of Northgalis? And the king said it</a>
<a id='line_6723'>was Sir Mador de la Porte, and Sir Mordred and Sir Gahalantine that all</a>
<a id='line_6724'>for-fared my knights, for against them three I nor my knights might</a>
<a id='line_6725'>bear no strength. Sir, said Sir Launcelot, as I hear say that the</a>
<a id='line_6726'>tournament shall be here within this three mile of this abbey, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_6727'>send unto me three knights of yours, such as ye trust, and look that</a>
<a id='line_6728'>the three knights have all white shields, and I also, and no painture</a>
<a id='line_6729'>on the shields, and we four will come out of a little wood in midst of</a>
<a id='line_6730'>both parties, and we shall fall in the front of our enemies and grieve</a>
<a id='line_6731'>them that we may; and thus shall I not be known what knight I am.</a>
<a id='line_6732'></a>
<a id='line_6733'>So they took their rest that night, and this was on the Sunday, and so</a>
<a id='line_6734'>the king departed, and sent unto Sir Launcelot three knights with the</a>
<a id='line_6735'>four white shields. And on the Tuesday they lodged them in a little</a>
<a id='line_6736'>leaved wood beside there the tournament should be. And there were</a>
<a id='line_6737'>scaffolds and holes that lords and ladies might behold and to give the</a>
<a id='line_6738'>prize. Then came into the field the King of Northgalis with eight score</a>
<a id='line_6739'>helms. And then the three knights of Arthur’s stood by themselves. Then</a>
<a id='line_6740'>came into the field King Bagdemagus with four score of helms. And then</a>
<a id='line_6741'>they feutred their spears, and came together with a great dash, and</a>
<a id='line_6742'>there were slain of knights at the first recounter twelve of King</a>
<a id='line_6743'>Bagdemagus’ party, and six of the King of Northgalis’ party, and King</a>
<a id='line_6744'>Bagdemagus’ party was far set aback.</a>

<a id='line_6748'>CHAPTER VII. How Sir Launcelot behaved him in a tournament, and how he</a>
<a id='line_6749'>met with Sir Turquine leading Sir Gaheris.</a>
<a id='line_6750'></a>
<a id='line_6751'>With that came Sir Launcelot du Lake, and he thrust in with his spear</a>
<a id='line_6752'>in the thickest of the press, and there he smote down with one spear</a>
<a id='line_6753'>five knights, and of four of them he brake their backs. And in that</a>
<a id='line_6754'>throng he smote down the King of Northgalis, and brake his thigh in</a>
<a id='line_6755'>that fall. All this doing of Sir Launcelot saw the three knights of</a>
<a id='line_6756'>Arthur’s. Yonder is a shrewd guest, said Sir Mador de la Porte,</a>
<a id='line_6757'>therefore have here once at him. So they encountered, and Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_6758'>bare him down horse and man, so that his shoulder went out of lith. Now</a>
<a id='line_6759'>befalleth it to me to joust, said Mordred, for Sir Mador hath a sore</a>
<a id='line_6760'>fall. Sir Launcelot was ware of him, and gat a great spear in his hand,</a>
<a id='line_6761'>and met him, and Sir Mordred brake a spear upon him, and Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_6762'>gave him such a buffet that the arson of his saddle brake, and so he</a>
<a id='line_6763'>flew over his horse’s tail, that his helm butted into the earth a foot</a>
<a id='line_6764'>and more, that nigh his neck was broken, and there he lay long in a</a>
<a id='line_6765'>swoon.</a>
<a id='line_6766'></a>
<a id='line_6767'>Then came in Sir Gahalantine with a great spear and Launcelot against</a>
<a id='line_6768'>him, with all their strength that they might drive, that both their</a>
<a id='line_6769'>spears to-brast even to their hands, and then they flang out with their</a>
<a id='line_6770'>swords and gave many a grim stroke. Then was Sir Launcelot wroth out of</a>
<a id='line_6771'>measure, and then he smote Sir Gahalantine on the helm that his nose</a>
<a id='line_6772'>brast out on blood, and ears and mouth both, and therewith his head</a>
<a id='line_6773'>hung low. And therewith his horse ran away with him, and he fell down</a>
<a id='line_6774'>to the earth. Anon therewithal Sir Launcelot gat a great spear in his</a>
<a id='line_6775'>hand, and or ever that great spear brake, he bare down to the earth</a>
<a id='line_6776'>sixteen knights, some horse and man, and some the man and not the</a>
<a id='line_6777'>horse, and there was none but that he hit surely, he bare none arms</a>
<a id='line_6778'>that day. And then he gat another great spear, and smote down twelve</a>
<a id='line_6779'>knights, and the most part of them never throve after. And then the</a>
<a id='line_6780'>knights of the King of Northgalis would joust no more. And there the</a>
<a id='line_6781'>gree was given to King Bagdemagus.</a>
<a id='line_6782'></a>
<a id='line_6783'>So either party departed unto his own place, and Sir Launcelot rode</a>
<a id='line_6784'>forth with King Bagdemagus unto his castle, and there he had passing</a>
<a id='line_6785'>good cheer both with the king and with his daughter, and they proffered</a>
<a id='line_6786'>him great gifts. And on the morn he took his leave, and told the king</a>
<a id='line_6787'>that he would go and seek his brother Sir Lionel, that went from him</a>
<a id='line_6788'>when that he slept, so he took his horse, and betaught them all to God.</a>
<a id='line_6789'>And there he said unto the king’s daughter, If ye have need any time of</a>
<a id='line_6790'>my service I pray you let me have knowledge, and I shall not fail you</a>
<a id='line_6791'>as I am true knight. And so Sir Launcelot departed, and by adventure he</a>
<a id='line_6792'>came into the same forest there he was taken sleeping. And in the midst</a>
<a id='line_6793'>of a highway he met a damosel riding on a white palfrey, and there</a>
<a id='line_6794'>either saluted other. Fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, know ye in this</a>
<a id='line_6795'>country any adventures? Sir knight, said that damosel, here are</a>
<a id='line_6796'>adventures near hand, an thou durst prove them. Why should I not prove</a>
<a id='line_6797'>adventures? said Sir Launcelot for that cause come I hither. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_6798'>she, thou seemest well to be a good knight, and if thou dare meet with</a>
<a id='line_6799'>a good knight, I shall bring thee where is the best knight, and the</a>
<a id='line_6800'>mightiest that ever thou found, so thou wilt tell me what is thy name,</a>
<a id='line_6801'>and what knight thou art. Damosel, as for to tell thee my name I take</a>
<a id='line_6802'>no great force; truly my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. Sir, thou</a>
<a id='line_6803'>beseemest well, here be adventures by that fall for thee, for hereby</a>
<a id='line_6804'>dwelleth a knight that will not be overmatched for no man I know but ye</a>
<a id='line_6805'>overmatch him, and his name is Sir Turquine. And, as I understand, he</a>
<a id='line_6806'>hath in his prison, of Arthur’s court, good knights three score and</a>
<a id='line_6807'>four, that he hath won with his own hands. But when ye have done that</a>
<a id='line_6808'>journey ye shall promise me as ye are a true knight for to go with me,</a>
<a id='line_6809'>and to help me and other damosels that are distressed daily with a</a>
<a id='line_6810'>false knight. All your intent, damosel, and desire I will fulfil, so ye</a>
<a id='line_6811'>will bring me unto this knight. Now, fair knight, come on your way; and</a>
<a id='line_6812'>so she brought him unto the ford and the tree where hung the basin.</a>
<a id='line_6813'></a>
<a id='line_6814'>So Sir Launcelot let his horse drink, and then he beat on the basin</a>
<a id='line_6815'>with the butt of his spear so hard with all his might till the bottom</a>
<a id='line_6816'>fell out, and long he did so, but he saw nothing. Then he rode endlong</a>
<a id='line_6817'>the gates of that manor nigh half-an-hour. And then was he ware of a</a>
<a id='line_6818'>great knight that drove an horse afore him, and overthwart the horse</a>
<a id='line_6819'>there lay an armed knight bound. And ever as they came near and near,</a>
<a id='line_6820'>Sir Launcelot thought he should know him. Then Sir Launcelot was ware</a>
<a id='line_6821'>that it was Sir Gaheris, Gawaine’s brother, a knight of the Table</a>
<a id='line_6822'>Round. Now, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, I see yonder cometh a</a>
<a id='line_6823'>knight fast bounden that is a fellow of mine, and brother he is unto</a>
<a id='line_6824'>Sir Gawaine. And at the first beginning I promise you, by the leave of</a>
<a id='line_6825'>God, to rescue that knight; but if his master sit better in the saddle</a>
<a id='line_6826'>I shall deliver all the prisoners that he hath out of danger, for I am</a>
<a id='line_6827'>sure he hath two brethren of mine prisoners with him. By that time that</a>
<a id='line_6828'>either had seen other, they gripped their spears unto them. Now, fair</a>
<a id='line_6829'>knight, said Sir Launcelot, put that wounded knight off the horse, and</a>
<a id='line_6830'>let him rest awhile, and let us two prove our strengths; for as it is</a>
<a id='line_6831'>informed me, thou doest and hast done great despite and shame unto</a>
<a id='line_6832'>knights of the Round Table, and therefore now defend thee. An thou be</a>
<a id='line_6833'>of the Table Round, said Turquine, I defy thee and all thy fellowship.</a>
<a id='line_6834'>That is overmuch said, said Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_6835'></a>
<a id='line_6836'></a>
<a id='line_6837'></a>
<a id='line_6838'>CHAPTER VIII. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Turquine fought together.</a>
<a id='line_6839'></a>
<a id='line_6840'>And then they put their spears in the rests, and came together with</a>
<a id='line_6841'>their horses as fast as they might run, and either smote other in midst</a>
<a id='line_6842'>of their shields, that both their horses’ backs brast under them, and</a>
<a id='line_6843'>the knights were both stonied. And as soon as they might avoid their</a>
<a id='line_6844'>horses, they took their shields afore them, and drew out their swords,</a>
<a id='line_6845'>and came together eagerly, and either gave other many strong strokes,</a>
<a id='line_6846'>for there might neither shields nor harness hold their strokes. And so</a>
<a id='line_6847'>within a while they had both grimly wounds, and bled passing</a>
<a id='line_6848'>grievously. Thus they fared two hours or more trasing and rasing either</a>
<a id='line_6849'>other, where they might hit any bare place.</a>
<a id='line_6850'></a>
<a id='line_6851'>Then at the last they were breathless both, and stood leaning on their</a>
<a id='line_6852'>swords. Now fellow, said Sir Turquine, hold thy hand a while, and tell</a>
<a id='line_6853'>me what I shall ask thee. Say on. Then Turquine said, Thou art the</a>
<a id='line_6854'>biggest man that ever I met withal, and the best breathed, and like one</a>
<a id='line_6855'>knight that I hate above all other knights; so be it that thou be not</a>
<a id='line_6856'>he I will lightly accord with thee, and for thy love I will deliver all</a>
<a id='line_6857'>the prisoners that I have, that is three score and four, so thou wilt</a>
<a id='line_6858'>tell me thy name. And thou and I we will be fellows together, and never</a>
<a id='line_6859'>to fail thee while that I live. It is well said, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_6860'>but sithen it is so that I may have thy friendship, what knight is he</a>
<a id='line_6861'>that thou so hatest above all other? Faithfully, said Sir Turquine, his</a>
<a id='line_6862'>name is Sir Launcelot du Lake, for he slew my brother, Sir Carados, at</a>
<a id='line_6863'>the dolorous tower, that was one of the best knights alive; and</a>
<a id='line_6864'>therefore him I except of all knights, for may I once meet with him,</a>
<a id='line_6865'>the one of us shall make an end of other, I make mine avow. And for Sir</a>
<a id='line_6866'>Launcelot’s sake I have slain an hundred good knights, and as many I</a>
<a id='line_6867'>have maimed all utterly that they might never after help themselves,</a>
<a id='line_6868'>and many have died in prison, and yet have I three score and four, and</a>
<a id='line_6869'>all shall be delivered so thou wilt tell me thy name, so be it that</a>
<a id='line_6870'>thou be not Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_6871'></a>
<a id='line_6872'>Now, see I well, said Sir Launcelot, that such a man I might be, I</a>
<a id='line_6873'>might have peace, and such a man I might be, that there should be war</a>
<a id='line_6874'>mortal betwixt us. And now, sir knight, at thy request I will that thou</a>
<a id='line_6875'>wit and know that I am Launcelot du Lake, King Ban’s son of Benwick,</a>
<a id='line_6876'>and very knight of the Table Round. And now I defy thee, and do thy</a>
<a id='line_6877'>best. Ah, said Turquine, Launcelot, thou art unto me most welcome that</a>
<a id='line_6878'>ever was knight, for we shall never depart till the one of us be dead.</a>
<a id='line_6879'>Then they hurtled together as two wild bulls rushing and lashing with</a>
<a id='line_6880'>their shields and swords, that sometime they fell both over their</a>
<a id='line_6881'>noses. Thus they fought still two hours and more, and never would have</a>
<a id='line_6882'>rest, and Sir Turquine gave Sir Launcelot many wounds that all the</a>
<a id='line_6883'>ground thereas they fought was all bespeckled with blood.</a>

<a id='line_6887'>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Turquine was slain, and how Sir Launcelot bade Sir</a>
<a id='line_6888'>Gaheris deliver all the prisoners.</a>
<a id='line_6889'></a>
<a id='line_6890'>Then at the last Sir Turquine waxed faint, and gave somewhat aback, and</a>
<a id='line_6891'>bare his shield low for weariness. That espied Sir Launcelot, and leapt</a>
<a id='line_6892'>upon him fiercely and gat him by the beaver of his helmet, and plucked</a>
<a id='line_6893'>him down on his knees, and anon he raced off his helm, and smote his</a>
<a id='line_6894'>neck in sunder. And when Sir Launcelot had done this, he yode unto the</a>
<a id='line_6895'>damosel and said, Damosel, I am ready to go with you where ye will have</a>
<a id='line_6896'>me, but I have no horse. Fair sir, said she, take this wounded knight’s</a>
<a id='line_6897'>horse and send him into this manor, and command him to deliver all the</a>
<a id='line_6898'>prisoners. So Sir Launcelot went unto Gaheris, and prayed him not to be</a>
<a id='line_6899'>aggrieved for to lend him his horse. Nay, fair lord, said Gaheris, I</a>
<a id='line_6900'>will that ye take my horse at your own commandment, for ye have both</a>
<a id='line_6901'>saved me and my horse, and this day I say ye are the best knight in the</a>
<a id='line_6902'>world, for ye have slain this day in my sight the mightiest man and the</a>
<a id='line_6903'>best knight except you that ever I saw, and, fair sir, said Gaheris, I</a>
<a id='line_6904'>pray you tell me your name. Sir, my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake, that</a>
<a id='line_6905'>ought to help you of right for King Arthur’s sake, and in especial for</a>
<a id='line_6906'>my lord Sir Gawaine’s sake, your own dear brother; and when that ye</a>
<a id='line_6907'>come within yonder manor, I am sure ye shall find there many knights of</a>
<a id='line_6908'>the Round Table, for I have seen many of their shields that I know on</a>
<a id='line_6909'>yonder tree. There is Kay’s shield, and Sir Brandel’s shield, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_6910'>Marhaus’ shield, and Sir Galind’s shield, and Sir Brian de Listnois’</a>
<a id='line_6911'>shield, and Sir Aliduke’s shield, with many more that I am not now</a>
<a id='line_6912'>advised of, and also my two brethren’s shields, Sir Ector de Maris and</a>
<a id='line_6913'>Sir Lionel; wherefore I pray you greet them all from me, and say that I</a>
<a id='line_6914'>bid them take such stuff there as they find, and that in any wise my</a>
<a id='line_6915'>brethren go unto the court and abide me there till that I come, for by</a>
<a id='line_6916'>the feast of Pentecost I cast me to be there, for as at this time I</a>
<a id='line_6917'>must ride with this damosel for to save my promise.</a>
<a id='line_6918'></a>
<a id='line_6919'>And so he departed from Gaheris, and Gaheris yede in to the manor, and</a>
<a id='line_6920'>there he found a yeoman porter keeping there many keys. Anon withal Sir</a>
<a id='line_6921'>Gaheris threw the porter unto the ground and took the keys from him,</a>
<a id='line_6922'>and hastily he opened the prison door, and there he let out all the</a>
<a id='line_6923'>prisoners, and every man loosed other of their bonds. And when they saw</a>
<a id='line_6924'>Sir Gaheris, all they thanked him, for they weened that he was wounded.</a>
<a id='line_6925'>Not so, said Gaheris, it was Launcelot that slew him worshipfully with</a>
<a id='line_6926'>his own hands. I saw it with mine own eyes. And he greeteth you all</a>
<a id='line_6927'>well, and prayeth you to haste you to the court; and as unto Sir Lionel</a>
<a id='line_6928'>and Ector de Maris he prayeth you to abide him at the court. That shall</a>
<a id='line_6929'>we not do, says his brethren, we will find him an we may live. So shall</a>
<a id='line_6930'>I, said Sir Kay, find him or I come at the court, as I am true knight.</a>
<a id='line_6931'></a>
<a id='line_6932'>Then all those knights sought the house thereas the armour was, and</a>
<a id='line_6933'>then they armed them, and every knight found his own horse, and all</a>
<a id='line_6934'>that ever longed unto him. And when this was done, there came a</a>
<a id='line_6935'>forester with four horses laden with fat venison. Anon, Sir Kay said,</a>
<a id='line_6936'>Here is good meat for us for one meal, for we had not many a day no</a>
<a id='line_6937'>good repast. And so that venison was roasted, baken, and sodden, and so</a>
<a id='line_6938'>after supper some abode there all night, but Sir Lionel and Ector de</a>
<a id='line_6939'>Maris and Sir Kay rode after Sir Launcelot to find him if they might.</a>
<a id='line_6940'></a>
<a id='line_6941'></a>
<a id='line_6942'></a>
<a id='line_6943'>CHAPTER X. How Sir Launcelot rode with a damosel and slew a knight that</a>
<a id='line_6944'>distressed all ladies and also a villain that kept a bridge.</a>
<a id='line_6945'></a>
<a id='line_6946'>Now turn we unto Sir Launcelot, that rode with the damosel in a fair</a>
<a id='line_6947'>highway. Sir, said the damosel, here by this way haunteth a knight that</a>
<a id='line_6948'>distressed all ladies and gentlewomen, and at the least he robbeth them</a>
<a id='line_6949'>or lieth by them. What, said Sir Launcelot, is he a thief and a knight</a>
<a id='line_6950'>and a ravisher of women? he doth shame unto the order of knighthood,</a>
<a id='line_6951'>and contrary unto his oath; it is pity that he liveth. But, fair</a>
<a id='line_6952'>damosel, ye shall ride on afore, yourself, and I will keep myself in</a>
<a id='line_6953'>covert, and if that he trouble you or distress you I shall be your</a>
<a id='line_6954'>rescue and learn him to be ruled as a knight.</a>
<a id='line_6955'></a>
<a id='line_6956'>So the maid rode on by the way a soft ambling pace, and within a while</a>
<a id='line_6957'>came out that knight on horseback out of the wood, and his page with</a>
<a id='line_6958'>him, and there he put the damosel from her horse, and then she cried.</a>
<a id='line_6959'>With that came Launcelot as fast as he might till he came to that</a>
<a id='line_6960'>knight, saying, O thou false knight and traitor unto knighthood, who</a>
<a id='line_6961'>did learn thee to distress ladies and gentlewomen? When the knight saw</a>
<a id='line_6962'>Sir Launcelot thus rebuking him he answered not, but drew his sword and</a>
<a id='line_6963'>rode unto Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot threw his spear from him,</a>
<a id='line_6964'>and drew out his sword, and struck him such a buffet on the helmet that</a>
<a id='line_6965'>he clave his head and neck unto the throat. Now hast thou thy payment</a>
<a id='line_6966'>that long thou hast deserved! That is truth, said the damosel, for like</a>
<a id='line_6967'>as Sir Turquine watched to destroy knights, so did this knight attend</a>
<a id='line_6968'>to destroy and distress ladies, damosels, and gentlewomen, and his name</a>
<a id='line_6969'>was Sir Peris de Forest Savage. Now, damosel, said Sir Launcelot, will</a>
<a id='line_6970'>ye any more service of me? Nay, sir, she said, at this time, but</a>
<a id='line_6971'>almighty Jesu preserve you wheresomever ye ride or go, for the curteist</a>
<a id='line_6972'>knight thou art, and meekest unto all ladies and gentlewomen, that now</a>
<a id='line_6973'>liveth. But one thing, sir knight, methinketh ye lack, ye that are a</a>
<a id='line_6974'>knight wifeless, that he will not love some maiden or gentlewoman, for</a>
<a id='line_6975'>I could never hear say that ever ye loved any of no manner degree, and</a>
<a id='line_6976'>that is great pity; but it is noised that ye love Queen Guenever, and</a>
<a id='line_6977'>that she hath ordained by enchantment that ye shall never love none</a>
<a id='line_6978'>other but her, nor none other damosel nor lady shall rejoice you;</a>
<a id='line_6979'>wherefore many in this land, of high estate and low, make great sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_6980'></a>
<a id='line_6981'>Fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, I may not warn people to speak of me</a>
<a id='line_6982'>what it pleaseth them; but for to be a wedded man, I think it not; for</a>
<a id='line_6983'>then I must couch with her, and leave arms and tournaments, battles,</a>
<a id='line_6984'>and adventures; and as for to say for to take my pleasaunce with</a>
<a id='line_6985'>paramours, that will I refuse in principal for dread of God; for</a>
<a id='line_6986'>knights that be adventurous or lecherous shall not be happy nor</a>
<a id='line_6987'>fortunate unto the wars, for other they shall be overcome with a</a>
<a id='line_6988'>simpler knight than they be themselves, other else they shall by unhap</a>
<a id='line_6989'>and their cursedness slay better men than they be themselves. And so</a>
<a id='line_6990'>who that useth paramours shall be unhappy, and all thing is unhappy</a>
<a id='line_6991'>that is about them.</a>
<a id='line_6992'></a>
<a id='line_6993'>And so Sir Launcelot and she departed. And then he rode in a deep</a>
<a id='line_6994'>forest two days and more, and had strait lodging. So on the third day</a>
<a id='line_6995'>he rode over a long bridge, and there stert upon him suddenly a passing</a>
<a id='line_6996'>foul churl, and he smote his horse on the nose that he turned about,</a>
<a id='line_6997'>and asked him why he rode over that bridge without his licence. Why</a>
<a id='line_6998'>should I not ride this way? said Sir Launcelot, I may not ride beside.</a>
<a id='line_6999'>Thou shalt not choose, said the churl, and lashed at him with a great</a>
<a id='line_7000'>club shod with iron. Then Sir Launcelot drew his sword and put the</a>
<a id='line_7001'>stroke aback, and clave his head unto the paps. At the end of the</a>
<a id='line_7002'>bridge was a fair village, and all the people, men and women, cried on</a>
<a id='line_7003'>Sir Launcelot, and said, A worse deed didst thou never for thyself, for</a>
<a id='line_7004'>thou hast slain the chief porter of our castle. Sir Launcelot let them</a>
<a id='line_7005'>say what they would, and straight he went into the castle; and when he</a>
<a id='line_7006'>came into the castle he alighted, and tied his horse to a ring on the</a>
<a id='line_7007'>wall and there he saw a fair green court, and thither he dressed him,</a>
<a id='line_7008'>for there him thought was a fair place to fight in. So he looked about,</a>
<a id='line_7009'>and saw much people in doors and windows that said, Fair knight, thou</a>
<a id='line_7010'>art unhappy.</a>
<a id='line_7011'></a>
<a id='line_7012'></a>
<a id='line_7013'></a>
<a id='line_7014'>CHAPTER XI. How Sir Launcelot slew two giants, and made a castle free.</a>
<a id='line_7015'></a>
<a id='line_7016'>Anon withal came there upon him two great giants, well armed all save</a>
<a id='line_7017'>the heads, with two horrible clubs in their hands. Sir Launcelot put</a>
<a id='line_7018'>his shield afore him and put the stroke away of the one giant, and with</a>
<a id='line_7019'>his sword he clave his head asunder. When his fellow saw that, he ran</a>
<a id='line_7020'>away as he were wood, for fear of the horrible strokes, and Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_7021'>after him with all his might, and smote him on the shoulder, and clave</a>
<a id='line_7022'>him to the navel. Then Sir Launcelot went into the hall, and there came</a>
<a id='line_7023'>afore him three score ladies and damosels, and all kneeled unto him,</a>
<a id='line_7024'>and thanked God and him of their deliverance; For sir, said they, the</a>
<a id='line_7025'>most party of us have been here this seven year their prisoners, and we</a>
<a id='line_7026'>have worked all manner of silk works for our meat, and we are all great</a>
<a id='line_7027'>gentlewomen born; and blessed be the time, knight, that ever thou be</a>
<a id='line_7028'>born, for thou hast done the most worship that ever did knight in this</a>
<a id='line_7029'>world, that will we bear record, and we all pray you to tell us your</a>
<a id='line_7030'>name, that we may tell our friends who delivered us out of prison. Fair</a>
<a id='line_7031'>damosel, he said, my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. Ah, sir, said they</a>
<a id='line_7032'>all, well mayest thou be he, for else save yourself, as we deemed,</a>
<a id='line_7033'>there might never knight have the better of these two giants; for many</a>
<a id='line_7034'>fair knights have assayed it, and here have ended, and many times have</a>
<a id='line_7035'>we wished after you, and these two giants dread never knight but you.</a>
<a id='line_7036'>Now may ye say, said Sir Launcelot, unto your friends how and who hath</a>
<a id='line_7037'>delivered you, and greet them all from me, and if that I come in any of</a>
<a id='line_7038'>your marches, show me such cheer as ye have cause, and what treasure</a>
<a id='line_7039'>that there in this castle is I give it you for a reward for your</a>
<a id='line_7040'>grievance, and the lord that is owner of this castle I would he</a>
<a id='line_7041'>received it as is right. Fair sir, said they, the name of this castle</a>
<a id='line_7042'>is Tintagil, and a duke ought it sometime that had wedded fair Igraine,</a>
<a id='line_7043'>and after wedded her Uther Pendragon, and gat on her Arthur. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_7044'>Sir Launcelot, I understand to whom this castle longeth; and so he</a>
<a id='line_7045'>departed from them, and betaught them unto God.</a>
<a id='line_7046'></a>
<a id='line_7047'>And then he mounted upon his horse, and rode into many strange and wild</a>
<a id='line_7048'>countries, and through many waters and valleys, and evil was he lodged.</a>
<a id='line_7049'>And at the last by fortune him happened, against a night, to come to a</a>
<a id='line_7050'>fair courtelage, and therein he found an old gentlewoman that lodged</a>
<a id='line_7051'>him with good will, and there he had good cheer for him and his horse.</a>
<a id='line_7052'>And when time was, his host brought him into a fair garret, over the</a>
<a id='line_7053'>gate, to his bed. There Sir Launcelot unarmed him, and set his harness</a>
<a id='line_7054'>by him, and went to bed, and anon he fell asleep. So, soon after, there</a>
<a id='line_7055'>came one on horseback, and knocked at the gate in great haste, and when</a>
<a id='line_7056'>Sir Launcelot heard this, he arose up and looked out at the window, and</a>
<a id='line_7057'>saw by the moonlight three knights came riding after that one man, and</a>
<a id='line_7058'>all three lashed on him at once with swords, and that one knight turned</a>
<a id='line_7059'>on them knightly again, and defended him. Truly, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_7060'>yonder one knight shall I help, for it were shame for me to see three</a>
<a id='line_7061'>knights on one, and if he be slain I am partner of his death; and</a>
<a id='line_7062'>therewith he took his harness, and went out at a window by a sheet down</a>
<a id='line_7063'>to the four knights, and then Sir Launcelot said on high, Turn you</a>
<a id='line_7064'>knights unto me, and leave your fighting with that knight. And then</a>
<a id='line_7065'>they all three left Sir Kay, and turned unto Sir Launcelot, and there</a>
<a id='line_7066'>began great battle, for they alighted all three, and struck many great</a>
<a id='line_7067'>strokes at Sir Launcelot, and assailed him on every side. Then Sir Kay</a>
<a id='line_7068'>dressed him for to have holpen Sir Launcelot. Nay, sir, said he, I will</a>
<a id='line_7069'>none of your help; therefore as ye will have my help, let me alone with</a>
<a id='line_7070'>them. Sir Kay, for the pleasure of the knight, suffered him for to do</a>
<a id='line_7071'>his will, and so stood aside. And then anon within six strokes, Sir</a>
<a id='line_7072'>Launcelot had stricken them to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_7073'></a>
<a id='line_7074'>And then they all three cried: Sir knight, we yield us unto you as a</a>
<a id='line_7075'>man of might makeless. As to that, said Sir Launcelot, I will not take</a>
<a id='line_7076'>your yielding unto me. But so that ye will yield you unto Sir Kay the</a>
<a id='line_7077'>Seneschal, on that covenant I will save your lives, and else not. Fair</a>
<a id='line_7078'>knight, said they, that were we loath to do; for as for Sir Kay, we</a>
<a id='line_7079'>chased him hither, and had overcome him had not ye been, therefore to</a>
<a id='line_7080'>yield us unto him it were no reason. Well, as to that, said Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_7081'>advise you well, for ye may choose whether ye will die or live, for an</a>
<a id='line_7082'>ye be yolden it shall be unto Sir Kay. Fair knight, then they said, in</a>
<a id='line_7083'>saving of our lives we will do as thou commandest us. Then shall ye,</a>
<a id='line_7084'>said Sir Launcelot, on Whitsunday next coming, go unto the court of</a>
<a id='line_7085'>King Arthur, and there shall ye yield you unto Queen Guenever, and put</a>
<a id='line_7086'>you all three in her grace and mercy, and say that Sir Kay sent you</a>
<a id='line_7087'>thither to be her prisoners. Sir, they said, it shall be done by the</a>
<a id='line_7088'>faith of our bodies, an we be living, and there they swore every knight</a>
<a id='line_7089'>upon his sword. And so Sir Launcelot suffered them so to depart. And</a>
<a id='line_7090'>then Sir Launcelot knocked at the gate with the pommel of his sword,</a>
<a id='line_7091'>and with that came his host, and in they entered Sir Kay and he. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_7092'>said his host, I weened ye had been in your bed. So I was, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7093'>Launcelot, but I rose and leapt out at my window for to help an old</a>
<a id='line_7094'>fellow of mine. And so when they came nigh the light, Sir Kay knew well</a>
<a id='line_7095'>that it was Sir Launcelot, and therewith he kneeled down and thanked</a>
<a id='line_7096'>him of all his kindness that he had holpen him twice from the death.</a>
<a id='line_7097'>Sir, he said, I have nothing done but that me ought for to do, and ye</a>
<a id='line_7098'>are welcome, and here shall ye repose you and take your rest.</a>
<a id='line_7099'></a>
<a id='line_7100'>So when Sir Kay was unarmed, he asked after meat; so there was meat</a>
<a id='line_7101'>fetched him, and he ate strongly. And when he had supped they went to</a>
<a id='line_7102'>their beds and were lodged together in one bed. On the morn Sir</a>
<a id='line_7103'>Launcelot arose early, and left Sir Kay sleeping, and Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_7104'>took Sir Kay’s armour and his shield, and armed him, and so he went to</a>
<a id='line_7105'>the stable, and took his horse, and took his leave of his host, and so</a>
<a id='line_7106'>he departed. Then soon after arose Sir Kay and missed Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_7107'>And then he espied that he had his armour and his horse. Now by my</a>
<a id='line_7108'>faith I know well that he will grieve some of the court of King Arthur;</a>
<a id='line_7109'>for on him knights will be bold, and deem that it is I, and that will</a>
<a id='line_7110'>beguile them. And because of his armour and shield I am sure I shall</a>
<a id='line_7111'>ride in peace. And then soon after departed Sir Kay and thanked his</a>
<a id='line_7112'>host.</a>
<a id='line_7113'></a>
<a id='line_7114'></a>
<a id='line_7115'></a>
<a id='line_7116'>CHAPTER XII. How Sir Launcelot rode disguised in Sir Kay’s harness, and</a>
<a id='line_7117'>how he smote down a knight.</a>
<a id='line_7118'></a>
<a id='line_7119'>Now turn we unto Sir Launcelot that had ridden long in a great forest,</a>
<a id='line_7120'>and at the last he came into a low country, full of fair rivers and</a>
<a id='line_7121'>meadows. And afore him he saw a long bridge, and three pavilions stood</a>
<a id='line_7122'>thereon, of silk and sendal of divers hue. And without the pavilions</a>
<a id='line_7123'>hung three white shields on truncheons of spears, and great long spears</a>
<a id='line_7124'>stood upright by the pavilions, and at every pavilion’s door stood</a>
<a id='line_7125'>three fresh squires, and so Sir Launcelot passed by them and spake no</a>
<a id='line_7126'>word. When he was passed the three knights said them that it was the</a>
<a id='line_7127'>proud Kay; He weeneth no knight so good as he, and the contrary is</a>
<a id='line_7128'>ofttime proved. By my faith, said one of the knights, his name was Sir</a>
<a id='line_7129'>Gaunter, I will ride after him and assay him for all his pride, and ye</a>
<a id='line_7130'>may behold how that I speed. So this knight, Sir Gaunter, armed him,</a>
<a id='line_7131'>and hung his shield upon his shoulder, and mounted upon a great horse,</a>
<a id='line_7132'>and gat his spear in his hand, and walloped after Sir Launcelot. And</a>
<a id='line_7133'>when he came nigh him, he cried, Abide, thou proud knight Sir Kay, for</a>
<a id='line_7134'>thou shalt not pass quit. So Sir Launcelot turned him, and either</a>
<a id='line_7135'>feutred their spears, and came together with all their mights, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_7136'>Gaunter’s spear brake, but Sir Launcelot smote him down horse and man.</a>
<a id='line_7137'>And when Sir Gaunter was at the earth his brethren said each one to</a>
<a id='line_7138'>other, Yonder knight is not Sir Kay, for he is bigger than he. I dare</a>
<a id='line_7139'>lay my head, said Sir Gilmere, yonder knight hath slain Sir Kay and</a>
<a id='line_7140'>hath taken his horse and his harness. Whether it be so or no, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7141'>Raynold, the third brother, let us now go mount upon our horses and</a>
<a id='line_7142'>rescue our brother Sir Gaunter, upon pain of death. We all shall have</a>
<a id='line_7143'>work enough to match that knight, for ever meseemeth by his person it</a>
<a id='line_7144'>is Sir Launcelot, or Sir Tristram, or Sir Pelleas, the good knight.</a>
<a id='line_7145'></a>
<a id='line_7146'>Then anon they took their horses and overtook Sir Launcelot, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_7147'>Gilmere put forth his spear, and ran to Sir Launcelot, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_7148'>Launcelot smote him down that he lay in a swoon. Sir knight, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7149'>Raynold, thou art a strong man, and as I suppose thou hast slain my two</a>
<a id='line_7150'>brethren, for the which raseth my heart sore against thee, and if I</a>
<a id='line_7151'>might with my worship I would not have ado with you, but needs I must</a>
<a id='line_7152'>take part as they do, and therefore, knight, he said, keep thyself. And</a>
<a id='line_7153'>so they hurtled together with all their mights, and all to-shivered</a>
<a id='line_7154'>both their spears. And then they drew their swords and lashed together</a>
<a id='line_7155'>eagerly. Anon therewith arose Sir Gaunter, and came unto his brother</a>
<a id='line_7156'>Sir Gilmere, and bade him, Arise, and help we our brother Sir Raynold,</a>
<a id='line_7157'>that yonder marvellously matched yonder good knight. Therewithal, they</a>
<a id='line_7158'>leapt on their horses and hurtled unto Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_7159'></a>
<a id='line_7160'>And when he saw them come he smote a sore stroke unto Sir Raynold, that</a>
<a id='line_7161'>he fell off his horse to the ground, and then he struck to the other</a>
<a id='line_7162'>two brethren, and at two strokes he struck them down to the earth. With</a>
<a id='line_7163'>that Sir Raynold began to start up with his head all bloody, and came</a>
<a id='line_7164'>straight unto Sir Launcelot. Now let be, said Sir Launcelot, I was not</a>
<a id='line_7165'>far from thee when thou wert made knight, Sir Raynold, and also I know</a>
<a id='line_7166'>thou art a good knight, and loath I were to slay thee. Gramercy, said</a>
<a id='line_7167'>Sir Raynold, as for your goodness; and I dare say as for me and my</a>
<a id='line_7168'>brethren, we will not be loath to yield us unto you, with that we knew</a>
<a id='line_7169'>your name, for well we know ye are not Sir Kay. As for that be it as it</a>
<a id='line_7170'>be may, for ye shall yield you unto dame Guenever, and look that ye be</a>
<a id='line_7171'>with her on Whitsunday, and yield you unto her as prisoners, and say</a>
<a id='line_7172'>that Sir Kay sent you unto her. Then they swore it should be done, and</a>
<a id='line_7173'>so passed forth Sir Launcelot, and each one of the brethren holp other</a>
<a id='line_7174'>as well as they might.</a>

<a id='line_7179'>Round Table and overthrew them.</a>
<a id='line_7180'></a>
<a id='line_7181'>So Sir Launcelot rode into a deep forest, and thereby in a slade, he</a>
<a id='line_7182'>saw four knights hoving under an oak, and they were of Arthur’s court,</a>
<a id='line_7183'>one was Sir Sagramour le Desirous, and Ector de Maris, and Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_7184'>and Sir Uwaine. Anon as these four knights had espied Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_7185'>they weened by his arms it had been Sir Kay. Now by my faith, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7186'>Sagramour, I will prove Sir Kay’s might, and gat his spear in his hand,</a>
<a id='line_7187'>and came toward Sir Launcelot. Therewith Sir Launcelot was ware and</a>
<a id='line_7188'>knew him well, and feutred his spear against him, and smote Sir</a>
<a id='line_7189'>Sagramour so sore that horse and man fell both to the earth. Lo, my</a>
<a id='line_7190'>fellows, said he, yonder ye may see what a buffet he hath; that knight</a>
<a id='line_7191'>is much bigger than ever was Sir Kay. Now shall ye see what I may do to</a>
<a id='line_7192'>him. So Sir Ector gat his spear in his hand and walloped toward Sir</a>
<a id='line_7193'>Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot smote him through the shield and shoulder,</a>
<a id='line_7194'>that man and horse went to the earth, and ever his spear held.</a>
<a id='line_7195'></a>
<a id='line_7196'>By my faith, said Sir Uwaine, yonder is a strong knight, and I am sure</a>
<a id='line_7197'>he hath slain Sir Kay; and I see by his great strength it will be hard</a>
<a id='line_7198'>to match him. And therewithal, Sir Uwaine gat his spear in his hand and</a>
<a id='line_7199'>rode toward Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot knew him well, and so he</a>
<a id='line_7200'>met him on the plain, and gave him such a buffet that he was astonied,</a>
<a id='line_7201'>that long he wist not where he was. Now see I well, said Sir Gawaine, I</a>
<a id='line_7202'>must encounter with that knight. Then he dressed his shield and gat a</a>
<a id='line_7203'>good spear in his hand, and Sir Launcelot knew him well; and then they</a>
<a id='line_7204'>let run their horses with all their mights, and either knight smote</a>
<a id='line_7205'>other in midst of the shield. But Sir Gawaine’s spear to-brast, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_7206'>Launcelot charged so sore upon him that his horse reversed up-so-down.</a>
<a id='line_7207'>And much sorrow had Sir Gawaine to avoid his horse, and so Sir</a>
<a id='line_7208'>Launcelot passed on a pace and smiled, and said, God give him joy that</a>
<a id='line_7209'>this spear made, for there came never a better in my hand.</a>
<a id='line_7210'></a>
<a id='line_7211'>Then the four knights went each one to other and comforted each other.</a>
<a id='line_7212'>What say ye by this guest? said Sir Gawaine, that one spear hath felled</a>
<a id='line_7213'>us all four. We commend him unto the devil, they said all, for he is a</a>
<a id='line_7214'>man of great might. Ye may well say it, said Sir Gawaine, that he is a</a>
<a id='line_7215'>man of might, for I dare lay my head it is Sir Launcelot, I know it by</a>
<a id='line_7216'>his riding. Let him go, said Sir Gawaine, for when we come to the court</a>
<a id='line_7217'>then shall we wit; and then had they much sorrow to get their horses</a>
<a id='line_7218'>again.</a>
<a id='line_7219'></a>
<a id='line_7220'></a>
<a id='line_7221'></a>
<a id='line_7222'>CHAPTER XIV. How Sir Launcelot followed a brachet into a castle, where</a>
<a id='line_7223'>he found a dead knight, and how he after was required of a damosel to</a>
<a id='line_7224'>heal her brother.</a>
<a id='line_7225'></a>
<a id='line_7226'>Now leave we there and speak of Sir Launcelot that rode a great while</a>
<a id='line_7227'>in a deep forest, where he saw a black brachet, seeking in manner as it</a>
<a id='line_7228'>had been in the feute of an hurt deer. And therewith he rode after the</a>
<a id='line_7229'>brachet, and he saw lie on the ground a large feute of blood. And then</a>
<a id='line_7230'>Sir Launcelot rode after. And ever the brachet looked behind her, and</a>
<a id='line_7231'>so she went through a great marsh, and ever Sir Launcelot followed. And</a>
<a id='line_7232'>then was he ware of an old manor, and thither ran the brachet, and so</a>
<a id='line_7233'>over the bridge. So Sir Launcelot rode over that bridge that was old</a>
<a id='line_7234'>and feeble; and when he came in midst of a great hall, there he saw lie</a>
<a id='line_7235'>a dead knight that was a seemly man, and that brachet licked his</a>
<a id='line_7236'>wounds. And therewithal came out a lady weeping and wringing her hands;</a>
<a id='line_7237'>and then she said, O knight, too much sorrow hast thou brought me. Why</a>
<a id='line_7238'>say ye so? said Sir Launcelot, I did never this knight no harm, for</a>
<a id='line_7239'>hither by feute of blood this brachet brought me; and therefore, fair</a>
<a id='line_7240'>lady, be not displeased with me, for I am full sore aggrieved of your</a>
<a id='line_7241'>grievance. Truly, sir, she said, I trow it be not ye that hath slain my</a>
<a id='line_7242'>husband, for he that did that deed is sore wounded, and he is never</a>
<a id='line_7243'>likely to recover, that shall I ensure him. What was your husband’s</a>
<a id='line_7244'>name? said Sir Launcelot. Sir, said she, his name was called Sir</a>
<a id='line_7245'>Gilbert the Bastard, one of the best knights of the world, and he that</a>
<a id='line_7246'>hath slain him I know not his name. Now God send you better comfort,</a>
<a id='line_7247'>said Sir Launcelot; and so he departed and went into the forest again,</a>
<a id='line_7248'>and there he met with a damosel, the which knew him well, and she said</a>
<a id='line_7249'>aloud, Well be ye found, my lord; and now I require thee, on thy</a>
<a id='line_7250'>knighthood, help my brother that is sore wounded, and never stinteth</a>
<a id='line_7251'>bleeding; for this day he fought with Sir Gilbert the Bastard and slew</a>
<a id='line_7252'>him in plain battle, and there was my brother sore wounded, and there</a>
<a id='line_7253'>is a lady a sorceress that dwelleth in a castle here beside, and this</a>
<a id='line_7254'>day she told me my brother’s wounds should never be whole till I could</a>
<a id='line_7255'>find a knight that would go into the Chapel Perilous, and there he</a>
<a id='line_7256'>should find a sword and a bloody cloth that the wounded knight was</a>
<a id='line_7257'>lapped in, and a piece of that cloth and sword should heal my brother’s</a>
<a id='line_7258'>wounds, so that his wounds were searched with the sword and the cloth.</a>
<a id='line_7259'>This is a marvellous thing, said Sir Launcelot, but what is your</a>
<a id='line_7260'>brother’s name? Sir, she said, his name was Sir Meliot de Logres. That</a>
<a id='line_7261'>me repenteth, said Sir Launcelot, for he is a fellow of the Table</a>
<a id='line_7262'>Round, and to his help I will do my power. Then, sir, said she, follow</a>
<a id='line_7263'>even this highway, and it will bring you unto the Chapel Perilous; and</a>
<a id='line_7264'>here I shall abide till God send you here again, and, but you speed, I</a>
<a id='line_7265'>know no knight living that may achieve that adventure.</a>
<a id='line_7266'></a>
<a id='line_7267'></a>
<a id='line_7268'></a>
<a id='line_7269'>CHAPTER XV. How Sir Launcelot came into the Chapel Perilous and gat</a>
<a id='line_7270'>there of a dead corpse a piece of the cloth and a sword.</a>
<a id='line_7271'></a>
<a id='line_7272'>Right so Sir Launcelot departed, and when he came unto the Chapel</a>
<a id='line_7273'>Perilous he alighted down, and tied his horse unto a little gate. And</a>
<a id='line_7274'>as soon as he was within the churchyard he saw on the front of the</a>
<a id='line_7275'>chapel many fair rich shields turned up-so-down, and many of the</a>
<a id='line_7276'>shields Sir Launcelot had seen knights bear beforehand. With that he</a>
<a id='line_7277'>saw by him there stand a thirty great knights, more by a yard than any</a>
<a id='line_7278'>man that ever he had seen, and all those grinned and gnashed at Sir</a>
<a id='line_7279'>Launcelot. And when he saw their countenance he dreaded him sore, and</a>
<a id='line_7280'>so put his shield afore him, and took his sword ready in his hand ready</a>
<a id='line_7281'>unto battle, and they were all armed in black harness ready with their</a>
<a id='line_7282'>shields and their swords drawn. And when Sir Launcelot would have gone</a>
<a id='line_7283'>throughout them, they scattered on every side of him, and gave him the</a>
<a id='line_7284'>way, and therewith he waxed all bold, and entered into the chapel, and</a>
<a id='line_7285'>then he saw no light but a dim lamp burning, and then was he ware of a</a>
<a id='line_7286'>corpse hilled with a cloth of silk. Then Sir Launcelot stooped down,</a>
<a id='line_7287'>and cut a piece away of that cloth, and then it fared under him as the</a>
<a id='line_7288'>earth had quaked a little; therewithal he feared. And then he saw a</a>
<a id='line_7289'>fair sword lie by the dead knight, and that he gat in his hand and hied</a>
<a id='line_7290'>him out of the chapel.</a>
<a id='line_7291'></a>
<a id='line_7292'>Anon as ever he was in the chapel yard all the knights spake to him</a>
<a id='line_7293'>with a grimly voice, and said, Knight, Sir Launcelot, lay that sword</a>
<a id='line_7294'>from thee or else thou shalt die. Whether that I live or die, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7295'>Launcelot, with no great word get ye it again, therefore fight for it</a>
<a id='line_7296'>an ye list. Then right so he passed throughout them, and beyond the</a>
<a id='line_7297'>chapel yard there met him a fair damosel, and said, Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_7298'>leave that sword behind thee, or thou wilt die for it. I leave it not,</a>
<a id='line_7299'>said Sir Launcelot, for no treaties. No, said she, an thou didst leave</a>
<a id='line_7300'>that sword, Queen Guenever should thou never see. Then were I a fool an</a>
<a id='line_7301'>I would leave this sword, said Launcelot. Now, gentle knight, said the</a>
<a id='line_7302'>damosel, I require thee to kiss me but once. Nay, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_7303'>that God me forbid. Well, sir, said she, an thou hadst kissed me thy</a>
<a id='line_7304'>life days had been done, but now, alas, she said, I have lost all my</a>
<a id='line_7305'>labour, for I ordained this chapel for thy sake, and for Sir Gawaine.</a>
<a id='line_7306'>And once I had Sir Gawaine within me, and at that time he fought with</a>
<a id='line_7307'>that knight that lieth there dead in yonder chapel, Sir Gilbert the</a>
<a id='line_7308'>Bastard; and at that time he smote the left hand off of Sir Gilbert the</a>
<a id='line_7309'>Bastard. And, Sir Launcelot, now I tell thee, I have loved thee this</a>
<a id='line_7310'>seven year, but there may no woman have thy love but Queen Guenever.</a>
<a id='line_7311'>But sithen I may not rejoice thee to have thy body alive, I had kept no</a>
<a id='line_7312'>more joy in this world but to have thy body dead. Then would I have</a>
<a id='line_7313'>balmed it and served it, and so have kept it my life days, and daily I</a>
<a id='line_7314'>should have clipped thee, and kissed thee, in despite of Queen</a>
<a id='line_7315'>Guenever. Ye say well, said Sir Launcelot, Jesu preserve me from your</a>
<a id='line_7316'>subtle crafts. And therewithal he took his horse and so departed from</a>
<a id='line_7317'>her. And as the book saith, when Sir Launcelot was departed she took</a>
<a id='line_7318'>such sorrow that she died within a fourteen night, and her name was</a>
<a id='line_7319'>Hellawes the sorceress, Lady of the Castle Nigramous.</a>
<a id='line_7320'></a>
<a id='line_7321'>Anon Sir Launcelot met with the damosel, Sir Meliot’s sister. And when</a>
<a id='line_7322'>she saw him she clapped her hands, and wept for joy. And then they rode</a>
<a id='line_7323'>unto a castle thereby where lay Sir Meliot. And anon as Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_7324'>saw him he knew him, but he was passing pale, as the earth, for</a>
<a id='line_7325'>bleeding. When Sir Meliot saw Sir Launcelot he kneeled upon his knees</a>
<a id='line_7326'>and cried on high: O lord Sir Launcelot, help me! Anon Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_7327'>leapt unto him and touched his wounds with Sir Gilbert’s sword. And</a>
<a id='line_7328'>then he wiped his wounds with a part of the bloody cloth that Sir</a>
<a id='line_7329'>Gilbert was wrapped in, and anon an wholer man in his life was he</a>
<a id='line_7330'>never. And then there was great joy between them, and they made Sir</a>
<a id='line_7331'>Launcelot all the cheer that they might, and so on the morn Sir</a>
<a id='line_7332'>Launcelot took his leave, and bade Sir Meliot hie him to the court of</a>
<a id='line_7333'>my lord Arthur, for it draweth nigh to the Feast of Pentecost, and</a>
<a id='line_7334'>there by the grace of God ye shall find me. And therewith they</a>
<a id='line_7335'>departed.</a>
<a id='line_7336'></a>
<a id='line_7337'></a>
<a id='line_7338'></a>
<a id='line_7339'>CHAPTER XVI. How Sir Launcelot at the request of a lady recovered a</a>
<a id='line_7340'>falcon, by which he was deceived.</a>
<a id='line_7341'></a>
<a id='line_7342'>And so Sir Launcelot rode through many strange countries, over marshes</a>
<a id='line_7343'>and valleys, till by fortune he came to a fair castle, and as he passed</a>
<a id='line_7344'>beyond the castle him thought he heard two bells ring. And then was he</a>
<a id='line_7345'>ware of a falcon came flying over his head toward an high elm, and long</a>
<a id='line_7346'>lunes about her feet, and as she flew unto the elm to take her perch</a>
<a id='line_7347'>the lunes over-cast about a bough. And when she would have taken her</a>
<a id='line_7348'>flight she hung by the legs fast; and Sir Launcelot saw how she hung,</a>
<a id='line_7349'>and beheld the fair falcon perigot, and he was sorry for her.</a>
<a id='line_7350'></a>
<a id='line_7351'>The meanwhile came a lady out of the castle and cried on high: O</a>
<a id='line_7352'>Launcelot, Launcelot, as thou art flower of all knights, help me to get</a>
<a id='line_7353'>my hawk, for an my hawk be lost my lord will destroy me; for I kept the</a>
<a id='line_7354'>hawk and she slipped from me, and if my lord my husband wit it he is so</a>
<a id='line_7355'>hasty that he will slay me. What is your lord’s name? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7356'>Launcelot. Sir, she said, his name is Sir Phelot, a knight that longeth</a>
<a id='line_7357'>unto the King of Northgalis. Well, fair lady, since that ye know my</a>
<a id='line_7358'>name, and require me of knighthood to help you, I will do what I may to</a>
<a id='line_7359'>get your hawk, and yet God knoweth I am an ill climber, and the tree is</a>
<a id='line_7360'>passing high, and few boughs to help me withal. And therewith Sir</a>
<a id='line_7361'>Launcelot alighted, and tied his horse to the same tree, and prayed the</a>
<a id='line_7362'>lady to unarm him. And so when he was unarmed, he put off all his</a>
<a id='line_7363'>clothes unto his shirt and breech, and with might and force he clomb up</a>
<a id='line_7364'>to the falcon, and tied the lines to a great rotten boyshe, and threw</a>
<a id='line_7365'>the hawk down and it withal.</a>
<a id='line_7366'></a>
<a id='line_7367'>Anon the lady gat the hawk in her hand; and therewithal came out Sir</a>
<a id='line_7368'>Phelot out of the groves suddenly, that was her husband, all armed and</a>
<a id='line_7369'>with his naked sword in his hand, and said: O knight Launcelot, now</a>
<a id='line_7370'>have I found thee as I would, and stood at the bole of the tree to slay</a>
<a id='line_7371'>him. Ah, lady, said Sir Launcelot, why have ye betrayed me? She hath</a>
<a id='line_7372'>done, said Sir Phelot, but as I commanded her, and therefore there nis</a>
<a id='line_7373'>none other boot but thine hour is come that thou must die. That were</a>
<a id='line_7374'>shame unto thee, said Sir Launcelot, thou an armed knight to slay a</a>
<a id='line_7375'>naked man by treason. Thou gettest none other grace, said Sir Phelot,</a>
<a id='line_7376'>and therefore help thyself an thou canst. Truly, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_7377'>that shall be thy shame, but since thou wilt do none other, take mine</a>
<a id='line_7378'>harness with thee, and hang my sword upon a bough that I may get it,</a>
<a id='line_7379'>and then do thy best to slay me an thou canst. Nay, nay, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7380'>Phelot, for I know thee better than thou weenest, therefore thou</a>
<a id='line_7381'>gettest no weapon, an I may keep you therefrom. Alas, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7382'>Launcelot, that ever a knight should die weaponless. And therewith he</a>
<a id='line_7383'>waited above him and under him, and over his head he saw a rownsepyk, a</a>
<a id='line_7384'>big bough leafless, and therewith he brake it off by the body. And then</a>
<a id='line_7385'>he came lower and awaited how his own horse stood, and suddenly he</a>
<a id='line_7386'>leapt on the further side of the horse, fro-ward the knight. And then</a>
<a id='line_7387'>Sir Phelot lashed at him eagerly, weening to have slain him. But Sir</a>
<a id='line_7388'>Launcelot put away the stroke with the rownsepyk, and therewith he</a>
<a id='line_7389'>smote him on the one side of the head, that he fell down in a swoon to</a>
<a id='line_7390'>the ground. So then Sir Launcelot took his sword out of his hand, and</a>
<a id='line_7391'>struck his neck from the body. Then cried the lady, Alas! why hast thou</a>
<a id='line_7392'>slain my husband? I am not causer, said Sir Launcelot, for with</a>
<a id='line_7393'>falsehood ye would have had slain me with treason, and now it is fallen</a>
<a id='line_7394'>on you both. And then she swooned as though she would die. And</a>
<a id='line_7395'>therewithal Sir Launcelot gat all his armour as well as he might, and</a>
<a id='line_7396'>put it upon him for dread of more resort, for he dreaded that the</a>
<a id='line_7397'>knight’s castle was so nigh. And so, as soon as he might, he took his</a>
<a id='line_7398'>horse and departed, and thanked God that he had escaped that adventure.</a>
<a id='line_7399'></a>
<a id='line_7400'></a>
<a id='line_7401'></a>
<a id='line_7402'>CHAPTER XVII. How Sir Launcelot overtook a knight which chased his wife</a>
<a id='line_7403'>to have slain her, and how he said to him.</a>
<a id='line_7404'></a>
<a id='line_7405'>So Sir Launcelot rode many wild ways, throughout marches and many wild</a>
<a id='line_7406'>ways. And as he rode in a valley he saw a knight chasing a lady, with a</a>
<a id='line_7407'>naked sword, to have slain her. And by fortune as this knight should</a>
<a id='line_7408'>have slain this lady, she cried on Sir Launcelot and prayed him to</a>
<a id='line_7409'>rescue her. When Sir Launcelot saw that mischief, he took his horse and</a>
<a id='line_7410'>rode between them, saying, Knight, fie for shame, why wilt thou slay</a>
<a id='line_7411'>this lady? thou dost shame unto thee and all knights. What hast thou to</a>
<a id='line_7412'>do betwixt me and my wife? said the knight. I will slay her maugre thy</a>
<a id='line_7413'>head. That shall ye not, said Sir Launcelot, for rather we two will</a>
<a id='line_7414'>have ado together. Sir Launcelot, said the knight, thou dost not thy</a>
<a id='line_7415'>part, for this lady hath betrayed me. It is not so, said the lady,</a>
<a id='line_7416'>truly he saith wrong on me. And for because I love and cherish my</a>
<a id='line_7417'>cousin germain, he is jealous betwixt him and me; and as I shall answer</a>
<a id='line_7418'>to God there was never sin betwixt us. But, sir, said the lady, as thou</a>
<a id='line_7419'>art called the worshipfullest knight of the world, I require thee of</a>
<a id='line_7420'>true knighthood, keep me and save me. For whatsomever ye say he will</a>
<a id='line_7421'>slay me, for he is without mercy. Have ye no doubt, said Launcelot, it</a>
<a id='line_7422'>shall not lie in his power. Sir, said the knight, in your sight I will</a>
<a id='line_7423'>be ruled as ye will have me. And so Sir Launcelot rode on the one side</a>
<a id='line_7424'>and she on the other: he had not ridden but a while, but the knight</a>
<a id='line_7425'>bade Sir Launcelot turn him and look behind him, and said, Sir, yonder</a>
<a id='line_7426'>come men of arms after us riding. And so Sir Launcelot turned him and</a>
<a id='line_7427'>thought no treason, and therewith was the knight and the lady on one</a>
<a id='line_7428'>side, and suddenly he swapped off his lady’s head.</a>
<a id='line_7429'></a>
<a id='line_7430'>And when Sir Launcelot had espied him what he had done, he said, and</a>
<a id='line_7431'>called him, Traitor, thou hast shamed me for ever. And suddenly Sir</a>
<a id='line_7432'>Launcelot alighted off his horse, and pulled out his sword to slay him,</a>
<a id='line_7433'>and therewithal he fell flat to the earth, and gripped Sir Launcelot by</a>
<a id='line_7434'>the thighs, and cried mercy. Fie on thee, said Sir Launcelot, thou</a>
<a id='line_7435'>shameful knight, thou mayest have no mercy, and therefore arise and</a>
<a id='line_7436'>fight with me. Nay, said the knight, I will never arise till ye grant</a>
<a id='line_7437'>me mercy. Now will I proffer thee fair, said Launcelot, I will unarm me</a>
<a id='line_7438'>unto my shirt, and I will have nothing upon me but my shirt, and my</a>
<a id='line_7439'>sword and my hand. And if thou canst slay me, quit be thou for ever.</a>
<a id='line_7440'>Nay, sir, said Pedivere, that will I never. Well, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_7441'>take this lady and the head, and bear it upon thee, and here shalt thou</a>
<a id='line_7442'>swear upon my sword, to bear it always upon thy back, and never to rest</a>
<a id='line_7443'>till thou come to Queen Guenever. Sir, said he, that will I do, by the</a>
<a id='line_7444'>faith of my body. Now, said Launcelot, tell me what is your name? Sir,</a>
<a id='line_7445'>my name is Pedivere. In a shameful hour wert thou born, said Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_7446'></a>
<a id='line_7447'>So Pedivere departed with the dead lady and the head, and found the</a>
<a id='line_7448'>queen with King Arthur at Winchester, and there he told all the truth.</a>
<a id='line_7449'>Sir knight, said the queen, this is an horrible deed and a shameful,</a>
<a id='line_7450'>and a great rebuke unto Sir Launcelot; but notwithstanding his worship</a>
<a id='line_7451'>is not known in many divers countries; but this shall I give you in</a>
<a id='line_7452'>penance, make ye as good shift as ye can, ye shall bear this lady with</a>
<a id='line_7453'>you on horseback unto the Pope of Rome, and of him receive your penance</a>
<a id='line_7454'>for your foul deeds; and ye shall never rest one night whereas ye do</a>
<a id='line_7455'>another; an ye go to any bed the dead body shall lie with you. This</a>
<a id='line_7456'>oath there he made, and so departed. And as it telleth in the French</a>
<a id='line_7457'>book, when he came to Rome, the Pope bade him go again unto Queen</a>
<a id='line_7458'>Guenever, and in Rome was his lady buried by the Pope’s commandment.</a>
<a id='line_7459'>And after this Sir Pedivere fell to great goodness, and was an holy man</a>
<a id='line_7460'>and an hermit.</a>

<a id='line_7464'>CHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Launcelot came to King Arthur’s Court, and how</a>
<a id='line_7465'>there were recounted all his noble feats and acts.</a>
<a id='line_7466'></a>
<a id='line_7467'>Now turn we unto Sir Launcelot du Lake, that came home two days afore</a>
<a id='line_7468'>the Feast of Pentecost; and the king and all the court were passing</a>
<a id='line_7469'>fain of his coming. And when Sir Gawaine, Sir Uwaine, Sir Sagramore,</a>
<a id='line_7470'>Sir Ector de Maris, saw Sir Launcelot in Kay’s armour, then they wist</a>
<a id='line_7471'>well it was he that smote them down all with one spear. Then there was</a>
<a id='line_7472'>laughing and smiling among them. And ever now and now came all the</a>
<a id='line_7473'>knights home that Sir Turquine had prisoners, and they all honoured and</a>
<a id='line_7474'>worshipped Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_7475'></a>
<a id='line_7476'>When Sir Gaheris heard them speak, he said, I saw all the battle from</a>
<a id='line_7477'>the beginning to the ending, and there he told King Arthur all how it</a>
<a id='line_7478'>was, and how Sir Turquine was the strongest knight that ever he saw</a>
<a id='line_7479'>except Sir Launcelot: there were many knights bare him record, nigh</a>
<a id='line_7480'>three score. Then Sir Kay told the king how Sir Launcelot had rescued</a>
<a id='line_7481'>him when he should have been slain, and how he made the knights yield</a>
<a id='line_7482'>them to me, and not to him. And there they were all three, and bare</a>
<a id='line_7483'>record. And by Jesu, said Sir Kay, because Sir Launcelot took my</a>
<a id='line_7484'>harness and left me his I rode in good peace, and no man would have ado</a>
<a id='line_7485'>with me.</a>
<a id='line_7486'></a>
<a id='line_7487'>Anon therewithal there came the three knights that fought with Sir</a>
<a id='line_7488'>Launcelot at the long bridge. And there they yielded them unto Sir Kay,</a>
<a id='line_7489'>and Sir Kay forsook them and said he fought never with them. But I</a>
<a id='line_7490'>shall ease your heart, said Sir Kay, yonder is Sir Launcelot that</a>
<a id='line_7491'>overcame you. When they wist that they were glad. And then Sir Meliot</a>
<a id='line_7492'>de Logres came home, and told the king how Sir Launcelot had saved him</a>
<a id='line_7493'>from the death. And all his deeds were known, how four queens,</a>
<a id='line_7494'>sorceresses, had him in prison, and how he was delivered by King</a>
<a id='line_7495'>Bagdemagus’ daughter. Also there were told all the great deeds of arms</a>
<a id='line_7496'>that Sir Launcelot did betwixt the two kings, that is for to say the</a>
<a id='line_7497'>King of Northgalis and King Bagdemagus. All the truth Sir Gahalantine</a>
<a id='line_7498'>did tell, and Sir Mador de la Porte and Sir Mordred, for they were at</a>
<a id='line_7499'>that same tournament. Then came in the lady that knew Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_7500'>when that he wounded Sir Belleus at the pavilion. And there, at request</a>
<a id='line_7501'>of Sir Launcelot, Sir Belleus was made knight of the Round Table. And</a>
<a id='line_7502'>so at that time Sir Launcelot had the greatest name of any knight of</a>
<a id='line_7503'>the world, and most he was honoured of high and low.</a>
<a id='line_7504'></a>
<a id='line_7505'> Explicit the noble tale of Sir Launcelot du Lake, which is the vi.</a>
<a id='line_7506'> book. Here followeth the tale of Sir Gareth of Orkney that was called</a>
<a id='line_7507'> Beaumains by Sir Kay, and is the seventh book.</a>

<a id='line_7512'></a>
<a id='line_7513'></a>
<a id='line_7514'></a>
<a id='line_7515'>CHAPTER I. How Beaumains came to King Arthur’s Court and demanded three</a>
<a id='line_7516'>petitions of King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_7517'></a>
<a id='line_7518'>When Arthur held his Round Table most plenour, it fortuned that he</a>
<a id='line_7519'>commanded that the high feast of Pentecost should be holden at a city</a>
<a id='line_7520'>and a castle, the which in those days was called Kynke Kenadonne, upon</a>
<a id='line_7521'>the sands that marched nigh Wales. So ever the king had a custom that</a>
<a id='line_7522'>at the feast of Pentecost in especial, afore other feasts in the year,</a>
<a id='line_7523'>he would not go that day to meat until he had heard or seen of a great</a>
<a id='line_7524'>marvel. And for that custom all manner of strange adventures came</a>
<a id='line_7525'>before Arthur as at that feast before all other feasts. And so Sir</a>
<a id='line_7526'>Gawaine, a little to-fore noon of the day of Pentecost, espied at a</a>
<a id='line_7527'>window three men upon horseback, and a dwarf on foot, and so the three</a>
<a id='line_7528'>men alighted, and the dwarf kept their horses, and one of the three men</a>
<a id='line_7529'>was higher than the other twain by a foot and an half. Then Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_7530'>went unto the king and said, Sir, go to your meat, for here at the hand</a>
<a id='line_7531'>come strange adventures. So Arthur went unto his meat with many other</a>
<a id='line_7532'>kings. And there were all the knights of the Round Table, [save] only</a>
<a id='line_7533'>those that were prisoners or slain at a recounter. Then at the high</a>
<a id='line_7534'>feast evermore they should be fulfilled the whole number of an hundred</a>
<a id='line_7535'>and fifty, for then was the Round Table fully complished.</a>
<a id='line_7536'></a>
<a id='line_7537'>Right so came into the hall two men well beseen and richly, and upon</a>
<a id='line_7538'>their shoulders there leaned the goodliest young man and the fairest</a>
<a id='line_7539'>that ever they all saw, and he was large and long, and broad in the</a>
<a id='line_7540'>shoulders, and well visaged, and the fairest and the largest handed</a>
<a id='line_7541'>that ever man saw, but he fared as though he might not go nor bear</a>
<a id='line_7542'>himself but if he leaned upon their shoulders. Anon as Arthur saw him</a>
<a id='line_7543'>there was made peace and room, and right so they yede with him unto the</a>
<a id='line_7544'>high dais, without saying of any words. Then this much young man pulled</a>
<a id='line_7545'>him aback, and easily stretched up straight, saying, King Arthur, God</a>
<a id='line_7546'>you bless and all your fair fellowship, and in especial the fellowship</a>
<a id='line_7547'>of the Table Round. And for this cause I am come hither, to pray you</a>
<a id='line_7548'>and require you to give me three gifts, and they shall not be</a>
<a id='line_7549'>unreasonably asked, but that ye may worshipfully and honourably grant</a>
<a id='line_7550'>them me, and to you no great hurt nor loss. And the first don and gift</a>
<a id='line_7551'>I will ask now, and the other two gifts I will ask this day</a>
<a id='line_7552'>twelvemonth, wheresomever ye hold your high feast. Now ask, said</a>
<a id='line_7553'>Arthur, and ye shall have your asking.</a>
<a id='line_7554'></a>
<a id='line_7555'>Now, sir, this is my petition for this feast, that ye will give me meat</a>
<a id='line_7556'>and drink sufficiently for this twelvemonth, and at that day I will ask</a>
<a id='line_7557'>mine other two gifts.</a>
<a id='line_7558'></a>
<a id='line_7559'>My fair son, said Arthur, ask better, I counsel thee, for this is but a</a>
<a id='line_7560'>simple asking; for my heart giveth me to thee greatly, that thou art</a>
<a id='line_7561'>come of men of worship, and greatly my conceit faileth me but thou</a>
<a id='line_7562'>shalt prove a man of right great worship. Sir, he said, thereof be as</a>
<a id='line_7563'>it be may, I have asked that I will ask. Well, said the king, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_7564'>have meat and drink enough; I never defended that none, neither my</a>
<a id='line_7565'>friend nor my foe. But what is thy name I would wit? I cannot tell you,</a>
<a id='line_7566'>said he. That is marvel, said the king, that thou knowest not thy name,</a>
<a id='line_7567'>and thou art the goodliest young man that ever I saw. Then the king</a>
<a id='line_7568'>betook him to Sir Kay the steward, and charged him that he should give</a>
<a id='line_7569'>him of all manner of meats and drinks of the best, and also that he had</a>
<a id='line_7570'>all manner of finding as though he were a lord’s son. That shall little</a>
<a id='line_7571'>need, said Sir Kay, to do such cost upon him; for I dare undertake he</a>
<a id='line_7572'>is a villain born, and never will make man, for an he had come of</a>
<a id='line_7573'>gentlemen he would have asked of you horse and armour, but such as he</a>
<a id='line_7574'>is, so he asketh. And sithen he hath no name, I shall give him a name</a>
<a id='line_7575'>that shall be Beaumains, that is Fair-hands, and into the kitchen I</a>
<a id='line_7576'>shall bring him, and there he shall have fat brose every day, that he</a>
<a id='line_7577'>shall be as fat by the twelvemonths’ end as a pork hog. Right so the</a>
<a id='line_7578'>two men departed and beleft him to Sir Kay, that scorned him and mocked</a>
<a id='line_7579'>him.</a>
<a id='line_7580'></a>
<a id='line_7581'></a>
<a id='line_7582'></a>
<a id='line_7583'>CHAPTER II. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine were wroth because Sir</a>
<a id='line_7584'>Kay mocked Beaumains, and of a damosel which desired a knight to fight</a>
<a id='line_7585'>for a lady.</a>
<a id='line_7586'></a>
<a id='line_7587'>Thereat was Sir Gawaine wroth, and in especial Sir Launcelot bade Sir</a>
<a id='line_7588'>Kay leave his mocking, for I dare lay my head he shall prove a man of</a>
<a id='line_7589'>great worship. Let be said Sir Kay, it may not be by no reason, for as</a>
<a id='line_7590'>he is, so he hath asked. Beware, said Sir Launcelot, so ye gave the</a>
<a id='line_7591'>good knight Brewnor, Sir Dinadan’s brother, a name, and ye called him</a>
<a id='line_7592'>La Cote Male Taile, and that turned you to anger afterward. As for</a>
<a id='line_7593'>that, said Sir Kay, this shall never prove none such. For Sir Brewnor</a>
<a id='line_7594'>desired ever worship, and this desireth bread and drink and broth; upon</a>
<a id='line_7595'>pain of my life he was fostered up in some abbey, and, howsomever it</a>
<a id='line_7596'>was, they failed meat and drink, and so hither he is come for his</a>
<a id='line_7597'>sustenance.</a>
<a id='line_7598'></a>
<a id='line_7599'>And so Sir Kay bade get him a place, and sit down to meat; so Beaumains</a>
<a id='line_7600'>went to the hall door, and set him down among boys and lads, and there</a>
<a id='line_7601'>he ate sadly. And then Sir Launcelot after meat bade him come to his</a>
<a id='line_7602'>chamber, and there he should have meat and drink enough. And so did Sir</a>
<a id='line_7603'>Gawaine: but he refused them all; he would do none other but as Sir Kay</a>
<a id='line_7604'>commanded him, for no proffer. But as touching Sir Gawaine, he had</a>
<a id='line_7605'>reason to proffer him lodging, meat, and drink, for that proffer came</a>
<a id='line_7606'>of his blood, for he was nearer kin to him than he wist. But that as</a>
<a id='line_7607'>Sir Launcelot did was of his great gentleness and courtesy.</a>
<a id='line_7608'></a>
<a id='line_7609'>So thus he was put into the kitchen, and lay nightly as the boys of the</a>
<a id='line_7610'>kitchen did. And so he endured all that twelvemonth, and never</a>
<a id='line_7611'>displeased man nor child, but always he was meek and mild. But ever</a>
<a id='line_7612'>when that he saw any jousting of knights, that would he see an he</a>
<a id='line_7613'>might. And ever Sir Launcelot would give him gold to spend, and</a>
<a id='line_7614'>clothes, and so did Sir Gawaine, and where there were any masteries</a>
<a id='line_7615'>done, thereat would he be, and there might none cast bar nor stone to</a>
<a id='line_7616'>him by two yards. Then would Sir Kay say, How liketh you my boy of the</a>
<a id='line_7617'>kitchen? So it passed on till the feast of Whitsuntide. And at that</a>
<a id='line_7618'>time the king held it at Carlion in the most royallest wise that might</a>
<a id='line_7619'>be, like as he did yearly. But the king would no meat eat upon the</a>
<a id='line_7620'>Whitsunday, until he heard some adventures. Then came there a squire to</a>
<a id='line_7621'>the king and said, Sir, ye may go to your meat, for here cometh a</a>
<a id='line_7622'>damosel with some strange adventures. Then was the king glad and sat</a>
<a id='line_7623'>him down.</a>
<a id='line_7624'></a>
<a id='line_7625'>Right so there came a damosel into the hall and saluted the king, and</a>
<a id='line_7626'>prayed him of succour. For whom? said the king, what is the adventure?</a>
<a id='line_7627'></a>
<a id='line_7628'>Sir, she said, I have a lady of great worship and renown, and she is</a>
<a id='line_7629'>besieged with a tyrant, so that she may not out of her castle; and</a>
<a id='line_7630'>because here are called the noblest knights of the world, I come to you</a>
<a id='line_7631'>to pray you of succour. What hight your lady, and where dwelleth she,</a>
<a id='line_7632'>and who is she, and what is his name that hath besieged her? Sir king,</a>
<a id='line_7633'>she said, as for my lady’s name that shall not ye know for me as at</a>
<a id='line_7634'>this time, but I let you wit she is a lady of great worship and of</a>
<a id='line_7635'>great lands; and as for the tyrant that besiegeth her and destroyeth</a>
<a id='line_7636'>her lands, he is called the Red Knight of the Red Launds. I know him</a>
<a id='line_7637'>not, said the king. Sir, said Sir Gawaine, I know him well, for he is</a>
<a id='line_7638'>one of the perilloust knights of the world; men say that he hath seven</a>
<a id='line_7639'>men’s strength, and from him I escaped once full hard with my life.</a>
<a id='line_7640'>Fair damosel, said the king, there be knights here would do their power</a>
<a id='line_7641'>for to rescue your lady, but because you will not tell her name, nor</a>
<a id='line_7642'>where she dwelleth, therefore none of my knights that here be now shall</a>
<a id='line_7643'>go with you by my will. Then must I speak further, said the damosel.</a>
<a id='line_7644'></a>
<a id='line_7645'></a>
<a id='line_7646'></a>
<a id='line_7647'>CHAPTER III. How Beaumains desired the battle, and how it was granted</a>
<a id='line_7648'>to him, and how he desired to be made knight of Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_7649'></a>
<a id='line_7650'>With these words came before the king Beaumains, while the damosel was</a>
<a id='line_7651'>there, and thus he said, Sir king, God thank you, I have been this</a>
<a id='line_7652'>twelvemonth in your kitchen, and have had my full sustenance, and now I</a>
<a id='line_7653'>will ask my two gifts that be behind. Ask, upon my peril, said the</a>
<a id='line_7654'>king. Sir, this shall be my two gifts, first that ye will grant me to</a>
<a id='line_7655'>have this adventure of the damosel, for it belongeth unto me. Thou</a>
<a id='line_7656'>shalt have it, said the king, I grant it thee. Then, sir, this is the</a>
<a id='line_7657'>other gift, that ye shall bid Launcelot du Lake to make me knight, for</a>
<a id='line_7658'>of him I will be made knight and else of none. And when I am passed I</a>
<a id='line_7659'>pray you let him ride after me, and make me knight when I require him.</a>
<a id='line_7660'>All this shall be done, said the king. Fie on thee, said the damosel,</a>
<a id='line_7661'>shall I have none but one that is your kitchen page? Then was she wroth</a>
<a id='line_7662'>and took her horse and departed. And with that there came one to</a>
<a id='line_7663'>Beaumains and told him his horse and armour was come for him; and there</a>
<a id='line_7664'>was the dwarf come with all thing that him needed, in the richest</a>
<a id='line_7665'>manner; thereat all the court had much marvel from whence came all that</a>
<a id='line_7666'>gear. So when he was armed there was none but few so goodly a man as he</a>
<a id='line_7667'>was; and right so as he came into the hall and took his leave of King</a>
<a id='line_7668'>Arthur, and Sir Gawaine, and Sir Launcelot, and prayed that he would</a>
<a id='line_7669'>hie after him, and so departed and rode after the damosel.</a>
<a id='line_7670'></a>
<a id='line_7671'></a>
<a id='line_7672'></a>
<a id='line_7673'>CHAPTER IV. How Beaumains departed, and how he gat of Sir Kay a spear</a>
<a id='line_7674'>and a shield, and how he jousted with Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_7675'></a>
<a id='line_7676'>But there went many after to behold how well he was horsed and trapped</a>
<a id='line_7677'>in cloth of gold, but he had neither shield nor spear. Then Sir Kay</a>
<a id='line_7678'>said all open in the hall, I will ride after my boy in the kitchen, to</a>
<a id='line_7679'>wit whether he will know me for his better. Said Sir Launcelot and Sir</a>
<a id='line_7680'>Gawaine, Yet abide at home. So Sir Kay made him ready and took his</a>
<a id='line_7681'>horse and his spear, and rode after him. And right as Beaumains</a>
<a id='line_7682'>overtook the damosel, right so came Sir Kay and said, Beaumains, what,</a>
<a id='line_7683'>sir, know ye not me? Then he turned his horse, and knew it was Sir Kay,</a>
<a id='line_7684'>that had done him all the despite as ye have heard afore. Yea, said</a>
<a id='line_7685'>Beaumains, I know you for an ungentle knight of the court, and</a>
<a id='line_7686'>therefore beware of me. Therewith Sir Kay put his spear in the rest,</a>
<a id='line_7687'>and ran straight upon him; and Beaumains came as fast upon him with his</a>
<a id='line_7688'>sword in his hand, and so he put away his spear with his sword, and</a>
<a id='line_7689'>with a foin thrust him through the side, that Sir Kay fell down as he</a>
<a id='line_7690'>had been dead; and he alighted down and took Sir Kay’s shield and his</a>
<a id='line_7691'>spear, and stert upon his own horse and rode his way.</a>
<a id='line_7692'></a>
<a id='line_7693'>All that saw Sir Launcelot, and so did the damosel. And then he bade</a>
<a id='line_7694'>his dwarf stert upon Sir Kay’s horse, and so he did. By that Sir</a>
<a id='line_7695'>Launcelot was come, then he proffered Sir Launcelot to joust; and</a>
<a id='line_7696'>either made them ready, and they came together so fiercely that either</a>
<a id='line_7697'>bare down other to the earth, and sore were they bruised. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_7698'>Launcelot arose and helped him from his horse. And then Beaumains threw</a>
<a id='line_7699'>his shield from him, and proffered to fight with Sir Launcelot on foot;</a>
<a id='line_7700'>and so they rushed together like boars, tracing, rasing, and foining to</a>
<a id='line_7701'>the mountenance of an hour; and Sir Launcelot felt him so big that he</a>
<a id='line_7702'>marvelled of his strength, for he fought more liker a giant than a</a>
<a id='line_7703'>knight, and that his fighting was durable and passing perilous. For Sir</a>
<a id='line_7704'>Launcelot had so much ado with him that he dreaded himself to be</a>
<a id='line_7705'>shamed, and said, Beaumains, fight not so sore, your quarrel and mine</a>
<a id='line_7706'>is not so great but we may leave off. Truly that is truth, said</a>
<a id='line_7707'>Beaumains, but it doth me good to feel your might, and yet, my lord, I</a>
<a id='line_7708'>showed not the utterance.</a>

<a id='line_7715'>In God’s name, said Sir Launcelot, for I promise you, by the faith of</a>
<a id='line_7716'>my body, I had as much to do as I might to save myself from you</a>
<a id='line_7717'>unshamed, and therefore have ye no doubt of none earthly knight. Hope</a>
<a id='line_7718'>ye so that I may any while stand a proved knight? said Beaumains. Yea,</a>
<a id='line_7719'>said Launcelot, do as ye have done, and I shall be your warrant. Then,</a>
<a id='line_7720'>I pray you, said Beaumains, give me the order of knighthood. Then must</a>
<a id='line_7721'>ye tell me your name, said Launcelot, and of what kin ye be born. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_7722'>so that ye will not discover me I shall, said Beaumains. Nay, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7723'>Launcelot, and that I promise you by the faith of my body, until it be</a>
<a id='line_7724'>openly known. Then, sir, he said, my name is Gareth, and brother unto</a>
<a id='line_7725'>Sir Gawaine of father and mother. Ah, sir, said Sir Launcelot, I am</a>
<a id='line_7726'>more gladder of you than I was; for ever me thought ye should be of</a>
<a id='line_7727'>great blood, and that ye came not to the court neither for meat nor for</a>
<a id='line_7728'>drink. And then Sir Launcelot gave him the order of knighthood, and</a>
<a id='line_7729'>then Sir Gareth prayed him for to depart and let him go.</a>
<a id='line_7730'></a>
<a id='line_7731'>So Sir Launcelot departed from him and came to Sir Kay, and made him to</a>
<a id='line_7732'>be borne home upon his shield, and so he was healed hard with the life;</a>
<a id='line_7733'>and all men scorned Sir Kay, and in especial Sir Gawaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_7734'>Launcelot said it was not his part to rebuke no young man, for full</a>
<a id='line_7735'>little knew he of what birth he is come, and for what cause he came to</a>
<a id='line_7736'>this court; and so we leave Sir Kay and turn we unto Beaumains.</a>
<a id='line_7737'></a>
<a id='line_7738'>When he had overtaken the damosel, anon she said, What dost thou here?</a>
<a id='line_7739'>thou stinkest all of the kitchen, thy clothes be bawdy of the grease</a>
<a id='line_7740'>and tallow that thou gainest in King Arthur’s kitchen; weenest thou,</a>
<a id='line_7741'>said she, that I allow thee, for yonder knight that thou killest. Nay</a>
<a id='line_7742'>truly, for thou slewest him unhappily and cowardly; therefore turn</a>
<a id='line_7743'>again, bawdy kitchen page, I know thee well, for Sir Kay named thee</a>
<a id='line_7744'>Beaumains. What art thou but a lusk and a turner of broaches and a</a>
<a id='line_7745'>ladle-washer? Damosel, said Beaumains, say to me what ye will, I will</a>
<a id='line_7746'>not go from you whatsomever ye say, for I have undertaken to King</a>
<a id='line_7747'>Arthur for to achieve your adventure, and so shall I finish it to the</a>
<a id='line_7748'>end, either I shall die therefore. Fie on thee, kitchen knave, wilt</a>
<a id='line_7749'>thou finish mine adventure? thou shalt anon be met withal, that thou</a>
<a id='line_7750'>wouldest not for all the broth that ever thou suppest once look him in</a>
<a id='line_7751'>the face. I shall assay, said Beaumains.</a>
<a id='line_7752'></a>
<a id='line_7753'>So thus as they rode in the wood, there came a man flying all that ever</a>
<a id='line_7754'>he might. Whither wilt thou? said Beaumains. O lord, he said, help me,</a>
<a id='line_7755'>for here by in a slade are six thieves that have taken my lord and</a>
<a id='line_7756'>bound him, so I am afeard lest they will slay him. Bring me thither,</a>
<a id='line_7757'>said Beaumains. And so they rode together until they came thereas was</a>
<a id='line_7758'>the knight bounden; and then he rode unto them, and struck one unto the</a>
<a id='line_7759'>death, and then another, and at the third stroke he slew the third</a>
<a id='line_7760'>thief, and then the other three fled. And he rode after them, and he</a>
<a id='line_7761'>overtook them; and then those three thieves turned again and assailed</a>
<a id='line_7762'>Beaumains hard, but at the last he slew them, and returned and unbound</a>
<a id='line_7763'>the knight. And the knight thanked him, and prayed him to ride with him</a>
<a id='line_7764'>to his castle there a little beside, and he should worshipfully reward</a>
<a id='line_7765'>him for his good deeds. Sir, said Beaumains, I will no reward have: I</a>
<a id='line_7766'>was this day made knight of noble Sir Launcelot, and therefore I will</a>
<a id='line_7767'>no reward have, but God reward me. And also I must follow this damosel.</a>
<a id='line_7768'></a>
<a id='line_7769'>And when he came nigh her she bade him ride from her, For thou smellest</a>
<a id='line_7770'>all of the kitchen: weenest thou that I have joy of thee, for all this</a>
<a id='line_7771'>deed that thou hast done is but mishapped thee: but thou shalt see a</a>
<a id='line_7772'>sight shall make thee turn again, and that lightly. Then the same</a>
<a id='line_7773'>knight which was rescued of the thieves rode after that damosel, and</a>
<a id='line_7774'>prayed her to lodge with him all that night. And because it was near</a>
<a id='line_7775'>night the damosel rode with him to his castle, and there they had great</a>
<a id='line_7776'>cheer, and at supper the knight sat Sir Beaumains afore the damosel.</a>
<a id='line_7777'>Fie, fie, said she, Sir knight, ye are uncourteous to set a kitchen</a>
<a id='line_7778'>page afore me; him beseemeth better to stick a swine than to sit afore</a>
<a id='line_7779'>a damosel of high parage. Then the knight was ashamed at her words, and</a>
<a id='line_7780'>took him up, and set him at a sideboard, and set himself afore him, and</a>
<a id='line_7781'>so all that night they had good cheer and merry rest.</a>
<a id='line_7782'></a>
<a id='line_7783'></a>
<a id='line_7784'></a>
<a id='line_7785'>CHAPTER VI. How Beaumains fought and slew two knights at a passage.</a>
<a id='line_7786'></a>
<a id='line_7787'>And on the morn the damosel and he took their leave and thanked the</a>
<a id='line_7788'>knight, and so departed, and rode on their way until they came to a</a>
<a id='line_7789'>great forest. And there was a great river and but one passage, and</a>
<a id='line_7790'>there were ready two knights on the farther side to let them the</a>
<a id='line_7791'>passage. What sayest thou, said the damosel, wilt thou match yonder</a>
<a id='line_7792'>knights or turn again? Nay, said Sir Beaumains, I will not turn again</a>
<a id='line_7793'>an they were six more. And therewithal he rushed into the water, and in</a>
<a id='line_7794'>midst of the water either brake their spears upon other to their hands,</a>
<a id='line_7795'>and then they drew their swords, and smote eagerly at other. And at the</a>
<a id='line_7796'>last Sir Beaumains smote the other upon the helm that his head stonied,</a>
<a id='line_7797'>and therewithal he fell down in the water, and there was he drowned.</a>
<a id='line_7798'>And then he spurred his horse upon the land, where the other knight</a>
<a id='line_7799'>fell upon him, and brake his spear, and so they drew their swords and</a>
<a id='line_7800'>fought long together. At the last Sir Beaumains clave his helm and his</a>
<a id='line_7801'>head down to the shoulders; and so he rode unto the damosel and bade</a>
<a id='line_7802'>her ride forth on her way.</a>
<a id='line_7803'></a>
<a id='line_7804'>Alas, she said, that ever a kitchen page should have that fortune to</a>
<a id='line_7805'>destroy such two doughty knights: thou weenest thou hast done</a>
<a id='line_7806'>doughtily, that is not so; for the first knight his horse stumbled, and</a>
<a id='line_7807'>there he was drowned in the water, and never it was by thy force, nor</a>
<a id='line_7808'>by thy might. And the last knight by mishap thou camest behind him and</a>
<a id='line_7809'>mishappily thou slew him.</a>
<a id='line_7810'></a>
<a id='line_7811'>Damosel, said Beaumains, ye may say what ye will, but with whomsomever</a>
<a id='line_7812'>I have ado withal, I trust to God to serve him or he depart. And</a>
<a id='line_7813'>therefore I reck not what ye say, so that I may win your lady. Fie,</a>
<a id='line_7814'>fie, foul kitchen knave, thou shalt see knights that shall abate thy</a>
<a id='line_7815'>boast. Fair damosel, give me goodly language, and then my care is past,</a>
<a id='line_7816'>for what knights somever they be, I care not, nor I doubt them not.</a>
<a id='line_7817'>Also, said she, I say it for thine avail, yet mayest thou turn again</a>
<a id='line_7818'>with thy worship; for an thou follow me, thou art but slain, for I see</a>
<a id='line_7819'>all that ever thou dost is but by misadventure, and not by prowess of</a>
<a id='line_7820'>thy hands. Well, damosel, ye may say what ye will, but wheresomever ye</a>
<a id='line_7821'>go I will follow you. So this Beaumains rode with that lady till</a>
<a id='line_7822'>evensong time, and ever she chid him, and would not rest. And they came</a>
<a id='line_7823'>to a black laund; and there was a black hawthorn, and thereon hung a</a>
<a id='line_7824'>black banner, and on the other side there hung a black shield, and by</a>
<a id='line_7825'>it stood a black spear great and long, and a great black horse covered</a>
<a id='line_7826'>with silk, and a black stone fast by.</a>
<a id='line_7827'></a>
<a id='line_7828'></a>
<a id='line_7829'></a>
<a id='line_7830'>CHAPTER VII. How Beaumains fought with the Knight of the Black Launds,</a>
<a id='line_7831'>and fought with him till he fell down and died.</a>
<a id='line_7832'></a>
<a id='line_7833'>There sat a knight all armed in black harness, and his name was the</a>
<a id='line_7834'>Knight of the Black Laund. Then the damosel, when she saw that knight,</a>
<a id='line_7835'>she bade him flee down that valley, for his horse was not saddled.</a>
<a id='line_7836'>Gramercy, said Beaumains, for always ye would have me a coward. With</a>
<a id='line_7837'>that the Black Knight, when she came nigh him, spake and said, Damosel,</a>
<a id='line_7838'>have ye brought this knight of King Arthur to be your champion? Nay,</a>
<a id='line_7839'>fair knight, said she, this is but a kitchen knave that was fed in King</a>
<a id='line_7840'>Arthur’s kitchen for alms. Why cometh he, said the knight, in such</a>
<a id='line_7841'>array? it is shame that he beareth you company. Sir, I cannot be</a>
<a id='line_7842'>delivered of him, said she, for with me he rideth maugre mine head: God</a>
<a id='line_7843'>would that ye should put him from me, other to slay him an ye may, for</a>
<a id='line_7844'>he is an unhappy knave, and unhappily he hath done this day: through</a>
<a id='line_7845'>mishap I saw him slay two knights at the passage of the water; and</a>
<a id='line_7846'>other deeds he did before right marvellous and through unhappiness.</a>
<a id='line_7847'>That marvelleth me, said the Black Knight, that any man that is of</a>
<a id='line_7848'>worship will have ado with him. They know him not, said the damosel,</a>
<a id='line_7849'>and for because he rideth with me, they ween that he be some man of</a>
<a id='line_7850'>worship born. That may be, said the Black Knight; howbeit as ye say</a>
<a id='line_7851'>that he be no man of worship, he is a full likely person, and full like</a>
<a id='line_7852'>to be a strong man: but thus much shall I grant you, said the Black</a>
<a id='line_7853'>Knight; I shall put him down upon one foot, and his horse and his</a>
<a id='line_7854'>harness he shall leave with me, for it were shame to me to do him any</a>
<a id='line_7855'>more harm.</a>
<a id='line_7856'></a>
<a id='line_7857'>When Sir Beaumains heard him say thus, he said, Sir knight, thou art</a>
<a id='line_7858'>full large of my horse and my harness; I let thee wit it cost thee</a>
<a id='line_7859'>nought, and whether it liketh thee or not, this laund will I pass</a>
<a id='line_7860'>maugre thine head. And horse nor harness gettest thou none of mine, but</a>
<a id='line_7861'>if thou win them with thy hands; and therefore let see what thou canst</a>
<a id='line_7862'>do. Sayest thou that? said the Black Knight, now yield thy lady from</a>
<a id='line_7863'>thee, for it beseemeth never a kitchen page to ride with such a lady.</a>
<a id='line_7864'>Thou liest, said Beaumains, I am a gentleman born, and of more high</a>
<a id='line_7865'>lineage than thou, and that will I prove on thy body.</a>
<a id='line_7866'></a>
<a id='line_7867'>Then in great wrath they departed with their horses, and came together</a>
<a id='line_7868'>as it had been the thunder, and the Black Knight’s spear brake, and</a>
<a id='line_7869'>Beaumains thrust him through both his sides, and therewith his spear</a>
<a id='line_7870'>brake, and the truncheon left still in his side. But nevertheless the</a>
<a id='line_7871'>Black Knight drew his sword, and smote many eager strokes, and of great</a>
<a id='line_7872'>might, and hurt Beaumains full sore. But at the last the Black Knight,</a>
<a id='line_7873'>within an hour and an half, he fell down off his horse in swoon, and</a>
<a id='line_7874'>there he died. And when Beaumains saw him so well horsed and armed,</a>
<a id='line_7875'>then he alighted down and armed him in his armour, and so took his</a>
<a id='line_7876'>horse and rode after the damosel.</a>
<a id='line_7877'></a>
<a id='line_7878'>When she saw him come nigh, she said, Away, kitchen knave, out of the</a>
<a id='line_7879'>wind, for the smell of thy bawdy clothes grieveth me. Alas, she said,</a>
<a id='line_7880'>that ever such a knave should by mishap slay so good a knight as thou</a>
<a id='line_7881'>hast done, but all this is thine unhappiness. But here by is one shall</a>
<a id='line_7882'>pay thee all thy payment, and therefore yet I counsel thee, flee. It</a>
<a id='line_7883'>may happen me, said Beaumains, to be beaten or slain, but I warn you,</a>
<a id='line_7884'>fair damosel, I will not flee away, a nor leave your company, for all</a>
<a id='line_7885'>that ye can say; for ever ye say that they will kill me or beat me, but</a>
<a id='line_7886'>howsomever it happeneth I escape, and they lie on the ground. And</a>
<a id='line_7887'>therefore it were as good for you to hold you still thus all day</a>
<a id='line_7888'>rebuking me, for away will I not till I see the uttermost of this</a>
<a id='line_7889'>journey, or else I will be slain, other truly beaten; therefore ride on</a>
<a id='line_7890'>your way, for follow you I will whatsomever happen.</a>
<a id='line_7891'></a>
<a id='line_7892'></a>
<a id='line_7893'></a>
<a id='line_7894'>CHAPTER VIII. How the brother of the knight that was slain met with</a>
<a id='line_7895'>Beaumains, and fought with Beaumains till he was yielden.</a>
<a id='line_7896'></a>
<a id='line_7897'>Thus as they rode together, they saw a knight come driving by them all</a>
<a id='line_7898'>in green, both his horse and his harness; and when he came nigh the</a>
<a id='line_7899'>damosel, he asked her, Is that my brother the Black Knight that ye have</a>
<a id='line_7900'>brought with you? Nay, nay, she said, this unhappy kitchen knave hath</a>
<a id='line_7901'>slain your brother through unhappiness. Alas, said the Green Knight,</a>
<a id='line_7902'>that is great pity, that so noble a knight as he was should so</a>
<a id='line_7903'>unhappily be slain, and namely of a knave’s hand, as ye say that he is.</a>
<a id='line_7904'>Ah! traitor, said the Green Knight, thou shalt die for slaying of my</a>
<a id='line_7905'>brother; he was a full noble knight, and his name was Sir Perard. I</a>
<a id='line_7906'>defy thee, said Beaumains, for I let thee wit I slew him knightly and</a>
<a id='line_7907'>not shamefully.</a>
<a id='line_7908'></a>
<a id='line_7909'>Therewithal the Green Knight rode unto an horn that was green, and it</a>
<a id='line_7910'>hung upon a thorn, and there he blew three deadly motes, and there came</a>
<a id='line_7911'>two damosels and armed him lightly. And then he took a great horse, and</a>
<a id='line_7912'>a green shield and a green spear. And then they ran together with all</a>
<a id='line_7913'>their mights, and brake their spears unto their hands. And then they</a>
<a id='line_7914'>drew their swords, and gave many sad strokes, and either of them</a>
<a id='line_7915'>wounded other full ill. And at the last, at an overthwart, Beaumains</a>
<a id='line_7916'>with his horse struck the Green Knight’s horse upon the side, that he</a>
<a id='line_7917'>fell to the earth. And then the Green Knight avoided his horse lightly,</a>
<a id='line_7918'>and dressed him upon foot. That saw Beaumains, and therewithal he</a>
<a id='line_7919'>alighted, and they rushed together like two mighty kemps a long while,</a>
<a id='line_7920'>and sore they bled both. With that came the damosel, and said, My lord</a>
<a id='line_7921'>the Green Knight, why for shame stand ye so long fighting with the</a>
<a id='line_7922'>kitchen knave? Alas, it is shame that ever ye were made knight, to see</a>
<a id='line_7923'>such a lad to match such a knight, as the weed overgrew the corn.</a>
<a id='line_7924'>Therewith the Green Knight was ashamed, and therewithal he gave a great</a>
<a id='line_7925'>stroke of might, and clave his shield through. When Beaumains saw his</a>
<a id='line_7926'>shield cloven asunder he was a little ashamed of that stroke and of her</a>
<a id='line_7927'>language; and then he gave him such a buffet upon the helm that he fell</a>
<a id='line_7928'>on his knees. And so suddenly Beaumains pulled him upon the ground</a>
<a id='line_7929'>grovelling. And then the Green Knight cried him mercy, and yielded him</a>
<a id='line_7930'>unto Sir Beaumains, and prayed him to slay him not. All is in vain,</a>
<a id='line_7931'>said Beaumains, for thou shalt die but if this damosel that came with</a>
<a id='line_7932'>me pray me to save thy life. And therewithal he unlaced his helm like</a>
<a id='line_7933'>as he would slay him. Fie upon thee, false kitchen page, I will never</a>
<a id='line_7934'>pray thee to save his life, for I will never be so much in thy danger.</a>
<a id='line_7935'>Then shall he die, said Beaumains. Not so hardy, thou bawdy knave, said</a>
<a id='line_7936'>the damosel, that thou slay him. Alas, said the Green Knight, suffer me</a>
<a id='line_7937'>not to die for a fair word may save me. Fair knight, said the Green</a>
<a id='line_7938'>Knight, save my life, and I will forgive thee the death of my brother,</a>
<a id='line_7939'>and for ever to become thy man, and thirty knights that hold of me for</a>
<a id='line_7940'>ever shall do you service. In the devil’s name, said the damosel, that</a>
<a id='line_7941'>such a bawdy kitchen knave should have thee and thirty knights’</a>
<a id='line_7942'>service.</a>
<a id='line_7943'></a>
<a id='line_7944'>Sir knight, said Beaumains, all this availeth thee not, but if my</a>
<a id='line_7945'>damosel speak with me for thy life. And therewithal he made a semblant</a>
<a id='line_7946'>to slay him. Let be, said the damosel, thou bawdy knave; slay him not,</a>
<a id='line_7947'>for an thou do thou shalt repent it. Damosel, said Beaumains, your</a>
<a id='line_7948'>charge is to me a pleasure, and at your commandment his life shall be</a>
<a id='line_7949'>saved, and else not. Then he said, Sir knight with the green arms, I</a>
<a id='line_7950'>release thee quit at this damosel’s request, for I will not make her</a>
<a id='line_7951'>wroth, I will fulfil all that she chargeth me. And then the Green</a>
<a id='line_7952'>Knight kneeled down, and did him homage with his sword. Then said the</a>
<a id='line_7953'>damosel, Me repenteth, Green Knight, of your damage, and of your</a>
<a id='line_7954'>brother’s death, the Black Knight, for of your help I had great mister,</a>
<a id='line_7955'>for I dread me sore to pass this forest. Nay, dread you not, said the</a>
<a id='line_7956'>Green Knight, for ye shall lodge with me this night, and to-morn I</a>
<a id='line_7957'>shall help you through this forest. So they took their horses and rode</a>
<a id='line_7958'>to his manor, which was fast there beside.</a>
<a id='line_7959'></a>
<a id='line_7960'></a>
<a id='line_7961'></a>
<a id='line_7962'>CHAPTER IX. How the damosel again rebuked Beaumains, and would not</a>
<a id='line_7963'>suffer him to sit at her table, but called him kitchen boy.</a>
<a id='line_7964'></a>
<a id='line_7965'>And ever she rebuked Beaumains, and would not suffer him to sit at her</a>
<a id='line_7966'>table, but as the Green Knight took him and sat him at a side table.</a>
<a id='line_7967'>Marvel methinketh, said the Green Knight to the damosel, why ye rebuke</a>
<a id='line_7968'>this noble knight as ye do, for I warn you, damosel, he is a full noble</a>
<a id='line_7969'>knight, and I know no knight is able to match him; therefore ye do</a>
<a id='line_7970'>great wrong to rebuke him, for he shall do you right good service, for</a>
<a id='line_7971'>whatsomever he maketh himself, ye shall prove at the end that he is</a>
<a id='line_7972'>come of a noble blood and of king’s lineage. Fie, fie, said the</a>
<a id='line_7973'>damosel, it is shame for you to say of him such worship. Truly, said</a>
<a id='line_7974'>the Green Knight, it were shame for me to say of him any disworship,</a>
<a id='line_7975'>for he hath proved himself a better knight than I am, yet have I met</a>
<a id='line_7976'>with many knights in my days, and never or this time have I found no</a>
<a id='line_7977'>knight his match. And so that night they yede unto rest, and all that</a>
<a id='line_7978'>night the Green Knight commanded thirty knights privily to watch</a>
<a id='line_7979'>Beaumains, for to keep him from all treason.</a>
<a id='line_7980'></a>
<a id='line_7981'>And so on the morn they all arose, and heard their mass and brake their</a>
<a id='line_7982'>fast; and then they took their horses and rode on their way, and the</a>
<a id='line_7983'>Green Knight conveyed them through the forest; and there the Green</a>
<a id='line_7984'>Knight said, My lord Beaumains, I and these thirty knights shall be</a>
<a id='line_7985'>always at your summons, both early and late, at your calling and</a>
<a id='line_7986'>whither that ever ye will send us. It is well said, said Beaumains;</a>
<a id='line_7987'>when that I call upon you ye must yield you unto King Arthur, and all</a>
<a id='line_7988'>your knights. If that ye so command us, we shall be ready at all times,</a>
<a id='line_7989'>said the Green Knight. Fie, fie upon thee, in the devil’s name, said</a>
<a id='line_7990'>the damosel, that any good knights should be obedient unto a kitchen</a>
<a id='line_7991'>knave. So then departed the Green Knight and the damosel. And then she</a>
<a id='line_7992'>said unto Beaumains, Why followest thou me, thou kitchen boy? Cast away</a>
<a id='line_7993'>thy shield and thy spear, and flee away; yet I counsel thee betimes or</a>
<a id='line_7994'>thou shalt say right soon, alas; for wert thou as wight as ever was</a>
<a id='line_7995'>Wade or Launcelot, Tristram, or the good knight Sir Lamorak, thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_7996'>not pass a pass here that is called the Pass Perilous. Damosel, said</a>
<a id='line_7997'>Beaumains, who is afeard let him flee, for it were shame to turn again</a>
<a id='line_7998'>sithen I have ridden so long with you. Well, said the damosel, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_7999'>soon, whether ye will or not.</a>
<a id='line_8000'></a>
<a id='line_8001'></a>
<a id='line_8002'></a>
<a id='line_8003'>CHAPTER X. How the third brother, called the Red Knight, jousted and</a>
<a id='line_8004'>fought against Beaumains, and how Beaumains overcame him.</a>
<a id='line_8005'></a>
<a id='line_8006'>So within a while they saw a tower as white as any snow, well</a>
<a id='line_8007'>matchecold all about, and double dyked. And over the tower gate there</a>
<a id='line_8008'>hung a fifty shields of divers colours, and under that tower there was</a>
<a id='line_8009'>a fair meadow. And therein were many knights and squires to behold,</a>
<a id='line_8010'>scaffolds and pavilions; for there upon the morn should be a great</a>
<a id='line_8011'>tournament: and the lord of the tower was in his castle and looked out</a>
<a id='line_8012'>at a window, and saw a damosel, a dwarf, and a knight armed at all</a>
<a id='line_8013'>points. So God me help, said the lord, with that knight will I joust,</a>
<a id='line_8014'>for I see that he is a knight-errant. And so he armed him and horsed</a>
<a id='line_8015'>him hastily. And when he was on horseback with his shield and his</a>
<a id='line_8016'>spear, it was all red, both his horse and his harness, and all that to</a>
<a id='line_8017'>him longeth. And when that he came nigh him he weened it had been his</a>
<a id='line_8018'>brother the Black Knight; and then he cried aloud, Brother, what do ye</a>
<a id='line_8019'>in these marches? Nay, nay, said the damosel, it is not he; this is but</a>
<a id='line_8020'>a kitchen knave that was brought up for alms in King Arthur’s court.</a>
<a id='line_8021'>Nevertheless, said the Red Knight, I will speak with him or he depart.</a>
<a id='line_8022'>Ah, said the damosel, this knave hath killed thy brother, and Sir Kay</a>
<a id='line_8023'>named him Beaumains, and this horse and this harness was thy brother’s,</a>
<a id='line_8024'>the Black Knight. Also I saw thy brother the Green Knight overcome of</a>
<a id='line_8025'>his hands. Now may ye be revenged upon him, for I may never be quit of</a>
<a id='line_8026'>him.</a>
<a id='line_8027'></a>
<a id='line_8028'>With this either knights departed in sunder, and they came together</a>
<a id='line_8029'>with all their might, and either of their horses fell to the earth, and</a>
<a id='line_8030'>they avoided their horses, and put their shields afore them and drew</a>
<a id='line_8031'>their swords, and either gave other sad strokes, now here, now there,</a>
<a id='line_8032'>rasing, tracing, foining, and hurling like two boars, the space of two</a>
<a id='line_8033'>hours. And then she cried on high to the Red Knight, Alas, thou noble</a>
<a id='line_8034'>Red Knight, think what worship hath followed thee, let never a kitchen</a>
<a id='line_8035'>knave endure thee so long as he doth. Then the Red Knight waxed wroth</a>
<a id='line_8036'>and doubled his strokes, and hurt Beaumains wonderly sore, that the</a>
<a id='line_8037'>blood ran down to the ground, that it was wonder to see that strong</a>
<a id='line_8038'>battle. Yet at the last Sir Beaumains struck him to the earth, and as</a>
<a id='line_8039'>he would have slain the Red Knight, he cried mercy, saying, Noble</a>
<a id='line_8040'>knight, slay me not, and I shall yield me to thee with fifty knights</a>
<a id='line_8041'>with me that be at my commandment. And I forgive thee all the despite</a>
<a id='line_8042'>that thou hast done to me, and the death of my brother the Black</a>
<a id='line_8043'>Knight. All this availeth not, said Beaumains, but if my damosel pray</a>
<a id='line_8044'>me to save thy life. And therewith he made semblant to strike off his</a>
<a id='line_8045'>head. Let be, thou Beaumains, slay him not, for he is a noble knight,</a>
<a id='line_8046'>and not so hardy, upon thine head, but thou save him.</a>
<a id='line_8047'></a>
<a id='line_8048'>Then Beaumains bade the Red Knight, Stand up, and thank the damosel now</a>
<a id='line_8049'>of thy life. Then the Red Knight prayed him to see his castle, and to</a>
<a id='line_8050'>be there all night. So the damosel then granted him, and there they had</a>
<a id='line_8051'>merry cheer. But always the damosel spake many foul words unto</a>
<a id='line_8052'>Beaumains, whereof the Red Knight had great marvel; and all that night</a>
<a id='line_8053'>the Red Knight made three score knights to watch Beaumains, that he</a>
<a id='line_8054'>should have no shame nor villainy. And upon the morn they heard mass</a>
<a id='line_8055'>and dined, and the Red Knight came before Beaumains with his three</a>
<a id='line_8056'>score knights, and there he proffered him his homage and fealty at all</a>
<a id='line_8057'>times, he and his knights to do him service. I thank you, said</a>
<a id='line_8058'>Beaumains, but this ye shall grant me: when I call upon you, to come</a>
<a id='line_8059'>afore my lord King Arthur, and yield you unto him to be his knights.</a>
<a id='line_8060'>Sir, said the Red Knight, I will be ready, and my fellowship, at your</a>
<a id='line_8061'>summons. So Sir Beaumains departed and the damosel, and ever she rode</a>
<a id='line_8062'>chiding him in the foulest manner.</a>
<a id='line_8063'></a>
<a id='line_8064'></a>
<a id='line_8065'></a>
<a id='line_8066'>CHAPTER XI. How Sir Beaumains suffered great rebukes of the damosel,</a>
<a id='line_8067'>and he suffered it patiently.</a>
<a id='line_8068'></a>
<a id='line_8069'>Damosel, said Beaumains, ye are uncourteous so to rebuke me as ye do,</a>
<a id='line_8070'>for meseemeth I have done you good service, and ever ye threaten me I</a>
<a id='line_8071'>shall be beaten with knights that we meet, but ever for all your boast</a>
<a id='line_8072'>they lie in the dust or in the mire, and therefore I pray you rebuke me</a>
<a id='line_8073'>no more; and when ye see me beaten or yielden as recreant, then may ye</a>
<a id='line_8074'>bid me go from you shamefully; but first I let you wit I will not</a>
<a id='line_8075'>depart from you, for I were worse than a fool an I would depart from</a>
<a id='line_8076'>you all the while that I win worship. Well, said she, right soon there</a>
<a id='line_8077'>shall meet a knight shall pay thee all thy wages, for he is the most</a>
<a id='line_8078'>man of worship of the world, except King Arthur. I will well, said</a>
<a id='line_8079'>Beaumains, the more he is of worship, the more shall be my worship to</a>
<a id='line_8080'>have ado with him.</a>
<a id='line_8081'></a>
<a id='line_8082'>Then anon they were ware where was afore them a city rich and fair. And</a>
<a id='line_8083'>betwixt them and the city a mile and an half there was a fair meadow</a>
<a id='line_8084'>that seemed new mown, and therein were many pavilions fair to behold.</a>
<a id='line_8085'>Lo, said the damosel, yonder is a lord that owneth yonder city, and his</a>
<a id='line_8086'>custom is, when the weather is fair, to lie in this meadow to joust and</a>
<a id='line_8087'>tourney. And ever there be about him five hundred knights and gentlemen</a>
<a id='line_8088'>of arms, and there be all manner of games that any gentleman can</a>
<a id='line_8089'>devise. That goodly lord, said Beaumains, would I fain see. Thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_8090'>see him time enough, said the damosel, and so as she rode near she</a>
<a id='line_8091'>espied the pavilion where he was. Lo, said she, seest thou yonder</a>
<a id='line_8092'>pavilion that is all of the colour of Inde, and all manner of thing</a>
<a id='line_8093'>that there is about, men and women, and horses trapped, shields and</a>
<a id='line_8094'>spears were all of the colour of Inde, and his name is Sir Persant of</a>
<a id='line_8095'>Inde, the most lordliest knight that ever thou lookedst on. It may well</a>
<a id='line_8096'>be, said Beaumains, but be he never so stout a knight, in this field I</a>
<a id='line_8097'>shall abide till that I see him under his shield. Ah, fool, said she,</a>
<a id='line_8098'>thou wert better flee betimes. Why, said Beaumains, an he be such a</a>
<a id='line_8099'>knight as ye make him, he will not set upon me with all his men, or</a>
<a id='line_8100'>with his five hundred knights. For an there come no more but one at</a>
<a id='line_8101'>once, I shall him not fail whilst my life lasteth. Fie, fie, said the</a>
<a id='line_8102'>damosel, that ever such a stinking knave should blow such a boast.</a>
<a id='line_8103'>Damosel, he said, ye are to blame so to rebuke me, for I had liefer do</a>
<a id='line_8104'>five battles than so to be rebuked, let him come and then let him do</a>
<a id='line_8105'>his worst.</a>
<a id='line_8106'></a>
<a id='line_8107'>Sir, she said, I marvel what thou art and of what kin thou art come;</a>
<a id='line_8108'>boldly thou speakest, and boldly thou hast done, that have I seen;</a>
<a id='line_8109'>therefore I pray thee save thyself an thou mayest, for thy horse and</a>
<a id='line_8110'>thou have had great travail, and I dread we dwell over long from the</a>
<a id='line_8111'>siege, for it is but hence seven mile, and all perilous passages we are</a>
<a id='line_8112'>passed save all only this passage; and here I dread me sore lest ye</a>
<a id='line_8113'>shall catch some hurt, therefore I would ye were hence, that ye were</a>
<a id='line_8114'>not bruised nor hurt with this strong knight. But I let you wit that</a>
<a id='line_8115'>Sir Persant of Inde is nothing of might nor strength unto the knight</a>
<a id='line_8116'>that laid the siege about my lady. As for that, said Sir Beaumains, be</a>
<a id='line_8117'>it as it be may. For sithen I am come so nigh this knight I will prove</a>
<a id='line_8118'>his might or I depart from him, and else I shall be shamed an I now</a>
<a id='line_8119'>withdraw me from him. And therefore, damosel, have ye no doubt by the</a>
<a id='line_8120'>grace of God I shall so deal with this knight that within two hours</a>
<a id='line_8121'>after noon I shall deliver him. And then shall we come to the siege by</a>
<a id='line_8122'>daylight. O Jesu, marvel have I, said the damosel, what manner a man ye</a>
<a id='line_8123'>be, for it may never be otherwise but that ye be come of a noble blood,</a>
<a id='line_8124'>for so foul nor shamefully did never woman rule a knight as I have done</a>
<a id='line_8125'>you, and ever courteously ye have suffered me, and that came never but</a>
<a id='line_8126'>of a gentle blood.</a>
<a id='line_8127'></a>
<a id='line_8128'>Damosel, said Beaumains, a knight may little do that may not suffer a</a>
<a id='line_8129'>damosel, for whatsomever ye said unto me I took none heed to your</a>
<a id='line_8130'>words, for the more ye said the more ye angered me, and my wrath I</a>
<a id='line_8131'>wreaked upon them that I had ado withal. And therefore all the</a>
<a id='line_8132'>missaying that ye missaid me furthered me in my battle, and caused me</a>
<a id='line_8133'>to think to show and prove myself at the end what I was; for</a>
<a id='line_8134'>peradventure though I had meat in King Arthur’s kitchen, yet I might</a>
<a id='line_8135'>have had meat enough in other places, but all that I did it for to</a>
<a id='line_8136'>prove and assay my friends, and that shall be known another day; and</a>
<a id='line_8137'>whether that I be a gentleman born or none, I let you wit, fair</a>
<a id='line_8138'>damosel, I have done you gentleman’s service, and peradventure better</a>
<a id='line_8139'>service yet will I do or I depart from you. Alas, she said, fair</a>
<a id='line_8140'>Beaumains, forgive me all that I have missaid or done against thee.</a>
<a id='line_8141'>With all my heart, said he, I forgive it you, for ye did nothing but as</a>
<a id='line_8142'>ye should do, for all your evil words pleased me; and damosel, said</a>
<a id='line_8143'>Beaumains, since it liketh you to say thus fair unto me, wit ye well it</a>
<a id='line_8144'>gladdeth my heart greatly, and now meseemeth there is no knight living</a>
<a id='line_8145'>but I am able enough for him.</a>
<a id='line_8146'></a>
<a id='line_8147'></a>
<a id='line_8148'></a>
<a id='line_8149'>CHAPTER XII. How Beaumains fought with Sir Persant of Inde, and made</a>
<a id='line_8150'>him to be yielden.</a>
<a id='line_8151'></a>
<a id='line_8152'>With this Sir Persant of Inde had espied them as they hoved in the</a>
<a id='line_8153'>field, and knightly he sent to them whether he came in war or in peace.</a>
<a id='line_8154'>Say to thy lord, said Beaumains, I take no force, but whether as him</a>
<a id='line_8155'>list himself. So the messenger went again unto Sir Persant and told him</a>
<a id='line_8156'>all his answer. Well then will I have ado with him to the utterance,</a>
<a id='line_8157'>and so he purveyed him and rode against him. And Beaumains saw him and</a>
<a id='line_8158'>made him ready, and there they met with all that ever their horses</a>
<a id='line_8159'>might run, and brast their spears either in three pieces, and their</a>
<a id='line_8160'>horses rushed so together that both their horses fell dead to the</a>
<a id='line_8161'>earth; and lightly they avoided their horses and put their shields</a>
<a id='line_8162'>afore them, and drew their swords, and gave many great strokes that</a>
<a id='line_8163'>sometime they hurtled together that they fell grovelling on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_8164'>Thus they fought two hours and more, that their shields and their</a>
<a id='line_8165'>hauberks were all forhewen, and in many steads they were wounded. So at</a>
<a id='line_8166'>the last Sir Beaumains smote him through the cost of the body, and then</a>
<a id='line_8167'>he retrayed him here and there, and knightly maintained his battle long</a>
<a id='line_8168'>time. And at the last, though him loath were, Beaumains smote Sir</a>
<a id='line_8169'>Persant above upon the helm, that he fell grovelling to the earth; and</a>
<a id='line_8170'>then he leapt upon him overthwart and unlaced his helm to have slain</a>
<a id='line_8171'>him.</a>
<a id='line_8172'></a>
<a id='line_8173'>Then Sir Persant yielded him and asked him mercy. With that came the</a>
<a id='line_8174'>damosel and prayed to save his life. I will well, for it were pity this</a>
<a id='line_8175'>noble knight should die. Gramercy, said Persant, gentle knight and</a>
<a id='line_8176'>damosel. For certainly now I wot well it was ye that slew my brother</a>
<a id='line_8177'>the Black Knight at the black thorn; he was a full noble knight, his</a>
<a id='line_8178'>name was Sir Percard. Also I am sure that ye are he that won mine other</a>
<a id='line_8179'>brother the Green Knight, his name was Sir Pertolepe. Also ye won my</a>
<a id='line_8180'>brother the Red Knight, Sir Perimones. And now since ye have won these,</a>
<a id='line_8181'>this shall I do for to please you: ye shall have homage and fealty of</a>
<a id='line_8182'>me, and an hundred knights to be always at your commandment, to go and</a>
<a id='line_8183'>ride where ye will command us. And so they went unto Sir Persant’s</a>
<a id='line_8184'>pavilion and drank the wine, and ate spices, and afterward Sir Persant</a>
<a id='line_8185'>made him to rest upon a bed until supper time, and after supper to bed</a>
<a id='line_8186'>again. When Beaumains was abed, Sir Persant had a lady, a fair daughter</a>
<a id='line_8187'>of eighteen year of age, and there he called her unto him, and charged</a>
<a id='line_8188'>her and commanded her upon his blessing to go unto the knight’s bed,</a>
<a id='line_8189'>and lie down by his side, and make him no strange cheer, but good</a>
<a id='line_8190'>cheer, and take him in thine arms and kiss him, and look that this be</a>
<a id='line_8191'>done, I charge you, as ye will have my love and my good will. So Sir</a>
<a id='line_8192'>Persant’s daughter did as her father bade her, and so she went unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_8193'>Beaumains’ bed, and privily she dispoiled her, and laid her down by</a>
<a id='line_8194'>him, and then he awoke and saw her, and asked her what she was. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_8195'>she said, I am Sir Persant’s daughter, that by the commandment of my</a>
<a id='line_8196'>father am come hither. Be ye a maid or a wife? said he. Sir, she said,</a>
<a id='line_8197'>I am a clean maiden. God defend, said he, that I should defoil you to</a>
<a id='line_8198'>do Sir Persant such a shame; therefore, fair damosel, arise out of this</a>
<a id='line_8199'>bed or else I will. Sir, she said, I came not to you by mine own will,</a>
<a id='line_8200'>but as I was commanded. Alas, said Sir Beaumains, I were a shameful</a>
<a id='line_8201'>knight an I would do your father any disworship; and so he kissed her,</a>
<a id='line_8202'>and so she departed and came unto Sir Persant her father, and told him</a>
<a id='line_8203'>all how she had sped. Truly, said Sir Persant, whatsomever he be, he is</a>
<a id='line_8204'>come of a noble blood. And so we leave them there till on the morn.</a>
<a id='line_8205'></a>
<a id='line_8206'></a>
<a id='line_8207'></a>
<a id='line_8208'>CHAPTER XIII. Of the goodly communication between Sir Persant and</a>
<a id='line_8209'>Beaumains, and how he told him that his name was Sir Gareth.</a>
<a id='line_8210'></a>
<a id='line_8211'>And so on the morn the damosel and Sir Beaumains heard mass and brake</a>
<a id='line_8212'>their fast, and so took their leave. Fair damosel, said Persant,</a>
<a id='line_8213'>whitherward are ye way-leading this knight? Sir, she said, this knight</a>
<a id='line_8214'>is going to the siege that besiegeth my sister in the Castle Dangerous.</a>
<a id='line_8215'>Ah, ah, said Persant, that is the Knight of the Red Laund, the which is</a>
<a id='line_8216'>the most perilous knight that I know now living, and a man that is</a>
<a id='line_8217'>without mercy, and men say that he hath seven men’s strength. God save</a>
<a id='line_8218'>you, said he to Beaumains, from that knight, for he doth great wrong to</a>
<a id='line_8219'>that lady, and that is great pity, for she is one of the fairest ladies</a>
<a id='line_8220'>of the world, and meseemeth that your damosel is her sister: is not</a>
<a id='line_8221'>your name Linet? said he. Yea, sir, said she, and my lady my sister’s</a>
<a id='line_8222'>name is Dame Lionesse. Now shall I tell you, said Sir Persant, this Red</a>
<a id='line_8223'>Knight of the Red Laund hath lain long at the siege, well-nigh this two</a>
<a id='line_8224'>years, and many times he might have had her an he had would, but he</a>
<a id='line_8225'>prolongeth the time to this intent, for to have Sir Launcelot du Lake</a>
<a id='line_8226'>to do battle with him, or Sir Tristram, or Sir Lamorak de Galis, or Sir</a>
<a id='line_8227'>Gawaine, and this is his tarrying so long at the siege.</a>
<a id='line_8228'></a>
<a id='line_8229'>Now my lord Sir Persant of Inde, said the damosel Linet, I require you</a>
<a id='line_8230'>that ye will make this gentleman knight or ever he fight with the Red</a>
<a id='line_8231'>Knight. I will with all my heart, said Sir Persant, an it please him to</a>
<a id='line_8232'>take the order of knighthood of so simple a man as I am. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_8233'>Beaumains, I thank you for your good will, for I am better sped, for</a>
<a id='line_8234'>certainly the noble knight Sir Launcelot made me knight. Ah, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_8235'>Persant, of a more renowned knight might ye not be made knight; for of</a>
<a id='line_8236'>all knights he may be called chief of knighthood; and so all the world</a>
<a id='line_8237'>saith, that betwixt three knights is departed clearly knighthood, that</a>
<a id='line_8238'>is Launcelot du Lake, Sir Tristram de Liones, and Sir Lamorak de Galis:</a>
<a id='line_8239'>these bear now the renown. There be many other knights, as Sir</a>
<a id='line_8240'>Palamides the Saracen and Sir Safere his brother; also Sir Bleoberis</a>
<a id='line_8241'>and Sir Blamore de Ganis his brother; also Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir</a>
<a id='line_8242'>Ector de Maris and Sir Percivale de Galis; these and many more be noble</a>
<a id='line_8243'>knights, but there be none that pass the three above said; therefore</a>
<a id='line_8244'>God speed you well, said Sir Persant, for an ye may match the Red</a>
<a id='line_8245'>Knight ye shall be called the fourth of the world.</a>
<a id='line_8246'></a>
<a id='line_8247'>Sir, said Beaumains, I would fain be of good fame and of knighthood.</a>
<a id='line_8248'>And I let you wit I came of good men, for I dare say my father was a</a>
<a id='line_8249'>noble man, and so that ye will keep it in close, and this damosel, I</a>
<a id='line_8250'>will tell you of what kin I am. We will not discover you, said they</a>
<a id='line_8251'>both, till ye command us, by the faith we owe unto God. Truly then,</a>
<a id='line_8252'>said he, my name is Gareth of Orkney, and King Lot was my father, and</a>
<a id='line_8253'>my mother is King Arthur’s sister, her name is Dame Morgawse, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_8254'>Gawaine is my brother, and Sir Agravaine and Sir Gaheris, and I am the</a>
<a id='line_8255'>youngest of them all. And yet wot not King Arthur nor Sir Gawaine what</a>
<a id='line_8256'>I am.</a>
<a id='line_8257'></a>
<a id='line_8258'></a>
<a id='line_8259'></a>
<a id='line_8260'>CHAPTER XIV. How the lady that was besieged had word from her sister</a>
<a id='line_8261'>how she had brought a knight to fight for her, and what battles he had</a>
<a id='line_8262'>achieved.</a>
<a id='line_8263'></a>
<a id='line_8264'>So the book saith that the lady that was besieged had word of her</a>
<a id='line_8265'>sister’s coming by the dwarf, and a knight with her, and how he had</a>
<a id='line_8266'>passed all the perilous passages. What manner a man is he? said the</a>
<a id='line_8267'>lady. He is a noble knight, truly, madam, said the dwarf, and but a</a>
<a id='line_8268'>young man, but he is as likely a man as ever ye saw any. What is he?</a>
<a id='line_8269'>said the damosel, and of what kin is he come, and of whom was he made</a>
<a id='line_8270'>knight? Madam, said the dwarf, he is the king’s son of Orkney, but his</a>
<a id='line_8271'>name I will not tell you as at this time; but wit ye well, of Sir</a>
<a id='line_8272'>Launcelot was he made knight, for of none other would he be made</a>
<a id='line_8273'>knight, and Sir Kay named him Beaumains. How escaped he, said the lady,</a>
<a id='line_8274'>from the brethren of Persant? Madam, he said, as a noble knight should.</a>
<a id='line_8275'>First, he slew two brethren at a passage of a water. Ah! said she, they</a>
<a id='line_8276'>were good knights, but they were murderers, the one hight Gherard le</a>
<a id='line_8277'>Breuse, and the other knight hight Sir Arnold le Breuse. Then, madam,</a>
<a id='line_8278'>he recountered with the Black Knight, and slew him in plain battle, and</a>
<a id='line_8279'>so he took his horse and his armour and fought with the Green Knight</a>
<a id='line_8280'>and won him in plain battle, and in like wise he served the Red Knight,</a>
<a id='line_8281'>and after in the same wise he served the Blue Knight and won him in</a>
<a id='line_8282'>plain battle. Then, said the lady, he hath overcome Sir Persant of</a>
<a id='line_8283'>Inde, one of the noblest knights of the world, and the dwarf said, He</a>
<a id='line_8284'>hath won all the four brethren and slain the Black Knight, and yet he</a>
<a id='line_8285'>did more to-fore: he overthrew Sir Kay and left him nigh dead upon the</a>
<a id='line_8286'>ground; also he did a great battle with Sir Launcelot, and there they</a>
<a id='line_8287'>departed on even hands: and then Sir Launcelot made him knight.</a>
<a id='line_8288'></a>
<a id='line_8289'>Dwarf, said the lady, I am glad of these tidings, therefore go thou in</a>
<a id='line_8290'>an hermitage of mine hereby, and there shalt thou bear with thee of my</a>
<a id='line_8291'>wine in two flagons of silver, they are of two gallons, and also two</a>
<a id='line_8292'>cast of bread with fat venison baked, and dainty fowls; and a cup of</a>
<a id='line_8293'>gold here I deliver thee, that is rich and precious; and bear all this</a>
<a id='line_8294'>to mine hermitage, and put it in the hermit’s hands. And sithen go thou</a>
<a id='line_8295'>unto my sister and greet her well, and commend me unto that gentle</a>
<a id='line_8296'>knight, and pray him to eat and to drink and make him strong, and say</a>
<a id='line_8297'>ye him I thank him of his courtesy and goodness, that he would take</a>
<a id='line_8298'>upon him such labour for me that never did him bounty nor courtesy.</a>
<a id='line_8299'>Also pray him that he be of good heart and courage, for he shall meet</a>
<a id='line_8300'>with a full noble knight, but he is neither of bounty, courtesy, nor</a>
<a id='line_8301'>gentleness; for he attendeth unto nothing but to murder, and that is</a>
<a id='line_8302'>the cause I cannot praise him nor love him.</a>
<a id='line_8303'></a>
<a id='line_8304'>So this dwarf departed, and came to Sir Persant, where he found the</a>
<a id='line_8305'>damosel Linet and Sir Beaumains, and there he told them all as ye have</a>
<a id='line_8306'>heard; and then they took their leave, but Sir Persant took an ambling</a>
<a id='line_8307'>hackney and conveyed them on their ways, and then beleft them to God;</a>
<a id='line_8308'>and so within a little while they came to that hermitage, and there</a>
<a id='line_8309'>they drank the wine, and ate the venison and the fowls baken. And so</a>
<a id='line_8310'>when they had repasted them well, the dwarf returned again with his</a>
<a id='line_8311'>vessel unto the castle again; and there met with him the Red Knight of</a>
<a id='line_8312'>the Red Launds, and asked him from whence that he came, and where he</a>
<a id='line_8313'>had been. Sir, said the dwarf, I have been with my lady’s sister of</a>
<a id='line_8314'>this castle, and she hath been at King Arthur’s court, and brought a</a>
<a id='line_8315'>knight with her. Then I account her travail but lost; for though she</a>
<a id='line_8316'>had brought with her Sir Launcelot, Sir Tristram, Sir Lamorak, or Sir</a>
<a id='line_8317'>Gawaine, I would think myself good enough for them all.</a>
<a id='line_8318'></a>
<a id='line_8319'>It may well be, said the dwarf, but this knight hath passed all the</a>
<a id='line_8320'>perilous passages, and slain the Black Knight and other two more, and</a>
<a id='line_8321'>won the Green Knight, the Red Knight, and the Blue Knight. Then is he</a>
<a id='line_8322'>one of these four that I have afore rehearsed. He is none of those,</a>
<a id='line_8323'>said the dwarf, but he is a king’s son. What is his name? said the Red</a>
<a id='line_8324'>Knight of the Red Launds. That will I not tell you, said the dwarf, but</a>
<a id='line_8325'>Sir Kay upon scorn named him Beaumains. I care not, said the knight,</a>
<a id='line_8326'>what knight so ever he be, for I shall soon deliver him. And if I ever</a>
<a id='line_8327'>match him he shall have a shameful death as many other have had. That</a>
<a id='line_8328'>were pity, said the dwarf, and it is marvel that ye make such shameful</a>
<a id='line_8329'>war upon noble knights.</a>
<a id='line_8330'></a>
<a id='line_8331'></a>
<a id='line_8332'></a>
<a id='line_8333'>CHAPTER XV. How the damosel and Beaumains came to the siege; and came</a>
<a id='line_8334'>to a sycamore tree, and there Beaumains blew a horn, and then the</a>
<a id='line_8335'>Knight of the Red Launds came to fight with him.</a>
<a id='line_8336'></a>
<a id='line_8337'>Now leave we the knight and the dwarf, and speak we of Beaumains, that</a>
<a id='line_8338'>all night lay in the hermitage; and upon the morn he and the damosel</a>
<a id='line_8339'>Linet heard their mass and brake their fast. And then they took their</a>
<a id='line_8340'>horses and rode throughout a fair forest; and then they came to a</a>
<a id='line_8341'>plain, and saw where were many pavilions and tents, and a fair castle,</a>
<a id='line_8342'>and there was much smoke and great noise; and when they came near the</a>
<a id='line_8343'>siege Sir Beaumains espied upon great trees, as he rode, how there hung</a>
<a id='line_8344'>full goodly armed knights by the neck, and their shields about their</a>
<a id='line_8345'>necks with their swords, and gilt spurs upon their heels, and so there</a>
<a id='line_8346'>hung nigh a forty knights shamefully with full rich arms.</a>
<a id='line_8347'></a>
<a id='line_8348'>Then Sir Beaumains abated his countenance and said, What meaneth this?</a>
<a id='line_8349'>Fair sir, said the damosel, abate not your cheer for all this sight,</a>
<a id='line_8350'>for ye must courage yourself, or else ye be all shent, for all these</a>
<a id='line_8351'>knights came hither to this siege to rescue my sister Dame Lionesse,</a>
<a id='line_8352'>and when the Red Knight of the Red Launds had overcome them, he put</a>
<a id='line_8353'>them to this shameful death without mercy and pity. And in the same</a>
<a id='line_8354'>wise he will serve you but if you quit you the better.</a>
<a id='line_8355'></a>
<a id='line_8356'>Now Jesu defend me, said Beaumains, from such a villainous death and</a>
<a id='line_8357'>shenship of arms. For rather than I should so be faren withal, I would</a>
<a id='line_8358'>rather be slain manly in plain battle. So were ye better, said the</a>
<a id='line_8359'>damosel; for trust not, in him is no courtesy, but all goeth to the</a>
<a id='line_8360'>death or shameful murder, and that is pity, for he is a full likely</a>
<a id='line_8361'>man, well made of body, and a full noble knight of prowess, and a lord</a>
<a id='line_8362'>of great lands and possessions. Truly, said Beaumains, he may well be a</a>
<a id='line_8363'>good knight, but he useth shameful customs, and it is marvel that he</a>
<a id='line_8364'>endureth so long that none of the noble knights of my lord Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_8365'>have not dealt with him.</a>
<a id='line_8366'></a>
<a id='line_8367'>And then they rode to the dykes, and saw them double dyked with full</a>
<a id='line_8368'>warlike walls; and there were lodged many great lords nigh the walls;</a>
<a id='line_8369'>and there was great noise of minstrelsy; and the sea beat upon the one</a>
<a id='line_8370'>side of the walls, where were many ships and mariners’ noise with “hale</a>
<a id='line_8371'>and how.” And also there was fast by a sycamore tree, and there hung an</a>
<a id='line_8372'>horn, the greatest that ever they saw, of an elephant’s bone; and this</a>
<a id='line_8373'>Knight of the Red Launds had hanged it up there, that if there came any</a>
<a id='line_8374'>errant-knight, he must blow that horn, and then will he make him ready</a>
<a id='line_8375'>and come to him to do battle. But, sir, I pray you, said the damosel</a>
<a id='line_8376'>Linet, blow ye not the horn till it be high noon, for now it is about</a>
<a id='line_8377'>prime, and now increaseth his might, that as men say he hath seven</a>
<a id='line_8378'>men’s strength. Ah, fie for shame, fair damosel, say ye never so more</a>
<a id='line_8379'>to me; for, an he were as good a knight as ever was, I shall never fail</a>
<a id='line_8380'>him in his most might, for either I will win worship worshipfully, or</a>
<a id='line_8381'>die knightly in the field. And therewith he spurred his horse straight</a>
<a id='line_8382'>to the sycamore tree, and blew so the horn eagerly that all the siege</a>
<a id='line_8383'>and the castle rang thereof. And then there leapt out knights out of</a>
<a id='line_8384'>their tents and pavilions, and they within the castle looked over the</a>
<a id='line_8385'>walls and out at windows.</a>
<a id='line_8386'></a>
<a id='line_8387'>Then the Red Knight of the Red Launds armed him hastily, and two barons</a>
<a id='line_8388'>set on his spurs upon his heels, and all was blood red, his armour,</a>
<a id='line_8389'>spear and shield. And an earl buckled his helm upon his head, and then</a>
<a id='line_8390'>they brought him a red spear and a red steed, and so he rode into a</a>
<a id='line_8391'>little vale under the castle, that all that were in the castle and at</a>
<a id='line_8392'>the siege might behold the battle.</a>
<a id='line_8393'></a>
<a id='line_8394'></a>
<a id='line_8395'></a>
<a id='line_8396'>CHAPTER XVI. How the two knights met together, and of their talking,</a>
<a id='line_8397'>and how they began their battle.</a>
<a id='line_8398'></a>
<a id='line_8399'>Sir, said the damosel Linet unto Sir Beaumains, look ye be glad and</a>
<a id='line_8400'>light, for yonder is your deadly enemy, and at yonder window is my</a>
<a id='line_8401'>lady, my sister, Dame Lionesse. Where? said Beaumains. Yonder, said the</a>
<a id='line_8402'>damosel, and pointed with her finger. That is truth, said Beaumains.</a>
<a id='line_8403'>She beseemeth afar the fairest lady that ever I looked upon; and truly,</a>
<a id='line_8404'>he said, I ask no better quarrel than now for to do battle, for truly</a>
<a id='line_8405'>she shall be my lady, and for her I will fight. And ever he looked up</a>
<a id='line_8406'>to the window with glad countenance, and the Lady Lionesse made curtsey</a>
<a id='line_8407'>to him down to the earth, with holding up both their hands.</a>
<a id='line_8408'></a>
<a id='line_8409'>With that the Red Knight of the Red Launds called to Sir Beaumains,</a>
<a id='line_8410'>Leave, sir knight, thy looking, and behold me, I counsel thee; for I</a>
<a id='line_8411'>warn thee well she is my lady, and for her I have done many strong</a>
<a id='line_8412'>battles. If thou have so done, said Beaumains, meseemeth it was but</a>
<a id='line_8413'>waste labour, for she loveth none of thy fellowship, and thou to love</a>
<a id='line_8414'>that loveth not thee is but great folly. For an I understood that she</a>
<a id='line_8415'>were not glad of my coming, I would be advised or I did battle for her.</a>
<a id='line_8416'>But I understand by the besieging of this castle she may forbear thy</a>
<a id='line_8417'>fellowship. And therefore wit thou well, thou Red Knight of the Red</a>
<a id='line_8418'>Launds, I love her, and will rescue her, or else to die. Sayst thou</a>
<a id='line_8419'>that? said the Red Knight, meseemeth thou ought of reason to be ware by</a>
<a id='line_8420'>yonder knights that thou sawest hang upon yonder trees. Fie for shame,</a>
<a id='line_8421'>said Beaumains, that ever thou shouldest say or do so evil, for in that</a>
<a id='line_8422'>thou shamest thyself and knighthood, and thou mayst be sure there will</a>
<a id='line_8423'>no lady love thee that knoweth thy wicked customs. And now thou weenest</a>
<a id='line_8424'>that the sight of these hanged knights should fear me. Nay truly, not</a>
<a id='line_8425'>so; that shameful sight causeth me to have courage and hardiness</a>
<a id='line_8426'>against thee, more than I would have had against thee an thou wert a</a>
<a id='line_8427'>well-ruled knight. Make thee ready, said the Red Knight of the Red</a>
<a id='line_8428'>Launds, and talk no longer with me.</a>
<a id='line_8429'></a>
<a id='line_8430'>Then Sir Beaumains bade the damosel go from him; and then they put</a>
<a id='line_8431'>their spears in their rests, and came together with all their might</a>
<a id='line_8432'>that they had both, and either smote other in midst of their shields</a>
<a id='line_8433'>that the paitrelles, surcingles, and cruppers brast, and fell to the</a>
<a id='line_8434'>earth both, and the reins of their bridles in their hands; and so they</a>
<a id='line_8435'>lay a great while sore astonied, that all that were in the castle and</a>
<a id='line_8436'>in the siege weened their necks had been broken; and then many a</a>
<a id='line_8437'>stranger and other said the strange knight was a big man, and a noble</a>
<a id='line_8438'>jouster, for or now we saw never no knight match the Red Knight of the</a>
<a id='line_8439'>Red Launds: thus they said, both within the castle and without. Then</a>
<a id='line_8440'>lightly they avoided their horses and put their shields afore them, and</a>
<a id='line_8441'>drew their swords and ran together like two fierce lions, and either</a>
<a id='line_8442'>gave other such buffets upon their helms that they reeled backward both</a>
<a id='line_8443'>two strides; and then they recovered both, and hewed great pieces off</a>
<a id='line_8444'>their harness and their shields that a great part fell into the fields.</a>
<a id='line_8445'></a>
<a id='line_8446'></a>
<a id='line_8447'></a>
<a id='line_8448'>CHAPTER XVII. How after long fighting Beaumains overcame the knight and</a>
<a id='line_8449'>would have slain him, but at the request of the lords he saved his</a>
<a id='line_8450'>life, and made him to yield him to the lady.</a>
<a id='line_8451'></a>
<a id='line_8452'>And then thus they fought till it was past noon, and never would stint,</a>
<a id='line_8453'>till at the last they lacked wind both; and then they stood wagging and</a>
<a id='line_8454'>scattering, panting, blowing and bleeding, that all that beheld them</a>
<a id='line_8455'>for the most part wept for pity. So when they had rested them a while</a>
<a id='line_8456'>they yede to battle again, tracing, racing, foining as two boars. And</a>
<a id='line_8457'>at some time they took their run as it had been two rams, and hurtled</a>
<a id='line_8458'>together that sometime they fell grovelling to the earth: and at some</a>
<a id='line_8459'>time they were so amazed that either took other’s sword instead of his</a>
<a id='line_8460'>own.</a>
<a id='line_8461'></a>
<a id='line_8462'>Thus they endured till evensong time, that there was none that beheld</a>
<a id='line_8463'>them might know whether was like to win the battle; and their armour</a>
<a id='line_8464'>was so forhewn that men might see their naked sides; and in other</a>
<a id='line_8465'>places they were naked, but ever the naked places they did defend. And</a>
<a id='line_8466'>the Red Knight was a wily knight of war, and his wily fighting taught</a>
<a id='line_8467'>Sir Beaumains to be wise; but he abought it full sore or he did espy</a>
<a id='line_8468'>his fighting.</a>
<a id='line_8469'></a>
<a id='line_8470'>And thus by assent of them both they granted either other to rest; and</a>
<a id='line_8471'>so they set them down upon two mole-hills there beside the fighting</a>
<a id='line_8472'>place, and either of them unlaced his helm, and took the cold wind; for</a>
<a id='line_8473'>either of their pages was fast by them, to come when they called to</a>
<a id='line_8474'>unlace their harness and to set them on again at their commandment. And</a>
<a id='line_8475'>then when Sir Beaumains’ helm was off, he looked up to the window, and</a>
<a id='line_8476'>there he saw the fair lady Dame Lionesse, and she made him such</a>
<a id='line_8477'>countenance that his heart waxed light and jolly; and therewith he bade</a>
<a id='line_8478'>the Red Knight of the Red Launds make him ready, and let us do the</a>
<a id='line_8479'>battle to the utterance. I will well, said the knight, and then they</a>
<a id='line_8480'>laced up their helms, and their pages avoided, and they stepped</a>
<a id='line_8481'>together and fought freshly; but the Red Knight of the Red Launds</a>
<a id='line_8482'>awaited him, and at an overthwart smote him within the hand, that his</a>
<a id='line_8483'>sword fell out of his hand; and yet he gave him another buffet upon the</a>
<a id='line_8484'>helm that he fell grovelling to the earth, and the Red Knight fell over</a>
<a id='line_8485'>him, for to hold him down.</a>
<a id='line_8486'></a>
<a id='line_8487'>Then cried the maiden Linet on high: O Sir Beaumains, where is thy</a>
<a id='line_8488'>courage become? Alas, my lady my sister beholdeth thee, and she sobbeth</a>
<a id='line_8489'>and weepeth, that maketh mine heart heavy. When Sir Beaumains heard her</a>
<a id='line_8490'>say so, he abraid up with a great might and gat him upon his feet, and</a>
<a id='line_8491'>lightly he leapt to his sword and gripped it in his hand, and doubled</a>
<a id='line_8492'>his pace unto the Red Knight, and there they fought a new battle</a>
<a id='line_8493'>together. But Sir Beaumains then doubled his strokes, and smote so</a>
<a id='line_8494'>thick that he smote the sword out of his hand, and then he smote him</a>
<a id='line_8495'>upon the helm that he fell to the earth, and Sir Beaumains fell upon</a>
<a id='line_8496'>him, and unlaced his helm to have slain him; and then he yielded him</a>
<a id='line_8497'>and asked mercy, and said with a loud voice: O noble knight, I yield me</a>
<a id='line_8498'>to thy mercy.</a>
<a id='line_8499'></a>
<a id='line_8500'>Then Sir Beaumains bethought him upon the knights that he had made to</a>
<a id='line_8501'>be hanged shamefully, and then he said: I may not with my worship save</a>
<a id='line_8502'>thy life, for the shameful deaths that thou hast caused many full good</a>
<a id='line_8503'>knights to die. Sir, said the Red Knight of the Red Launds, hold your</a>
<a id='line_8504'>hand and ye shall know the causes why I put them to so shameful a</a>
<a id='line_8505'>death. Say on, said Sir Beaumains. Sir, I loved once a lady, a fair</a>
<a id='line_8506'>damosel, and she had her brother slain; and she said it was Sir</a>
<a id='line_8507'>Launcelot du Lake, or else Sir Gawaine; and she prayed me as that I</a>
<a id='line_8508'>loved her heartily, that I would make her a promise by the faith of my</a>
<a id='line_8509'>knighthood, for to labour daily in arms unto I met with one of them;</a>
<a id='line_8510'>and all that I might overcome I should put them unto a villainous</a>
<a id='line_8511'>death; and this is the cause that I have put all these knights to</a>
<a id='line_8512'>death, and so I ensured her to do all the villainy unto King Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_8513'>knights, and that I should take vengeance upon all these knights. And,</a>
<a id='line_8514'>sir, now I will thee tell that every day my strength increaseth till</a>
<a id='line_8515'>noon, and all this time have I seven men’s strength.</a>
<a id='line_8516'></a>

<a id='line_8519'>CHAPTER XVIII. How the knight yielded him, and how Beaumains made him</a>
<a id='line_8520'>to go unto King Arthur’s court, and to cry Sir Launcelot mercy.</a>
<a id='line_8521'></a>
<a id='line_8522'>Then came there many earls, and barons, and noble knights, and prayed</a>
<a id='line_8523'>that knight to save his life, and take him to your prisoner. And all</a>
<a id='line_8524'>they fell upon their knees, and prayed him of mercy, and that he would</a>
<a id='line_8525'>save his life; and, Sir, they all said, it were fairer of him to take</a>
<a id='line_8526'>homage and fealty, and let him hold his lands of you than for to slay</a>
<a id='line_8527'>him; by his death ye shall have none advantage, and his misdeeds that</a>
<a id='line_8528'>be done may not be undone; and therefore he shall make amends to all</a>
<a id='line_8529'>parties, and we all will become your men and do you homage and fealty.</a>
<a id='line_8530'>Fair lords, said Beaumains, wit you well I am full loath to slay this</a>
<a id='line_8531'>knight, nevertheless he hath done passing ill and shamefully; but</a>
<a id='line_8532'>insomuch all that he did was at a lady’s request I blame him the less;</a>
<a id='line_8533'>and so for your sake I will release him that he shall have his life</a>
<a id='line_8534'>upon this covenant, that he go within the castle, and yield him there</a>
<a id='line_8535'>to the lady, and if she will forgive and quit him, I will well; with</a>
<a id='line_8536'>this he make her amends of all the trespass he hath done against her</a>
<a id='line_8537'>and her lands. And also, when that is done, that ye go unto the court</a>
<a id='line_8538'>of King Arthur, and there that ye ask Sir Launcelot mercy, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_8539'>Gawaine, for the evil will ye have had against them. Sir, said the Red</a>
<a id='line_8540'>Knight of the Red Launds, all this will I do as ye command, and siker</a>
<a id='line_8541'>assurance and borrows ye shall have. And so then when the assurance was</a>
<a id='line_8542'>made, he made his homage and fealty, and all those earls and barons</a>
<a id='line_8543'>with him.</a>
<a id='line_8544'></a>
<a id='line_8545'>And then the maiden Linet came to Sir Beaumains, and unarmed him and</a>
<a id='line_8546'>searched his wounds, and stinted his blood, and in likewise she did to</a>
<a id='line_8547'>the Red Knight of the Red Launds. And there they sojourned ten days in</a>
<a id='line_8548'>their tents; and the Red Knight made his lords and servants to do all</a>
<a id='line_8549'>the pleasure that they might unto Sir Beaumains. And so within a while</a>
<a id='line_8550'>the Red Knight of the Red Launds yede unto the castle, and put him in</a>
<a id='line_8551'>her grace. And so she received him upon sufficient surety, so all her</a>
<a id='line_8552'>hurts were well restored of all that she could complain. And then he</a>
<a id='line_8553'>departed unto the court of King Arthur, and there openly the Red Knight</a>
<a id='line_8554'>of the Red Launds put him in the mercy of Sir Launcelot and Sir</a>
<a id='line_8555'>Gawaine, and there he told openly how he was overcome and by whom, and</a>
<a id='line_8556'>also he told all the battles from the beginning unto the ending. Jesu</a>
<a id='line_8557'>mercy, said King Arthur and Sir Gawaine, we marvel much of what blood</a>
<a id='line_8558'>he is come, for he is a noble knight. Have ye no marvel, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_8559'>Launcelot, for ye shall right well wit that he is come of a full noble</a>
<a id='line_8560'>blood; and as for his might and hardiness, there be but few now living</a>
<a id='line_8561'>that is so mighty as he is, and so noble of prowess. It seemeth by you,</a>
<a id='line_8562'>said King Arthur, that ye know his name, and from whence he is come,</a>
<a id='line_8563'>and of what blood he is. I suppose I do so, said Launcelot, or else I</a>
<a id='line_8564'>would not have given him the order of knighthood; but he gave me such</a>
<a id='line_8565'>charge at that time that I should never discover him until he required</a>
<a id='line_8566'>me, or else it be known openly by some other.</a>
<a id='line_8567'></a>
<a id='line_8568'></a>
<a id='line_8569'></a>
<a id='line_8570'>CHAPTER XIX. How Beaumains came to the lady, and when he came to the</a>
<a id='line_8571'>castle the gates were closed against him, and of the words that the</a>
<a id='line_8572'>lady said to him.</a>
<a id='line_8573'></a>
<a id='line_8574'>Now turn we unto Sir Beaumains that desired of Linet that he might see</a>
<a id='line_8575'>her sister, his lady. Sir, she said, I would fain ye saw her. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_8576'>Beaumains all armed him, and took his horse and his spear, and rode</a>
<a id='line_8577'>straight unto the castle. And when he came to the gate he found there</a>
<a id='line_8578'>many men armed, and pulled up the drawbridge and drew the port close.</a>
<a id='line_8579'></a>
<a id='line_8580'>Then marvelled he why they would not suffer him to enter. And then he</a>
<a id='line_8581'>looked up to the window; and there he saw the fair Lionesse that said</a>
<a id='line_8582'>on high: Go thy way, Sir Beaumains, for as yet thou shalt not have</a>
<a id='line_8583'>wholly my love, unto the time that thou be called one of the number of</a>
<a id='line_8584'>the worthy knights. And therefore go labour in worship this</a>
<a id='line_8585'>twelvemonth, and then thou shalt hear new tidings. Alas, fair lady,</a>
<a id='line_8586'>said Beaumains, I have not deserved that ye should show me this</a>
<a id='line_8587'>strangeness, and I had weened that I should have right good cheer with</a>
<a id='line_8588'>you, and unto my power I have deserved thank, and well I am sure I have</a>
<a id='line_8589'>bought your love with part of the best blood within my body. Fair</a>
<a id='line_8590'>courteous knight, said Dame Lionesse, be not displeased nor over-hasty;</a>
<a id='line_8591'>for wit you well your great travail nor good love shall not be lost,</a>
<a id='line_8592'>for I consider your great travail and labour, your bounty and your</a>
<a id='line_8593'>goodness as me ought to do. And therefore go on your way, and look that</a>
<a id='line_8594'>ye be of good comfort, for all shall be for your worship and for the</a>
<a id='line_8595'>best, and perdy a twelvemonth will soon be done, and trust me, fair</a>
<a id='line_8596'>knight, I shall be true to you, and never to betray you, but to my</a>
<a id='line_8597'>death I shall love you and none other. And therewithal she turned her</a>
<a id='line_8598'>from the window, and Sir Beaumains rode awayward from the castle,</a>
<a id='line_8599'>making great dole, and so he rode here and there and wist not where he</a>
<a id='line_8600'>rode, till it was dark night. And then it happened him to come to a</a>
<a id='line_8601'>poor man’s house, and there he was harboured all that night.</a>
<a id='line_8602'></a>
<a id='line_8603'>But Sir Beaumains had no rest, but wallowed and writhed for the love of</a>
<a id='line_8604'>the lady of the castle. And so upon the morrow he took his horse and</a>
<a id='line_8605'>rode until underne, and then he came to a broad water, and thereby was</a>
<a id='line_8606'>a great lodge, and there he alighted to sleep and laid his head upon</a>
<a id='line_8607'>the shield, and betook his horse to the dwarf, and commanded him to</a>
<a id='line_8608'>watch all night.</a>
<a id='line_8609'></a>
<a id='line_8610'>Now turn we to the lady of the same castle, that thought much upon</a>
<a id='line_8611'>Beaumains, and then she called unto her Sir Gringamore her brother, and</a>
<a id='line_8612'>prayed him in all manner, as he loved her heartily, that he would ride</a>
<a id='line_8613'>after Sir Beaumains: And ever have ye wait upon him till ye may find</a>
<a id='line_8614'>him sleeping, for I am sure in his heaviness he will alight down in</a>
<a id='line_8615'>some place, and lie him down to sleep; and therefore have ye your wait</a>
<a id='line_8616'>upon him, and in the priviest manner ye can, take his dwarf, and go ye</a>
<a id='line_8617'>your way with him as fast as ever ye may or Sir Beaumains awake. For my</a>
<a id='line_8618'>sister Linet telleth me that he can tell of what kindred he is come,</a>
<a id='line_8619'>and what is his right name. And the meanwhile I and my sister will ride</a>
<a id='line_8620'>unto your castle to await when ye bring with you the dwarf. And then</a>
<a id='line_8621'>when ye have brought him unto your castle, I will have him in</a>
<a id='line_8622'>examination myself. Unto the time that I know what is his right name,</a>
<a id='line_8623'>and of what kindred he is come, shall I never be merry at my heart.</a>
<a id='line_8624'>Sister, said Sir Gringamore, all this shall be done after your intent.</a>
<a id='line_8625'></a>
<a id='line_8626'>And so he rode all the other day and the night till that he found Sir</a>
<a id='line_8627'>Beaumains lying by a water, and his head upon his shield, for to sleep.</a>
<a id='line_8628'>And then when he saw Sir Beaumains fast asleep, he came stilly stalking</a>
<a id='line_8629'>behind the dwarf, and plucked him fast under his arm, and so he rode</a>
<a id='line_8630'>away with him as fast as ever he might unto his own castle. And this</a>
<a id='line_8631'>Sir Gringamore’s arms were all black, and that to him longeth. But ever</a>
<a id='line_8632'>as he rode with the dwarf toward his castle, he cried unto his lord and</a>
<a id='line_8633'>prayed him of help. And therewith awoke Sir Beaumains, and up he leapt</a>
<a id='line_8634'>lightly, and saw where Sir Gringamore rode his way with the dwarf, and</a>
<a id='line_8635'>so Sir Gringamore rode out of his sight.</a>
<a id='line_8636'></a>
<a id='line_8637'></a>
<a id='line_8638'></a>
<a id='line_8639'>CHAPTER XX. How Sir Beaumains rode after to rescue his dwarf, and came</a>
<a id='line_8640'>into the castle where he was.</a>
<a id='line_8641'></a>
<a id='line_8642'>Then Sir Beaumains put on his helm anon, and buckled his shield, and</a>
<a id='line_8643'>took his horse, and rode after him all that ever he might ride through</a>
<a id='line_8644'>marshes, and fields, and great dales, that many times his horse and he</a>
<a id='line_8645'>plunged over the head in deep mires, for he knew not the way, but took</a>
<a id='line_8646'>the gainest way in that woodness, that many times he was like to</a>
<a id='line_8647'>perish. And at the last him happened to come to a fair green way, and</a>
<a id='line_8648'>there he met with a poor man of the country, whom he saluted and asked</a>
<a id='line_8649'>him whether he met not with a knight upon a black horse and all black</a>
<a id='line_8650'>harness, a little dwarf sitting behind him with heavy cheer. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_8651'>the poor man, here by me came Sir Gringamore the knight, with such a</a>
<a id='line_8652'>dwarf mourning as ye say; and therefore I rede you not follow him, for</a>
<a id='line_8653'>he is one of the periloust knights of the world, and his castle is here</a>
<a id='line_8654'>nigh hand but two mile; therefore we advise you ride not after Sir</a>
<a id='line_8655'>Gringamore, but if ye owe him good will.</a>
<a id='line_8656'></a>
<a id='line_8657'>So leave we Sir Beaumains riding toward the castle, and speak we of Sir</a>
<a id='line_8658'>Gringamore and the dwarf. Anon as the dwarf was come to the castle,</a>
<a id='line_8659'>Dame Lionesse and Dame Linet her sister, asked the dwarf where was his</a>
<a id='line_8660'>master born, and of what lineage he was come. And but if thou tell me,</a>
<a id='line_8661'>said Dame Lionesse, thou shalt never escape this castle, but ever here</a>
<a id='line_8662'>to be prisoner. As for that, said the dwarf, I fear not greatly to tell</a>
<a id='line_8663'>his name and of what kin he is come. Wit you well he is a king’s son,</a>
<a id='line_8664'>and his mother is sister to King Arthur, and he is brother to the good</a>
<a id='line_8665'>knight Sir Gawaine, and his name is Sir Gareth of Orkney. And now I</a>
<a id='line_8666'>have told you his right name, I pray you, fair lady, let me go to my</a>
<a id='line_8667'>lord again, for he will never out of this country until that he have me</a>
<a id='line_8668'>again. And if he be angry he will do much harm or that he be stint, and</a>
<a id='line_8669'>work you wrack in this country. As for that threatening, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_8670'>Gringamore, be it as it be may, we will go to dinner. And so they</a>
<a id='line_8671'>washed and went to meat, and made them merry and well at ease, and</a>
<a id='line_8672'>because the Lady Lionesse of the castle was there, they made great joy.</a>
<a id='line_8673'>Truly, madam, said Linet unto her sister, well may he be a king’s son,</a>
<a id='line_8674'>for he hath many good tatches on him, for he is courteous and mild, and</a>
<a id='line_8675'>the most suffering man that ever I met withal. For I dare say there was</a>
<a id='line_8676'>never gentlewoman reviled man in so foul a manner as I have rebuked</a>
<a id='line_8677'>him; and at all times he gave me goodly and meek answers again.</a>
<a id='line_8678'></a>
<a id='line_8679'>And as they sat thus talking, there came Sir Gareth in at the gate with</a>
<a id='line_8680'>an angry countenance, and his sword drawn in his hand, and cried aloud</a>
<a id='line_8681'>that all the castle might hear it, saying: Thou traitor, Sir</a>
<a id='line_8682'>Gringamore, deliver me my dwarf again, or by the faith that I owe to</a>
<a id='line_8683'>the order of knighthood, I shall do thee all the harm that I can. Then</a>
<a id='line_8684'>Sir Gringamore looked out at a window and said, Sir Gareth of Orkney,</a>
<a id='line_8685'>leave thy boasting words, for thou gettest not thy dwarf again. Thou</a>
<a id='line_8686'>coward knight, said Sir Gareth, bring him with thee, and come and do</a>
<a id='line_8687'>battle with me, and win him and take him. So will I do, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_8688'>Gringamore, an me list, but for all thy great words thou gettest him</a>
<a id='line_8689'>not. Ah! fair brother, said Dame Lionesse, I would he had his dwarf</a>
<a id='line_8690'>again, for I would he were not wroth, for now he hath told me all my</a>
<a id='line_8691'>desire I keep no more of the dwarf. And also, brother, he hath done</a>
<a id='line_8692'>much for me, and delivered me from the Red Knight of the Red Launds,</a>
<a id='line_8693'>and therefore, brother, I owe him my service afore all knights living.</a>
<a id='line_8694'>And wit ye well that I love him before all other, and full fain I would</a>
<a id='line_8695'>speak with him. But in nowise I would that he wist what I were, but</a>
<a id='line_8696'>that I were another strange lady.</a>
<a id='line_8697'></a>
<a id='line_8698'>Well, said Sir Gringamore, sithen I know now your will, I will obey now</a>
<a id='line_8699'>unto him. And right therewithal he went down unto Sir Gareth, and said:</a>
<a id='line_8700'>Sir, I cry you mercy, and all that I have misdone I will amend it at</a>
<a id='line_8701'>your will. And therefore I pray you that ye would alight, and take such</a>
<a id='line_8702'>cheer as I can make you in this castle. Shall I have my dwarf? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_8703'>Gareth. Yea, sir, and all the pleasaunce that I can make you, for as</a>
<a id='line_8704'>soon as your dwarf told me what ye were and of what blood ye are come,</a>
<a id='line_8705'>and what noble deeds ye have done in these marches, then I repented of</a>
<a id='line_8706'>my deeds. And then Sir Gareth alighted, and there came his dwarf and</a>
<a id='line_8707'>took his horse. O my fellow, said Sir Gareth, I have had many</a>
<a id='line_8708'>adventures for thy sake. And so Sir Gringamore took him by the hand and</a>
<a id='line_8709'>led him into the hall where his own wife was.</a>
<a id='line_8710'></a>
<a id='line_8711'></a>
<a id='line_8712'></a>
<a id='line_8713'>CHAPTER XXI. How Sir Gareth, otherwise called Beaumains, came to the</a>
<a id='line_8714'>presence of his lady, and how they took acquaintance, and of their</a>
<a id='line_8715'>love.</a>
<a id='line_8716'></a>
<a id='line_8717'>And then came forth Dame Lionesse arrayed like a princess, and there</a>
<a id='line_8718'>she made him passing good cheer, and he her again; and they had goodly</a>
<a id='line_8719'>language and lovely countenance together. And Sir Gareth thought many</a>
<a id='line_8720'>times, Jesu, would that the lady of the Castle Perilous were so fair as</a>
<a id='line_8721'>she was. There were all manner of games and plays, of dancing and</a>
<a id='line_8722'>singing. And ever the more Sir Gareth beheld that lady, the more he</a>
<a id='line_8723'>loved her; and so he burned in love that he was past himself in his</a>
<a id='line_8724'>reason; and forth toward night they yede unto supper, and Sir Gareth</a>
<a id='line_8725'>might not eat, for his love was so hot that he wist not where he was.</a>
<a id='line_8726'></a>
<a id='line_8727'>All these looks espied Sir Gringamore, and then at-after supper he</a>
<a id='line_8728'>called his sister Dame Lionesse into a chamber, and said: Fair sister,</a>
<a id='line_8729'>I have well espied your countenance betwixt you and this knight, and I</a>
<a id='line_8730'>will, sister, that ye wit he is a full noble knight, and if ye can make</a>
<a id='line_8731'>him to abide here I will do him all the pleasure that I can, for an ye</a>
<a id='line_8732'>were better than ye are, ye were well bywaryd upon him. Fair brother,</a>
<a id='line_8733'>said Dame Lionesse, I understand well that the knight is good, and come</a>
<a id='line_8734'>he is of a noble house. Notwithstanding, I will assay him better,</a>
<a id='line_8735'>howbeit I am most beholden to him of any earthly man; for he hath had</a>
<a id='line_8736'>great labour for my love, and passed many a dangerous passage.</a>
<a id='line_8737'></a>
<a id='line_8738'>Right so Sir Gringamore went unto Sir Gareth, and said, Sir, make ye</a>
<a id='line_8739'>good cheer, for ye shall have none other cause, for this lady, my</a>
<a id='line_8740'>sister, is yours at all times, her worship saved, for wit ye well she</a>
<a id='line_8741'>loveth you as well as ye do her, and better if better may be. An I wist</a>
<a id='line_8742'>that, said Sir Gareth, there lived not a gladder man than I would be.</a>
<a id='line_8743'>Upon my worship, said Sir Gringamore, trust unto my promise; and as</a>
<a id='line_8744'>long as it liketh you ye shall sojourn with me, and this lady shall be</a>
<a id='line_8745'>with us daily and nightly to make you all the cheer that she can. I</a>
<a id='line_8746'>will well, said Sir Gareth, for I have promised to be nigh this country</a>
<a id='line_8747'>this twelvemonth. And well I am sure King Arthur and other noble</a>
<a id='line_8748'>knights will find me where that I am within this twelvemonth. For I</a>
<a id='line_8749'>shall be sought and found, if that I be alive. And then the noble</a>
<a id='line_8750'>knight Sir Gareth went unto the Dame Lionesse, which he then much</a>
<a id='line_8751'>loved, and kissed her many times, and either made great joy of other.</a>
<a id='line_8752'>And there she promised him her love certainly, to love him and none</a>
<a id='line_8753'>other the days of her life. Then this lady, Dame Lionesse, by the</a>
<a id='line_8754'>assent of her brother, told Sir Gareth all the truth what she was, and</a>
<a id='line_8755'>how she was the same lady that he did battle for, and how she was lady</a>
<a id='line_8756'>of the Castle Perilous, and there she told him how she caused her</a>
<a id='line_8757'>brother to take away his dwarf.</a>
<a id='line_8758'></a>
<a id='line_8759'></a>
<a id='line_8760'></a>
<a id='line_8761'>CHAPTER XXII. How at night came an armed knight, and fought with Sir</a>
<a id='line_8762'>Gareth, and he, sore hurt in the thigh, smote off the knight’s head.</a>
<a id='line_8763'></a>
<a id='line_8764'>For this cause, to know the certainty what was your name, and of what</a>
<a id='line_8765'>kin ye were come.</a>
<a id='line_8766'></a>
<a id='line_8767'>And then she let fetch to-fore him Linet, the damosel that had ridden</a>
<a id='line_8768'>with him many wildsome ways. Then was Sir Gareth more gladder than he</a>
<a id='line_8769'>was to-fore. And then they troth-plight each other to love, and never</a>
<a id='line_8770'>to fail whiles their life lasteth. And so they burnt both in love, that</a>
<a id='line_8771'>they were accorded to abate their lusts secretly. And there Dame</a>
<a id='line_8772'>Lionesse counselled Sir Gareth to sleep in none other place but in the</a>
<a id='line_8773'>hall. And there she promised him to come to his bed a little afore</a>
<a id='line_8774'>midnight.</a>
<a id='line_8775'></a>
<a id='line_8776'>This counsel was not so privily kept but it was understood; for they</a>
<a id='line_8777'>were but young both, and tender of age, and had not used none such</a>
<a id='line_8778'>crafts to-fore. Wherefore the damosel Linet was a little displeased,</a>
<a id='line_8779'>and she thought her sister Dame Lionesse was a little over-hasty, that</a>
<a id='line_8780'>she might not abide the time of her marriage; and for saving their</a>
<a id='line_8781'>worship, she thought to abate their hot lusts. And so she let ordain by</a>
<a id='line_8782'>her subtle crafts that they had not their intents neither with other,</a>
<a id='line_8783'>as in their delights, until they were married. And so it passed on.</a>
<a id='line_8784'>At-after supper was made clean avoidance, that every lord and lady</a>
<a id='line_8785'>should go unto his rest. But Sir Gareth said plainly he would go no</a>
<a id='line_8786'>farther than the hall, for in such places, he said, was convenient for</a>
<a id='line_8787'>an errant-knight to take his rest in; and so there were ordained great</a>
<a id='line_8788'>couches, and thereon feather beds, and there laid him down to sleep;</a>
<a id='line_8789'>and within a while came Dame Lionesse, wrapped in a mantle furred with</a>
<a id='line_8790'>ermine, and laid her down beside Sir Gareth. And therewithal he began</a>
<a id='line_8791'>to kiss her. And then he looked afore him, and there he apperceived and</a>
<a id='line_8792'>saw come an armed knight, with many lights about him; and this knight</a>
<a id='line_8793'>had a long gisarm in his hand, and made grim countenance to smite him.</a>
<a id='line_8794'>When Sir Gareth saw him come in that wise, he leapt out of his bed, and</a>
<a id='line_8795'>gat in his hand his sword, and leapt straight toward that knight. And</a>
<a id='line_8796'>when the knight saw Sir Gareth come so fiercely upon him, he smote him</a>
<a id='line_8797'>with a foin through the thick of the thigh that the wound was a</a>
<a id='line_8798'>shaftmon broad and had cut a-two many veins and sinews. And therewithal</a>
<a id='line_8799'>Sir Gareth smote him upon the helm such a buffet that he fell</a>
<a id='line_8800'>grovelling; and then he leapt over him and unlaced his helm, and smote</a>
<a id='line_8801'>off his head from the body. And then he bled so fast that he might not</a>
<a id='line_8802'>stand, but so he laid him down upon his bed, and there he swooned and</a>
<a id='line_8803'>lay as he had been dead.</a>
<a id='line_8804'></a>
<a id='line_8805'>Then Dame Lionesse cried aloud, that her brother Sir Gringamore heard,</a>
<a id='line_8806'>and came down. And when he saw Sir Gareth so shamefully wounded he was</a>
<a id='line_8807'>sore displeased, and said: I am shamed that this noble knight is thus</a>
<a id='line_8808'>honoured. Sir, said Sir Gringamore, how may this be, that ye be here,</a>
<a id='line_8809'>and this noble knight wounded? Brother, she said, I can not tell you,</a>
<a id='line_8810'>for it was not done by me, nor by mine assent. For he is my lord and I</a>
<a id='line_8811'>am his, and he must be mine husband; therefore, my brother, I will that</a>
<a id='line_8812'>ye wit I shame me not to be with him, nor to do him all the pleasure</a>
<a id='line_8813'>that I can. Sister, said Sir Gringamore, and I will that ye wit it, and</a>
<a id='line_8814'>Sir Gareth both, that it was never done by me, nor by my assent that</a>
<a id='line_8815'>this unhappy deed was done. And there they staunched his bleeding as</a>
<a id='line_8816'>well as they might, and great sorrow made Sir Gringamore and Dame</a>
<a id='line_8817'>Lionesse.</a>
<a id='line_8818'></a>
<a id='line_8819'>And forthwithal came Dame Linet, and took up the head in the sight of</a>
<a id='line_8820'>them all, and anointed it with an ointment thereas it was smitten off;</a>
<a id='line_8821'>and in the same wise she did to the other part thereas the head stuck,</a>
<a id='line_8822'>and then she set it together, and it stuck as fast as ever it did. And</a>
<a id='line_8823'>the knight arose lightly up, and the damosel Linet put him in her</a>
<a id='line_8824'>chamber. All this saw Sir Gringamore and Dame Lionesse, and so did Sir</a>
<a id='line_8825'>Gareth; and well he espied that it was the damosel Linet, that rode</a>
<a id='line_8826'>with him through the perilous passages. Ah well, damosel, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_8827'>Gareth, I weened ye would not have done as ye have done. My lord</a>
<a id='line_8828'>Gareth, said Linet, all that I have done I will avow, and all that I</a>
<a id='line_8829'>have done shall be for your honour and worship, and to us all. And so</a>
<a id='line_8830'>within a while Sir Gareth was nigh whole, and waxed light and jocund,</a>
<a id='line_8831'>and sang, danced, and gamed; and he and Dame Lionesse were so hot in</a>
<a id='line_8832'>burning love that they made their covenant at the tenth night after,</a>
<a id='line_8833'>that she should come to his bed. And because he was wounded afore, he</a>
<a id='line_8834'>laid his armour and his sword nigh his bed’s side.</a>
<a id='line_8835'></a>
<a id='line_8836'></a>
<a id='line_8837'></a>
<a id='line_8838'>CHAPTER XXIII. How the said knight came again the next night and was</a>
<a id='line_8839'>beheaded again, and how at the feast of Pentecost all the knights that</a>
<a id='line_8840'>Sir Gareth had overcome came and yielded them to King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_8841'></a>
<a id='line_8842'>Right as she promised she came; and she was not so soon in his bed but</a>
<a id='line_8843'>she espied an armed knight coming toward the bed: therewithal she</a>
<a id='line_8844'>warned Sir Gareth, and lightly through the good help of Dame Lionesse</a>
<a id='line_8845'>he was armed; and they hurtled together with great ire and malice all</a>
<a id='line_8846'>about the hall; and there was great light as it had been the number of</a>
<a id='line_8847'>twenty torches both before and behind, so that Sir Gareth strained him,</a>
<a id='line_8848'>so that his old wound brast again a-bleeding; but he was hot and</a>
<a id='line_8849'>courageous and took no keep, but with his great force he struck down</a>
<a id='line_8850'>that knight, and voided his helm, and struck off his head. Then he</a>
<a id='line_8851'>hewed the head in an hundred pieces. And when he had done so he took up</a>
<a id='line_8852'>all those pieces, and threw them out at a window into the ditches of</a>
<a id='line_8853'>the castle; and by this done he was so faint that unnethes he might</a>
<a id='line_8854'>stand for bleeding. And by when he was almost unarmed he fell in a</a>
<a id='line_8855'>deadly swoon on the floor; and then Dame Lionesse cried so that Sir</a>
<a id='line_8856'>Gringamore heard; and when he came and found Sir Gareth in that plight</a>
<a id='line_8857'>he made great sorrow; and there he awaked Sir Gareth, and gave him a</a>
<a id='line_8858'>drink that relieved him wonderly well; but the sorrow that Dame</a>
<a id='line_8859'>Lionesse made there may no tongue tell, for she so fared with herself</a>
<a id='line_8860'>as she would have died.</a>
<a id='line_8861'></a>
<a id='line_8862'>Right so came this damosel Linet before them all, and she had fetched</a>
<a id='line_8863'>all the gobbets of the head that Sir Gareth had thrown out at a window,</a>
<a id='line_8864'>and there she anointed them as she had done to-fore, and set them</a>
<a id='line_8865'>together again. Well, damosel Linet, said Sir Gareth, I have not</a>
<a id='line_8866'>deserved all this despite that ye do unto me. Sir knight, she said, I</a>
<a id='line_8867'>have nothing done but I will avow, and all that I have done shall be to</a>
<a id='line_8868'>your worship, and to us all. And then was Sir Gareth staunched of his</a>
<a id='line_8869'>bleeding. But the leeches said that there was no man that bare the life</a>
<a id='line_8870'>should heal him throughout of his wound but if they healed him that</a>
<a id='line_8871'>caused that stroke by enchantment.</a>
<a id='line_8872'></a>
<a id='line_8873'>So leave we Sir Gareth there with Sir Gringamore and his sisters, and</a>
<a id='line_8874'>turn we unto King Arthur, that at the next feast of Pentecost held his</a>
<a id='line_8875'>feast; and there came the Green Knight with fifty knights, and yielded</a>
<a id='line_8876'>them all unto King Arthur. And so there came the Red Knight his</a>
<a id='line_8877'>brother, and yielded him to King Arthur, and three score knights with</a>
<a id='line_8878'>him. Also there came the Blue Knight, brother to them, with an hundred</a>
<a id='line_8879'>knights, and yielded them unto King Arthur; and the Green Knight’s name</a>
<a id='line_8880'>was Pertolepe, and the Red Knight’s name was Perimones, and the Blue</a>
<a id='line_8881'>Knight’s name was Sir Persant of Inde. These three brethren told King</a>
<a id='line_8882'>Arthur how they were overcome by a knight that a damosel had with her,</a>
<a id='line_8883'>and called him Beaumains. Jesu, said the king, I marvel what knight he</a>
<a id='line_8884'>is, and of what lineage he is come. He was with me a twelvemonth, and</a>
<a id='line_8885'>poorly and shamefully he was fostered, and Sir Kay in scorn named him</a>
<a id='line_8886'>Beaumains. So right as the king stood so talking with these three</a>
<a id='line_8887'>brethren, there came Sir Launcelot du Lake, and told the king that</a>
<a id='line_8888'>there was come a goodly lord with six hundred knights with him.</a>
<a id='line_8889'></a>
<a id='line_8890'>Then the king went out of Carlion, for there was the feast, and there</a>
<a id='line_8891'>came to him this lord, and saluted the king in a goodly manner. What</a>
<a id='line_8892'>will ye, said King Arthur, and what is your errand? Sir, he said, my</a>
<a id='line_8893'>name is the Red Knight of the Red Launds, but my name is Sir Ironside;</a>
<a id='line_8894'>and sir, wit ye well, here I am sent to you of a knight that is called</a>
<a id='line_8895'>Beaumains, for he won me in plain battle hand for hand, and so did</a>
<a id='line_8896'>never no knight but he, that ever had the better of me this thirty</a>
<a id='line_8897'>winter; the which commanded to yield me to you at your will. Ye are</a>
<a id='line_8898'>welcome, said the king, for ye have been long a great foe to me and my</a>
<a id='line_8899'>court, and now I trust to God I shall so entreat you that ye shall be</a>
<a id='line_8900'>my friend. Sir, both I and these five hundred knights shall always be</a>
<a id='line_8901'>at your summons to do you service as may lie in our powers. Jesu mercy,</a>
<a id='line_8902'>said King Arthur, I am much beholden unto that knight that hath put so</a>
<a id='line_8903'>his body in devoir to worship me and my court. And as to thee,</a>
<a id='line_8904'>Ironside, that art called the Red Knight of the Red Launds, thou art</a>
<a id='line_8905'>called a perilous knight; and if thou wilt hold of me I shall worship</a>
<a id='line_8906'>thee and make thee knight of the Table Round; but then thou must be no</a>
<a id='line_8907'>more a murderer. Sir, as to that, I have promised unto Sir Beaumains</a>
<a id='line_8908'>never more to use such customs, for all the shameful customs that I</a>
<a id='line_8909'>used I did at the request of a lady that I loved; and therefore I must</a>
<a id='line_8910'>go unto Sir Launcelot, and unto Sir Gawaine, and ask them forgiveness</a>
<a id='line_8911'>of the evil will I had unto them; for all that I put to death was all</a>
<a id='line_8912'>only for the love of Sir Launcelot and of Sir Gawaine. They be here</a>
<a id='line_8913'>now, said the king, afore thee, now may ye say to them what ye will.</a>
<a id='line_8914'>And then he kneeled down unto Sir Launcelot, and to Sir Gawaine, and</a>
<a id='line_8915'>prayed them of forgiveness of his enmity that ever he had against them.</a>
<a id='line_8916'></a>
<a id='line_8917'></a>
<a id='line_8918'></a>
<a id='line_8919'>CHAPTER XXIV. How King Arthur pardoned them, and demanded of them where</a>
<a id='line_8920'>Sir Gareth was.</a>
<a id='line_8921'></a>
<a id='line_8922'>Then goodly they said all at once, God forgive you, and we do, and pray</a>
<a id='line_8923'>you that ye will tell us where we may find Sir Beaumains. Fair lords,</a>
<a id='line_8924'>said Sir Ironside, I cannot tell you, for it is full hard to find him;</a>
<a id='line_8925'>for such young knights as he is one, when they be in their adventures</a>
<a id='line_8926'>be never abiding in no place. But to say the worship that the Red</a>
<a id='line_8927'>Knight of the Red Launds, and Sir Persant and his brother said of</a>
<a id='line_8928'>Beaumains, it was marvel to hear. Well, my fair lords, said King</a>
<a id='line_8929'>Arthur, wit you well I shall do you honour for the love of Sir</a>
<a id='line_8930'>Beaumains, and as soon as ever I meet with him I shall make you all</a>
<a id='line_8931'>upon one day knights of the Table Round. And as to thee, Sir Persant of</a>
<a id='line_8932'>Inde, thou hast been ever called a full noble knight, and so have ever</a>
<a id='line_8933'>been thy three brethren called. But I marvel, said the king, that I</a>
<a id='line_8934'>hear not of the Black Knight your brother, he was a full noble knight.</a>
<a id='line_8935'>Sir, said Pertolepe, the Green Knight, Sir Beaumains slew him in a</a>
<a id='line_8936'>recounter with his spear, his name was Sir Percard. That was great</a>
<a id='line_8937'>pity, said the king, and so said many knights. For these four brethren</a>
<a id='line_8938'>were full well known in the court of King Arthur for noble knights, for</a>
<a id='line_8939'>long time they had holden war against the knights of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_8940'>Then said Pertolepe, the Green Knight, to the king: At a passage of the</a>
<a id='line_8941'>water of Mortaise there encountered Sir Beaumains with two brethren</a>
<a id='line_8942'>that ever for the most part kept that passage, and they were two deadly</a>
<a id='line_8943'>knights, and there he slew the eldest brother in the water, and smote</a>
<a id='line_8944'>him upon the head such a buffet that he fell down in the water, and</a>
<a id='line_8945'>there he was drowned, and his name was Sir Gherard le Breusse; and</a>
<a id='line_8946'>after he slew the other brother upon the land, his name was Sir Arnold</a>
<a id='line_8947'>le Breusse.</a>
<a id='line_8948'></a>
<a id='line_8949'></a>
<a id='line_8950'></a>
<a id='line_8951'>CHAPTER XXV. How the Queen of Orkney came to this feast of Pentecost,</a>
<a id='line_8952'>and Sir Gawaine and his brethren came to ask her blessing.</a>
<a id='line_8953'></a>
<a id='line_8954'>So then the king and they went to meat, and were served in the best</a>
<a id='line_8955'>manner. And as they sat at the meat, there came in the Queen of Orkney,</a>
<a id='line_8956'>with ladies and knights a great number. And then Sir Gawaine, Sir</a>
<a id='line_8957'>Agravaine, and Gaheris arose, and went to her and saluted her upon</a>
<a id='line_8958'>their knees, and asked her blessing; for in fifteen year they had not</a>
<a id='line_8959'>seen her. Then she spake on high to her brother King Arthur: Where have</a>
<a id='line_8960'>ye done my young son Sir Gareth? He was here amongst you a twelvemonth,</a>
<a id='line_8961'>and ye made a kitchen knave of him, the which is shame to you all.</a>
<a id='line_8962'>Alas, where have ye done my dear son that was my joy and bliss? O dear</a>
<a id='line_8963'>mother, said Sir Gawaine, I knew him not. Nor I, said the king, that</a>
<a id='line_8964'>now me repenteth, but thanked be God he is proved a worshipful knight</a>
<a id='line_8965'>as any is now living of his years, and I shall never be glad till I may</a>
<a id='line_8966'>find him.</a>
<a id='line_8967'></a>
<a id='line_8968'>Ah, brother, said the Queen unto King Arthur, and unto Sir Gawaine, and</a>
<a id='line_8969'>to all her sons, ye did yourself great shame when ye amongst you kept</a>
<a id='line_8970'>my son in the kitchen and fed him like a poor hog. Fair sister, said</a>
<a id='line_8971'>King Arthur, ye shall right well wit I knew him not, nor no more did</a>
<a id='line_8972'>Sir Gawaine, nor his brethren; but sithen it is so, said the king, that</a>
<a id='line_8973'>he is thus gone from us all, we must shape a remedy to find him. Also,</a>
<a id='line_8974'>sister, meseemeth ye might have done me to wit of his coming, and then</a>
<a id='line_8975'>an I had not done well to him ye might have blamed me. For when he came</a>
<a id='line_8976'>to this court he came leaning upon two men’s shoulders, as though he</a>
<a id='line_8977'>might not have gone. And then he asked me three gifts; and one he asked</a>
<a id='line_8978'>the same day, that was that I would give him meat enough that</a>
<a id='line_8979'>twelvemonth; and the other two gifts he asked that day a twelvemonth,</a>
<a id='line_8980'>and that was that he might have the adventure of the damosel Linet, and</a>
<a id='line_8981'>the third was that Sir Launcelot should make him knight when he desired</a>
<a id='line_8982'>him. And so I granted him all his desire, and many in this court</a>
<a id='line_8983'>marvelled that he desired his sustenance for a twelvemonth. And</a>
<a id='line_8984'>thereby, we deemed, many of us, that he was not come of a noble house.</a>
<a id='line_8985'></a>
<a id='line_8986'>Sir, said the Queen of Orkney unto King Arthur her brother, wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_8987'>that I sent him unto you right well armed and horsed, and worshipfully</a>
<a id='line_8988'>beseen of his body, and gold and silver plenty to spend. It may be,</a>
<a id='line_8989'>said the King, but thereof saw we none, save that same day as he</a>
<a id='line_8990'>departed from us, knights told me that there came a dwarf hither</a>
<a id='line_8991'>suddenly, and brought him armour and a good horse full well and richly</a>
<a id='line_8992'>beseen; and thereat we all had marvel from whence that riches came,</a>
<a id='line_8993'>that we deemed all that he was come of men of worship. Brother, said</a>
<a id='line_8994'>the queen, all that ye say I believe, for ever sithen he was grown he</a>
<a id='line_8995'>was marvellously witted, and ever he was faithful and true of his</a>
<a id='line_8996'>promise. But I marvel, said she, that Sir Kay did mock him and scorn</a>
<a id='line_8997'>him, and gave him that name Beaumains; yet, Sir Kay, said the queen,</a>
<a id='line_8998'>named him more righteously than he weened; for I dare say an he be</a>
<a id='line_8999'>alive, he is as fair an handed man and well disposed as any is living.</a>
<a id='line_9000'>Sir, said Arthur, let this language be still, and by the grace of God</a>
<a id='line_9001'>he shall be found an he be within this seven realms, and let all this</a>
<a id='line_9002'>pass and be merry, for he is proved to be a man of worship, and that is</a>
<a id='line_9003'>my joy.</a>
<a id='line_9004'></a>
<a id='line_9005'></a>
<a id='line_9006'></a>
<a id='line_9007'>CHAPTER XXVI. How King Arthur sent for the Lady Lionesse, and how she</a>
<a id='line_9008'>let cry a tourney at her castle, whereas came many knights.</a>
<a id='line_9009'></a>
<a id='line_9010'>Then said Sir Gawaine and his brethren unto Arthur, Sir, an ye will</a>
<a id='line_9011'>give us leave, we will go and seek our brother. Nay, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_9012'>Launcelot, that shall ye not need; and so said Sir Baudwin of Britain:</a>
<a id='line_9013'>for as by our advice the king shall send unto Dame Lionesse a</a>
<a id='line_9014'>messenger, and pray her that she will come to the court in all the</a>
<a id='line_9015'>haste that she may, and doubt ye not she will come; and then she may</a>
<a id='line_9016'>give you best counsel where ye shall find him. This is well said of</a>
<a id='line_9017'>you, said the king. So then goodly letters were made, and the messenger</a>
<a id='line_9018'>sent forth, that night and day he went till he came unto the Castle</a>
<a id='line_9019'>Perilous. And then the lady Dame Lionesse was sent for, thereas she was</a>
<a id='line_9020'>with Sir Gringamore her brother and Sir Gareth. And when she understood</a>
<a id='line_9021'>this message, she bade him ride on his way unto King Arthur, and she</a>
<a id='line_9022'>would come after in all goodly haste. Then when she came to Sir</a>
<a id='line_9023'>Gringamore and to Sir Gareth, she told them all how King Arthur had</a>
<a id='line_9024'>sent for her. That is because of me, said Sir Gareth. Now advise me,</a>
<a id='line_9025'>said Dame Lionesse, what shall I say, and in what manner I shall rule</a>
<a id='line_9026'>me. My lady and my love, said Sir Gareth, I pray you in no wise be ye</a>
<a id='line_9027'>aknowen where I am; but well I wot my mother is there and all my</a>
<a id='line_9028'>brethren, and they will take upon them to seek me, I wot well that they</a>
<a id='line_9029'>do. But this, madam, I would ye said and advised the king when he</a>
<a id='line_9030'>questioned with you of me. Then may ye say, this is your advice that,</a>
<a id='line_9031'>an it like his good grace, ye will do make a cry against the feast of</a>
<a id='line_9032'>the Assumption of our Lady, that what knight there proveth him best he</a>
<a id='line_9033'>shall wield you and all your land. And if so be that he be a wedded</a>
<a id='line_9034'>man, that his wife shall have the degree, and a coronal of gold beset</a>
<a id='line_9035'>with stones of virtue to the value of a thousand pound, and a white</a>
<a id='line_9036'>gerfalcon.</a>
<a id='line_9037'></a>
<a id='line_9038'>So Dame Lionesse departed and came to King Arthur, where she was nobly</a>
<a id='line_9039'>received, and there she was sore questioned of the king and of the</a>
<a id='line_9040'>Queen of Orkney. And she answered, where Sir Gareth was she could not</a>
<a id='line_9041'>tell. But thus much she said unto Arthur: Sir, I will let cry a</a>
<a id='line_9042'>tournament that shall be done before my castle at the Assumption of our</a>
<a id='line_9043'>Lady, and the cry shall be this: that you, my lord Arthur, shall be</a>
<a id='line_9044'>there, and your knights, and I will purvey that my knights shall be</a>
<a id='line_9045'>against yours; and then I am sure ye shall hear of Sir Gareth. This is</a>
<a id='line_9046'>well advised, said King Arthur; and so she departed. And the king and</a>
<a id='line_9047'>she made great provision to that tournament.</a>
<a id='line_9048'></a>
<a id='line_9049'>When Dame Lionesse was come to the Isle of Avilion, that was the same</a>
<a id='line_9050'>isle thereas her brother Sir Gringamore dwelt, then she told them all</a>
<a id='line_9051'>how she had done, and what promise she had made to King Arthur. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_9052'>said Sir Gareth, I have been so wounded with unhappiness sithen I came</a>
<a id='line_9053'>into this castle that I shall not be able to do at that tournament like</a>
<a id='line_9054'>a knight; for I was never thoroughly whole since I was hurt. Be ye of</a>
<a id='line_9055'>good cheer, said the damosel Linet, for I undertake within these</a>
<a id='line_9056'>fifteen days to make ye whole, and as lusty as ever ye were. And then</a>
<a id='line_9057'>she laid an ointment and a salve to him as it pleased to her, that he</a>
<a id='line_9058'>was never so fresh nor so lusty. Then said the damosel Linet: Send you</a>
<a id='line_9059'>unto Sir Persant of Inde, and assummon him and his knights to be here</a>
<a id='line_9060'>with you as they have promised. Also, that ye send unto Sir Ironside,</a>
<a id='line_9061'>that is the Red Knight of the Red Launds, and charge him that he be</a>
<a id='line_9062'>ready with you with his whole sum of knights, and then shall ye be able</a>
<a id='line_9063'>to match with King Arthur and his knights. So this was done, and all</a>
<a id='line_9064'>knights were sent for unto the Castle Perilous; and then the Red Knight</a>
<a id='line_9065'>answered and said unto Dame Lionesse, and to Sir Gareth, Madam, and my</a>
<a id='line_9066'>lord Sir Gareth, ye shall understand that I have been at the court of</a>
<a id='line_9067'>King Arthur, and Sir Persant of Inde and his brethren, and there we</a>
<a id='line_9068'>have done our homage as ye commanded us. Also Sir Ironside said, I have</a>
<a id='line_9069'>taken upon me with Sir Persant of Inde and his brethren to hold part</a>
<a id='line_9070'>against my lord Sir Launcelot and the knights of that court. And this</a>
<a id='line_9071'>have I done for the love of my lady Dame Lionesse, and you my lord Sir</a>
<a id='line_9072'>Gareth. Ye have well done, said Sir Gareth; but wit you well ye shall</a>
<a id='line_9073'>be full sore matched with the most noble knights of the world;</a>
<a id='line_9074'>therefore we must purvey us of good knights, where we may get them.</a>
<a id='line_9075'>That is well said, said Sir Persant, and worshipfully.</a>
<a id='line_9076'></a>
<a id='line_9077'>And so the cry was made in England, Wales, and Scotland, Ireland,</a>
<a id='line_9078'>Cornwall, and in all the Out Isles, and in Brittany and in many</a>
<a id='line_9079'>countries; that at the feast of our Lady the Assumption next coming,</a>
<a id='line_9080'>men should come to the Castle Perilous beside the Isle of Avilion; and</a>
<a id='line_9081'>there all the knights that there came should have the choice whether</a>
<a id='line_9082'>them list to be on the one party with the knights of the castle, or on</a>
<a id='line_9083'>the other party with King Arthur. And two months was to the day that</a>
<a id='line_9084'>the tournament should be. And so there came many good knights that were</a>
<a id='line_9085'>at their large, and held them for the most part against King Arthur and</a>
<a id='line_9086'>his knights of the Round Table and came in the side of them of the</a>
<a id='line_9087'>castle. For Sir Epinogrus was the first, and he was the king’s son of</a>
<a id='line_9088'>Northumberland, and Sir Palamides the Saracen was another, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9089'>Safere his brother, and Sir Segwarides his brother, but they were</a>
<a id='line_9090'>christened, and Sir Malegrine another, and Sir Brian de les Isles, a</a>
<a id='line_9091'>noble knight, and Sir Grummore Grummursum, a good knight of Scotland,</a>
<a id='line_9092'>and Sir Carados of the dolorous tower, a noble knight, and Sir Turquine</a>
<a id='line_9093'>his brother, and Sir Arnold and Sir Gauter, two brethren, good knights</a>
<a id='line_9094'>of Cornwall. There came Sir Tristram de Liones, and with him Sir Dinas,</a>
<a id='line_9095'>the Seneschal, and Sir Sadok; but this Sir Tristram was not at that</a>
<a id='line_9096'>time knight of the Table Round, but he was one of the best knights of</a>
<a id='line_9097'>the world. And so all these noble knights accompanied them with the</a>
<a id='line_9098'>lady of the castle, and with the Red Knight of the Red Launds; but as</a>
<a id='line_9099'>for Sir Gareth, he would not take upon him more but as other mean</a>
<a id='line_9100'>knights.</a>
<a id='line_9101'></a>
<a id='line_9102'></a>
<a id='line_9103'></a>
<a id='line_9104'>CHAPTER XXVII. How King Arthur went to the tournament with his knights,</a>
<a id='line_9105'>and how the lady received him worshipfully, and how the knights</a>
<a id='line_9106'>encountered.</a>
<a id='line_9107'></a>
<a id='line_9108'>And then there came with King Arthur Sir Gawaine, Agravaine, Gaheris,</a>
<a id='line_9109'>his brethren. And then his nephews Sir Uwaine le Blanchemains, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9110'>Aglovale, Sir Tor, Sir Percivale de Galis, and Sir Lamorak de Galis.</a>
<a id='line_9111'>Then came Sir Launcelot du Lake with his brethren, nephews, and</a>
<a id='line_9112'>cousins, as Sir Lionel, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Bors de Ganis, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9113'>Galihodin, Sir Galihud, and many more of Sir Launcelot’s blood, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9114'>Dinadan, Sir La Cote Male Taile, his brother, a good knight, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9115'>Sagramore, a good knight; and all the most part of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_9116'>Also there came with King Arthur these knights, the King of Ireland,</a>
<a id='line_9117'>King Agwisance, and the King of Scotland, King Carados and King Uriens</a>
<a id='line_9118'>of the land of Gore, and King Bagdemagus and his son Sir Meliaganus,</a>
<a id='line_9119'>and Sir Galahault the noble prince. All these kings, princes, and</a>
<a id='line_9120'>earls, barons, and other noble knights, as Sir Brandiles, Sir Uwaine</a>
<a id='line_9121'>les Avoutres, and Sir Kay, Sir Bedivere, Sir Meliot de Logres, Sir</a>
<a id='line_9122'>Petipase of Winchelsea, Sir Godelake: all these came with King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_9123'>and more that cannot be rehearsed.</a>
<a id='line_9124'></a>
<a id='line_9125'>Now leave we of these kings and knights, and let us speak of the great</a>
<a id='line_9126'>array that was made within the castle and about the castle for both</a>
<a id='line_9127'>parties. The Lady Dame Lionesse ordained great array upon her part for</a>
<a id='line_9128'>her noble knights, for all manner of lodging and victual that came by</a>
<a id='line_9129'>land and by water, that there lacked nothing for her party, nor for the</a>
<a id='line_9130'>other, but there was plenty to be had for gold and silver for King</a>
<a id='line_9131'>Arthur and his knights. And then there came the harbingers from King</a>
<a id='line_9132'>Arthur for to harbour him, and his kings, dukes, earls, barons, and</a>
<a id='line_9133'>knights. And then Sir Gareth prayed Dame Lionesse and the Red Knight of</a>
<a id='line_9134'>the Red Launds, and Sir Persant and his brother, and Sir Gringamore,</a>
<a id='line_9135'>that in no wise there should none of them tell not his name, and make</a>
<a id='line_9136'>no more of him than of the least knight that there was, For, he said, I</a>
<a id='line_9137'>will not be known of neither more nor less, neither at the beginning</a>
<a id='line_9138'>neither at the ending. Then Dame Lionesse said unto Sir Gareth: Sir, I</a>
<a id='line_9139'>will lend you a ring, but I would pray you as you love me heartily let</a>
<a id='line_9140'>me have it again when the tournament is done, for that ring increaseth</a>
<a id='line_9141'>my beauty much more than it is of himself. And the virtue of my ring is</a>
<a id='line_9142'>that, that is green it will turn to red, and that is red it will turn</a>
<a id='line_9143'>in likeness to green, and that is blue it will turn to likeness of</a>
<a id='line_9144'>white, and that is white it will turn in likeness to blue, and so it</a>
<a id='line_9145'>will do of all manner of colours. Also who that beareth my ring shall</a>
<a id='line_9146'>lose no blood, and for great love I will give you this ring. Gramercy,</a>
<a id='line_9147'>said Sir Gareth, mine own lady, for this ring is passing meet for me,</a>
<a id='line_9148'>for it will turn all manner of likeness that I am in, and that shall</a>
<a id='line_9149'>cause me that I shall not be known. Then Sir Gringamore gave Sir Gareth</a>
<a id='line_9150'>a bay courser that was a passing good horse; also he gave him good</a>
<a id='line_9151'>armour and sure, and a noble sword that sometime Sir Gringamore’s</a>
<a id='line_9152'>father won upon an heathen tyrant. And so thus every knight made him</a>
<a id='line_9153'>ready to that tournament. And King Arthur was come two days to-fore the</a>
<a id='line_9154'>Assumption of our Lady. And there was all manner of royalty of all</a>
<a id='line_9155'>minstrelsy that might be found. Also there came Queen Guenever and the</a>
<a id='line_9156'>Queen of Orkney, Sir Gareth’s mother.</a>
<a id='line_9157'></a>
<a id='line_9158'>And upon the Assumption Day, when mass and matins were done, there were</a>
<a id='line_9159'>heralds with trumpets commanded to blow to the field. And so there came</a>
<a id='line_9160'>out Sir Epinogrus, the king’s son of Northumberland, from the castle,</a>
<a id='line_9161'>and there encountered with him Sir Sagramore le Desirous, and either of</a>
<a id='line_9162'>them brake their spears to their hands. And then came in Sir Palamides</a>
<a id='line_9163'>out of the castle, and there encountered with him Gawaine, and either</a>
<a id='line_9164'>of them smote other so hard that both the good knights and their horses</a>
<a id='line_9165'>fell to the earth. And then knights of either party rescued their</a>
<a id='line_9166'>knights. And then came in Sir Safere and Sir Segwarides, brethren to</a>
<a id='line_9167'>Sir Palamides; and there encountered Sir Agravaine with Sir Safere and</a>
<a id='line_9168'>Sir Gaheris encountered with Sir Segwarides. So Sir Safere smote down</a>
<a id='line_9169'>Agravaine, Sir Gawaine’s brother; and Sir Segwarides, Sir Safere’s</a>
<a id='line_9170'>brother. And Sir Malegrine, a knight of the castle, encountered with</a>
<a id='line_9171'>Sir Uwaine le Blanchemains, and there Sir Uwaine gave Sir Malegrine a</a>
<a id='line_9172'>fall, that he had almost broke his neck.</a>
<a id='line_9173'></a>
<a id='line_9174'></a>
<a id='line_9175'></a>
<a id='line_9176'>CHAPTER XXVIII. How the knights bare them in the battle.</a>
<a id='line_9177'></a>
<a id='line_9178'>Then Sir Brian de les Isles and Grummore Grummursum, knights of the</a>
<a id='line_9179'>castle, encountered with Sir Aglovale, and Sir Tor smote down Sir</a>
<a id='line_9180'>Grummore Grummursum to the earth. Then came in Sir Carados of the</a>
<a id='line_9181'>dolorous tower, and Sir Turquine, knights of the castle; and there</a>
<a id='line_9182'>encountered with them Sir Percivale de Galis and Sir Lamorak de Galis,</a>
<a id='line_9183'>that were two brethren. And there encountered Sir Percivale with Sir</a>
<a id='line_9184'>Carados, and either brake their spears unto their hands, and then Sir</a>
<a id='line_9185'>Turquine with Sir Lamorak, and either of them smote down other’s horse</a>
<a id='line_9186'>and all to the earth, and either parties rescued other, and horsed them</a>
<a id='line_9187'>again. And Sir Arnold and Sir Gauter, knights of the castle,</a>
<a id='line_9188'>encountered with Sir Brandiles and Sir Kay, and these four knights</a>
<a id='line_9189'>encountered mightily, and brake their spears to their hands. Then came</a>
<a id='line_9190'>in Sir Tristram, Sir Sadok, and Sir Dinas, knights of the castle, and</a>
<a id='line_9191'>there encountered Sir Tristram with Sir Bedivere, and there Sir</a>
<a id='line_9192'>Bedivere was smitten to the earth both horse and man. And Sir Sadok</a>
<a id='line_9193'>encountered with Sir Petipase, and there Sir Sadok was overthrown. And</a>
<a id='line_9194'>there Uwaine les Avoutres smote down Sir Dinas, the Seneschal. Then</a>
<a id='line_9195'>came in Sir Persant of Inde, a knight of the castle, and there</a>
<a id='line_9196'>encountered with him Sir Launcelot du Lake, and there he smote Sir</a>
<a id='line_9197'>Persant, horse and man, to the earth. Then came Sir Pertolepe from the</a>
<a id='line_9198'>castle, and there encountered with him Sir Lionel, and there Sir</a>
<a id='line_9199'>Pertolepe, the Green Knight, smote down Sir Lionel, brother to Sir</a>
<a id='line_9200'>Launcelot. All this was marked by noble heralds, who bare him best, and</a>
<a id='line_9201'>their names.</a>
<a id='line_9202'></a>
<a id='line_9203'>And then came into the field Sir Perimones, the Red Knight, Sir</a>
<a id='line_9204'>Persant’s brother, that was a knight of the castle, and he encountered</a>
<a id='line_9205'>with Sir Ector de Maris, and either smote other so hard that both their</a>
<a id='line_9206'>horses and they fell to the earth. And then came in the Red Knight of</a>
<a id='line_9207'>the Red Launds, and Sir Gareth, from the castle, and there encountered</a>
<a id='line_9208'>with them Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir Bleoberis, and there the Red Knight</a>
<a id='line_9209'>and Sir Bors [either] smote other so hard that their spears brast, and</a>
<a id='line_9210'>their horses fell grovelling to the earth. Then Sir Bleoberis brake his</a>
<a id='line_9211'>spear upon Sir Gareth, but of that stroke Sir Bleoberis fell to the</a>
<a id='line_9212'>earth. When Sir Galihodin saw that he bade Sir Gareth keep him, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9213'>Gareth smote him to the earth. Then Sir Galihud gat a spear to avenge</a>
<a id='line_9214'>his brother, and in the same wise Sir Gareth served him, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9215'>Dinadan and his brother, La Cote Male Taile, and Sir Sagramore le</a>
<a id='line_9216'>Desirous, and Sir Dodinas le Savage. All these he bare down with one</a>
<a id='line_9217'>spear.</a>
<a id='line_9218'></a>
<a id='line_9219'>When King Agwisance of Ireland saw Sir Gareth fare so, he marvelled</a>
<a id='line_9220'>what he might be that one time seemed green, and another time, at his</a>
<a id='line_9221'>again coming, he seemed blue. And thus at every course that he rode to</a>
<a id='line_9222'>and fro he changed his colour, so that there might neither king nor</a>
<a id='line_9223'>knight have ready cognisance of him. Then Sir Agwisance, the King of</a>
<a id='line_9224'>Ireland, encountered with Sir Gareth, and there Sir Gareth smote him</a>
<a id='line_9225'>from his horse, saddle and all. And then came King Carados of Scotland,</a>
<a id='line_9226'>and Sir Gareth smote him down horse and man. And in the same wise he</a>
<a id='line_9227'>served King Uriens of the land of Gore. And then came in Sir</a>
<a id='line_9228'>Bagdemagus, and Sir Gareth smote him down, horse and man, to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_9229'>And Bagdemagus’ son, Meliganus, brake a spear upon Sir Gareth mightily</a>
<a id='line_9230'>and knightly. And then Sir Galahault, the noble prince, cried on high:</a>
<a id='line_9231'>Knight with the many colours, well hast thou jousted; now make thee</a>
<a id='line_9232'>ready that I may joust with thee. Sir Gareth heard him, and he gat a</a>
<a id='line_9233'>great spear, and so they encountered together, and there the prince</a>
<a id='line_9234'>brake his spear; but Sir Gareth smote him upon the left side of the</a>
<a id='line_9235'>helm that he reeled here and there, and he had fallen down had not his</a>
<a id='line_9236'>men recovered him.</a>
<a id='line_9237'></a>
<a id='line_9238'>So God me help, said King Arthur, that same knight with the many</a>
<a id='line_9239'>colours is a good knight. Wherefore the king called unto him Sir</a>
<a id='line_9240'>Launcelot, and prayed him to encounter with that knight. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_9241'>Launcelot, I may well find in my heart for to forbear him as at this</a>
<a id='line_9242'>time, for he hath had travail enough this day; and when a good knight</a>
<a id='line_9243'>doth so well upon some day, it is no good knight’s part to let him of</a>
<a id='line_9244'>his worship, and namely, when he seeth a knight hath done so great</a>
<a id='line_9245'>labour; for peradventure, said Sir Launcelot, his quarrel is here this</a>
<a id='line_9246'>day, and peradventure he is best beloved with this lady of all that be</a>
<a id='line_9247'>here; for I see well he paineth him and enforceth him to do great</a>
<a id='line_9248'>deeds, and therefore, said Sir Launcelot, as for me, this day he shall</a>
<a id='line_9249'>have the honour; though it lay in my power to put him from it I would</a>
<a id='line_9250'>not.</a>
<a id='line_9251'></a>
<a id='line_9252'></a>
<a id='line_9253'></a>
<a id='line_9254'>CHAPTER XXIX. Yet of the said tournament.</a>
<a id='line_9255'></a>
<a id='line_9256'>Then when this was done there was drawing of swords, and then there</a>
<a id='line_9257'>began a sore tournament. And there did Sir Lamorak marvellous deeds of</a>
<a id='line_9258'>arms; and betwixt Sir Lamorak and Sir Ironside, that was the Red Knight</a>
<a id='line_9259'>of the Red Launds, there was strong battle; and betwixt Sir Palamides</a>
<a id='line_9260'>and Bleoberis there was a strong battle; and Sir Gawaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9261'>Tristram met, and there Sir Gawaine had the worse, for he pulled Sir</a>
<a id='line_9262'>Gawaine from his horse, and there he was long upon foot, and defouled.</a>
<a id='line_9263'>Then came in Sir Launcelot, and he smote Sir Turquine, and he him; and</a>
<a id='line_9264'>then came Sir Carados his brother, and both at once they assailed him,</a>
<a id='line_9265'>and he as the most noblest knight of the world worshipfully fought with</a>
<a id='line_9266'>them both, that all men wondered of the noblesse of Sir Launcelot. And</a>
<a id='line_9267'>then came in Sir Gareth, and knew that it was Sir Launcelot that fought</a>
<a id='line_9268'>with the two perilous knights. And then Sir Gareth came with his good</a>
<a id='line_9269'>horse and hurtled them in-sunder, and no stroke would he smite to Sir</a>
<a id='line_9270'>Launcelot. That espied Sir Launcelot, and deemed it should be the good</a>
<a id='line_9271'>knight Sir Gareth: and then Sir Gareth rode here and there, and smote</a>
<a id='line_9272'>on the right hand and on the left hand, and all the folk might well</a>
<a id='line_9273'>espy where that he rode. And by fortune he met with his brother Sir</a>
<a id='line_9274'>Gawaine, and there he put Sir Gawaine to the worse, for he put off his</a>
<a id='line_9275'>helm, and so he served five or six knights of the Round Table, that all</a>
<a id='line_9276'>men said he put him in the most pain, and best he did his devoir. For</a>
<a id='line_9277'>when Sir Tristram beheld him how he first jousted and after fought so</a>
<a id='line_9278'>well with a sword, then he rode unto Sir Ironside and to Sir Persant of</a>
<a id='line_9279'>Inde, and asked them, by their faith, What manner a knight is yonder</a>
<a id='line_9280'>knight that seemeth in so many divers colours? Truly, meseemeth, said</a>
<a id='line_9281'>Tristram, that he putteth himself in great pain, for he never ceaseth.</a>
<a id='line_9282'>Wot ye not what he is? said Sir Ironside. No, said Sir Tristram. Then</a>
<a id='line_9283'>shall ye know that this is he that loveth the lady of the castle, and</a>
<a id='line_9284'>she him again; and this is he that won me when I besieged the lady of</a>
<a id='line_9285'>this castle, and this is he that won Sir Persant of Inde, and his three</a>
<a id='line_9286'>brethren. What is his name, said Sir Tristram, and of what blood is he</a>
<a id='line_9287'>come? He was called in the court of King Arthur, Beaumains, but his</a>
<a id='line_9288'>right name is Sir Gareth of Orkney, brother to Sir Gawaine. By my head,</a>
<a id='line_9289'>said Sir Tristram, he is a good knight, and a big man of arms, and if</a>
<a id='line_9290'>he be young he shall prove a full noble knight. He is but a child, they</a>
<a id='line_9291'>all said, and of Sir Launcelot he was made knight. Therefore he is</a>
<a id='line_9292'>mickle the better, said Tristram. And then Sir Tristram, Sir Ironside,</a>
<a id='line_9293'>Sir Persant, and his brother, rode together for to help Sir Gareth; and</a>
<a id='line_9294'>then there were given many strong strokes.</a>
<a id='line_9295'></a>
<a id='line_9296'>And then Sir Gareth rode out on the one side to amend his helm; and</a>
<a id='line_9297'>then said his dwarf: Take me your ring, that ye lose it not while that</a>
<a id='line_9298'>ye drink. And so when he had drunk he gat on his helm, and eagerly took</a>
<a id='line_9299'>his horse and rode into the field, and left his ring with his dwarf;</a>
<a id='line_9300'>and the dwarf was glad the ring was from him, for then he wist well he</a>
<a id='line_9301'>should be known. And then when Sir Gareth was in the field all folks</a>
<a id='line_9302'>saw him well and plainly that he was in yellow colours; and there he</a>
<a id='line_9303'>rased off helms and pulled down knights, that King Arthur had marvel</a>
<a id='line_9304'>what knight he was, for the king saw by his hair that it was the same</a>
<a id='line_9305'>knight.</a>
<a id='line_9306'></a>
<a id='line_9307'></a>
<a id='line_9308'></a>
<a id='line_9309'>CHAPTER XXX. How Sir Gareth was espied by the heralds, and how he</a>
<a id='line_9310'>escaped out of the field.</a>
<a id='line_9311'></a>
<a id='line_9312'>But before he was in so many colours, and now he is but in one colour;</a>
<a id='line_9313'>that is yellow. Now go, said King Arthur unto divers heralds, and ride</a>
<a id='line_9314'>about him, and espy what manner knight he is, for I have spered of many</a>
<a id='line_9315'>knights this day that be upon his party, and all say they know him not.</a>
<a id='line_9316'></a>
<a id='line_9317'>And so an herald rode nigh Gareth as he could; and there he saw written</a>
<a id='line_9318'>about his helm in gold, This helm is Sir Gareth of Orkney.</a>
<a id='line_9319'></a>
<a id='line_9320'>Then the herald cried as he were wood, and many heralds with him:—This</a>
<a id='line_9321'>is Sir Gareth of Orkney in the yellow arms; that by all kings and</a>
<a id='line_9322'>knights of Arthur’s beheld him and awaited; and then they pressed all</a>
<a id='line_9323'>to behold him, and ever the heralds cried: This is Sir Gareth of</a>
<a id='line_9324'>Orkney, King Lot’s son.</a>
<a id='line_9325'></a>
<a id='line_9326'>And when Sir Gareth espied that he was discovered, then he doubled his</a>
<a id='line_9327'>strokes, and smote down Sir Sagramore, and his brother Sir Gawaine.</a>
<a id='line_9328'></a>
<a id='line_9329'>O brother, said Sir Gawaine, I weened ye would not have stricken me.</a>
<a id='line_9330'></a>
<a id='line_9331'>So when he heard him say so he thrang here and there, and so with great</a>
<a id='line_9332'>pain he gat out of the press, and there he met with his dwarf. O boy,</a>
<a id='line_9333'>said Sir Gareth, thou hast beguiled me foul this day that thou kept my</a>
<a id='line_9334'>ring; give it me anon again, that I may hide my body withal; and so he</a>
<a id='line_9335'>took it him. And then they all wist not where he was become; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9336'>Gawaine had in manner espied where Sir Gareth rode, and then he rode</a>
<a id='line_9337'>after with all his might. That espied Sir Gareth, and rode lightly into</a>
<a id='line_9338'>the forest, that Sir Gawaine wist not where he was become. And when Sir</a>
<a id='line_9339'>Gareth wist that Sir Gawaine was passed, he asked the dwarf of best</a>
<a id='line_9340'>counsel. Sir, said the dwarf, meseemeth it were best, now that ye are</a>
<a id='line_9341'>escaped from spying, that ye send my lady Dame Lionesse her ring. It is</a>
<a id='line_9342'>well advised, said Sir Gareth; now have it here and bear it to her, and</a>
<a id='line_9343'>say that I recommend me unto her good grace, and say her I will come</a>
<a id='line_9344'>when I may, and I pray her to be true and faithful to me as I will be</a>
<a id='line_9345'>to her. Sir, said the dwarf, it shall be done as ye command: and so he</a>
<a id='line_9346'>rode his way, and did his errand unto the lady. Then she said, Where is</a>
<a id='line_9347'>my knight, Sir Gareth? Madam, said the dwarf, he bade me say that he</a>
<a id='line_9348'>would not be long from you. And so lightly the dwarf came again unto</a>
<a id='line_9349'>Sir Gareth, that would full fain have had a lodging, for he had need to</a>
<a id='line_9350'>be reposed. And then fell there a thunder and a rain, as heaven and</a>
<a id='line_9351'>earth should go together. And Sir Gareth was not a little weary, for of</a>
<a id='line_9352'>all that day he had but little rest, neither his horse nor he. So this</a>
<a id='line_9353'>Sir Gareth rode so long in that forest until the night came. And ever</a>
<a id='line_9354'>it lightened and thundered, as it had been wood. At the last by fortune</a>
<a id='line_9355'>he came to a castle, and there he heard the waits upon the walls.</a>
<a id='line_9356'></a>
<a id='line_9357'></a>
<a id='line_9358'></a>
<a id='line_9359'>CHAPTER XXXI. How Sir Gareth came to a castle where he was well lodged,</a>
<a id='line_9360'>and he jousted with a knight and slew him.</a>
<a id='line_9361'></a>
<a id='line_9362'>Then Sir Gareth rode unto the barbican of the castle, and prayed the</a>
<a id='line_9363'>porter fair to let him into the castle. The porter answered ungoodly</a>
<a id='line_9364'>again, and said, Thou gettest no lodging here. Fair sir, say not so,</a>
<a id='line_9365'>for I am a knight of King Arthur’s, and pray the lord or the lady of</a>
<a id='line_9366'>this castle to give me harbour for the love of King Arthur. Then the</a>
<a id='line_9367'>porter went unto the duchess, and told her how there was a knight of</a>
<a id='line_9368'>King Arthur’s would have harbour. Let him in, said the duchess, for I</a>
<a id='line_9369'>will see that knight, and for King Arthur’s sake he shall not be</a>
<a id='line_9370'>harbourless. Then she yode up into a tower over the gate, with great</a>
<a id='line_9371'>torchlight.</a>
<a id='line_9372'></a>
<a id='line_9373'>When Sir Gareth saw that torch-light he cried on high: Whether thou be</a>
<a id='line_9374'>lord or lady, giant or champion, I take no force so that I may have</a>
<a id='line_9375'>harbour this night; and if it so be that I must needs fight, spare me</a>
<a id='line_9376'>not to-morn when I have rested me, for both I and mine horse be weary.</a>
<a id='line_9377'>Sir knight, said the lady, thou speakest knightly and boldly; but wit</a>
<a id='line_9378'>thou well the lord of this castle loveth not King Arthur, nor none of</a>
<a id='line_9379'>his court, for my lord hath ever been against him; and therefore thou</a>
<a id='line_9380'>were better not to come within this castle; for an thou come in this</a>
<a id='line_9381'>night, thou must come in under such form, that wheresomever thou meet</a>
<a id='line_9382'>my lord, by stigh or by street, thou must yield thee to him as</a>
<a id='line_9383'>prisoner. Madam, said Sir Gareth, what is your lord, and what is his</a>
<a id='line_9384'>name? Sir, my lord’s name is the Duke de la Rowse. Well madam, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_9385'>Gareth, I shall promise you in what place I meet your lord I shall</a>
<a id='line_9386'>yield me unto him and to his good grace; with that I understand he will</a>
<a id='line_9387'>do me no harm: and if I understand that he will, I will release myself</a>
<a id='line_9388'>an I can with my spear and my sword. Ye say well, said the duchess; and</a>
<a id='line_9389'>then she let the drawbridge down, and so he rode into the hall, and</a>
<a id='line_9390'>there he alighted, and his horse was led into a stable; and in the hall</a>
<a id='line_9391'>he unarmed him and said, Madam, I will not out of this hall this night;</a>
<a id='line_9392'>and when it is daylight, let see who will have ado with me, he shall</a>
<a id='line_9393'>find me ready. Then was he set unto supper, and had many good dishes.</a>
<a id='line_9394'>Then Sir Gareth list well to eat, and knightly he ate his meat, and</a>
<a id='line_9395'>eagerly; there was many a fair lady by him, and some said they never</a>
<a id='line_9396'>saw a goodlier man nor so well of eating. Then they made him passing</a>
<a id='line_9397'>good cheer, and shortly when he had supped his bed was made there; so</a>
<a id='line_9398'>he rested him all night.</a>
<a id='line_9399'></a>
<a id='line_9400'>And on the morn he heard mass, and brake his fast and took his leave at</a>
<a id='line_9401'>the duchess, and at them all; and thanked her goodly of her lodging,</a>
<a id='line_9402'>and of his good cheer; and then she asked him his name. Madam, he said,</a>
<a id='line_9403'>truly my name is Gareth of Orkney, and some men call me Beaumains. Then</a>
<a id='line_9404'>knew she well it was the same knight that fought for Dame Lionesse. So</a>
<a id='line_9405'>Sir Gareth departed and rode up into a mountain, and there met him a</a>
<a id='line_9406'>knight, his name was Sir Bendelaine, and said to Sir Gareth: Thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_9407'>not pass this way, for either thou shalt joust with me, or else be my</a>
<a id='line_9408'>prisoner. Then will I joust, said Sir Gareth. And so they let their</a>
<a id='line_9409'>horses run, and there Sir Gareth smote him throughout the body; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9410'>Bendelaine rode forth to his castle there beside, and there died. So</a>
<a id='line_9411'>Sir Gareth would have rested him, and he came riding to Bendelaine’s</a>
<a id='line_9412'>castle. Then his knights and servants espied that it was he that had</a>
<a id='line_9413'>slain their lord. Then they armed twenty good men, and came out and</a>
<a id='line_9414'>assailed Sir Gareth; and so he had no spear, but his sword, and put his</a>
<a id='line_9415'>shield afore him; and there they brake their spears upon him, and they</a>
<a id='line_9416'>assailed him passingly sore. But ever Sir Gareth defended him as a</a>
<a id='line_9417'>knight.</a>
<a id='line_9418'></a>
<a id='line_9419'></a>
<a id='line_9420'></a>
<a id='line_9421'>CHAPTER XXXII. How Sir Gareth fought with a knight that held within his</a>
<a id='line_9422'>castle thirty ladies, and how he slew him.</a>
<a id='line_9423'></a>
<a id='line_9424'>So when they saw that they might not overcome him, they rode from him,</a>
<a id='line_9425'>and took their counsel to slay his horse; and so they came in upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_9426'>Gareth, and with spears they slew his horse, and then they assailed him</a>
<a id='line_9427'>hard. But when he was on foot, there was none that he fought but he</a>
<a id='line_9428'>gave him such a buffet that he did never recover. So he slew them by</a>
<a id='line_9429'>one and one till they were but four, and there they fled; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9430'>Gareth took a good horse that was one of theirs, and rode his way.</a>
<a id='line_9431'></a>
<a id='line_9432'>Then he rode a great pace till that he came to a castle, and there he</a>
<a id='line_9433'>heard much mourning of ladies and gentlewomen. So there came by him a</a>
<a id='line_9434'>page. What noise is this, said Sir Gareth, that I hear within this</a>
<a id='line_9435'>castle? Sir knight, said the page, here be within this castle thirty</a>
<a id='line_9436'>ladies, and all they be widows; for here is a knight that waiteth daily</a>
<a id='line_9437'>upon this castle, and his name is the Brown Knight without Pity, and he</a>
<a id='line_9438'>is the periloust knight that now liveth; and therefore sir, said the</a>
<a id='line_9439'>page, I rede you flee. Nay, said Sir Gareth, I will not flee though</a>
<a id='line_9440'>thou be afeard of him. And then the page saw where came the Brown</a>
<a id='line_9441'>Knight: Lo, said the page, yonder he cometh. Let me deal with him, said</a>
<a id='line_9442'>Sir Gareth. And when either of other had a sight they let their horses</a>
<a id='line_9443'>run, and the Brown Knight brake his spear, and Sir Gareth smote him</a>
<a id='line_9444'>throughout the body, that he overthrew him to the ground stark dead. So</a>
<a id='line_9445'>Sir Gareth rode into the castle, and prayed the ladies that he might</a>
<a id='line_9446'>repose him. Alas, said the ladies, ye may not be lodged here. Make him</a>
<a id='line_9447'>good cheer, said the page, for this knight hath slain your enemy. Then</a>
<a id='line_9448'>they all made him good cheer as lay in their power. But wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_9449'>they made him good cheer, for they might none otherwise do, for they</a>
<a id='line_9450'>were but poor.</a>
<a id='line_9451'></a>
<a id='line_9452'>And so on the morn he went to mass, and there he saw the thirty ladies</a>
<a id='line_9453'>kneel, and lay grovelling upon divers tombs, making great dole and</a>
<a id='line_9454'>sorrow. Then Sir Gareth wist well that in the tombs lay their lords.</a>
<a id='line_9455'>Fair ladies, said Sir Gareth, ye must at the next feast of Pentecost be</a>
<a id='line_9456'>at the court of King Arthur, and say that I, Sir Gareth, sent you</a>
<a id='line_9457'>thither. We shall do this, said the ladies. So he departed, and by</a>
<a id='line_9458'>fortune he came to a mountain, and there he found a goodly knight that</a>
<a id='line_9459'>bade him, Abide sir knight, and joust with me. What are ye? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_9460'>Gareth. My name is, said he, the Duke de la Rowse. Ah sir, ye are the</a>
<a id='line_9461'>same knight that I lodged once in your castle; and there I made promise</a>
<a id='line_9462'>unto your lady that I should yield me unto you. Ah, said the duke, art</a>
<a id='line_9463'>thou that proud knight that profferest to fight with my knights;</a>
<a id='line_9464'>therefore make thee ready, for I will have ado with you. So they let</a>
<a id='line_9465'>their horses run, and there Sir Gareth smote the duke down from his</a>
<a id='line_9466'>horse. But the duke lightly avoided his horse, and dressed his shield</a>
<a id='line_9467'>and drew his sword, and bade Sir Gareth alight and fight with him. So</a>
<a id='line_9468'>he did alight, and they did great battle together more than an hour,</a>
<a id='line_9469'>and either hurt other full sore. At the last Sir Gareth gat the duke to</a>
<a id='line_9470'>the earth, and would have slain him, and then he yield him to him. Then</a>
<a id='line_9471'>must ye go, said Sir Gareth, unto Sir Arthur my lord at the next feast,</a>
<a id='line_9472'>and say that I, Sir Gareth of Orkney, sent you unto him. It shall be</a>
<a id='line_9473'>done, said the duke, and I will do to you homage and fealty with an</a>
<a id='line_9474'>hundred knights with me; and all the days of my life to do you service</a>
<a id='line_9475'>where ye will command me.</a>
<a id='line_9476'></a>
<a id='line_9477'></a>
<a id='line_9478'></a>
<a id='line_9479'>CHAPTER XXXIII. How Sir Gareth and Sir Gawaine fought each against</a>
<a id='line_9480'>other, and how they knew each other by the damosel Linet.</a>
<a id='line_9481'></a>
<a id='line_9482'>So the duke departed, and Sir Gareth stood there alone; and there he</a>
<a id='line_9483'>saw an armed knight coming toward him. Then Sir Gareth took the duke’s</a>
<a id='line_9484'>shield, and mounted upon horseback, and so without biding they ran</a>
<a id='line_9485'>together as it had been the thunder. And there that knight hurt Sir</a>
<a id='line_9486'>Gareth under the side with his spear. And then they alighted and drew</a>
<a id='line_9487'>their swords, and gave great strokes that the blood trailed to the</a>
<a id='line_9488'>ground. And so they fought two hours.</a>
<a id='line_9489'></a>
<a id='line_9490'>At the last there came the damosel Linet, that some men called the</a>
<a id='line_9491'>damosel Savage, and she came riding upon an ambling mule; and there she</a>
<a id='line_9492'>cried all on high, Sir Gawaine, Sir Gawaine, leave thy fighting with</a>
<a id='line_9493'>thy brother Sir Gareth.</a>
<a id='line_9494'></a>
<a id='line_9495'>And when he heard her say so he threw away his shield and his sword,</a>
<a id='line_9496'>and ran to Sir Gareth, and took him in his arms, and sithen kneeled</a>
<a id='line_9497'>down and asked him mercy.</a>
<a id='line_9498'></a>
<a id='line_9499'>What are ye, said Sir Gareth, that right now were so strong and so</a>
<a id='line_9500'>mighty, and now so suddenly yield you to me? O Gareth, I am your</a>
<a id='line_9501'>brother Sir Gawaine, that for your sake have had great sorrow and</a>
<a id='line_9502'>labour.</a>
<a id='line_9503'></a>
<a id='line_9504'>Then Sir Gareth unlaced his helm, and kneeled down to him, and asked</a>
<a id='line_9505'>him mercy. Then they rose both, and embraced either other in their</a>
<a id='line_9506'>arms, and wept a great while or they might speak, and either of them</a>
<a id='line_9507'>gave other the prize of the battle. And there were many kind words</a>
<a id='line_9508'>between them.</a>
<a id='line_9509'></a>
<a id='line_9510'>Alas, my fair brother, said Sir Gawaine, perdy I owe of right to</a>
<a id='line_9511'>worship you an ye were not my brother, for ye have worshipped King</a>
<a id='line_9512'>Arthur and all his court, for ye have sent me more worshipful knights</a>
<a id='line_9513'>this twelvemonth than six the best of the Round Table have done, except</a>
<a id='line_9514'>Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_9515'></a>
<a id='line_9516'>Then came the damosel Savage that was the Lady Linet, that rode with</a>
<a id='line_9517'>Sir Gareth so long, and there she did staunch Sir Gareth’s wounds and</a>
<a id='line_9518'>Sir Gawaine’s. Now what will ye do? said the damosel Savage; meseemeth</a>
<a id='line_9519'>that it were well done that Arthur had witting of you both, for your</a>
<a id='line_9520'>horses are so bruised that they may not bear. Now, fair damosel, said</a>
<a id='line_9521'>Sir Gawaine, I pray you ride unto my lord mine uncle, King Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_9522'>tell him what adventure is to me betid here, and I suppose he will not</a>
<a id='line_9523'>tarry long. Then she took her mule, and lightly she came to King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_9524'>that was but two mile thence. And when she had told him tidings the</a>
<a id='line_9525'>king bade get him a palfrey. And when he was upon his back he bade the</a>
<a id='line_9526'>lords and ladies come after, who that would; and there was saddling and</a>
<a id='line_9527'>bridling of queens’ horses and princes’ horses, and well was him that</a>
<a id='line_9528'>soonest might be ready.</a>
<a id='line_9529'></a>
<a id='line_9530'>So when the king came thereas they were, he saw Sir Gawaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9531'>Gareth sit upon a little hill-side, and then the king avoided his</a>
<a id='line_9532'>horse. And when he came nigh Sir Gareth he would have spoken but he</a>
<a id='line_9533'>might not; and therewith he sank down in a swoon for gladness. And so</a>
<a id='line_9534'>they stert unto their uncle, and required him of his good grace to be</a>
<a id='line_9535'>of good comfort. Wit ye well the king made great joy, and many a</a>
<a id='line_9536'>piteous complaint he made to Sir Gareth, and ever he wept as he had</a>
<a id='line_9537'>been a child. With that came his mother, the Queen of Orkney, Dame</a>
<a id='line_9538'>Morgawse, and when she saw Sir Gareth readily in the visage she might</a>
<a id='line_9539'>not weep, but suddenly fell down in a swoon, and lay there a great</a>
<a id='line_9540'>while like as she had been dead. And then Sir Gareth recomforted his</a>
<a id='line_9541'>mother in such wise that she recovered and made good cheer. Then the</a>
<a id='line_9542'>king commanded that all manner of knights that were under his</a>
<a id='line_9543'>obeissance should make their lodging right there for the love of his</a>
<a id='line_9544'>nephews. And so it was done, and all manner of purveyance purveyed,</a>
<a id='line_9545'>that there lacked nothing that might be gotten of tame nor wild for</a>
<a id='line_9546'>gold or silver. And then by the means of the damosel Savage Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_9547'>and Sir Gareth were healed of their wounds; and there they sojourned</a>
<a id='line_9548'>eight days.</a>
<a id='line_9549'></a>
<a id='line_9550'>Then said King Arthur unto the damosel Savage: I marvel that your</a>
<a id='line_9551'>sister, Dame Lionesse, cometh not here to me, and in especial that she</a>
<a id='line_9552'>cometh not to visit her knight, my nephew Sir Gareth, that hath had so</a>
<a id='line_9553'>much travail for her love. My lord, said the damosel Linet, ye must of</a>
<a id='line_9554'>your good grace hold her excused, for she knoweth not that my lord, Sir</a>
<a id='line_9555'>Gareth, is here. Go then for her, said King Arthur, that we may be</a>
<a id='line_9556'>appointed what is best to be done, according to the pleasure of my</a>
<a id='line_9557'>nephew. Sir, said the damosel, that shall be done, and so she rode unto</a>
<a id='line_9558'>her sister. And as lightly as she might she made her ready; and she</a>
<a id='line_9559'>came on the morn with her brother Sir Gringamore, and with her forty</a>
<a id='line_9560'>knights. And so when she was come she had all the cheer that might be</a>
<a id='line_9561'>done, both of the king, and of many other kings and queens.</a>
<a id='line_9562'></a>
<a id='line_9563'></a>
<a id='line_9564'></a>
<a id='line_9565'>CHAPTER XXXIV. How Sir Gareth acknowledged that they loved each other</a>
<a id='line_9566'>to King Arthur, and of the appointment of their wedding.</a>
<a id='line_9567'></a>
<a id='line_9568'>And among all these ladies she was named the fairest, and peerless.</a>
<a id='line_9569'>Then when Sir Gawaine saw her there was many a goodly look and goodly</a>
<a id='line_9570'>words, that all men of worship had joy to behold them. Then came King</a>
<a id='line_9571'>Arthur and many other kings, and Dame Guenever, and the Queen of</a>
<a id='line_9572'>Orkney. And there the king asked his nephew, Sir Gareth, whether he</a>
<a id='line_9573'>would have that lady as paramour, or to have her to his wife. My lord,</a>
<a id='line_9574'>wit you well that I love her above all ladies living. Now, fair lady,</a>
<a id='line_9575'>said King Arthur, what say ye? Most noble King, said Dame Lionesse, wit</a>
<a id='line_9576'>you well that my lord, Sir Gareth, is to me more liefer to have and</a>
<a id='line_9577'>wield as my husband, than any king or prince that is christened; and if</a>
<a id='line_9578'>I may not have him I promise you I will never have none. For, my lord</a>
<a id='line_9579'>Arthur, said Dame Lionesse, wit ye well he is my first love, and he</a>
<a id='line_9580'>shall be the last; and if ye will suffer him to have his will and free</a>
<a id='line_9581'>choice I dare say he will have me. That is truth, said Sir Gareth; an I</a>
<a id='line_9582'>have not you and wield not you as my wife, there shall never lady nor</a>
<a id='line_9583'>gentlewoman rejoice me. What, nephew, said the king, is the wind in</a>
<a id='line_9584'>that door? for wit ye well I would not for the stint of my crown to be</a>
<a id='line_9585'>causer to withdraw your hearts; and wit ye well ye cannot love so well</a>
<a id='line_9586'>but I shall rather increase it than distress it. And also ye shall have</a>
<a id='line_9587'>my love and my lordship in the uttermost wise that may lie in my power.</a>
<a id='line_9588'>And in the same wise said Sir Gareth’s mother.</a>
<a id='line_9589'></a>
<a id='line_9590'>Then there was made a provision for the day of marriage; and by the</a>
<a id='line_9591'>king’s advice it was provided that it should be at Michaelmas</a>
<a id='line_9592'>following, at Kink Kenadon by the seaside, for there is a plentiful</a>
<a id='line_9593'>country. And so it was cried in all the places through the realm. And</a>
<a id='line_9594'>then Sir Gareth sent his summons to all these knights and ladies that</a>
<a id='line_9595'>he had won in battle to-fore, that they should be at his day of</a>
<a id='line_9596'>marriage at Kink Kenadon by the sands.</a>
<a id='line_9597'></a>
<a id='line_9598'>And then Dame Lionesse, and the damosel Linet with Sir Gringamore, rode</a>
<a id='line_9599'>to their castle; and a goodly and a rich ring she gave to Sir Gareth,</a>
<a id='line_9600'>and he gave her another. And King Arthur gave her a rich pair of bee of</a>
<a id='line_9601'>gold; and so she departed.</a>
<a id='line_9602'></a>
<a id='line_9603'>And King Arthur and his fellowship rode toward Kink Kenadon, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9604'>Gareth brought his lady on the way, and so came to the king again and</a>
<a id='line_9605'>rode with him.</a>
<a id='line_9606'></a>
<a id='line_9607'>Lord! the great cheer that Sir Launcelot made of Sir Gareth and he of</a>
<a id='line_9608'>him, for there was never no knight that Sir Gareth loved so well as he</a>
<a id='line_9609'>did Sir Launcelot; and ever for the most part he would be in Sir</a>
<a id='line_9610'>Launcelot’s company; for after Sir Gareth had espied Sir Gawaine’s</a>
<a id='line_9611'>conditions, he withdrew himself from his brother, Sir Gawaine’s,</a>
<a id='line_9612'>fellowship, for he was vengeable, and where he hated he would be</a>
<a id='line_9613'>avenged with murder, and that hated Sir Gareth.</a>
<a id='line_9614'></a>
<a id='line_9615'></a>
<a id='line_9616'></a>
<a id='line_9617'>CHAPTER XXXV. Of the Great Royalty, and what officers were made at the</a>
<a id='line_9618'>feast of the wedding, and of the jousts at the feast.</a>
<a id='line_9619'></a>
<a id='line_9620'>So it drew fast to Michaelmas; and thither came Dame Lionesse, the lady</a>
<a id='line_9621'>of the Castle Perilous, and her sister, Dame Linet, with Sir</a>
<a id='line_9622'>Gringamore, her brother, with them for he had the conduct of these</a>
<a id='line_9623'>ladies. And there they were lodged at the device of King Arthur. And</a>
<a id='line_9624'>upon Michaelmas Day the Bishop of Canterbury made the wedding betwixt</a>
<a id='line_9625'>Sir Gareth and the Lady Lionesse with great solemnity. And King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_9626'>made Gaheris to wed the Damosel Savage, that was Dame Linet; and King</a>
<a id='line_9627'>Arthur made Sir Agravaine to wed Dame Lionesse’s niece, a fair lady,</a>
<a id='line_9628'>her name was Dame Laurel.</a>
<a id='line_9629'></a>
<a id='line_9630'>And so when this solemnization was done, then came in the Green Knight,</a>
<a id='line_9631'>Sir Pertolepe, with thirty knights, and there he did homage and fealty</a>
<a id='line_9632'>to Sir Gareth, and these knights to hold of him for evermore. Also Sir</a>
<a id='line_9633'>Pertolepe said: I pray you that at this feast I may be your</a>
<a id='line_9634'>chamberlain. With a good will, said Sir Gareth sith it liketh you to</a>
<a id='line_9635'>take so simple an office. Then came in the Red Knight, with three score</a>
<a id='line_9636'>knights with him, and did to Sir Gareth homage and fealty, and all</a>
<a id='line_9637'>those knights to hold of him for evermore. And then this Sir Perimones</a>
<a id='line_9638'>prayed Sir Gareth to grant him to be his chief butler at that high</a>
<a id='line_9639'>feast. I will well, said Sir Gareth, that ye have this office, and it</a>
<a id='line_9640'>were better. Then came in Sir Persant of Inde, with an hundred knights</a>
<a id='line_9641'>with him, and there he did homage and fealty, and all his knights</a>
<a id='line_9642'>should do him service, and hold their lands of him for ever; and there</a>
<a id='line_9643'>he prayed Sir Gareth to make him his sewer-chief at the feast. I will</a>
<a id='line_9644'>well, said Sir Gareth, that ye have it and it were better. Then came</a>
<a id='line_9645'>the Duke de la Rowse with an hundred knights with him, and there he did</a>
<a id='line_9646'>homage and fealty to Sir Gareth, and so to hold their lands of him for</a>
<a id='line_9647'>ever. And he required Sir Gareth that he might serve him of the wine</a>
<a id='line_9648'>that day of that feast. I will well, said Sir Gareth, and it were</a>
<a id='line_9649'>better. Then came in the Red Knight of the Red Launds, that was Sir</a>
<a id='line_9650'>Ironside, and he brought with him three hundred knights, and there he</a>
<a id='line_9651'>did homage and fealty, and all these knights to hold their lands of him</a>
<a id='line_9652'>for ever. And then he asked Sir Gareth to be his carver. I will well,</a>
<a id='line_9653'>said Sir Gareth, an it please you.</a>
<a id='line_9654'></a>
<a id='line_9655'>Then came into the court thirty ladies, and all they seemed widows, and</a>
<a id='line_9656'>those thirty ladies brought with them many fair gentlewomen. And all</a>
<a id='line_9657'>they kneeled down at once unto King Arthur and unto Sir Gareth, and</a>
<a id='line_9658'>there all those ladies told the king how Sir Gareth delivered them from</a>
<a id='line_9659'>the dolorous tower, and slew the Brown Knight without Pity: And</a>
<a id='line_9660'>therefore we, and our heirs for evermore, will do homage unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_9661'>Gareth of Orkney. So then the kings and queens, princes and earls,</a>
<a id='line_9662'>barons and many bold knights, went unto meat; and well may ye wit there</a>
<a id='line_9663'>were all manner of meat plenteously, all manner revels and games, with</a>
<a id='line_9664'>all manner of minstrelsy that was used in those days. Also there was</a>
<a id='line_9665'>great jousts three days. But the king would not suffer Sir Gareth to</a>
<a id='line_9666'>joust, because of his new bride; for, as the French book saith, that</a>
<a id='line_9667'>Dame Lionesse desired of the king that none that were wedded should</a>
<a id='line_9668'>joust at that feast.</a>
<a id='line_9669'></a>
<a id='line_9670'>So the first day there jousted Sir Lamorak de Galis, for he overthrew</a>
<a id='line_9671'>thirty knights, and did passing marvellously deeds of arms; and then</a>
<a id='line_9672'>King Arthur made Sir Persant and his two brethren Knights of the Round</a>
<a id='line_9673'>Table to their lives’ end, and gave them great lands. Also the second</a>
<a id='line_9674'>day there jousted Tristram best, and he overthrew forty knights, and</a>
<a id='line_9675'>did there marvellous deeds of arms. And there King Arthur made</a>
<a id='line_9676'>Ironside, that was the Red Knight of the Red Launds, a Knight of the</a>
<a id='line_9677'>Table Round to his life’s end, and gave him great lands. The third day</a>
<a id='line_9678'>there jousted Sir Launcelot du Lake, and he overthrew fifty knights,</a>
<a id='line_9679'>and did many marvellous deeds of arms, that all men wondered on him.</a>
<a id='line_9680'>And there King Arthur made the Duke de la Rowse a Knight of the Round</a>
<a id='line_9681'>Table to his life’s end, and gave him great lands to spend. But when</a>
<a id='line_9682'>these jousts were done, Sir Lamorak and Sir Tristram departed suddenly,</a>
<a id='line_9683'>and would not be known, for the which King Arthur and all the court</a>
<a id='line_9684'>were sore displeased. And so they held the court forty days with great</a>
<a id='line_9685'>solemnity. And this Sir Gareth was a noble knight, and a well-ruled,</a>
<a id='line_9686'>and fair-languaged.</a>
<a id='line_9687'></a>
<a id='line_9688'>Thus endeth this tale of Sir Gareth of Orkney that wedded Dame Lionesse</a>
<a id='line_9689'>of the Castle Perilous. And also Sir Gaheris wedded her sister, Dame</a>
<a id='line_9690'>Linet, that was called the Damosel Sabage. And Sir Agrabaine wedded</a>
<a id='line_9691'>Dame Laurel, a fair lady and great, and mighty lands with great riches</a>
<a id='line_9692'>gave with them King Arthur, that royally they might live till their</a>
<a id='line_9693'>lives’ end.</a>

<a id='line_9695'> Here followeth the viii. book, the which is the first book of Sir</a>
<a id='line_9696'> Tristram de Liones, and who was his father and his mother, and how he</a>
<a id='line_9697'> was born and fostered, and how he was made knight.</a>

<a id='line_9701'>BOOK VIII.</a>
<a id='line_9702'></a>
<a id='line_9703'></a>
<a id='line_9704'></a>
<a id='line_9705'>CHAPTER I. How Sir Tristram de Liones was born, and how his mother died</a>
<a id='line_9706'>at his birth, wherefore she named him Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_9707'></a>
<a id='line_9708'>It was a king that hight Meliodas, and he was lord and king of the</a>
<a id='line_9709'>country of Liones, and this Meliodas was a likely knight as any was</a>
<a id='line_9710'>that time living. And by fortune he wedded King Mark’s sister of</a>
<a id='line_9711'>Cornwall, and she was called Elizabeth, that was called both good and</a>
<a id='line_9712'>fair. And at that time King Arthur reigned, and he was whole king of</a>
<a id='line_9713'>England, Wales, and Scotland, and of many other realms: howbeit there</a>
<a id='line_9714'>were many kings that were lords of many countries, but all they held</a>
<a id='line_9715'>their lands of King Arthur; for in Wales were two kings, and in the</a>
<a id='line_9716'>north were many kings; and in Cornwall and in the west were two kings;</a>
<a id='line_9717'>also in Ireland were two or three kings, and all were under the</a>
<a id='line_9718'>obeissance of King Arthur. So was the King of France, and the King of</a>
<a id='line_9719'>Brittany, and all the lordships unto Rome.</a>
<a id='line_9720'></a>
<a id='line_9721'>So when this King Meliodas had been with his wife, within a while she</a>
<a id='line_9722'>waxed great with child, and she was a full meek lady, and well she</a>
<a id='line_9723'>loved her lord, and he her again, so there was great joy betwixt them.</a>
<a id='line_9724'>Then there was a lady in that country that had loved King Meliodas</a>
<a id='line_9725'>long, and by no mean she never could get his love; therefore she let</a>
<a id='line_9726'>ordain upon a day, as King Meliodas rode a-hunting, for he was a great</a>
<a id='line_9727'>chaser, and there by an enchantment she made him chase an hart by</a>
<a id='line_9728'>himself alone till that he came to an old castle, and there anon he was</a>
<a id='line_9729'>taken prisoner by the lady that him loved. When Elizabeth, King</a>
<a id='line_9730'>Meliodas’ wife, missed her lord, and she was nigh out of her wit, and</a>
<a id='line_9731'>also as great with child as she was, she took a gentlewoman with her,</a>
<a id='line_9732'>and ran into the forest to seek her lord. And when she was far in the</a>
<a id='line_9733'>forest she might no farther, for she began to travail fast of her</a>
<a id='line_9734'>child. And she had many grimly throes; her gentlewoman helped her all</a>
<a id='line_9735'>that she might, and so by miracle of Our Lady of Heaven she was</a>
<a id='line_9736'>delivered with great pains. But she had taken such cold for the default</a>
<a id='line_9737'>of help that deep draughts of death took her, that needs she must die</a>
<a id='line_9738'>and depart out of this world; there was none other bote.</a>
<a id='line_9739'></a>
<a id='line_9740'>And when this Queen Elizabeth saw that there was none other bote, then</a>
<a id='line_9741'>she made great dole, and said unto her gentlewoman: When ye see my</a>
<a id='line_9742'>lord, King Meliodas, recommend me unto him, and tell him what pains I</a>
<a id='line_9743'>endure here for his love, and how I must die here for his sake for</a>
<a id='line_9744'>default of good help; and let him wit that I am full sorry to depart</a>
<a id='line_9745'>out of this world from him, therefore pray him to be friend to my soul.</a>
<a id='line_9746'>Now let me see my little child, for whom I have had all this sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_9747'>And when she saw him she said thus: Ah, my little son, thou hast</a>
<a id='line_9748'>murdered thy mother, and therefore I suppose, thou that art a murderer</a>
<a id='line_9749'>so young, thou art full likely to be a manly man in thine age. And</a>
<a id='line_9750'>because I shall die of the birth of thee, I charge thee, gentlewoman,</a>
<a id='line_9751'>that thou pray my lord, King Meliodas, that when he is christened let</a>
<a id='line_9752'>call him Tristram, that is as much to say as a sorrowful birth. And</a>
<a id='line_9753'>therewith this queen gave up the ghost and died. Then the gentlewoman</a>
<a id='line_9754'>laid her under an umbre of a great tree, and then she lapped the child</a>
<a id='line_9755'>as well as she might for cold. Right so there came the barons,</a>
<a id='line_9756'>following after the queen, and when they saw that she was dead, and</a>
<a id='line_9757'>understood none other but the king was destroyed.</a>
<a id='line_9758'></a>
<a id='line_9759'></a>
<a id='line_9760'></a>
<a id='line_9761'>CHAPTER II. How the stepmother of Sir Tristram had ordained poison for</a>
<a id='line_9762'>to have poisoned Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_9763'></a>
<a id='line_9764'>Then certain of them would have slain the child, because they would</a>
<a id='line_9765'>have been lords of the country of Liones. But then through the fair</a>
<a id='line_9766'>speech of the gentlewoman, and by the means that she made, the most</a>
<a id='line_9767'>part of the barons would not assent thereto. And then they let carry</a>
<a id='line_9768'>home the dead queen, and much dole was made for her.</a>
<a id='line_9769'></a>
<a id='line_9770'>Then this meanwhile Merlin delivered King Meliodas out of prison on the</a>
<a id='line_9771'>morn after his queen was dead. And so when the king was come home the</a>
<a id='line_9772'>most part of the barons made great joy. But the sorrow that the king</a>
<a id='line_9773'>made for his queen that might no tongue tell. So then the king let</a>
<a id='line_9774'>inter her richly, and after he let christen his child as his wife had</a>
<a id='line_9775'>commanded afore her death. And then he let call him Tristram, the</a>
<a id='line_9776'>sorrowful born child. Then the King Meliodas endured seven years</a>
<a id='line_9777'>without a wife, and all this time Tristram was nourished well. Then it</a>
<a id='line_9778'>befell that King Meliodas wedded King Howell’s daughter of Brittany,</a>
<a id='line_9779'>and anon she had children of King Meliodas: then was she heavy and</a>
<a id='line_9780'>wroth that her children should not rejoice the country of Liones,</a>
<a id='line_9781'>wherefore this queen ordained for to poison young Tristram. So she let</a>
<a id='line_9782'>poison be put in a piece of silver in the chamber whereas Tristram and</a>
<a id='line_9783'>her children were together, unto that intent that when Tristram were</a>
<a id='line_9784'>thirsty he should drink that drink. And so it fell upon a day, the</a>
<a id='line_9785'>queen’s son, as he was in that chamber, espied the piece with poison,</a>
<a id='line_9786'>and he weened it had been good drink, and because the child was thirsty</a>
<a id='line_9787'>he took the piece with poison and drank freely; and therewithal</a>
<a id='line_9788'>suddenly the child brast and was dead.</a>
<a id='line_9789'></a>
<a id='line_9790'>When the queen of Meliodas wist of the death of her son, wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_9791'>that she was heavy. But yet the king understood nothing of her treason.</a>
<a id='line_9792'>Notwithstanding the queen would not leave this, but eft she let ordain</a>
<a id='line_9793'>more poison, and put it in a piece. And by fortune King Meliodas, her</a>
<a id='line_9794'>husband, found the piece with wine where was the poison, and he that</a>
<a id='line_9795'>was much thirsty took the piece for to drink thereout. And as he would</a>
<a id='line_9796'>have drunken thereof the queen espied him, and then she ran unto him,</a>
<a id='line_9797'>and pulled the piece from him suddenly. The king marvelled why she did</a>
<a id='line_9798'>so, and remembered him how her son was suddenly slain with poison. And</a>
<a id='line_9799'>then he took her by the hand, and said: Thou false traitress, thou</a>
<a id='line_9800'>shalt tell me what manner of drink this is, or else I shall slay thee.</a>
<a id='line_9801'>And therewith he pulled out his sword, and sware a great oath that he</a>
<a id='line_9802'>should slay her but if she told him truth. Ah! mercy, my lord, said</a>
<a id='line_9803'>she, and I shall tell you all. And then she told him why she would have</a>
<a id='line_9804'>slain Tristram, because her children should rejoice his land. Well,</a>
<a id='line_9805'>said King Meliodas, and therefore shall ye have the law. And so she was</a>
<a id='line_9806'>condemned by the assent of the barons to be burnt; and then was there</a>
<a id='line_9807'>made a great fire, and right as she was at the fire to take her</a>
<a id='line_9808'>execution, young Tristram kneeled afore King Meliodas, and besought him</a>
<a id='line_9809'>to give him a boon. I will well, said the king again. Then said young</a>
<a id='line_9810'>Tristram, Give me the life of thy queen, my stepmother. That is</a>
<a id='line_9811'>unrightfully asked, said King Meliodas, for thou ought of right to hate</a>
<a id='line_9812'>her, for she would have slain thee with that poison an she might have</a>
<a id='line_9813'>had her will; and for thy sake most is my cause that she should die.</a>
<a id='line_9814'></a>
<a id='line_9815'>Sir, said Tristram, as for that, I beseech you of your mercy that you</a>
<a id='line_9816'>will forgive it her, and as for my part, God forgive it her, and I do;</a>
<a id='line_9817'>and so much it liked your highness to grant me my boon, for God’s love</a>
<a id='line_9818'>I require you hold your promise. Sithen it is so, said the king, I will</a>
<a id='line_9819'>that ye have her life. Then, said the king, I give her to you, and go</a>
<a id='line_9820'>ye to the fire and take her, and do with her what ye will. So Sir</a>
<a id='line_9821'>Tristram went to the fire, and by the commandment of the king delivered</a>
<a id='line_9822'>her from the death. But after that King Meliodas would never have ado</a>
<a id='line_9823'>with her, as at bed and board. But by the good means of young Tristram</a>
<a id='line_9824'>he made the king and her accorded. But then the king would not suffer</a>
<a id='line_9825'>young Tristram to abide no longer in his court.</a>
<a id='line_9826'></a>
<a id='line_9827'></a>
<a id='line_9828'></a>
<a id='line_9829'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Tristram was sent into France, and had one to</a>
<a id='line_9830'>govern him named Gouvernail, and how he learned to harp, hawk, and</a>
<a id='line_9831'>hunt.</a>
<a id='line_9832'></a>
<a id='line_9833'>And then he let ordain a gentleman that was well learned and taught,</a>
<a id='line_9834'>his name was Gouvernail; and then he sent young Tristram with</a>
<a id='line_9835'>Gouvernail into France to learn the language, and nurture, and deeds of</a>
<a id='line_9836'>arms. And there was Tristram more than seven years. And then when he</a>
<a id='line_9837'>well could speak the language, and had learned all that he might learn</a>
<a id='line_9838'>in that country, then he came home to his father, King Meliodas, again.</a>
<a id='line_9839'>And so Tristram learned to be an harper passing all other, that there</a>
<a id='line_9840'>was none such called in no country, and so on harping and on</a>
<a id='line_9841'>instruments of music he applied him in his youth for to learn.</a>
<a id='line_9842'></a>
<a id='line_9843'>And after, as he grew in might and strength, he laboured ever in</a>
<a id='line_9844'>hunting and in hawking, so that never gentleman more, that ever we</a>
<a id='line_9845'>heard read of. And as the book saith, he began good measures of blowing</a>
<a id='line_9846'>of beasts of venery, and beasts of chase, and all manner of vermin, and</a>
<a id='line_9847'>all these terms we have yet of hawking and hunting. And therefore the</a>
<a id='line_9848'>book of venery, of hawking, and hunting, is called the book of Sir</a>
<a id='line_9849'>Tristram. Wherefore, as meseemeth, all gentlemen that bear old arms</a>
<a id='line_9850'>ought of right to honour Sir Tristram for the goodly terms that</a>
<a id='line_9851'>gentlemen have and use, and shall to the day of doom, that thereby in a</a>
<a id='line_9852'>manner all men of worship may dissever a gentleman from a yeoman, and</a>
<a id='line_9853'>from a yeoman a villain. For he that gentle is will draw him unto</a>
<a id='line_9854'>gentle tatches, and to follow the customs of noble gentlemen.</a>
<a id='line_9855'></a>
<a id='line_9856'>Thus Sir Tristram endured in Cornwall until he was big and strong, of</a>
<a id='line_9857'>the age of eighteen years. And then the King Meliodas had great joy of</a>
<a id='line_9858'>Sir Tristram, and so had the queen, his wife. For ever after in her</a>
<a id='line_9859'>life, because Sir Tristram saved her from the fire, she did never hate</a>
<a id='line_9860'>him more after, but loved him ever after, and gave Tristram many great</a>
<a id='line_9861'>gifts; for every estate loved him, where that he went.</a>

<a id='line_9865'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Marhaus came out of Ireland for to ask truage of</a>
<a id='line_9866'>Cornwall, or else he would fight therefore.</a>
<a id='line_9867'></a>
<a id='line_9868'>Then it befell that King Anguish of Ireland sent unto King Mark of</a>
<a id='line_9869'>Cornwall for his truage, that Cornwall had paid many winters. And all</a>
<a id='line_9870'>that time King Mark was behind of the truage for seven years. And King</a>
<a id='line_9871'>Mark and his barons gave unto the messenger of Ireland these words and</a>
<a id='line_9872'>answer, that they would none pay; and bade the messenger go unto his</a>
<a id='line_9873'>King Anguish, and tell him we will pay him no truage, but tell your</a>
<a id='line_9874'>lord, an he will always have truage of us of Cornwall, bid him send a</a>
<a id='line_9875'>trusty knight of his land, that will fight for his right, and we shall</a>
<a id='line_9876'>find another for to defend our right. With this answer the messengers</a>
<a id='line_9877'>departed into Ireland. And when King Anguish understood the answer of</a>
<a id='line_9878'>the messengers he was wonderly wroth. And then he called unto him Sir</a>
<a id='line_9879'>Marhaus, the good knight, that was nobly proved, and a Knight of the</a>
<a id='line_9880'>Table Round. And this Marhaus was brother unto the queen of Ireland.</a>
<a id='line_9881'>Then the king said thus: Fair brother, Sir Marhaus, I pray you go into</a>
<a id='line_9882'>Cornwall for my sake, and do battle for our truage that of right we</a>
<a id='line_9883'>ought to have; and whatsomever ye spend ye shall have sufficiently,</a>
<a id='line_9884'>more than ye shall need. Sir, said Marhaus, wit ye well that I shall</a>
<a id='line_9885'>not be loath to do battle in the right of you and your land with the</a>
<a id='line_9886'>best knight of the Table Round; for I know them, for the most part,</a>
<a id='line_9887'>what be their deeds; and for to advance my deeds and to increase my</a>
<a id='line_9888'>worship I will right gladly go unto this journey for our right.</a>
<a id='line_9889'></a>
<a id='line_9890'>So in all haste there was made purveyance for Sir Marhaus, and he had</a>
<a id='line_9891'>all things that to him needed; and so he departed out of Ireland, and</a>
<a id='line_9892'>arrived up in Cornwall even fast by the Castle of Tintagil. And when</a>
<a id='line_9893'>King Mark understood that he was there arrived to fight for Ireland,</a>
<a id='line_9894'>then made King Mark great sorrow when he understood that the good and</a>
<a id='line_9895'>noble knight Sir Marhaus was come. For they knew no knight that durst</a>
<a id='line_9896'>have ado with him. For at that time Sir Marhaus was called one of the</a>
<a id='line_9897'>famousest and renowned knights of the world. And thus Sir Marhaus abode</a>
<a id='line_9898'>in the sea, and every day he sent unto King Mark for to pay the truage</a>
<a id='line_9899'>that was behind of seven year, other else to find a knight to fight</a>
<a id='line_9900'>with him for the truage. This manner of message Sir Marhaus sent daily</a>
<a id='line_9901'>unto King Mark.</a>
<a id='line_9902'></a>
<a id='line_9903'>Then they of Cornwall let make cries in every place, that what knight</a>
<a id='line_9904'>would fight for to save the truage of Cornwall, he should be rewarded</a>
<a id='line_9905'>so that he should fare the better, term of his life. Then some of the</a>
<a id='line_9906'>barons said to King Mark, and counselled him to send to the court of</a>
<a id='line_9907'>King Arthur for to seek Sir Launcelot du Lake, that was that time named</a>
<a id='line_9908'>for the marvelloust knight of all the world. Then there were some other</a>
<a id='line_9909'>barons that counselled the king not to do so, and said that it was</a>
<a id='line_9910'>labour in vain, because Sir Marhaus was a knight of the Round Table,</a>
<a id='line_9911'>therefore any of them will be loath to have ado with other, but if it</a>
<a id='line_9912'>were any knight at his own request would fight disguised and unknown.</a>
<a id='line_9913'>So the king and all his barons assented that it was no bote to seek any</a>
<a id='line_9914'>knight of the Round Table. This mean while came the language and the</a>
<a id='line_9915'>noise unto King Meliodas, how that Sir Marhaus abode battle fast by</a>
<a id='line_9916'>Tintagil, and how King Mark could find no manner knight to fight for</a>
<a id='line_9917'>him. When young Tristram heard of this he was wroth, and sore ashamed</a>
<a id='line_9918'>that there durst no knight in Cornwall have ado with Sir Marhaus of</a>
<a id='line_9919'>Ireland.</a>
<a id='line_9920'></a>
<a id='line_9921'></a>
<a id='line_9922'></a>
<a id='line_9923'>CHAPTER V. How Tristram enterprized the battle to fight for the truage</a>
<a id='line_9924'>of Cornwall, and how he was made knight.</a>
<a id='line_9925'></a>
<a id='line_9926'>Therewithal Tristram went unto his father, King Meliodas, and asked him</a>
<a id='line_9927'>counsel what was best to do for to recover Cornwall from truage. For,</a>
<a id='line_9928'>as meseemeth, said Sir Tristram, it were shame that Sir Marhaus, the</a>
<a id='line_9929'>queen’s brother of Ireland, should go away unless that he were foughten</a>
<a id='line_9930'>withal. As for that, said King Meliodas, wit you well, son Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_9931'>that Sir Marhaus is called one of the best knights of the world, and</a>
<a id='line_9932'>Knight of the Table Round; and therefore I know no knight in this</a>
<a id='line_9933'>country that is able to match with him. Alas, said Sir Tristram, that I</a>
<a id='line_9934'>am not made knight; and if Sir Marhaus should thus depart into Ireland,</a>
<a id='line_9935'>God let me never have worship: an I were made knight I should match</a>
<a id='line_9936'>him. And sir, said Tristram, I pray you give me leave to ride to King</a>
<a id='line_9937'>Mark; and, so ye be not displeased, of King Mark will I be made knight.</a>
<a id='line_9938'>I will well, said King Meliodas, that ye be ruled as your courage will</a>
<a id='line_9939'>rule you. Then Sir Tristram thanked his father much. And then he made</a>
<a id='line_9940'>him ready to ride into Cornwall.</a>
<a id='line_9941'></a>
<a id='line_9942'>In the meanwhile there came a messenger with letters of love from King</a>
<a id='line_9943'>Faramon of France’s daughter unto Sir Tristram, that were full piteous</a>
<a id='line_9944'>letters, and in them were written many complaints of love; but Sir</a>
<a id='line_9945'>Tristram had no joy of her letters nor regard unto her. Also she sent</a>
<a id='line_9946'>him a little brachet that was passing fair. But when the king’s</a>
<a id='line_9947'>daughter understood that Sir Tristram would not love her, as the book</a>
<a id='line_9948'>saith, she died for sorrow. And then the same squire that brought the</a>
<a id='line_9949'>letter and the brachet came again unto Sir Tristram, as after ye shall</a>
<a id='line_9950'>hear in the tale.</a>
<a id='line_9951'></a>
<a id='line_9952'>So this young Sir Tristram rode unto his eme, King Mark of Cornwall.</a>
<a id='line_9953'>And when he came there he heard say that there would no knight fight</a>
<a id='line_9954'>with Sir Marhaus. Then yede Sir Tristram unto his eme and said: Sir, if</a>
<a id='line_9955'>ye will give me the order of knighthood, I will do battle with Sir</a>
<a id='line_9956'>Marhaus. What are ye, said the king, and from whence be ye come? Sir,</a>
<a id='line_9957'>said Tristram, I come from King Meliodas that wedded your sister, and a</a>
<a id='line_9958'>gentleman wit ye well I am. King Mark beheld Sir Tristram and saw that</a>
<a id='line_9959'>he was but a young man of age, but he was passingly well made and big.</a>
<a id='line_9960'>Fair sir, said the king, what is your name, and where were ye born?</a>
<a id='line_9961'>Sir, said he again, my name is Tristram, and in the country of Liones</a>
<a id='line_9962'>was I born. Ye say well, said the king; and if ye will do this battle I</a>
<a id='line_9963'>shall make you knight. Therefore I come to you, said Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_9964'>for none other cause. But then King Mark made him knight. And</a>
<a id='line_9965'>therewithal, anon as he had made him knight, he sent a messenger unto</a>
<a id='line_9966'>Sir Marhaus with letters that said that he had found a young knight</a>
<a id='line_9967'>ready for to take the battle to the uttermost. It may well be, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_9968'>Marhaus; but tell King Mark I will not fight with no knight but he be</a>
<a id='line_9969'>of blood royal, that is to say, other king’s son, other queen’s son,</a>
<a id='line_9970'>born of a prince or princess.</a>
<a id='line_9971'></a>
<a id='line_9972'>When King Mark understood that, he sent for Sir Tristram de Liones and</a>
<a id='line_9973'>told him what was the answer of Sir Marhaus. Then said Sir Tristram:</a>
<a id='line_9974'>Sithen that he saith so, let him wit that I am come of father side and</a>
<a id='line_9975'>mother side of as noble blood as he is: for, sir, now shall ye know</a>
<a id='line_9976'>that I am King Meliodas’ son, born of your own sister, Dame Elizabeth,</a>
<a id='line_9977'>that died in the forest in the birth of me. O Jesu, said King Mark, ye</a>
<a id='line_9978'>are welcome fair nephew to me. Then in all the haste the king let horse</a>
<a id='line_9979'>Sir Tristram, and armed him in the best manner that might be had or</a>
<a id='line_9980'>gotten for gold or silver. And then King Mark sent unto Sir Marhaus,</a>
<a id='line_9981'>and did him to wit that a better born man than he was himself should</a>
<a id='line_9982'>fight with him, and his name is Sir Tristram de Liones, gotten of King</a>
<a id='line_9983'>Meliodas, and born of King Mark’s sister. Then was Sir Marhaus glad and</a>
<a id='line_9984'>blithe that he should fight with such a gentleman. And so by the assent</a>
<a id='line_9985'>of King Mark and of Sir Marhaus they let ordain that they should fight</a>
<a id='line_9986'>within an island nigh Sir Marhaus’ ships; and so was Sir Tristram put</a>
<a id='line_9987'>into a vessel both his horse and he, and all that to him longed both</a>
<a id='line_9988'>for his body and for his horse. Sir Tristram lacked nothing. And when</a>
<a id='line_9989'>King Mark and his barons of Cornwall beheld how young Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_9990'>departed with such a carriage to fight for the right of Cornwall, there</a>
<a id='line_9991'>was neither man nor woman of worship but they wept to see and</a>
<a id='line_9992'>understand so young a knight to jeopardy himself for their right.</a>
<a id='line_9993'></a>
<a id='line_9994'></a>
<a id='line_9995'></a>
<a id='line_9996'>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Tristram arrived into the Island for to furnish the</a>
<a id='line_9997'>battle with Sir Marhaus.</a>
<a id='line_9998'></a>
<a id='line_9999'>So to shorten this tale, when Sir Tristram was arrived within the</a>
<a id='line_10000'>island he looked to the farther side, and there he saw at an anchor six</a>
<a id='line_10001'>ships nigh to the land; and under the shadow of the ships upon the</a>
<a id='line_10002'>land, there hoved the noble knight, Sir Marhaus of Ireland. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_10003'>Tristram commanded his servant Gouvernail to bring his horse to the</a>
<a id='line_10004'>land, and dress his harness at all manner of rights. And then when he</a>
<a id='line_10005'>had so done he mounted upon his horse; and when he was in his saddle</a>
<a id='line_10006'>well apparelled, and his shield dressed upon his shoulder, Tristram</a>
<a id='line_10007'>asked Gouvernail, Where is this knight that I shall have ado withal?</a>
<a id='line_10008'>Sir, said Gouvernail, see ye him not? I weened ye had seen him; yonder</a>
<a id='line_10009'>he hoveth under the umbre of his ships on horseback, with his spear in</a>
<a id='line_10010'>his hand and his shield upon his shoulder. That is truth, said the</a>
<a id='line_10011'>noble knight, Sir Tristram, now I see him well enough.</a>
<a id='line_10012'></a>
<a id='line_10013'>Then he commanded his servant Gouvernail to go to his vessel again: And</a>
<a id='line_10014'>commend me unto mine eme King Mark, and pray him, if that I be slain in</a>
<a id='line_10015'>this battle, for to inter my body as him seemed best; and as for me,</a>
<a id='line_10016'>let him wit that I will never yield me for cowardice; and if I be slain</a>
<a id='line_10017'>and flee not, then they have lost no truage for me; and if so be that I</a>
<a id='line_10018'>flee or yield me as recreant, bid mine eme never bury me in Christian</a>
<a id='line_10019'>burials. And upon thy life, said Sir Tristram to Gouvernail, come thou</a>
<a id='line_10020'>not nigh this island till that thou see me overcome or slain, or else</a>
<a id='line_10021'>that I win yonder knight. So either departed from other sore weeping.</a>
<a id='line_10022'></a>
<a id='line_10023'></a>
<a id='line_10024'></a>
<a id='line_10025'>CHAPTER VII. How Sir Tristram fought against Sir Marhaus and achieved</a>
<a id='line_10026'>his battle, and how Sir Marhaus fled to his ship.</a>
<a id='line_10027'></a>
<a id='line_10028'>And then Sir Marhaus avised Sir Tristram, and said thus: Young knight,</a>
<a id='line_10029'>Sir Tristram, what dost thou here? me sore repenteth of thy courage,</a>
<a id='line_10030'>for wit thou well I have been assayed, and the best knights of this</a>
<a id='line_10031'>land have been assayed of my hand; and also I have matched with the</a>
<a id='line_10032'>best knights of the world, and therefore by my counsel return again</a>
<a id='line_10033'>unto thy vessel. And fair knight, and well-proved knight, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_10034'>Tristram, thou shalt well wit I may not forsake thee in this quarrel,</a>
<a id='line_10035'>for I am for thy sake made knight. And thou shalt well wit that I am a</a>
<a id='line_10036'>king’s son born, and gotten upon a queen; and such promise I have made</a>
<a id='line_10037'>at my uncle’s request and mine own seeking, that I shall fight with</a>
<a id='line_10038'>thee unto the uttermost, and deliver Cornwall from the old truage. And</a>
<a id='line_10039'>also wit thou well, Sir Marhaus, that this is the greatest cause that</a>
<a id='line_10040'>thou couragest me to have ado with thee, for thou art called one of the</a>
<a id='line_10041'>most renowned knights of the world, and because of that noise and fame</a>
<a id='line_10042'>that thou hast thou givest me courage to have ado with thee, for never</a>
<a id='line_10043'>yet was I proved with good knight; and sithen I took the order of</a>
<a id='line_10044'>knighthood this day, I am well pleased that I may have ado with so good</a>
<a id='line_10045'>a knight as thou art. And now wit thou well, Sir Marhaus, that I cast</a>
<a id='line_10046'>me to get worship on thy body; and if that I be not proved, I trust to</a>
<a id='line_10047'>God that I shall be worshipfully proved upon thy body, and to deliver</a>
<a id='line_10048'>the country of Cornwall for ever from all manner of truage from Ireland</a>
<a id='line_10049'>for ever.</a>
<a id='line_10050'></a>
<a id='line_10051'>When Sir Marhaus had heard him say what he would, he said then thus</a>
<a id='line_10052'>again: Fair knight, sithen it is so that thou castest to win worship of</a>
<a id='line_10053'>me, I let thee wit worship may thou none lose by me if thou mayest</a>
<a id='line_10054'>stand me three strokes; for I let thee wit for my noble deeds, proved</a>
<a id='line_10055'>and seen, King Arthur made me Knight of the Table Round.</a>
<a id='line_10056'></a>
<a id='line_10057'>Then they began to feutre their spears, and they met so fiercely</a>
<a id='line_10058'>together that they smote either other down, both horse and all. But Sir</a>
<a id='line_10059'>Marhaus smote Sir Tristram a great wound in the side with his spear,</a>
<a id='line_10060'>and then they avoided their horses, and pulled out their swords, and</a>
<a id='line_10061'>threw their shields afore them. And then they lashed together as men</a>
<a id='line_10062'>that were wild and courageous. And when they had stricken so together</a>
<a id='line_10063'>long, then they left their strokes, and foined at their breaths and</a>
<a id='line_10064'>visors; and when they saw that that might not prevail them, then they</a>
<a id='line_10065'>hurtled together like rams to bear either other down. Thus they fought</a>
<a id='line_10066'>still more than half a day, and either were wounded passing sore, that</a>
<a id='line_10067'>the blood ran down freshly from them upon the ground. By then Sir</a>
<a id='line_10068'>Tristram waxed more fresher than Sir Marhaus, and better winded and</a>
<a id='line_10069'>bigger; and with a mighty stroke he smote Sir Marhaus upon the helm</a>
<a id='line_10070'>such a buffet that it went through his helm, and through the coif of</a>
<a id='line_10071'>steel, and through the brain-pan, and the sword stuck so fast in the</a>
<a id='line_10072'>helm and in his brain-pan that Sir Tristram pulled thrice at his sword</a>
<a id='line_10073'>or ever he might pull it out from his head; and there Marhaus fell down</a>
<a id='line_10074'>on his knees, the edge of Tristram’s sword left in his brain-pan. And</a>
<a id='line_10075'>suddenly Sir Marhaus rose grovelling, and threw his sword and his</a>
<a id='line_10076'>shield from him, and so ran to his ships and fled his way, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_10077'>Tristram had ever his shield and his sword.</a>
<a id='line_10078'></a>
<a id='line_10079'>And when Sir Tristram saw Sir Marhaus withdraw him, he said: Ah! Sir</a>
<a id='line_10080'>Knight of the Round Table, why withdrawest thou thee? thou dost thyself</a>
<a id='line_10081'>and thy kin great shame, for I am but a young knight, or now I was</a>
<a id='line_10082'>never proved, and rather than I should withdraw me from thee, I had</a>
<a id='line_10083'>rather be hewn in an hundred pieces. Sir Marhaus answered no word but</a>
<a id='line_10084'>yede his way sore groaning. Well, Sir Knight, said Sir Tristram, I</a>
<a id='line_10085'>promise thee thy sword and thy shield shall be mine; and thy shield</a>
<a id='line_10086'>shall I wear in all places where I ride on mine adventures, and in the</a>
<a id='line_10087'>sight of King Arthur and all the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_10088'></a>
<a id='line_10089'></a>
<a id='line_10090'></a>
<a id='line_10091'>CHAPTER VIII. How Sir Marhaus after that he was arrived in Ireland died</a>
<a id='line_10092'>of the stroke that Sir Tristram had given him, and how Tristram was</a>
<a id='line_10093'>hurt.</a>
<a id='line_10094'></a>
<a id='line_10095'>Anon Sir Marhaus and his fellowship departed into Ireland. And as soon</a>
<a id='line_10096'>as he came to the king, his brother, he let search his wounds. And when</a>
<a id='line_10097'>his head was searched a piece of Sir Tristram’s sword was found</a>
<a id='line_10098'>therein, and might never be had out of his head for no surgeons, and so</a>
<a id='line_10099'>he died of Sir Tristram’s sword; and that piece of the sword the queen,</a>
<a id='line_10100'>his sister, kept it for ever with her, for she thought to be revenged</a>
<a id='line_10101'>an she might.</a>
<a id='line_10102'></a>
<a id='line_10103'>Now turn we again unto Sir Tristram, that was sore wounded, and full</a>
<a id='line_10104'>sore bled that he might not within a little while, when he had taken</a>
<a id='line_10105'>cold, unnethe stir him of his limbs. And then he set him down softly</a>
<a id='line_10106'>upon a little hill, and bled fast. Then anon came Gouvernail, his man,</a>
<a id='line_10107'>with his vessel; and the king and his barons came with procession</a>
<a id='line_10108'>against him. And when he was come unto the land, King Mark took him in</a>
<a id='line_10109'>his arms, and the king and Sir Dinas, the seneschal, led Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_10110'>into the castle of Tintagil. And then was he searched in the best</a>
<a id='line_10111'>manner, and laid in his bed. And when King Mark saw his wounds he wept</a>
<a id='line_10112'>heartily, and so did all his lords. So God me help, said King Mark, I</a>
<a id='line_10113'>would not for all my lands that my nephew died. So Sir Tristram lay</a>
<a id='line_10114'>there a month and more, and ever he was like to die of that stroke that</a>
<a id='line_10115'>Sir Marhaus smote him first with the spear. For, as the French book</a>
<a id='line_10116'>saith, the spear’s head was envenomed, that Sir Tristram might not be</a>
<a id='line_10117'>whole. Then was King Mark and all his barons passing heavy, for they</a>
<a id='line_10118'>deemed none other but that Sir Tristram should not recover. Then the</a>
<a id='line_10119'>king let send after all manner of leeches and surgeons, both unto men</a>
<a id='line_10120'>and women, and there was none that would behote him the life. Then came</a>
<a id='line_10121'>there a lady that was a right wise lady, and she said plainly unto King</a>
<a id='line_10122'>Mark, and to Sir Tristram, and to all his barons, that he should never</a>
<a id='line_10123'>be whole but if Sir Tristram went in the same country that the venom</a>
<a id='line_10124'>came from, and in that country should he be holpen or else never. Thus</a>
<a id='line_10125'>said the lady unto the king.</a>
<a id='line_10126'></a>
<a id='line_10127'>When King Mark understood that, he let purvey for Sir Tristram a fair</a>
<a id='line_10128'>vessel, well victualled, and therein was put Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_10129'>Gouvernail with him, and Sir Tristram took his harp with him, and so he</a>
<a id='line_10130'>was put into the sea to sail into Ireland; and so by good fortune he</a>
<a id='line_10131'>arrived up in Ireland, even fast by a castle where the king and the</a>
<a id='line_10132'>queen was; and at his arrival he sat and harped in his bed a merry lay,</a>
<a id='line_10133'>such one heard they never none in Ireland before that time.</a>
<a id='line_10134'></a>
<a id='line_10135'>And when it was told the king and the queen of such a knight that was</a>
<a id='line_10136'>such an harper, anon the king sent for him, and let search his wounds,</a>
<a id='line_10137'>and then asked him his name. Then he answered, I am of the country of</a>
<a id='line_10138'>Liones, and my name is Tramtrist, that thus was wounded in a battle as</a>
<a id='line_10139'>I fought for a lady’s right. So God me help, said King Anguish, ye</a>
<a id='line_10140'>shall have all the help in this land that ye may have here; but I let</a>
<a id='line_10141'>you wit, in Cornwall I had a great loss as ever had king, for there I</a>
<a id='line_10142'>lost the best knight of the world; his name was Marhaus, a full noble</a>
<a id='line_10143'>knight, and Knight of the Table Round; and there he told Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_10144'>wherefore Sir Marhaus was slain. Sir Tristram made semblant as he had</a>
<a id='line_10145'>been sorry, and better knew he how it was than the king.</a>
<a id='line_10146'></a>
<a id='line_10147'></a>
<a id='line_10148'></a>
<a id='line_10149'>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Tristram was put to the keeping of La Beale Isoud</a>
<a id='line_10150'>first for to be healed of his wound.</a>
<a id='line_10151'></a>
<a id='line_10152'>Then the king for great favour made Tramtrist to be put in his</a>
<a id='line_10153'>daughter’s ward and keeping, because she was a noble surgeon. And when</a>
<a id='line_10154'>she had searched him she found in the bottom of his wound that therein</a>
<a id='line_10155'>was poison, and so she healed him within a while; and therefore</a>
<a id='line_10156'>Tramtrist cast great love to La Beale Isoud, for she was at that time</a>
<a id='line_10157'>the fairest maid and lady of the world. And there Tramtrist learned her</a>
<a id='line_10158'>to harp, and she began to have a great fantasy unto him. And at that</a>
<a id='line_10159'>time Sir Palamides, the Saracen, was in that country, and well</a>
<a id='line_10160'>cherished with the king and the queen. And every day Sir Palamides drew</a>
<a id='line_10161'>unto La Beale Isoud and proffered her many gifts, for he loved her</a>
<a id='line_10162'>passingly well. All that espied Tramtrist, and full well knew he Sir</a>
<a id='line_10163'>Palamides for a noble knight and a mighty man. And wit you well Sir</a>
<a id='line_10164'>Tramtrist had great despite at Sir Palamides, for La Beale Isoud told</a>
<a id='line_10165'>Tramtrist that Palamides was in will to be christened for her sake.</a>
<a id='line_10166'>Thus was there great envy betwixt Tramtrist and Sir Palamides.</a>
<a id='line_10167'></a>
<a id='line_10168'>Then it befell that King Anguish let cry a great jousts and a great</a>
<a id='line_10169'>tournament for a lady that was called the Lady of the Launds, and she</a>
<a id='line_10170'>was nigh cousin unto the king. And what man won her, three days after</a>
<a id='line_10171'>he should wed her and have all her lands. This cry was made in England,</a>
<a id='line_10172'>Wales, Scotland, and also in France and in Brittany. It befell upon a</a>
<a id='line_10173'>day La Beale Isoud came unto Sir Tramtrist, and told him of this</a>
<a id='line_10174'>tournament. He answered and said: Fair lady, I am but a feeble knight,</a>
<a id='line_10175'>and but late I had been dead had not your good ladyship been. Now, fair</a>
<a id='line_10176'>lady, what would ye I should do in this matter? well ye wot, my lady,</a>
<a id='line_10177'>that I may not joust. Ah, Tramtrist, said La Beale Isoud, why will ye</a>
<a id='line_10178'>not have ado at that tournament? well I wot Sir Palamides shall be</a>
<a id='line_10179'>there, and to do what he may; and therefore Tramtrist, I pray you for</a>
<a id='line_10180'>to be there, for else Sir Palamides is like to win the degree. Madam,</a>
<a id='line_10181'>said Tramtrist, as for that, it may be so, for he is a proved knight,</a>
<a id='line_10182'>and I am but a young knight and late made; and the first battle that I</a>
<a id='line_10183'>did it mishapped me to be sore wounded as ye see. But an I wist ye</a>
<a id='line_10184'>would be my better lady, at that tournament I will be, so that ye will</a>
<a id='line_10185'>keep my counsel and let no creature have knowledge that I shall joust</a>
<a id='line_10186'>but yourself, and such as ye will to keep your counsel, my poor person</a>
<a id='line_10187'>shall I jeopard there for your sake, that, peradventure, Sir Palamides</a>
<a id='line_10188'>shall know when that I come. Thereto, said La Beale Isoud, do your</a>
<a id='line_10189'>best, and as I can, said La Beale Isoud, I shall purvey horse and</a>
<a id='line_10190'>armour for you at my device. As ye will so be it, said Sir Tramtrist, I</a>
<a id='line_10191'>will be at your commandment.</a>
<a id='line_10192'></a>
<a id='line_10193'>So at the day of jousts there came Sir Palamides with a black shield,</a>
<a id='line_10194'>and he overthrew many knights, that all the people had marvel of him.</a>
<a id='line_10195'>For he put to the worse Sir Gawaine, Gaheris, Agravaine, Bagdemagus,</a>
<a id='line_10196'>Kay, Dodinas le Savage, Sagramore le Desirous, Gumret le Petit, and</a>
<a id='line_10197'>Griflet le Fise de Dieu. All these the first day Sir Palamides struck</a>
<a id='line_10198'>down to the earth. And then all manner of knights were adread of Sir</a>
<a id='line_10199'>Palamides, and many called him the Knight with the Black Shield. So</a>
<a id='line_10200'>that day Sir Palamides had great worship.</a>
<a id='line_10201'></a>
<a id='line_10202'>Then came King Anguish unto Tramtrist, and asked him why he would not</a>
<a id='line_10203'>joust. Sir, he said, I was but late hurt, and as yet I dare not</a>
<a id='line_10204'>adventure me. Then came there the same squire that was sent from the</a>
<a id='line_10205'>king’s daughter of France unto Sir Tristram. And when he had espied Sir</a>
<a id='line_10206'>Tristram he fell flat to his feet. All that espied La Beale Isoud, what</a>
<a id='line_10207'>courtesy the squire made unto Sir Tristram. And therewithal suddenly</a>
<a id='line_10208'>Sir Tristram ran unto his squire, whose name was Hebes le Renoumes, and</a>
<a id='line_10209'>prayed him heartily in no wise to tell his name. Sir, said Hebes, I</a>
<a id='line_10210'>will not discover your name but if ye command me.</a>
<a id='line_10211'></a>
<a id='line_10212'></a>
<a id='line_10213'></a>
<a id='line_10214'>CHAPTER X. How Sir Tristram won the degree at a tournament in Ireland,</a>
<a id='line_10215'>and there made Palamides to bear no more harness in a year.</a>
<a id='line_10216'></a>
<a id='line_10217'>Then Sir Tristram asked him what he did in those countries. Sir, he</a>
<a id='line_10218'>said, I came hither with Sir Gawaine for to be made knight, and if it</a>
<a id='line_10219'>please you, of your hands that I may be made knight. Await upon me as</a>
<a id='line_10220'>to-morn secretly, and in the field I shall make you a knight.</a>
<a id='line_10221'></a>
<a id='line_10222'>Then had La Beale Isoud great suspicion unto Tramtrist, that he was</a>
<a id='line_10223'>some man of worship proved, and therewith she comforted herself, and</a>
<a id='line_10224'>cast more love unto him than she had done to-fore. And so on the morn</a>
<a id='line_10225'>Sir Palamides made him ready to come into the field as he did the first</a>
<a id='line_10226'>day. And there he smote down the King with the Hundred Knights, and the</a>
<a id='line_10227'>King of Scots. Then had La Beale Isoud ordained and well arrayed Sir</a>
<a id='line_10228'>Tristram in white horse and harness. And right so she let put him out</a>
<a id='line_10229'>at a privy postern, and so he came into the field as it had been a</a>
<a id='line_10230'>bright angel. And anon Sir Palamides espied him, and therewith he</a>
<a id='line_10231'>feutred a spear unto Sir Tramtrist, and he again unto him. And there</a>
<a id='line_10232'>Sir Tristram smote down Sir Palamides unto the earth. And then there</a>
<a id='line_10233'>was a great noise of people: some said Sir Palamides had a fall, some</a>
<a id='line_10234'>said the Knight with the Black Shield had a fall. And wit you well La</a>
<a id='line_10235'>Beale Isoud was passing glad. And then Sir Gawaine and his fellows nine</a>
<a id='line_10236'>had marvel what knight it might be that had smitten down Sir Palamides.</a>
<a id='line_10237'>Then would there none joust with Tramtrist, but all that there were</a>
<a id='line_10238'>forsook him, most and least. Then Sir Tristram made Hebes a knight, and</a>
<a id='line_10239'>caused him to put himself forth, and did right well that day. So after</a>
<a id='line_10240'>Sir Hebes held him with Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_10241'></a>
<a id='line_10242'>And when Sir Palamides had received this fall, wit ye well that he was</a>
<a id='line_10243'>sore ashamed, and as privily as he might he withdrew him out of the</a>
<a id='line_10244'>field. All that espied Sir Tristram, and lightly he rode after Sir</a>
<a id='line_10245'>Palamides and overtook him, and bade him turn, for better he would</a>
<a id='line_10246'>assay him or ever he departed. Then Sir Palamides turned him, and</a>
<a id='line_10247'>either lashed at other with their swords. But at the first stroke Sir</a>
<a id='line_10248'>Tristram smote down Palamides, and gave him such a stroke upon the head</a>
<a id='line_10249'>that he fell to the earth. So then Tristram bade yield him, and do his</a>
<a id='line_10250'>commandment, or else he would slay him. When Sir Palamides beheld his</a>
<a id='line_10251'>countenance, he dread his buffets so, that he granted all his askings.</a>
<a id='line_10252'>Well said, said Sir Tristram, this shall be your charge. First, upon</a>
<a id='line_10253'>pain of your life that ye forsake my lady La Beale Isoud, and in no</a>
<a id='line_10254'>manner wise that ye draw not to her. Also this twelvemonth and a day</a>
<a id='line_10255'>that ye bear none armour nor none harness of war. Now promise me this,</a>
<a id='line_10256'>or here shalt thou die. Alas, said Palamides, for ever am I ashamed.</a>
<a id='line_10257'>Then he sware as Sir Tristram had commanded him. Then for despite and</a>
<a id='line_10258'>anger Sir Palamides cut off his harness, and threw them away.</a>
<a id='line_10259'></a>
<a id='line_10260'>And so Sir Tristram turned again to the castle where was La Beale</a>
<a id='line_10261'>Isoud; and by the way he met with a damosel that asked after Sir</a>
<a id='line_10262'>Launcelot, that won the Dolorous Guard worshipfully; and this damosel</a>
<a id='line_10263'>asked Sir Tristram what he was. For it was told her that it was he that</a>
<a id='line_10264'>smote down Sir Palamides, by whom the ten knights of King Arthur’s were</a>
<a id='line_10265'>smitten down. Then the damosel prayed Sir Tristram to tell her what he</a>
<a id='line_10266'>was, and whether that he were Sir Launcelot du Lake, for she deemed</a>
<a id='line_10267'>that there was no knight in the world might do such deeds of arms but</a>
<a id='line_10268'>if it were Launcelot. Fair damosel, said Sir Tristram, wit ye well that</a>
<a id='line_10269'>I am not Sir Launcelot, for I was never of such prowess, but in God is</a>
<a id='line_10270'>all that he may make me as good a knight as the good knight Sir</a>
<a id='line_10271'>Launcelot. Now, gentle knight, said she, put up thy visor; and when she</a>
<a id='line_10272'>beheld his visage she thought she saw never a better man’s visage, nor</a>
<a id='line_10273'>a better faring knight. And then when the damosel knew certainly that</a>
<a id='line_10274'>he was not Sir Launcelot, then she took her leave, and departed from</a>
<a id='line_10275'>him. And then Sir Tristram rode privily unto the postern, where kept</a>
<a id='line_10276'>him La Beale Isoud, and there she made him good cheer, and thanked God</a>
<a id='line_10277'>of his good speed. So anon, within a while the king and the queen</a>
<a id='line_10278'>understood that it was Tramtrist that smote down Sir Palamides; then</a>
<a id='line_10279'>was he much made of, more than he was before.</a>
<a id='line_10280'></a>
<a id='line_10281'></a>
<a id='line_10282'></a>
<a id='line_10283'>CHAPTER XI. How the queen espied that Sir Tristram had slain her</a>
<a id='line_10284'>brother Sir Marhaus by his sword, and in what jeopardy he was.</a>
<a id='line_10285'></a>
<a id='line_10286'>Thus was Sir Tramtrist long there well cherished with the king and the</a>
<a id='line_10287'>queen, and namely with La Beale Isoud. So upon a day the queen and La</a>
<a id='line_10288'>Beale Isoud made a bain for Sir Tramtrist. And when he was in his bain</a>
<a id='line_10289'>the queen and Isoud, her daughter, roamed up and down in the chamber;</a>
<a id='line_10290'>and therewhiles Gouvernail and Hebes attended upon Tramtrist, and the</a>
<a id='line_10291'>queen beheld his sword thereas it lay upon his bed. And then by unhap</a>
<a id='line_10292'>the queen drew out his sword and beheld it a long while, and both they</a>
<a id='line_10293'>thought it a passing fair sword; but within a foot and an half of the</a>
<a id='line_10294'>point there was a great piece thereof out-broken of the edge. And when</a>
<a id='line_10295'>the queen espied that gap in the sword, she remembered her of a piece</a>
<a id='line_10296'>of a sword that was found in the brain-pan of Sir Marhaus, the good</a>
<a id='line_10297'>knight that was her brother. Alas then, said she unto her daughter, La</a>
<a id='line_10298'>Beale Isoud, this is the same traitor knight that slew my brother,</a>
<a id='line_10299'>thine eme. When Isoud heard her say so she was passing sore abashed,</a>
<a id='line_10300'>for passing well she loved Tramtrist, and full well she knew the</a>
<a id='line_10301'>cruelness of her mother the queen.</a>
<a id='line_10302'></a>
<a id='line_10303'>Anon therewithal the queen went unto her own chamber, and sought her</a>
<a id='line_10304'>coffer, and there she took out the piece or the sword that was pulled</a>
<a id='line_10305'>out of Sir Marhaus’ head after that he was dead. And then she ran with</a>
<a id='line_10306'>that piece of iron to the sword that lay upon the bed. And when she put</a>
<a id='line_10307'>that piece of steel and iron unto the sword, it was as meet as it might</a>
<a id='line_10308'>be when it was new broken. And then the queen gripped that sword in her</a>
<a id='line_10309'>hand fiercely, and with all her might she ran straight upon Tramtrist</a>
<a id='line_10310'>where he sat in his bain, and there she had rived him through had not</a>
<a id='line_10311'>Sir Hebes gotten her in his arms, and pulled the sword from her, and</a>
<a id='line_10312'>else she had thrust him through.</a>
<a id='line_10313'></a>
<a id='line_10314'>Then when she was let of her evil will she ran to the King Anguish, her</a>
<a id='line_10315'>husband, and said on her knees: O my lord, here have ye in your house</a>
<a id='line_10316'>that traitor knight that slew my brother and your servant, that noble</a>
<a id='line_10317'>knight, Sir Marhaus. Who is that, said King Anguish, and where is he?</a>
<a id='line_10318'>Sir, she said, it is Sir Tramtrist, the same knight that my daughter</a>
<a id='line_10319'>healed. Alas, said the king, therefore am I right heavy, for he is a</a>
<a id='line_10320'>full noble knight as ever I saw in field. But I charge you, said the</a>
<a id='line_10321'>king to the queen, that ye have not ado with that knight, but let me</a>
<a id='line_10322'>deal with him.</a>
<a id='line_10323'></a>
<a id='line_10324'>Then the king went into the chamber unto Sir Tramtrist, and then was he</a>
<a id='line_10325'>gone unto his chamber, and the king found him all ready armed to mount</a>
<a id='line_10326'>upon his horse. When the king saw him all ready armed to go unto</a>
<a id='line_10327'>horseback, the king said: Nay, Tramtrist, it will not avail to compare</a>
<a id='line_10328'>thee against me; but thus much I shall do for my worship and for thy</a>
<a id='line_10329'>love; in so much as thou art within my court it were no worship for me</a>
<a id='line_10330'>to slay thee: therefore upon this condition I will give thee leave for</a>
<a id='line_10331'>to depart from this court in safety, so thou wilt tell me who was thy</a>
<a id='line_10332'>father, and what is thy name, and if thou slew Sir Marhaus, my brother.</a>

<a id='line_10337'>out of Ireland for to come into Cornwall.</a>
<a id='line_10338'></a>
<a id='line_10339'>Sir, said Tristram, now I shall tell you all the truth: my father’s</a>
<a id='line_10340'>name is Sir Meliodas, King of Liones, and my mother hight Elizabeth,</a>
<a id='line_10341'>that was sister unto King Mark of Cornwall; and my mother died of me in</a>
<a id='line_10342'>the forest, and because thereof she commanded, or she died, that when I</a>
<a id='line_10343'>were christened they should christen me Tristram; and because I would</a>
<a id='line_10344'>not be known in this country I turned my name and let me call</a>
<a id='line_10345'>Tramtrist; and for the truage of Cornwall I fought for my eme’s sake,</a>
<a id='line_10346'>and for the right of Cornwall that ye had posseded many years. And wit</a>
<a id='line_10347'>ye well, said Tristram unto the king, I did the battle for the love of</a>
<a id='line_10348'>mine uncle, King Mark, and for the love of the country of Cornwall, and</a>
<a id='line_10349'>for to increase mine honour; for that same day that I fought with Sir</a>
<a id='line_10350'>Marhaus I was made knight, and never or then did I battle with no</a>
<a id='line_10351'>knight, and from me he went alive, and left his shield and his sword</a>
<a id='line_10352'>behind.</a>
<a id='line_10353'></a>
<a id='line_10354'>So God me help, said the king, I may not say but ye did as a knight</a>
<a id='line_10355'>should, and it was your part to do for your quarrel, and to increase</a>
<a id='line_10356'>your worship as a knight should; howbeit I may not maintain you in this</a>
<a id='line_10357'>country with my worship, unless that I should displease my barons, and</a>
<a id='line_10358'>my wife and her kin. Sir, said Tristram, I thank you of your good</a>
<a id='line_10359'>lordship that I have had with you here, and the great goodness my lady,</a>
<a id='line_10360'>your daughter, hath shewed me, and therefore, said Sir Tristram, it may</a>
<a id='line_10361'>so happen that ye shall win more by my life than by my death, for in</a>
<a id='line_10362'>the parts of England it may happen I may do you service at some season,</a>
<a id='line_10363'>that ye shall be glad that ever ye shewed me your good lordship. With</a>
<a id='line_10364'>more I promise you as I am true knight, that in all places I shall be</a>
<a id='line_10365'>my lady your daughter’s servant and knight in right and in wrong, and I</a>
<a id='line_10366'>shall never fail her, to do as much as a knight may do. Also I beseech</a>
<a id='line_10367'>your good grace that I may take my leave at my lady, your daughter, and</a>
<a id='line_10368'>at all the barons and knights. I will well, said the king.</a>
<a id='line_10369'></a>
<a id='line_10370'>Then Sir Tristram went unto La Beale Isoud and took his leave of her.</a>
<a id='line_10371'>And then he told her all, what he was, and how he had changed his name</a>
<a id='line_10372'>because he would not be known, and how a lady told him that he should</a>
<a id='line_10373'>never be whole till he came into this country where the poison was</a>
<a id='line_10374'>made, wherethrough I was near my death had not your ladyship been. O</a>
<a id='line_10375'>gentle knight, said La Beale Isoud, full woe am I of thy departing, for</a>
<a id='line_10376'>I saw never man that I owed so good will to. And therewithal she wept</a>
<a id='line_10377'>heartily. Madam, said Sir Tristram, ye shall understand that my name is</a>
<a id='line_10378'>Sir Tristram de Liones, gotten of King Meliodas, and born of his queen.</a>
<a id='line_10379'>And I promise you faithfully that I shall be all the days of my life</a>
<a id='line_10380'>your knight. Gramercy, said La Beale Isoud, and I promise you</a>
<a id='line_10381'>there-against that I shall not be married this seven years but by your</a>
<a id='line_10382'>assent; and to whom that ye will I shall be married to him will I have,</a>
<a id='line_10383'>and he will have me if ye will consent.</a>
<a id='line_10384'></a>
<a id='line_10385'>And then Sir Tristram gave her a ring, and she gave him another; and</a>
<a id='line_10386'>therewith he departed from her, leaving her making great dole and</a>
<a id='line_10387'>lamentation; and he straight went unto the court among all the barons,</a>
<a id='line_10388'>and there he took his leave at most and least, and openly he said among</a>
<a id='line_10389'>them all: Fair lords, now it is so that I must depart: if there be any</a>
<a id='line_10390'>man here that I have offended unto, or that any man be with me grieved,</a>
<a id='line_10391'>let complain him here afore me or that ever I depart, and I shall amend</a>
<a id='line_10392'>it unto my power. And if there be any that will proffer me wrong, or</a>
<a id='line_10393'>say of me wrong or shame behind my back, say it now or never, and here</a>
<a id='line_10394'>is my body to make it good, body against body. And all they stood</a>
<a id='line_10395'>still, there was not one that would say one word; yet were there some</a>
<a id='line_10396'>knights that were of the queen’s blood, and of Sir Marhaus’ blood, but</a>

<a id='line_10404'>So Sir Tristram departed, and took the sea, and with good wind he</a>
<a id='line_10405'>arrived up at Tintagil in Cornwall; and when King Mark was whole in his</a>
<a id='line_10406'>prosperity there came tidings that Sir Tristram was arrived, and whole</a>
<a id='line_10407'>of his wounds: thereof was King Mark passing glad, and so were all the</a>
<a id='line_10408'>barons; and when he saw his time he rode unto his father, King</a>
<a id='line_10409'>Meliodas, and there he had all the cheer that the king and the queen</a>
<a id='line_10410'>could make him. And then largely King Meliodas and his queen departed</a>
<a id='line_10411'>of their lands and goods to Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_10412'></a>
<a id='line_10413'>Then by the license of King Meliodas, his father, he returned again</a>
<a id='line_10414'>unto the court of King Mark, and there he lived in great joy long time,</a>
<a id='line_10415'>until at the last there befell a jealousy and an unkindness betwixt</a>
<a id='line_10416'>King Mark and Sir Tristram, for they loved both one lady. And she was</a>
<a id='line_10417'>an earl’s wife that hight Sir Segwarides. And this lady loved Sir</a>
<a id='line_10418'>Tristram passingly well. And he loved her again, for she was a passing</a>
<a id='line_10419'>fair lady, and that espied Sir Tristram well. Then King Mark understood</a>
<a id='line_10420'>that and was jealous, for King Mark loved her passingly well.</a>
<a id='line_10421'></a>
<a id='line_10422'>So it fell upon a day this lady sent a dwarf unto Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_10423'>bade him, as he loved her, that he would be with her the night next</a>
<a id='line_10424'>following. Also she charged you that ye come not to her but if ye be</a>
<a id='line_10425'>well armed, for her lover was called a good knight. Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_10426'>answered to the dwarf: Recommend me unto my lady, and tell her I will</a>
<a id='line_10427'>not fail but I will be with her the term that she hath set me. And with</a>
<a id='line_10428'>this answer the dwarf departed. And King Mark espied that the dwarf was</a>
<a id='line_10429'>with Sir Tristram upon message from Segwarides’ wife; then King Mark</a>
<a id='line_10430'>sent for the dwarf, and when he was come he made the dwarf by force to</a>
<a id='line_10431'>tell him all, why and wherefore that he came on message from Sir</a>
<a id='line_10432'>Tristram. Now, said King Mark, go where thou wilt, and upon pain of</a>
<a id='line_10433'>death that thou say no word that thou spakest with me; so the dwarf</a>
<a id='line_10434'>departed from the king.</a>
<a id='line_10435'></a>
<a id='line_10436'>And that same night that the steven was set betwixt Segwarides’ wife</a>
<a id='line_10437'>and Sir Tristram, King Mark armed him, and made him ready, and took two</a>
<a id='line_10438'>knights of his counsel with him; and so he rode afore for to abide by</a>
<a id='line_10439'>the way for to wait upon Sir Tristram. And as Sir Tristram came riding</a>
<a id='line_10440'>upon his way with his spear in his hand, King Mark came hurtling upon</a>
<a id='line_10441'>him with his two knights suddenly. And all three smote him with their</a>
<a id='line_10442'>spears, and King Mark hurt Sir Tristram on the breast right sore. And</a>
<a id='line_10443'>then Sir Tristram feutred his spear, and smote his uncle, King Mark, so</a>
<a id='line_10444'>sore, that he rashed him to the earth, and bruised him that he lay</a>
<a id='line_10445'>still in a swoon, and long it was or ever he might wield himself. And</a>
<a id='line_10446'>then he ran to the one knight, and eft to the other, and smote them to</a>
<a id='line_10447'>the cold earth, that they lay still. And therewithal Sir Tristram rode</a>
<a id='line_10448'>forth sore wounded to the lady, and found her abiding him at a postern.</a>

<a id='line_10451'></a>
<a id='line_10452'>CHAPTER XIV. How Sir Tristram lay with the lady, and how her husband</a>
<a id='line_10453'>fought with Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_10454'></a>
<a id='line_10455'>And there she welcomed him fair, and either halsed other in arms, and</a>
<a id='line_10456'>so she let put up his horse in the best wise, and then she unarmed him.</a>
<a id='line_10457'>And so they supped lightly, and went to bed with great joy and</a>
<a id='line_10458'>pleasaunce; and so in his raging he took no keep of his green wound</a>
<a id='line_10459'>that King Mark had given him. And so Sir Tristram be-bled both the over</a>
<a id='line_10460'>sheet and the nether, and pillows, and head sheet. And within a while</a>
<a id='line_10461'>there came one afore, that warned her that her lord was near-hand</a>
<a id='line_10462'>within a bow-draught. So she made Sir Tristram to arise, and so he</a>
<a id='line_10463'>armed him, and took his horse, and so departed. By then was come</a>
<a id='line_10464'>Segwarides, her lord, and when he found her bed troubled and broken,</a>
<a id='line_10465'>and went near and beheld it by candle light, then he saw that there had</a>
<a id='line_10466'>lain a wounded knight. Ah, false traitress, then he said, why hast thou</a>
<a id='line_10467'>betrayed me? And therewithal he swang out a sword, and said: But if</a>
<a id='line_10468'>thou tell me who hath been here, here thou shalt die. Ah, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_10469'>mercy, said the lady, and held up her hands, saying: Slay me not, and I</a>
<a id='line_10470'>shall tell you all who hath been here. Tell anon, said Segwarides, to</a>
<a id='line_10471'>me all the truth. Anon for dread she said: Here was Sir Tristram with</a>
<a id='line_10472'>me, and by the way as he came to me ward, he was sore wounded. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_10473'>false traitress, said Segwarides, where is he become? Sir, she said, he</a>
<a id='line_10474'>is armed, and departed on horseback, not yet hence half a mile. Ye say</a>
<a id='line_10475'>well, said Segwarides.</a>
<a id='line_10476'></a>
<a id='line_10477'>Then he armed him lightly, and gat his horse, and rode after Sir</a>
<a id='line_10478'>Tristram that rode straightway unto Tintagil. And within a while he</a>
<a id='line_10479'>overtook Sir Tristram, and then he bade him, Turn, false traitor</a>
<a id='line_10480'>knight. And Sir Tristram anon turned him against him. And therewithal</a>
<a id='line_10481'>Segwarides smote Sir Tristram with a spear that it all to-brast; and</a>
<a id='line_10482'>then he swang out his sword and smote fast at Sir Tristram. Sir knight,</a>
<a id='line_10483'>said Sir Tristram, I counsel you that ye smite no more, howbeit for the</a>
<a id='line_10484'>wrongs that I have done you I will forbear you as long as I may. Nay,</a>
<a id='line_10485'>said Segwarides, that shall not be, for either thou shalt die or I.</a>
<a id='line_10486'></a>
<a id='line_10487'>Then Sir Tristram drew out his sword, and hurtled his horse unto him</a>
<a id='line_10488'>fiercely, and through the waist of the body he smote Sir Segwarides</a>
<a id='line_10489'>that he fell to the earth in a swoon. And so Sir Tristram departed and</a>
<a id='line_10490'>left him there. And so he rode unto Tintagil and took his lodging</a>
<a id='line_10491'>secretly, for he would not be known that he was hurt. Also Sir</a>
<a id='line_10492'>Segwarides’ men rode after their master, whom they found lying in the</a>
<a id='line_10493'>field sore wounded, and brought him home on his shield, and there he</a>
<a id='line_10494'>lay long or that he were whole, but at the last he recovered. Also King</a>
<a id='line_10495'>Mark would not be aknown of that Sir Tristram and he had met that</a>
<a id='line_10496'>night. And as for Sir Tristram, he knew not that King Mark had met with</a>
<a id='line_10497'>him. And so the king askance came to Sir Tristram, to comfort him as he</a>
<a id='line_10498'>lay sick in his bed. But as long as King Mark lived he loved never Sir</a>
<a id='line_10499'>Tristram after that; though there was fair speech, love was there none.</a>
<a id='line_10500'>And thus it passed many weeks and days, and all was forgiven and</a>
<a id='line_10501'>forgotten; for Sir Segwarides durst not have ado with Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_10502'>because of his noble prowess, and also because he was nephew unto King</a>
<a id='line_10503'>Mark; therefore he let it overslip: for he that hath a privy hurt is</a>
<a id='line_10504'>loath to have a shame outward.</a>

<a id='line_10508'>CHAPTER XV. How Sir Bleoberis demanded the fairest lady in King Mark’s</a>
<a id='line_10509'>court, whom he took away, and how he was fought with.</a>
<a id='line_10510'></a>
<a id='line_10511'>Then it befell upon a day that the good knight Bleoberis de Ganis,</a>
<a id='line_10512'>brother to Blamore de Ganis, and nigh cousin unto the good knight Sir</a>
<a id='line_10513'>Launcelot du Lake, this Bleoberis came unto the court of King Mark, and</a>
<a id='line_10514'>there he asked of King Mark a boon, to give him what gift that he would</a>
<a id='line_10515'>ask in his court. When the king heard him ask so, he marvelled of his</a>
<a id='line_10516'>asking, but because he was a knight of the Round Table, and of a great</a>
<a id='line_10517'>renown, King Mark granted him his whole asking. Then, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_10518'>Bleoberis, I will have the fairest lady in your court that me list to</a>
<a id='line_10519'>choose. I may not say nay, said King Mark; now choose at your</a>
<a id='line_10520'>adventure. And so Sir Bleoberis did choose Sir Segwarides’ wife, and</a>
<a id='line_10521'>took her by the hand, and so went his way with her; and so he took his</a>
<a id='line_10522'>horse and gart set her behind his squire, and rode upon his way.</a>
<a id='line_10523'></a>
<a id='line_10524'>When Sir Segwarides heard tell that his lady was gone with a knight of</a>
<a id='line_10525'>King Arthur’s court, then he armed him and rode after that knight for</a>
<a id='line_10526'>to rescue his lady. So when Bleoberis was gone with this lady, King</a>
<a id='line_10527'>Mark and all the court was wroth that she was away. Then were there</a>
<a id='line_10528'>certain ladies that knew that there were great love between Sir</a>
<a id='line_10529'>Tristram and her, and also that lady loved Sir Tristram above all other</a>
<a id='line_10530'>knights. Then there was one lady that rebuked Sir Tristram in the</a>
<a id='line_10531'>horriblest wise, and called him coward knight, that he would for shame</a>
<a id='line_10532'>of his knighthood see a lady so shamefully be taken away from his</a>
<a id='line_10533'>uncle’s court. But she meant that either of them had loved other with</a>
<a id='line_10534'>entire heart. But Sir Tristram answered her thus: Fair lady, it is not</a>
<a id='line_10535'>my part to have ado in such matters while her lord and husband is</a>
<a id='line_10536'>present here; and if it had been that her lord had not been here in</a>
<a id='line_10537'>this court, then for the worship of this court peradventure I would</a>
<a id='line_10538'>have been her champion, and if so be Sir Segwarides speed not well, it</a>
<a id='line_10539'>may happen that I will speak with that good knight or ever he pass from</a>
<a id='line_10540'>this country.</a>
<a id='line_10541'></a>
<a id='line_10542'>Then within a while came one of Sir Segwarides’ squires, and told in</a>
<a id='line_10543'>the court that Sir Segwarides was beaten sore and wounded to the point</a>
<a id='line_10544'>of death; as he would have rescued his lady Sir Bleoberis overthrew him</a>
<a id='line_10545'>and sore hath wounded him. Then was King Mark heavy thereof, and all</a>
<a id='line_10546'>the court. When Sir Tristram heard of this he was ashamed and sore</a>
<a id='line_10547'>grieved; and then was he soon armed and on horseback, and Gouvernail,</a>
<a id='line_10548'>his servant, bare his shield and spear. And so as Sir Tristram rode</a>
<a id='line_10549'>fast he met with Sir Andred his cousin, that by the commandment of King</a>
<a id='line_10550'>Mark was sent to bring forth, an ever it lay in his power, two knights</a>
<a id='line_10551'>of Arthur’s court, that rode by the country to seek their adventures.</a>
<a id='line_10552'>When Sir Tristram saw Sir Andred he asked him what tidings. So God me</a>
<a id='line_10553'>help, said Sir Andred, there was never worse with me, for here by the</a>
<a id='line_10554'>commandment of King Mark I was sent to fetch two knights of King</a>
<a id='line_10555'>Arthur’s court, and that one beat me and wounded me, and set nought by</a>
<a id='line_10556'>my message. Fair cousin, said Sir Tristram, ride on your way, and if I</a>
<a id='line_10557'>may meet them it may happen I shall revenge you. So Sir Andred rode</a>
<a id='line_10558'>into Cornwall, and Sir Tristram rode after the two knights, the which</a>
<a id='line_10559'>one hight Sagramore le Desirous, and the other hight Dodinas le Savage.</a>

<a id='line_10562'></a>
<a id='line_10563'>CHAPTER XVI. How Sir Tristram fought with two knights of the Round</a>
<a id='line_10564'>Table.</a>
<a id='line_10565'></a>
<a id='line_10566'>Then within a while Sir Tristram saw them afore him, two likely</a>
<a id='line_10567'>knights. Sir, said Gouvernail unto his master, Sir, I would counsel you</a>
<a id='line_10568'>not to have ado with them, for they be two proved knights of Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_10569'>court. As for that, said Sir Tristram, have ye no doubt but I will have</a>
<a id='line_10570'>ado with them to increase my worship, for it is many day sithen I did</a>
<a id='line_10571'>any deeds of arms. Do as ye list, said Gouvernail. And therewithal anon</a>
<a id='line_10572'>Sir Tristram asked them from whence they came, and whither they would,</a>
<a id='line_10573'>and what they did in those marches. Sir Sagramore looked upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_10574'>Tristram, and had scorn of his words, and asked him again, Fair knight,</a>
<a id='line_10575'>be ye a knight of Cornwall? Whereby ask ye it? said Sir Tristram. For</a>
<a id='line_10576'>it is seldom seen, said Sir Sagramore, that ye Cornish knights be</a>
<a id='line_10577'>valiant men of arms; for within these two hours there met us one of</a>
<a id='line_10578'>your Cornish knights, and great words he spake, and anon with little</a>
<a id='line_10579'>might he was laid to the earth. And, as I trow, said Sir Sagramore, ye</a>
<a id='line_10580'>shall have the same handsel that he had. Fair lords, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_10581'>it may so happen that I may better withstand than he did, and whether</a>
<a id='line_10582'>ye will or nill I will have ado with you, because he was my cousin that</a>
<a id='line_10583'>ye beat. And therefore here do your best, and wit ye well but if ye</a>
<a id='line_10584'>quit you the better here upon this ground, one knight of Cornwall shall</a>
<a id='line_10585'>beat you both.</a>
<a id='line_10586'></a>
<a id='line_10587'>When Sir Dodinas le Savage heard him say so he gat a spear in his hand,</a>
<a id='line_10588'>and said, Sir knight, keep well thyself: And then they departed and</a>
<a id='line_10589'>came together as it had been thunder. And Sir Dodinas’ spear brast</a>
<a id='line_10590'>in-sunder, but Sir Tristram smote him with a more might, that he smote</a>
<a id='line_10591'>him clean over the horse-croup, that nigh he had broken his neck. When</a>
<a id='line_10592'>Sir Sagramore saw his fellow have such a fall he marvelled what knight</a>
<a id='line_10593'>he might be. And he dressed his spear with all his might, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_10594'>Tristram against him, and they came together as the thunder, and there</a>
<a id='line_10595'>Sir Tristram smote Sir Sagramore a strong buffet, that he bare his</a>
<a id='line_10596'>horse and him to the earth, and in the falling he brake his thigh.</a>
<a id='line_10597'></a>
<a id='line_10598'>When this was done Sir Tristram asked them: Fair knights, will ye any</a>
<a id='line_10599'>more? Be there no bigger knights in the court of King Arthur? it is to</a>
<a id='line_10600'>you shame to say of us knights of Cornwall dishonour, for it may happen</a>
<a id='line_10601'>a Cornish knight may match you. That is truth, said Sir Sagramore, that</a>
<a id='line_10602'>have we well proved; but I require thee, said Sir Sagramore, tell us</a>
<a id='line_10603'>your right name, by the faith and troth that ye owe to the high order</a>
<a id='line_10604'>of knighthood. Ye charge me with a great thing, said Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_10605'>sithen ye list to wit it, ye shall know and understand that my name is</a>
<a id='line_10606'>Sir Tristram de Liones, King Meliodas’ son, and nephew unto King Mark.</a>
<a id='line_10607'>Then were they two knights fain that they had met with Tristram, and so</a>
<a id='line_10608'>they prayed him to abide in their fellowship. Nay, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_10609'>for I must have ado with one of your fellows, his name is Sir Bleoberis</a>
<a id='line_10610'>de Ganis. God speed you well, said Sir Sagramore and Dodinas. Sir</a>
<a id='line_10611'>Tristram departed and rode onward on his way. And then was he ware</a>
<a id='line_10612'>before him in a valley where rode Sir Bleoberis, with Sir Segwarides’</a>
<a id='line_10613'>lady, that rode behind his squire upon a palfrey.</a>

<a id='line_10617'>CHAPTER XVII. How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Bleoberis for a lady,</a>
<a id='line_10618'>and how the lady was put to choice to whom she would go.</a>
<a id='line_10619'></a>
<a id='line_10620'>Then Sir Tristram rode more than a pace until that he had overtaken</a>
<a id='line_10621'>him. Then spake Sir Tristram: Abide, he said, Knight of Arthur’s court,</a>
<a id='line_10622'>bring again that lady, or deliver her to me. I will do neither, said</a>
<a id='line_10623'>Bleoberis, for I dread no Cornish knight so sore that me list to</a>
<a id='line_10624'>deliver her. Why, said Sir Tristram, may not a Cornish knight do as</a>
<a id='line_10625'>well as another knight? this same day two knights of your court within</a>
<a id='line_10626'>this three mile met with me, and or ever we departed they found a</a>
<a id='line_10627'>Cornish knight good enough for them both. What were their names? said</a>
<a id='line_10628'>Bleoberis. They told me, said Sir Tristram, that the one of them hight</a>
<a id='line_10629'>Sir Sagramore le Desirous, and the other hight Dodinas le Savage. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_10630'>said Sir Bleoberis, have ye met with them? so God me help, they were</a>
<a id='line_10631'>two good knights and men of great worship, and if ye have beat them</a>
<a id='line_10632'>both ye must needs be a good knight; but if it so be ye have beat them</a>
<a id='line_10633'>both, yet shall ye not fear me, but ye shall beat me or ever ye have</a>
<a id='line_10634'>this lady. Then defend you, said Sir Tristram. So they departed and</a>
<a id='line_10635'>came together like thunder, and either bare other down, horse and all,</a>
<a id='line_10636'>to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_10637'></a>
<a id='line_10638'>Then they avoided their horses, and lashed together eagerly with</a>
<a id='line_10639'>swords, and mightily, now tracing and traversing on the right hand and</a>
<a id='line_10640'>on the left hand more than two hours. And sometime they rushed together</a>
<a id='line_10641'>with such a might that they lay both grovelling on the ground. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_10642'>Bleoberis de Ganis stert aback, and said thus: Now, gentle good knight,</a>
<a id='line_10643'>a while hold your hands, and let us speak together. Say what ye will,</a>
<a id='line_10644'>said Tristram, and I will answer you. Sir, said Bleoberis, I would wit</a>
<a id='line_10645'>of whence ye be, and of whom ye be come, and what is your name? So God</a>
<a id='line_10646'>me help, said Sir Tristram, I fear not to tell you my name. Wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_10647'>I am King Meliodas’ son, and my mother is King Mark’s sister, and my</a>
<a id='line_10648'>name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and King Mark is mine uncle. Truly,</a>
<a id='line_10649'>said Bleoberis, I am right glad of you, for ye are he that slew Marhaus</a>
<a id='line_10650'>the knight, hand for hand in an island, for the truage of Cornwall;</a>
<a id='line_10651'>also ye overcame Sir Palamides the good knight, at a tournament in an</a>
<a id='line_10652'>island, where ye beat Sir Gawaine and his nine fellows. So God me help,</a>
<a id='line_10653'>said Sir Tristram, wit ye well that I am the same knight; now I have</a>
<a id='line_10654'>told you my name, tell me yours with good will. Wit ye well that my</a>
<a id='line_10655'>name is Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, and my brother hight Sir Blamore de</a>
<a id='line_10656'>Ganis, that is called a good knight, and we be sister’s children unto</a>
<a id='line_10657'>my lord Sir Launcelot du Lake, that we call one of the best knights of</a>
<a id='line_10658'>the world. That is truth, said Sir Tristram, Sir Launcelot is called</a>
<a id='line_10659'>peerless of courtesy and of knighthood; and for his sake, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_10660'>Tristram, I will not with my good will fight no more with you, for the</a>
<a id='line_10661'>great love I have to Sir Launcelot du Lake. In good faith, said</a>
<a id='line_10662'>Bleoberis, as for me I will be loath to fight with you; but sithen ye</a>
<a id='line_10663'>follow me here to have this lady, I shall proffer you kindness,</a>
<a id='line_10664'>courtesy, and gentleness right here upon this ground. This lady shall</a>
<a id='line_10665'>be betwixt us both, and to whom that she will go, let him have her in</a>
<a id='line_10666'>peace. I will well, said Tristram, for, as I deem, she will leave you</a>
<a id='line_10667'>and come to me. Ye shall prove it anon, said Bleoberis.</a>
<a id='line_10668'></a>
<a id='line_10669'></a>
<a id='line_10670'></a>
<a id='line_10671'>CHAPTER XVIII. How the lady forsook Sir Tristram and abode with Sir</a>
<a id='line_10672'>Bleoberis, and how she desired to go to her husband.</a>
<a id='line_10673'></a>
<a id='line_10674'>So when she was set betwixt them both she said these words unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_10675'>Tristram: Wit ye well, Sir Tristram de Liones, that but late thou wast</a>
<a id='line_10676'>the man in the world that I most loved and trusted, and I weened thou</a>
<a id='line_10677'>hadst loved me again above all ladies; but when thou sawest this knight</a>
<a id='line_10678'>lead me away thou madest no cheer to rescue me, but suffered my lord</a>
<a id='line_10679'>Segwarides ride after me; but until that time I weened thou haddest</a>
<a id='line_10680'>loved me, and therefore now I will leave thee, and never love thee</a>
<a id='line_10681'>more. And therewithal she went unto Sir Bleoberis.</a>
<a id='line_10682'></a>
<a id='line_10683'>When Sir Tristram saw her do so he was wonderly wroth with that lady,</a>
<a id='line_10684'>and ashamed to come to the court. Sir Tristram, said Sir Bleoberis, ye</a>
<a id='line_10685'>are in the default, for I hear by this lady’s words she before this day</a>
<a id='line_10686'>trusted you above all earthly knights, and, as she saith, ye have</a>
<a id='line_10687'>deceived her, therefore wit ye well, there may no man hold that will</a>
<a id='line_10688'>away; and rather than ye should be heartily displeased with me I would</a>
<a id='line_10689'>ye had her, an she would abide with you. Nay, said the lady, so God me</a>
<a id='line_10690'>help I will never go with him; for he that I loved most I weened he had</a>
<a id='line_10691'>loved me. And therefore, Sir Tristram, she said, ride as thou came, for</a>
<a id='line_10692'>though thou haddest overcome this knight, as ye was likely, with thee</a>
<a id='line_10693'>never would I have gone. And I shall pray this knight so fair of his</a>
<a id='line_10694'>knighthood, that or ever he pass this country, that he will lead me to</a>
<a id='line_10695'>the abbey where my lord Sir Segwarides lieth. So God me help, said</a>
<a id='line_10696'>Bleoberis, I let you wit, good knight Sir Tristram, because King Mark</a>
<a id='line_10697'>gave me the choice of a gift in this court, and so this lady liked me</a>
<a id='line_10698'>best—notwithstanding, she is wedded and hath a lord, and I have</a>
<a id='line_10699'>fulfilled my quest, she shall be sent unto her husband again, and in</a>
<a id='line_10700'>especial most for your sake, Sir Tristram; and if she would go with you</a>
<a id='line_10701'>I would ye had her. I thank you, said Sir Tristram, but for her love I</a>
<a id='line_10702'>shall beware what manner a lady I shall love or trust; for had her</a>
<a id='line_10703'>lord, Sir Segwarides, been away from the court, I should have been the</a>
<a id='line_10704'>first that should have followed you; but sithen that ye have refused</a>
<a id='line_10705'>me, as I am true knight I shall her know passingly well that I shall</a>
<a id='line_10706'>love or trust. And so they took their leave one from the other and</a>
<a id='line_10707'>departed.</a>
<a id='line_10708'></a>
<a id='line_10709'>And so Sir Tristram rode unto Tintagil, and Sir Bleoberis rode unto the</a>
<a id='line_10710'>abbey where Sir Segwarides lay sore wounded, and there he delivered his</a>
<a id='line_10711'>lady, and departed as a noble knight; and when Sir Segwarides saw his</a>
<a id='line_10712'>lady, he was greatly comforted; and then she told him that Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_10713'>had done great battle with Sir Bleoberis, and caused him to bring her</a>
<a id='line_10714'>again. These words pleased Sir Segwarides right well, that Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_10715'>would do so much; and so that lady told all the battle unto King Mark</a>
<a id='line_10716'>betwixt Sir Tristram and Sir Bleoberis.</a>
<a id='line_10717'></a>
<a id='line_10718'></a>
<a id='line_10719'></a>
<a id='line_10720'>CHAPTER XIX. How King Mark sent Sir Tristram for La Beale Isoud toward</a>
<a id='line_10721'>Ireland, and how by fortune he arrived into England.</a>
<a id='line_10722'></a>
<a id='line_10723'>Then when this was done King Mark cast always in his heart how he might</a>
<a id='line_10724'>destroy Sir Tristram. And then he imagined in himself to send Sir</a>
<a id='line_10725'>Tristram into Ireland for La Beale Isoud. For Sir Tristram had so</a>
<a id='line_10726'>praised her beauty and her goodness that King Mark said that he would</a>
<a id='line_10727'>wed her, whereupon he prayed Sir Tristram to take his way into Ireland</a>
<a id='line_10728'>for him on message. And all this was done to the intent to slay Sir</a>
<a id='line_10729'>Tristram. Notwithstanding, Sir Tristram would not refuse the message</a>
<a id='line_10730'>for no danger nor peril that might fall, for the pleasure of his uncle,</a>
<a id='line_10731'>but to go he made him ready in the most goodliest wise that might be</a>
<a id='line_10732'>devised. For Sir Tristram took with him the most goodliest knights that</a>
<a id='line_10733'>he might find in the court; and they were arrayed, after the guise that</a>
<a id='line_10734'>was then used, in the goodliest manner. So Sir Tristram departed and</a>
<a id='line_10735'>took the sea with all his fellowship. And anon, as he was in the broad</a>
<a id='line_10736'>sea a tempest took him and his fellowship, and drove them back into the</a>
<a id='line_10737'>coast of England; and there they arrived fast by Camelot, and full fain</a>
<a id='line_10738'>they were to take the land.</a>
<a id='line_10739'></a>
<a id='line_10740'>And when they were landed Sir Tristram set up his pavilion upon the</a>
<a id='line_10741'>land of Camelot, and there he let hang his shield upon the pavilion.</a>
<a id='line_10742'>And that same day came two knights of King Arthur’s, that one was Sir</a>
<a id='line_10743'>Ector de Maris, and Sir Morganor. And they touched the shield, and bade</a>
<a id='line_10744'>him come out of the pavilion for to joust, an he would joust. Ye shall</a>
<a id='line_10745'>be answered, said Sir Tristram, an ye will tarry a little while. So he</a>
<a id='line_10746'>made him ready, and first he smote down Sir Ector de Maris, and after</a>
<a id='line_10747'>he smote down Sir Morganor, all with one spear, and sore bruised them.</a>
<a id='line_10748'>And when they lay upon the earth they asked Sir Tristram what he was,</a>
<a id='line_10749'>and of what country he was knight. Fair lords, said Sir Tristram, wit</a>
<a id='line_10750'>ye well that I am of Cornwall. Alas, said Sir Ector, now am I ashamed</a>
<a id='line_10751'>that ever any Cornish knight should overcome me. And then for despite</a>
<a id='line_10752'>Sir Ector put off his armour from him, and went on foot, and would not</a>
<a id='line_10753'>ride.</a>
<a id='line_10754'></a>
<a id='line_10755'></a>
<a id='line_10756'></a>
<a id='line_10757'>CHAPTER XX. How King Anguish of Ireland was summoned to come to King</a>
<a id='line_10758'>Arthur’s court for treason.</a>
<a id='line_10759'></a>
<a id='line_10760'>Then it fell that Sir Bleoberis and Sir Blamore de Ganis, that were</a>
<a id='line_10761'>brethren, they had summoned the King Anguish of Ireland for to come to</a>
<a id='line_10762'>Arthur’s court upon pain of forfeiture of King Arthur’s good grace. And</a>
<a id='line_10763'>if the King of Ireland came not in, at the day assigned and set, the</a>
<a id='line_10764'>king should lose his lands. So it happened that at the day assigned,</a>
<a id='line_10765'>King Arthur neither Sir Launcelot might not be there for to give the</a>
<a id='line_10766'>judgment, for King Arthur was with Sir Launcelot at the Castle Joyous</a>
<a id='line_10767'>Garde. And so King Arthur assigned King Carados and the King of Scots</a>
<a id='line_10768'>to be there that day as judges. So when the kings were at Camelot King</a>
<a id='line_10769'>Anguish of Ireland was come to know his accusers. Then was there Sir</a>
<a id='line_10770'>Blamore de Ganis, and appealed the King of Ireland of treason, that he</a>
<a id='line_10771'>had slain a cousin of his in his court in Ireland by treason. The king</a>
<a id='line_10772'>was sore abashed of his accusation, for-why he was come at the summons</a>
<a id='line_10773'>of King Arthur, and or he came at Camelot he wist not wherefore he was</a>
<a id='line_10774'>sent after. And when the king heard Sir Blamore say his will, he</a>
<a id='line_10775'>understood well there was none other remedy but for to answer him</a>
<a id='line_10776'>knightly; for the custom was such in those days, that an any man were</a>
<a id='line_10777'>appealed of any treason or murder he should fight body for body, or</a>
<a id='line_10778'>else to find another knight for him. And all manner of murders in those</a>
<a id='line_10779'>days were called treason.</a>
<a id='line_10780'></a>
<a id='line_10781'>So when King Anguish understood his accusing he was passing heavy, for</a>
<a id='line_10782'>he knew Sir Blamore de Ganis that he was a noble knight, and of noble</a>
<a id='line_10783'>knights come. Then the King of Ireland was simply purveyed of his</a>
<a id='line_10784'>answer; therefore the judges gave him respite by the third day to give</a>
<a id='line_10785'>his answer. So the king departed unto his lodging. The meanwhile there</a>
<a id='line_10786'>came a lady by Sir Tristram’s pavilion making great dole. What aileth</a>
<a id='line_10787'>you, said Sir Tristram, that ye make such dole? Ah, fair knight, said</a>
<a id='line_10788'>the lady, I am ashamed unless that some good knight help me; for a</a>
<a id='line_10789'>great lady of worship sent by me a fair child and a rich, unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_10790'>Launcelot du Lake, and hereby there met with me a knight, and threw me</a>
<a id='line_10791'>down from my palfrey, and took away the child from me. Well, my lady,</a>
<a id='line_10792'>said Sir Tristram, and for my lord Sir Launcelot’s sake I shall get you</a>
<a id='line_10793'>that child again, or else I shall be beaten for it. And so Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_10794'>took his horse, and asked the lady which way the knight rode; and then</a>
<a id='line_10795'>she told him. And he rode after him, and within a while he overtook</a>
<a id='line_10796'>that knight. And then Sir Tristram bade him turn and give again the</a>
<a id='line_10797'>child.</a>
<a id='line_10798'></a>
<a id='line_10799'></a>
<a id='line_10800'></a>
<a id='line_10801'>CHAPTER XXI. How Sir Tristram rescued a child from a knight, and how</a>
<a id='line_10802'>Gouvernail told him of King Anguish.</a>
<a id='line_10803'></a>
<a id='line_10804'>The knight turned his horse and made him ready to fight. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_10805'>Tristram smote him with a sword such a buffet that he tumbled to the</a>
<a id='line_10806'>earth. And then he yielded him unto Sir Tristram. Then come thy way,</a>
<a id='line_10807'>said Sir Tristram, and bring the child to the lady again. So he took</a>
<a id='line_10808'>his horse meekly and rode with Sir Tristram; and then by the way Sir</a>
<a id='line_10809'>Tristram asked him his name. Then he said, My name is Breuse Saunce</a>
<a id='line_10810'>Pité. So when he had delivered that child to the lady, he said: Sir, as</a>
<a id='line_10811'>in this the child is well remedied. Then Sir Tristram let him go again</a>
<a id='line_10812'>that sore repented him after, for he was a great foe unto many good</a>
<a id='line_10813'>knights of King Arthur’s court.</a>
<a id='line_10814'></a>
<a id='line_10815'>Then when Sir Tristram was in his pavilion Gouvernail, his man, came</a>
<a id='line_10816'>and told him how that King Anguish of Ireland was come thither, and he</a>
<a id='line_10817'>was put in great distress; and there Gouvernail told Sir Tristram how</a>
<a id='line_10818'>King Anguish was summoned and appealed of murder. So God me help, said</a>
<a id='line_10819'>Sir Tristram, these be the best tidings that ever came to me this seven</a>
<a id='line_10820'>years, for now shall the King of Ireland have need of my help; for I</a>
<a id='line_10821'>daresay there is no knight in this country that is not of Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_10822'>court dare do battle with Sir Blamore de Ganis; and for to win the love</a>
<a id='line_10823'>of the King of Ireland I will take the battle upon me; and therefore</a>
<a id='line_10824'>Gouvernail bring me, I charge thee, to the king.</a>
<a id='line_10825'></a>
<a id='line_10826'>Then Gouvernail went unto King Anguish of Ireland, and saluted him</a>
<a id='line_10827'>fair. The king welcomed him and asked him what he would. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_10828'>Gouvernail, here is a knight near hand that desireth to speak with you:</a>
<a id='line_10829'>he bade me say he would do you service. What knight is he? said the</a>
<a id='line_10830'>king. Sir, said he, it is Sir Tristram de Liones, that for your good</a>
<a id='line_10831'>grace that ye showed him in your lands will reward you in this country.</a>
<a id='line_10832'>Come on, fellow, said the king, with me anon and show me unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_10833'>Tristram. So the king took a little hackney and but few fellowship with</a>
<a id='line_10834'>him, until he came unto Sir Tristram’s pavilion. And when Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_10835'>saw the king he ran unto him and would have holden his stirrup. But the</a>
<a id='line_10836'>king leapt from his horse lightly, and either halsed other in their</a>
<a id='line_10837'>arms. My gracious lord, said Sir Tristram, gramercy of your great</a>
<a id='line_10838'>goodnesses showed unto me in your marches and lands: and at that time I</a>
<a id='line_10839'>promised you to do you service an ever it lay in my power. And, gentle</a>
<a id='line_10840'>knight, said the king unto Sir Tristram, now have I great need of you,</a>
<a id='line_10841'>never had I so great need of no knight’s help. How so, my good lord?</a>
<a id='line_10842'>said Sir Tristram. I shall tell you, said the king: I am summoned and</a>
<a id='line_10843'>appealed from my country for the death of a knight that was kin unto</a>
<a id='line_10844'>the good knight Sir Launcelot; wherefore Sir Blamore de Ganis, brother</a>
<a id='line_10845'>to Sir Bleoberis hath appealed me to fight with him, outher to find a</a>
<a id='line_10846'>knight in my stead. And well I wot, said the king, these that are come</a>
<a id='line_10847'>of King Ban’s blood, as Sir Launcelot and these other, are passing good</a>
<a id='line_10848'>knights, and hard men for to win in battle as any that I know now</a>
<a id='line_10849'>living. Sir, said Sir Tristram, for the good lordship ye showed me in</a>
<a id='line_10850'>Ireland, and for my lady your daughter’s sake, La Beale Isoud, I will</a>
<a id='line_10851'>take the battle for you upon this condition that ye shall grant me two</a>
<a id='line_10852'>things: that one is that ye shall swear to me that ye are in the right,</a>
<a id='line_10853'>that ye were never consenting to the knight’s death; Sir, then said Sir</a>
<a id='line_10854'>Tristram, when that I have done this battle, if God give me grace that</a>
<a id='line_10855'>I speed, that ye shall give me a reward, what thing reasonable that I</a>
<a id='line_10856'>will ask of you. So God me help, said the king, ye shall have</a>
<a id='line_10857'>whatsomever ye will ask. It is well said, said Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_10858'></a>
<a id='line_10859'></a>
<a id='line_10860'></a>
<a id='line_10861'>CHAPTER XXII. How Sir Tristram fought for Sir Anguish and overcame his</a>
<a id='line_10862'>adversary, and how his adversary would never yield him.</a>
<a id='line_10863'></a>
<a id='line_10864'>Now make your answer that your champion is ready, for I shall die in</a>
<a id='line_10865'>your quarrel rather than to be recreant. I have no doubt of you, said</a>
<a id='line_10866'>the king, that, an ye should have ado with Sir Launcelot du Lake— Sir,</a>
<a id='line_10867'>said Sir Tristram, as for Sir Launcelot, he is called the noblest</a>
<a id='line_10868'>knight of the world, and wit ye well that the knights of his blood are</a>
<a id='line_10869'>noble men, and dread shame; and as for Bleoberis, brother unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_10870'>Blamore, I have done battle with him, therefore upon my head it is no</a>
<a id='line_10871'>shame to call him a good knight. It is noised, said the king, that</a>
<a id='line_10872'>Blamore is the hardier knight. Sir, as for that let him be, he shall</a>
<a id='line_10873'>never be refused, an as he were the best knight that now beareth shield</a>
<a id='line_10874'>or spear.</a>
<a id='line_10875'></a>
<a id='line_10876'>So King Anguish departed unto King Carados and the kings that were that</a>
<a id='line_10877'>time as judges, and told them that he had found his champion ready.</a>
<a id='line_10878'>Then by the commandment of the kings Sir Blamore de Ganis and Sir</a>
<a id='line_10879'>Tristram were sent for to hear the charge. And when they were come</a>
<a id='line_10880'>before the judges there were many kings and knights beheld Sir</a>
<a id='line_10881'>Tristram, and much speech they had of him because that he slew Sir</a>
<a id='line_10882'>Marhaus, the good knight, and because he for-jousted Sir Palamides the</a>
<a id='line_10883'>good knight. So when they had taken their charge they withdrew them to</a>
<a id='line_10884'>make them ready to do battle.</a>
<a id='line_10885'></a>
<a id='line_10886'>Then said Sir Bleoberis unto his brother, Sir Blamore: Fair dear</a>
<a id='line_10887'>brother, remember of what kin we be come of, and what a man is Sir</a>
<a id='line_10888'>Launcelot du Lake, neither farther nor nearer but brother’s children,</a>
<a id='line_10889'>and there was never none of our kin that ever was shamed in battle; and</a>
<a id='line_10890'>rather suffer death, brother, than to be shamed. Brother, said Blamore,</a>
<a id='line_10891'>have ye no doubt of me, for I shall never shame none of my blood;</a>
<a id='line_10892'>howbeit I am sure that yonder knight is called a passing good knight as</a>
<a id='line_10893'>of his time one of the world, yet shall I never yield me, nor say the</a>
<a id='line_10894'>loath word: well may he happen to smite me down with his great might of</a>
<a id='line_10895'>chivalry, but rather shall he slay me than I shall yield me as</a>
<a id='line_10896'>recreant. God speed you well, said Sir Bleoberis, for ye shall find him</a>
<a id='line_10897'>the mightiest knight that ever ye had ado withal, for I know him, for I</a>
<a id='line_10898'>have had ado with him. God me speed, said Sir Blamore de Ganis; and</a>
<a id='line_10899'>therewith he took his horse at the one end of the lists, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_10900'>Tristram at the other end of the lists, and so they feutred their</a>
<a id='line_10901'>spears and came together as it had been thunder; and there Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_10902'>through great might smote down Sir Blamore and his horse to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_10903'>Then anon Sir Blamore avoided his horse and pulled out his sword and</a>
<a id='line_10904'>threw his shield afore him, and bade Sir Tristram alight: For though an</a>
<a id='line_10905'>horse hath failed me, I trust to God the earth will not fail me. And</a>
<a id='line_10906'>then Sir Tristram alighted, and dressed him unto battle; and there they</a>
<a id='line_10907'>lashed together strongly as racing and tracing, foining and dashing,</a>
<a id='line_10908'>many sad strokes, that the kings and knights had great wonder that they</a>
<a id='line_10909'>might stand; for ever they fought like wood men, so that there was</a>
<a id='line_10910'>never knights seen fight more fiercely than they did; for Sir Blamore</a>
<a id='line_10911'>was so hasty that he would have no rest, that all men wondered that</a>
<a id='line_10912'>they had breath to stand on their feet; and all the place was bloody</a>
<a id='line_10913'>that they fought in. And at the last, Sir Tristram smote Sir Blamore</a>
<a id='line_10914'>such a buffet upon the helm that he there fell down upon his side, and</a>
<a id='line_10915'>Sir Tristram stood and beheld him.</a>

<a id='line_10920'>Sir Tristram spared him, and how they took appointment.</a>

<a id='line_10922'>Then when Sir Blamore might speak, he said thus: Sir Tristram de</a>

<a id='line_10924'>that ever I found, that thou wilt slay me out, for I would not live to</a>
<a id='line_10925'>be made lord of all the earth, for I have liefer die with worship than</a>
<a id='line_10926'>live with shame; and needs, Sir Tristram, thou must slay me, or else</a>
<a id='line_10927'>thou shalt never win the field, for I will never say the loath word.</a>
<a id='line_10928'>And therefore if thou dare slay me, slay me, I require thee. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_10929'>Tristram heard him say so knightly, he wist not what to do with him; he</a>
<a id='line_10930'>remembering him of both parties, of what blood he was come, and for Sir</a>
<a id='line_10931'>Launcelot’s sake he would be loath to slay him; and in the other party</a>
<a id='line_10932'>in no wise he might not choose, but that he must make him to say the</a>
<a id='line_10933'>loath word, or else to slay him.</a>
<a id='line_10934'></a>
<a id='line_10935'>Then Sir Tristram stert aback, and went to the kings that were judges,</a>
<a id='line_10936'>and there he kneeled down to-fore them, and besought them for their</a>
<a id='line_10937'>worships, and for King Arthur’s and Sir Launcelot’s sake, that they</a>
<a id='line_10938'>would take this matter in their hands. For, my fair lords, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_10939'>Tristram, it were shame and pity that this noble knight that yonder</a>
<a id='line_10940'>lieth should be slain; for ye hear well, shamed will he not be, and I</a>
<a id='line_10941'>pray to God that he never be slain nor shamed for me. And as for the</a>
<a id='line_10942'>king for whom I fight for, I shall require him, as I am his true</a>
<a id='line_10943'>champion and true knight in this field, that he will have mercy upon</a>
<a id='line_10944'>this good knight. So God me help, said King Anguish, I will for your</a>
<a id='line_10945'>sake; Sir Tristram, be ruled as ye will have me, for I know you for my</a>
<a id='line_10946'>true knight; and therefore I will heartily pray the kings that be here</a>
<a id='line_10947'>as judges to take it in their hands. And the kings that were judges</a>
<a id='line_10948'>called Sir Bleoberis to them, and asked him his advice. My lords, said</a>
<a id='line_10949'>Bleoberis, though my brother be beaten, and hath the worse through</a>
<a id='line_10950'>might of arms, I dare say, though Sir Tristram hath beaten his body he</a>
<a id='line_10951'>hath not beaten his heart, and I thank God he is not shamed this day;</a>
<a id='line_10952'>and rather than he should be shamed I require you, said Bleoberis, let</a>
<a id='line_10953'>Sir Tristram slay him out. It shall not be so, said the kings, for his</a>
<a id='line_10954'>part adversary, both the king and the champion, have pity of Sir</a>
<a id='line_10955'>Blamore’s knighthood. My lords, said Bleoberis, I will right well as ye</a>
<a id='line_10956'>will.</a>
<a id='line_10957'></a>
<a id='line_10958'>Then the kings called the King of Ireland, and found him goodly and</a>
<a id='line_10959'>treatable. And then, by all their advices, Sir Tristram and Sir</a>
<a id='line_10960'>Bleoberis took up Sir Blamore, and the two brethren were accorded with</a>
<a id='line_10961'>King Anguish, and kissed and made friends for ever. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_10962'>Blamore and Sir Tristram kissed together, and there they made their</a>
<a id='line_10963'>oaths that they would never none of them two brethren fight with Sir</a>
<a id='line_10964'>Tristram, and Sir Tristram made the same oath. And for that gentle</a>
<a id='line_10965'>battle all the blood of Sir Launcelot loved Sir Tristram for ever.</a>
<a id='line_10966'></a>
<a id='line_10967'>Then King Anguish and Sir Tristram took their leave, and sailed into</a>
<a id='line_10968'>Ireland with great noblesse and joy. So when they were in Ireland the</a>
<a id='line_10969'>king let make it known throughout all the land how and in what manner</a>
<a id='line_10970'>Sir Tristram had done for him. Then the queen and all that there were</a>
<a id='line_10971'>made the most of him that they might. But the joy that La Beale Isoud</a>
<a id='line_10972'>made of Sir Tristram there might no tongue tell, for of all men earthly</a>
<a id='line_10973'>she loved him most.</a>
<a id='line_10974'></a>
<a id='line_10975'></a>
<a id='line_10976'></a>
<a id='line_10977'>CHAPTER XXIV. How Sir Tristram demanded La Beale Isoud for King Mark,</a>
<a id='line_10978'>and how Sir Tristram and Isoud drank the love drink.</a>
<a id='line_10979'></a>
<a id='line_10980'>Then upon a day King Anguish asked Sir Tristram why he asked not his</a>
<a id='line_10981'>boon, for whatsomever he had promised him he should have it without</a>
<a id='line_10982'>fail. Sir, said Sir Tristram, now is it time; this is all that I will</a>
<a id='line_10983'>desire, that ye will give me La Beale Isoud, your daughter, not for</a>
<a id='line_10984'>myself, but for mine uncle, King Mark, that shall have her to wife, for</a>
<a id='line_10985'>so have I promised him. Alas, said the king, I had liefer than all the</a>
<a id='line_10986'>land that I have ye would wed her yourself. Sir, an I did then I were</a>
<a id='line_10987'>shamed for ever in this world, and false of my promise. Therefore, said</a>
<a id='line_10988'>Sir I Tristram, I pray you hold your promise that ye promised me; for</a>
<a id='line_10989'>this is my desire, that ye will give me La Beale Isoud to go with me</a>
<a id='line_10990'>into Cornwall for to be wedded to King Mark, mine uncle. As for that,</a>
<a id='line_10991'>said King Anguish, ye shall have her with you to do with her what it</a>
<a id='line_10992'>please you; that is for to say if that ye list to wed her yourself,</a>
<a id='line_10993'>that is me liefest, and if ye will give her unto King Mark, your uncle,</a>
<a id='line_10994'>that is in your choice. So, to make short conclusion, La Beale Isoud</a>
<a id='line_10995'>was made ready to go with Sir Tristram, and Dame Bragwaine went with</a>
<a id='line_10996'>her for her chief gentlewoman, with many other.</a>
<a id='line_10997'></a>
<a id='line_10998'>Then the queen, Isoud’s mother, gave to her and Dame Bragwaine, her</a>
<a id='line_10999'>daughter’s gentlewoman, and unto Gouvernail, a drink, and charged them</a>
<a id='line_11000'>that what day King Mark should wed, that same day they should give him</a>
<a id='line_11001'>that drink, so that King Mark should drink to La Beale Isoud, and then,</a>
<a id='line_11002'>said the queen, I undertake either shall love other the days of their</a>
<a id='line_11003'>life. So this drink was given unto Dame Bragwaine, and unto Gouvernail.</a>
<a id='line_11004'>And then anon Sir Tristram took the sea, and La Beale Isoud; and when</a>
<a id='line_11005'>they were in their cabin, it happed so that they were thirsty, and they</a>
<a id='line_11006'>saw a little flasket of gold stand by them, and it seemed by the colour</a>
<a id='line_11007'>and the taste that it was noble wine. Then Sir Tristram took the</a>
<a id='line_11008'>flasket in his hand, and said, Madam Isoud, here is the best drink that</a>
<a id='line_11009'>ever ye drank, that Dame Bragwaine, your maiden, and Gouvernail, my</a>
<a id='line_11010'>servant, have kept for themselves. Then they laughed and made good</a>
<a id='line_11011'>cheer, and either drank to other freely, and they thought never drink</a>
<a id='line_11012'>that ever they drank to other was so sweet nor so good. But by that</a>
<a id='line_11013'>their drink was in their bodies, they loved either other so well that</a>
<a id='line_11014'>never their love departed for weal neither for woe. And thus it happed</a>
<a id='line_11015'>the love first betwixt Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud, the which love</a>
<a id='line_11016'>never departed the days of their life.</a>
<a id='line_11017'></a>
<a id='line_11018'>So then they sailed till by fortune they came nigh a castle that hight</a>
<a id='line_11019'>Pluere, and thereby arrived for to repose them, weening to them to have</a>
<a id='line_11020'>had good harbourage. But anon as Sir Tristram was within the castle</a>
<a id='line_11021'>they were taken prisoners; for the custom of the castle was such; who</a>
<a id='line_11022'>that rode by that castle and brought any lady, he must needs fight with</a>
<a id='line_11023'>the lord, that hight Breunor. And if it were so that Breunor won the</a>
<a id='line_11024'>field, then should the knight stranger and his lady be put to death,</a>
<a id='line_11025'>what that ever they were; and if it were so that the strange knight won</a>
<a id='line_11026'>the field of Sir Breunor, then should he die and his lady both. This</a>
<a id='line_11027'>custom was used many winters, for it was called the Castle Pluere, that</a>
<a id='line_11028'>is to say the Weeping Castle.</a>
<a id='line_11029'></a>
<a id='line_11030'></a>
<a id='line_11031'></a>
<a id='line_11032'>CHAPTER XXV. How Sir Tristram and Isoud were in prison, and how he</a>
<a id='line_11033'>fought for her beauty, and smote off another lady’s head.</a>
<a id='line_11034'></a>
<a id='line_11035'>Thus as Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud were in prison, it happed a</a>
<a id='line_11036'>knight and a lady came unto them where they were, to cheer them. I have</a>
<a id='line_11037'>marvel, said Tristram unto the knight and the lady, what is the cause</a>
<a id='line_11038'>the lord of this castle holdeth us in prison: it was never the custom</a>
<a id='line_11039'>of no place of worship that ever I came in, when a knight and a lady</a>
<a id='line_11040'>asked harbour, and they to receive them, and after to destroy them that</a>
<a id='line_11041'>be his guests. Sir, said the knight, this is the old custom of this</a>
<a id='line_11042'>castle, that when a knight cometh here he must needs fight with our</a>
<a id='line_11043'>lord, and he that is weaker must lose his head. And when that is done,</a>
<a id='line_11044'>if his lady that he bringeth be fouler than our lord’s wife, she must</a>
<a id='line_11045'>lose her head: and if she be fairer proved than is our lady, then shall</a>
<a id='line_11046'>the lady of this castle lose her head. So God me help, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11047'>Tristram, this is a foul custom and a shameful. But one advantage have</a>
<a id='line_11048'>I, said Sir Tristram, I have a lady is fair enough, fairer saw I never</a>
<a id='line_11049'>in all my life-days, and I doubt not for lack of beauty she shall not</a>
<a id='line_11050'>lose her head; and rather than I should lose my head I will fight for</a>
<a id='line_11051'>it on a fair field. Wherefore, sir knight, I pray you tell your lord</a>
<a id='line_11052'>that I will be ready as to-morn with my lady, and myself to do battle,</a>
<a id='line_11053'>if it be so I may have my horse and mine armour. Sir, said that knight,</a>
<a id='line_11054'>I undertake that your desire shall be sped right well. And then he</a>
<a id='line_11055'>said: Take your rest, and look that ye be up betimes and make you ready</a>
<a id='line_11056'>and your lady, for ye shall want no thing that you behoveth. And</a>
<a id='line_11057'>therewith he departed, and on the morn betimes that same knight came to</a>
<a id='line_11058'>Sir Tristram, and fetched him out and his lady, and brought him horse</a>
<a id='line_11059'>and armour that was his own, and bade him make him ready to the field,</a>
<a id='line_11060'>for all the estates and commons of that lordship were there ready to</a>
<a id='line_11061'>behold that battle and judgment.</a>
<a id='line_11062'></a>
<a id='line_11063'>Then came Sir Breunor, the lord of that castle, with his lady in his</a>
<a id='line_11064'>hand, muffled, and asked Sir Tristram where was his lady: For an thy</a>
<a id='line_11065'>lady be fairer than mine, with thy sword smite off my lady’s head; and</a>
<a id='line_11066'>if my lady be fairer than thine, with my sword I must strike off her</a>
<a id='line_11067'>head. And if I may win thee, yet shall thy lady be mine, and thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_11068'>lose thy head. Sir, said Tristram, this is a foul custom and horrible;</a>
<a id='line_11069'>and rather than my lady should lose her head, yet had I liefer lose my</a>
<a id='line_11070'>head. Nay, nay, said Sir Breunor, the ladies shall be first showed</a>
<a id='line_11071'>together, and the one shall have her judgment. Nay, I will not so, said</a>
<a id='line_11072'>Sir Tristram, for here is none that will give righteous judgment. But I</a>
<a id='line_11073'>doubt not, said Sir Tristram, my lady is fairer than thine, and that</a>
<a id='line_11074'>will I prove and make good with my hand. And whosomever he be that will</a>
<a id='line_11075'>say the contrary I will prove it on his head. And therewith Sir</a>
<a id='line_11076'>Tristram showed La Beale Isoud, and turned her thrice about with his</a>
<a id='line_11077'>naked sword in his hand. And when Sir Breunor saw that, he did the same</a>
<a id='line_11078'>wise turn his lady. But when Sir Breunor beheld La Beale Isoud, him</a>
<a id='line_11079'>thought he saw never a fairer lady, and then he dread his lady’s head</a>
<a id='line_11080'>should be off. And so all the people that were there present gave</a>
<a id='line_11081'>judgment that La Beale Isoud was the fairer lady and the better made.</a>
<a id='line_11082'>How now, said Sir Tristram, meseemeth it were pity that my lady should</a>
<a id='line_11083'>lose her head, but because thou and she of long time have used this</a>
<a id='line_11084'>wicked custom, and by you both have many good knights and ladies been</a>
<a id='line_11085'>destroyed, for that cause it were no loss to destroy you both. So God</a>
<a id='line_11086'>me help, said Sir Breunor, for to say the sooth, thy lady is fairer</a>
<a id='line_11087'>than mine, and that me sore repenteth. And so I hear the people privily</a>
<a id='line_11088'>say, for of all women I saw none so fair; and therefore, an thou wilt</a>
<a id='line_11089'>slay my lady, I doubt not but I shall slay thee and have thy lady. Thou</a>
<a id='line_11090'>shalt win her, said Sir Tristram, as dear as ever knight won lady. And</a>
<a id='line_11091'>because of thine own judgment, as thou wouldst have done to my lady if</a>
<a id='line_11092'>that she had been fouler, and because of the evil custom, give me thy</a>
<a id='line_11093'>lady, said Sir Tristram. And therewithal Sir Tristram strode unto him</a>
<a id='line_11094'>and took his lady from him, and with an awk stroke he smote off her</a>
<a id='line_11095'>head clean. Well, knight, said Sir Breunor, now hast thou done me a</a>
<a id='line_11096'>despite.</a>
<a id='line_11097'></a>
<a id='line_11098'></a>
<a id='line_11099'></a>
<a id='line_11100'>CHAPTER XXVI. How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Breunor, and at the last</a>
<a id='line_11101'>smote off his head.</a>
<a id='line_11102'></a>
<a id='line_11103'>Now take thine horse: sithen I am ladyless I will win thy lady an I</a>
<a id='line_11104'>may.</a>
<a id='line_11105'></a>
<a id='line_11106'>Then they took their horses and came together as it had been the</a>
<a id='line_11107'>thunder; and Sir Tristram smote Sir Breunor clean from his horse, and</a>
<a id='line_11108'>lightly he rose up; and as Sir Tristram came again by him he thrust his</a>
<a id='line_11109'>horse throughout both the shoulders, that his horse hurled here and</a>
<a id='line_11110'>there and fell dead to the ground. And ever Sir Breunor ran after to</a>
<a id='line_11111'>have slain Sir Tristram, but Sir Tristram was light and nimble, and</a>
<a id='line_11112'>voided his horse lightly. And or ever Sir Tristram might dress his</a>
<a id='line_11113'>shield and his sword the other gave him three or four sad strokes. Then</a>
<a id='line_11114'>they rushed together like two boars, tracing and traversing mightily</a>
<a id='line_11115'>and wisely as two noble knights. For this Sir Breunor was a proved</a>
<a id='line_11116'>knight, and had been or then the death of many good knights, that it</a>
<a id='line_11117'>was pity that he had so long endured.</a>
<a id='line_11118'></a>
<a id='line_11119'>Thus they fought, hurling here and there nigh two hours, and either</a>
<a id='line_11120'>were wounded sore. Then at the last Sir Breunor rashed upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_11121'>Tristram and took him in his arms, for he trusted much in his strength.</a>
<a id='line_11122'>Then was Sir Tristram called the strongest and the highest knight of</a>
<a id='line_11123'>the world; for he was called bigger than Sir Launcelot, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_11124'>Launcelot was better breathed. So anon Sir Tristram thrust Sir Breunor</a>
<a id='line_11125'>down grovelling, and then he unlaced his helm and struck off his head.</a>
<a id='line_11126'>And then all they that longed to the castle came to him, and did him</a>
<a id='line_11127'>homage and fealty, praying him that he would abide there still a little</a>
<a id='line_11128'>while to fordo that foul custom. Sir Tristram granted thereto. The</a>
<a id='line_11129'>meanwhile one of the knights of the castle rode unto Sir Galahad, the</a>
<a id='line_11130'>haut prince, the which was Sir Breunor’s son, which was a noble knight,</a>
<a id='line_11131'>and told him what misadventure his father had and his mother.</a>

<a id='line_11135'>CHAPTER XXVII. How Sir Galahad fought with Sir Tristram, and how Sir</a>
<a id='line_11136'>Tristram yielded him and promised to fellowship with Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_11137'></a>
<a id='line_11138'>Then came Sir Galahad, and the King with the Hundred Knights with him;</a>
<a id='line_11139'>and this Sir Galahad proffered to fight with Sir Tristram hand for</a>
<a id='line_11140'>hand. And so they made them ready to go unto battle on horseback with</a>
<a id='line_11141'>great courage. Then Sir Galahad and Sir Tristram met together so hard</a>
<a id='line_11142'>that either bare other down, horse and all, to the earth. And then they</a>
<a id='line_11143'>avoided their horses as noble knights, and dressed their shields, and</a>
<a id='line_11144'>drew their swords with ire and rancour, and they lashed together many</a>
<a id='line_11145'>sad strokes, and one while striking, another while foining, tracing and</a>
<a id='line_11146'>traversing as noble knights; thus they fought long, near half a day,</a>
<a id='line_11147'>and either were sore wounded. At the last Sir Tristram waxed light and</a>
<a id='line_11148'>big, and doubled his strokes, and drove Sir Galahad aback on the one</a>
<a id='line_11149'>side and on the other, so that he was like to have been slain.</a>
<a id='line_11150'></a>
<a id='line_11151'>With that came the King with the Hundred Knights, and all that</a>
<a id='line_11152'>fellowship went fiercely upon Sir Tristram. When Sir Tristram saw them</a>
<a id='line_11153'>coming upon him, then he wist well he might not endure. Then as a wise</a>
<a id='line_11154'>knight of war, he said to Sir Galahad, the haut prince: Sir, ye show to</a>
<a id='line_11155'>me no knighthood, for to suffer all your men to have ado with me all at</a>
<a id='line_11156'>once; and as meseemeth ye be a noble knight of your hands it is great</a>
<a id='line_11157'>shame to you. So God me help, said Sir Galahad, there is none other way</a>
<a id='line_11158'>but thou must yield thee to me, other else to die, said Sir Galahad to</a>
<a id='line_11159'>Sir Tristram. I will rather yield me to you than die for that is more</a>
<a id='line_11160'>for the might of your men than of your hands. And therewithal Sir</a>
<a id='line_11161'>Tristram took his own sword by the point, and put the pommel in the</a>
<a id='line_11162'>hand of Sir Galahad.</a>
<a id='line_11163'></a>
<a id='line_11164'>Therewithal came the King with the Hundred Knights, and hard began to</a>
<a id='line_11165'>assail Sir Tristram. Let be, said Sir Galahad, be ye not so hardy to</a>
<a id='line_11166'>touch him, for I have given this knight his life. That is your shame,</a>
<a id='line_11167'>said the King with the Hundred Knights; hath he not slain your father</a>
<a id='line_11168'>and your mother? As for that, said Sir Galahad, I may not wite him</a>
<a id='line_11169'>greatly, for my father had him in prison, and enforced him to do battle</a>
<a id='line_11170'>with him; and my father had such a custom that was a shameful custom,</a>
<a id='line_11171'>that what knight came there to ask harbour his lady must needs die but</a>
<a id='line_11172'>if she were fairer than my mother; and if my father overcame that</a>
<a id='line_11173'>knight he must needs die. This was a shameful custom and usage, a</a>
<a id='line_11174'>knight for his harbour-asking to have such harbourage. And for this</a>
<a id='line_11175'>custom I would never draw about him. So God me help, said the King,</a>
<a id='line_11176'>this was a shameful custom. Truly, said Sir Galahad, so seemed me; and</a>
<a id='line_11177'>meseemed it had been great pity that this knight should have been</a>
<a id='line_11178'>slain, for I dare say he is the noblest man that beareth life, but if</a>
<a id='line_11179'>it were Sir Launcelot du Lake. Now, fair knight, said Sir Galahad, I</a>
<a id='line_11180'>require thee tell me thy name, and of whence thou art, and whither thou</a>
<a id='line_11181'>wilt. Sir, he said, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and from King</a>
<a id='line_11182'>Mark of Cornwall I was sent on message unto King Anguish of Ireland,</a>
<a id='line_11183'>for to fetch his daughter to be his wife, and here she is ready to go</a>
<a id='line_11184'>with me into Cornwall, and her name is La Beale Isoud. And, Sir</a>
<a id='line_11185'>Tristram, said Sir Galahad, the haut prince, well be ye found in these</a>
<a id='line_11186'>marches, and so ye will promise me to go unto Sir Launcelot du Lake,</a>
<a id='line_11187'>and accompany with him, ye shall go where ye will, and your fair lady</a>
<a id='line_11188'>with you; and I shall promise you never in all my days shall such</a>
<a id='line_11189'>customs be used in this castle as have been used. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11190'>Tristram, now I let you wit, so God me help, I weened ye had been Sir</a>
<a id='line_11191'>Launcelot du Lake when I saw you first, and therefore I dread you the</a>
<a id='line_11192'>more; and sir, I promise you, said Sir Tristram, as soon as I may I</a>
<a id='line_11193'>will see Sir Launcelot and in fellowship me with him; for of all the</a>
<a id='line_11194'>knights of the world I most desire his fellowship.</a>

<a id='line_11198'>CHAPTER XXVIII. How Sir Launcelot met with Sir Carados bearing away Sir</a>
<a id='line_11199'>Gawaine, and of the rescue of Sir Gawaine.</a>
<a id='line_11200'></a>
<a id='line_11201'>And then Sir Tristram took his leave when he saw his time, and took the</a>
<a id='line_11202'>sea. And in the meanwhile word came unto Sir Launcelot and to Sir</a>
<a id='line_11203'>Tristram that Sir Carados, the mighty king, that was made like a giant,</a>
<a id='line_11204'>fought with Sir Gawaine, and gave him such strokes that he swooned in</a>
<a id='line_11205'>his saddle, and after that he took him by the collar and pulled him out</a>
<a id='line_11206'>of his saddle, and fast bound him to the saddle-bow, and so rode his</a>
<a id='line_11207'>way with him toward his castle. And as he rode, by fortune Sir</a>
<a id='line_11208'>Launcelot met with Sir Carados, and anon he knew Sir Gawaine that lay</a>
<a id='line_11209'>bound after him. Ah, said Sir Launcelot unto Sir Gawaine, how stands it</a>
<a id='line_11210'>with you? Never so hard, said Sir Gawaine, unless that ye help me, for</a>
<a id='line_11211'>so God me help, without ye rescue me I know no knight that may, but</a>
<a id='line_11212'>outher you or Sir Tristram. Wherefore Sir Launcelot was heavy of Sir</a>
<a id='line_11213'>Gawaine’s words. And then Sir Launcelot bade Sir Carados: Lay down that</a>
<a id='line_11214'>knight and fight with me. Thou art but a fool, said Sir Carados, for I</a>
<a id='line_11215'>will serve you in the same wise. As for that, said Sir Launcelot, spare</a>
<a id='line_11216'>me not, for I warn thee I will not spare thee. And then he bound Sir</a>
<a id='line_11217'>Gawaine hand and foot, and so threw him to the ground. And then he gat</a>
<a id='line_11218'>his spear of his squire, and departed from Sir Launcelot to fetch his</a>
<a id='line_11219'>course. And so either met with other, and brake their spears to their</a>
<a id='line_11220'>hands; and then they pulled out swords, and hurtled together on</a>
<a id='line_11221'>horseback more than an hour. And at the last Sir Launcelot smote Sir</a>
<a id='line_11222'>Carados such a buffet upon the helm that it pierced his brain-pan. So</a>
<a id='line_11223'>then Sir Launcelot took Sir Carados by the collar and pulled him under</a>
<a id='line_11224'>his horse’s feet, and then he alighted and pulled off his helm and</a>
<a id='line_11225'>struck off his head. And then Sir Launcelot unbound Sir Gawaine. So</a>
<a id='line_11226'>this same tale was told to Sir Galahad and to Sir Tristram:—here may ye</a>
<a id='line_11227'>hear the nobleness that followeth Sir Launcelot. Alas, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11228'>Tristram, an I had not this message in hand with this fair lady, truly</a>
<a id='line_11229'>I would never stint or I had found Sir Launcelot. Then Sir Tristram and</a>
<a id='line_11230'>La Beale Isoud went to the sea and came into Cornwall, and there all</a>
<a id='line_11231'>the barons met them.</a>

<a id='line_11235'>CHAPTER XXIX. Of the wedding of King Mark to La Beale Isoud, and of</a>
<a id='line_11236'>Bragwaine her maid, and of Palamides.</a>
<a id='line_11237'></a>
<a id='line_11238'>And anon they were richly wedded with great noblesse. But ever, as the</a>
<a id='line_11239'>French book saith, Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud loved ever together.</a>
<a id='line_11240'>Then was there great jousts and great tourneying, and many lords and</a>
<a id='line_11241'>ladies were at that feast, and Sir Tristram was most praised of all</a>
<a id='line_11242'>other. Thus dured the feast long, and after the feast was done, within</a>
<a id='line_11243'>a little while after, by the assent of two ladies that were with Queen</a>
<a id='line_11244'>Isoud, they ordained for hate and envy for to destroy Dame Bragwaine,</a>
<a id='line_11245'>that was maiden and lady unto La Beale Isoud; and she was sent into the</a>
<a id='line_11246'>forest for to fetch herbs, and there she was met, and bound feet and</a>
<a id='line_11247'>hand to a tree, and so she was bounden three days. And by fortune, Sir</a>
<a id='line_11248'>Palamides found Dame Bragwaine, and there he delivered her from the</a>
<a id='line_11249'>death, and brought her to a nunnery there beside, for to be recovered.</a>
<a id='line_11250'>When Isoud the queen missed her maiden, wit ye well she was right heavy</a>
<a id='line_11251'>as ever was any queen, for of all earthly women she loved her best: the</a>
<a id='line_11252'>cause was for she came with her out of her country. And so upon a day</a>
<a id='line_11253'>Queen Isoud walked into the forest to put away her thoughts, and there</a>
<a id='line_11254'>she went herself unto a well and made great moan. And suddenly there</a>
<a id='line_11255'>came Palamides to her, and had heard all her complaint, and said: Madam</a>
<a id='line_11256'>Isoud, an ye will grant me my boon, I shall bring to you Dame Bragwaine</a>
<a id='line_11257'>safe and sound. And the queen was so glad of his proffer that suddenly</a>
<a id='line_11258'>unadvised she granted all his asking. Well, Madam, said Palamides, I</a>
<a id='line_11259'>trust to your promise, and if ye will abide here half an hour I shall</a>
<a id='line_11260'>bring her to you. I shall abide you, said La Beale Isoud. And Sir</a>
<a id='line_11261'>Palamides rode forth his way to that nunnery, and lightly he came again</a>
<a id='line_11262'>with Dame Bragwaine; but by her good will she would not have come</a>
<a id='line_11263'>again, because for love of the queen she stood in adventure of her</a>
<a id='line_11264'>life. Notwithstanding, half against her will, she went with Sir</a>
<a id='line_11265'>Palamides unto the queen. And when the queen saw her she was passing</a>
<a id='line_11266'>glad. Now, Madam, said Palamides, remember upon your promise, for I</a>
<a id='line_11267'>have fulfilled my promise. Sir Palamides, said the queen, I wot not</a>
<a id='line_11268'>what is your desire, but I will that ye wit, howbeit I promised you</a>
<a id='line_11269'>largely, I thought none evil, nor I warn you none evil will I do.</a>
<a id='line_11270'>Madam, said Sir Palamides, as at this time, ye shall not know my</a>
<a id='line_11271'>desire, but before my lord your husband there shall ye know that I will</a>
<a id='line_11272'>have my desire that ye have promised me. And therewith the queen</a>
<a id='line_11273'>departed, and rode home to the king, and Sir Palamides rode after her.</a>
<a id='line_11274'>And when Sir Palamides came before the king, he said: Sir King, I</a>
<a id='line_11275'>require you as ye be a righteous king, that ye will judge me the right.</a>
<a id='line_11276'>Tell me your cause, said the king, and ye shall have right.</a>

<a id='line_11280'>CHAPTER XXX. How Palamides demanded Queen Isoud, and how Lambegus rode</a>
<a id='line_11281'>after to rescue her, and of the escape of Isoud.</a>
<a id='line_11282'></a>
<a id='line_11283'>Sir, said Palamides, I promised your Queen Isoud to bring again Dame</a>
<a id='line_11284'>Bragwaine that she had lost, upon this covenant, that she should grant</a>
<a id='line_11285'>me a boon that I would ask, and without grudging, outher advisement,</a>
<a id='line_11286'>she granted me. What say ye, my lady? said the king. It is as he saith,</a>
<a id='line_11287'>so God me help, said the queen; to say thee sooth I promised him his</a>
<a id='line_11288'>asking for love and joy that I had to see her. Well, Madam, said the</a>
<a id='line_11289'>king, and if ye were hasty to grant him what boon he would ask, I will</a>
<a id='line_11290'>well that ye perform your promise. Then, said Palamides, I will that ye</a>
<a id='line_11291'>wit that I will have your queen to lead her and govern her whereas me</a>
<a id='line_11292'>list. Therewith the king stood still, and bethought him of Sir</a>
<a id='line_11293'>Tristram, and deemed that he would rescue her. And then hastily the</a>
<a id='line_11294'>king answered: Take her with the adventures that shall fall of it, for</a>
<a id='line_11295'>as I suppose thou wilt not enjoy her no while. As for that, said</a>
<a id='line_11296'>Palamides, I dare right well abide the adventure. And so, to make short</a>
<a id='line_11297'>tale, Sir Palamides took her by the hand and said: Madam, grudge not to</a>
<a id='line_11298'>go with me, for I desire nothing but your own promise. As for that,</a>
<a id='line_11299'>said the queen, I fear not greatly to go with thee, howbeit thou hast</a>
<a id='line_11300'>me at advantage upon my promise, for I doubt not I shall be</a>
<a id='line_11301'>worshipfully rescued from thee. As for that, said Sir Palamides, be it</a>
<a id='line_11302'>as it be may. So Queen Isoud was set behind Palamides, and rode his</a>
<a id='line_11303'>way.</a>
<a id='line_11304'></a>
<a id='line_11305'>Anon the king sent after Sir Tristram, but in no wise he could be</a>
<a id='line_11306'>found, for he was in the forest a-hunting; for that was always his</a>
<a id='line_11307'>custom, but if he used arms, to chase and to hunt in the forests. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_11308'>said the king, now I am shamed for ever, that by mine own assent my</a>
<a id='line_11309'>lady and my queen shall be devoured. Then came forth a knight, his name</a>
<a id='line_11310'>was Lambegus, and he was a knight of Sir Tristram. My lord, said this</a>
<a id='line_11311'>knight, sith ye have trust in my lord, Sir Tristram, wit ye well for</a>
<a id='line_11312'>his sake I will ride after your queen and rescue her, or else I shall</a>
<a id='line_11313'>be beaten. Gramercy, said the king, as I live, Sir Lambegus, I shall</a>
<a id='line_11314'>deserve it. And then Sir Lambegus armed him, and rode after as fast as</a>
<a id='line_11315'>he might. And then within a while he overtook Sir Palamides. And then</a>
<a id='line_11316'>Sir Palamides left the queen. What art thou, said Palamides, art thou</a>
<a id='line_11317'>Tristram? Nay, he said, I am his servant, and my name is Sir Lambegus.</a>
<a id='line_11318'>That me repenteth, said Palamides. I had liefer thou hadst been Sir</a>
<a id='line_11319'>Tristram. I believe you well, said Lambegus, but when thou meetest with</a>
<a id='line_11320'>Sir Tristram thou shalt have thy hands full. And then they hurtled</a>
<a id='line_11321'>together and all to-brast their spears, and then they pulled out their</a>
<a id='line_11322'>swords, and hewed on helms and hauberks. At the last Sir Palamides gave</a>
<a id='line_11323'>Sir Lambegus such a wound that he fell down like a dead knight to the</a>
<a id='line_11324'>earth.</a>
<a id='line_11325'></a>
<a id='line_11326'>Then he looked after La Beale Isoud, and then she was gone he nist</a>
<a id='line_11327'>where. Wit ye well Sir Palamides was never so heavy. So the queen ran</a>
<a id='line_11328'>into the forest, and there she found a well, and therein she had</a>
<a id='line_11329'>thought to have drowned herself. And as good fortune would, there came</a>
<a id='line_11330'>a knight to her that had a castle thereby, his name was Sir Adtherp.</a>
<a id='line_11331'>And when he found the queen in that mischief he rescued her, and</a>
<a id='line_11332'>brought her to his castle. And when he wist what she was he armed him,</a>
<a id='line_11333'>and took his horse, and said he would be avenged upon Palamides; and so</a>
<a id='line_11334'>he rode on till he met with him, and there Sir Palamides wounded him</a>
<a id='line_11335'>sore, and by force he made him to tell him the cause why he did battle</a>
<a id='line_11336'>with him, and how he had led the queen unto his castle. Now bring me</a>
<a id='line_11337'>there, said Palamides, or thou shalt die of my hands. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11338'>Adtherp, I am so wounded I may not follow, but ride you this way and it</a>
<a id='line_11339'>shall bring you into my castle, and there within is the queen. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_11340'>Palamides rode still till he came to the castle. And at a window La</a>
<a id='line_11341'>Beale Isoud saw Sir Palamides; then she made the gates to be shut</a>
<a id='line_11342'>strongly. And when he saw he might not come within the castle, he put</a>
<a id='line_11343'>off his bridle and his saddle, and put his horse to pasture, and set</a>
<a id='line_11344'>himself down at the gate like a man that was out of his wit that recked</a>
<a id='line_11345'>not of himself.</a>

<a id='line_11351'></a>
<a id='line_11352'>Now turn we unto Sir Tristram, that when he was come home and wist La</a>
<a id='line_11353'>Beale Isoud was gone with Sir Palamides, wit ye well he was wroth out</a>
<a id='line_11354'>of measure. Alas, said Sir Tristram, I am this day shamed. Then he</a>
<a id='line_11355'>cried to Gouvernail his man: Haste thee that I were armed and on</a>
<a id='line_11356'>horseback, for well I wot Lambegus hath no might nor strength to</a>
<a id='line_11357'>withstand Sir Palamides: alas that I have not been in his stead! So</a>
<a id='line_11358'>anon as he was armed and horsed Sir Tristram and Gouvernail rode after</a>
<a id='line_11359'>into the forest, and within a while he found his knight Lambegus almost</a>
<a id='line_11360'>wounded to the death; and Sir Tristram bare him to a forester, and</a>
<a id='line_11361'>charged him to keep him well. And then he rode forth, and there he</a>
<a id='line_11362'>found Sir Adtherp sore wounded, and he told him how the queen would</a>
<a id='line_11363'>have drowned herself had he not been, and how for her sake and love he</a>
<a id='line_11364'>had taken upon him to do battle with Sir Palamides. Where is my lady?</a>
<a id='line_11365'>said Sir Tristram. Sir, said the knight, she is sure enough within my</a>
<a id='line_11366'>castle, an she can hold her within it. Gramercy, said Sir Tristram, of</a>
<a id='line_11367'>thy great goodness. And so he rode till he came nigh to that castle;</a>
<a id='line_11368'>and then Sir Tristram saw where Sir Palamides sat at the gate sleeping,</a>
<a id='line_11369'>and his horse pastured fast afore him. Now go thou, Gouvernail, said</a>
<a id='line_11370'>Sir Tristram, and bid him awake, and make him ready. So Gouvernail rode</a>
<a id='line_11371'>unto him and said: Sir Palamides, arise, and take to thee thine</a>
<a id='line_11372'>harness. But he was in such a study he heard not what Gouvernail said.</a>
<a id='line_11373'>So Gouvernail came again and told Sir Tristram he slept, or else he was</a>
<a id='line_11374'>mad. Go thou again, said Sir Tristram, and bid him arise, and tell him</a>
<a id='line_11375'>that I am here, his mortal foe. So Gouvernail rode again and put upon</a>
<a id='line_11376'>him the butt of his spear, and said: Sir Palamides, make thee ready,</a>
<a id='line_11377'>for wit ye well Sir Tristram hoveth yonder, and sendeth thee word he is</a>
<a id='line_11378'>thy mortal foe. And therewithal Sir Palamides arose stilly, without</a>
<a id='line_11379'>words, and gat his horse, and saddled him and bridled him, and lightly</a>
<a id='line_11380'>he leapt upon, and gat his spear in his hand, and either feutred their</a>
<a id='line_11381'>spears and hurtled fast together; and there Tristram smote down Sir</a>
<a id='line_11382'>Palamides over his horse’s tail. Then lightly Sir Palamides put his</a>
<a id='line_11383'>shield afore him and drew his sword. And there began strong battle on</a>
<a id='line_11384'>both parts, for both they fought for the love of one lady, and ever she</a>
<a id='line_11385'>lay on the walls and beheld them how they fought out of measure, and</a>
<a id='line_11386'>either were wounded passing sore, but Palamides was much sorer wounded.</a>
<a id='line_11387'>Thus they fought tracing and traversing more than two hours, that</a>
<a id='line_11388'>well-nigh for dole and sorrow La Beale Isoud swooned. Alas, she said,</a>
<a id='line_11389'>that one I loved and yet do, and the other I love not, yet it were</a>
<a id='line_11390'>great pity that I should see Sir Palamides slain; for well I know by</a>
<a id='line_11391'>that time the end be done Sir Palamides is but a dead knight: because</a>
<a id='line_11392'>he is not christened I would be loath that he should die a Saracen. And</a>
<a id='line_11393'>therewithal she came down and besought Sir Tristram to fight no more.</a>
<a id='line_11394'>Ah, madam, said he, what mean you, will ye have me shamed? Well ye know</a>
<a id='line_11395'>I will be ruled by you. I will not your dishonour, said La Beale Isoud,</a>
<a id='line_11396'>but I would that ye would for my sake spare this unhappy Saracen</a>
<a id='line_11397'>Palamides. Madam, said Sir Tristram, I will leave fighting at this time</a>
<a id='line_11398'>for your sake. Then she said to Sir Palamides: This shall be your</a>
<a id='line_11399'>charge, that thou shalt go out of this country while I am therein. I</a>
<a id='line_11400'>will obey your commandment, said Sir Palamides, the which is sore</a>
<a id='line_11401'>against my will. Then take thy way, said La Beale Isoud, unto the court</a>
<a id='line_11402'>of King Arthur, and there recommend me unto Queen Guenever, and tell</a>
<a id='line_11403'>her that I send her word that there be within this land but four</a>

<a id='line_11412'>And so Sir Palamides departed with great heaviness. And Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_11413'>took the queen and brought her again to King Mark, and then was there</a>
<a id='line_11414'>made great joy of her home-coming. Who was cherished but Sir Tristram!</a>
<a id='line_11415'>Then Sir Tristram let fetch Sir Lambegus, his knight, from the</a>
<a id='line_11416'>forester’s house, and it was long or he was whole, but at the last he</a>
<a id='line_11417'>was well recovered. Thus they lived with joy and play a long while. But</a>
<a id='line_11418'>ever Sir Andred, that was nigh cousin to Sir Tristram, lay in a watch</a>
<a id='line_11419'>to wait betwixt Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud, for to take them and</a>
<a id='line_11420'>slander them. So upon a day Sir Tristram talked with La Beale Isoud in</a>
<a id='line_11421'>a window, and that espied Sir Andred, and told it to the King. Then</a>
<a id='line_11422'>King Mark took a sword in his hand and came to Sir Tristram, and called</a>
<a id='line_11423'>him false traitor, and would have stricken him. But Sir Tristram was</a>
<a id='line_11424'>nigh him, and ran under his sword, and took it out of his hand. And</a>
<a id='line_11425'>then the King cried: Where are my knights and my men? I charge you slay</a>
<a id='line_11426'>this traitor. But at that time there was not one would move for his</a>
<a id='line_11427'>words. When Sir Tristram saw that there was not one would be against</a>
<a id='line_11428'>him, he shook the sword to the king, and made countenance as though he</a>
<a id='line_11429'>would have stricken him. And then King Mark fled, and Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_11430'>followed him, and smote upon him five or six strokes flatling on the</a>
<a id='line_11431'>neck, that he made him to fall upon the nose. And then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_11432'>yede his way and armed him, and took his horse and his man, and so he</a>
<a id='line_11433'>rode into that forest.</a>
<a id='line_11434'></a>
<a id='line_11435'>And there upon a day Sir Tristram met with two brethren that were</a>
<a id='line_11436'>knights with King Mark, and there he struck off the head of the one,</a>
<a id='line_11437'>and wounded the other to the death; and he made him to bear his</a>
<a id='line_11438'>brother’s head in his helm unto the king, and thirty more there he</a>
<a id='line_11439'>wounded. And when that knight came before the king to say his message,</a>
<a id='line_11440'>he there died afore the king and the queen. Then King Mark called his</a>
<a id='line_11441'>council unto him, and asked advice of his barons what was best to do</a>
<a id='line_11442'>with Sir Tristram. Sir, said the barons, in especial Sir Dinas, the</a>
<a id='line_11443'>Seneschal, Sir, we will give you counsel for to send for Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_11444'>for we will that ye wit many men will hold with Sir Tristram an he were</a>
<a id='line_11445'>hard bestead. And sir, said Sir Dinas, ye shall understand that Sir</a>
<a id='line_11446'>Tristram is called peerless and makeless of any Christian knight, and</a>
<a id='line_11447'>of his might and hardiness we knew none so good a knight, but if it be</a>
<a id='line_11448'>Sir Launcelot du Lake. And if he depart from your court and go to King</a>
<a id='line_11449'>Arthur’s court, wit ye well he will get him such friends there that he</a>
<a id='line_11450'>will not set by your malice. And therefore, sir, I counsel you to take</a>
<a id='line_11451'>him to your grace. I will well, said the king, that he be sent for,</a>
<a id='line_11452'>that we may be friends. Then the barons sent for Sir Tristram under a</a>
<a id='line_11453'>safe conduct. And so when Sir Tristram came to the king he was welcome,</a>
<a id='line_11454'>and no rehearsal was made, and there was game and play. And then the</a>
<a id='line_11455'>king and the queen went a-hunting, and Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_11456'></a>
<a id='line_11457'></a>
<a id='line_11458'></a>
<a id='line_11459'>CHAPTER XXXIII. How Sir Lamorak jousted with thirty knights, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_11460'>Tristram at the request of King Mark smote his horse down.</a>
<a id='line_11461'></a>
<a id='line_11462'>The king and the queen made their pavilions and their tents in that</a>
<a id='line_11463'>forest beside a river, and there was daily hunting and jousting, for</a>
<a id='line_11464'>there were ever thirty knights ready to joust unto all them that came</a>
<a id='line_11465'>in at that time. And there by fortune came Sir Lamorak de Galis and Sir</a>
<a id='line_11466'>Driant; and there Sir Driant jousted right well, but at the last he had</a>
<a id='line_11467'>a fall. Then Sir Lamorak proffered to joust. And when he began he fared</a>
<a id='line_11468'>so with the thirty knights that there was not one of them but that he</a>
<a id='line_11469'>gave him a fall, and some of them were sore hurt. I marvel, said King</a>
<a id='line_11470'>Mark, what knight he is that doth such deeds of arms. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11471'>Tristram, I know him well for a noble knight as few now be living, and</a>
<a id='line_11472'>his name is Sir Lamorak de Galis. It were great shame, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_11473'>that he should go thus away, unless that some of you meet with him</a>
<a id='line_11474'>better. Sir, said Sir Tristram, meseemeth it were no worship for a</a>
<a id='line_11475'>noble man to have ado with him: and for because at this time he hath</a>
<a id='line_11476'>done over much for any mean knight living, therefore, as meseemeth, it</a>
<a id='line_11477'>were great shame and villainy to tempt him any more at this time,</a>
<a id='line_11478'>insomuch as he and his horse are weary both; for the deeds of arms that</a>
<a id='line_11479'>he hath done this day, an they be well considered, it were enough for</a>
<a id='line_11480'>Sir Launcelot du Lake. As for that, said King Mark, I require you, as</a>
<a id='line_11481'>ye love me and my lady the queen, La Beale Isoud, take your arms and</a>
<a id='line_11482'>joust with Sir Lamorak de Galis. Sir, said Sir Tristram, ye bid me do a</a>
<a id='line_11483'>thing that is against knighthood, and well I can deem that I shall give</a>
<a id='line_11484'>him a fall, for it is no mastery, for my horse and I be fresh both, and</a>
<a id='line_11485'>so is not his horse and he; and wit ye well that he will take it for</a>
<a id='line_11486'>great unkindness, for ever one good knight is loath to take another at</a>
<a id='line_11487'>disadvantage; but because I will not displease you, as ye require me so</a>
<a id='line_11488'>will I do, and obey your commandment.</a>
<a id='line_11489'></a>
<a id='line_11490'>And so Sir Tristram armed him and took his horse, and put him forth,</a>
<a id='line_11491'>and there Sir Lamorak met him mightily, and what with the might of his</a>
<a id='line_11492'>own spear, and of Sir Tristram’s spear, Sir Lamorak’s horse fell to the</a>
<a id='line_11493'>earth, and he sitting in the saddle. Then anon as lightly as he might</a>
<a id='line_11494'>he avoided the saddle and his horse, and put his shield afore him and</a>
<a id='line_11495'>drew his sword. And then he bade Sir Tristram: Alight, thou knight, an</a>
<a id='line_11496'>thou durst. Nay, said Sir Tristram, I will no more have ado with thee,</a>
<a id='line_11497'>for I have done to thee over much unto my dishonour and to thy worship.</a>
<a id='line_11498'>As for that, said Sir Lamorak, I can thee no thank; since thou hast</a>
<a id='line_11499'>for-jousted me on horseback I require thee and I beseech thee, an thou</a>
<a id='line_11500'>be Sir Tristram, fight with me on foot. I will not so, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11501'>Tristram; and wit ye well my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and well I</a>
<a id='line_11502'>know ye be Sir Lamorak de Galis, and this that I have done to you was</a>
<a id='line_11503'>against my will, but I was required thereto; but to say that I will do</a>
<a id='line_11504'>at your request as at this time, I will have no more ado with you, for</a>
<a id='line_11505'>me shameth of that I have done. As for the shame, said Sir Lamorak, on</a>
<a id='line_11506'>thy part or on mine, bear thou it an thou wilt, for though a mare’s son</a>
<a id='line_11507'>hath failed me, now a queen’s son shall not fail thee; and therefore,</a>
<a id='line_11508'>an thou be such a knight as men call thee, I require thee, alight, and</a>
<a id='line_11509'>fight with me. Sir Lamorak, said Sir Tristram, I understand your heart</a>
<a id='line_11510'>is great, and cause why ye have, to say thee sooth; for it would grieve</a>
<a id='line_11511'>me an any knight should keep him fresh and then to strike down a weary</a>
<a id='line_11512'>knight, for that knight nor horse was never formed that alway might</a>
<a id='line_11513'>stand or endure. And therefore, said Sir Tristram, I will not have ado</a>
<a id='line_11514'>with you, for me forthinketh of that I have done. As for that, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11515'>Lamorak, I shall quit you, an ever I see my time.</a>
<a id='line_11516'></a>
<a id='line_11517'></a>
<a id='line_11518'></a>
<a id='line_11519'>CHAPTER XXXIV. How Sir Lamorak sent an horn to King Mark in despite of</a>
<a id='line_11520'>Sir Tristram, and how Sir Tristram was driven into a chapel.</a>
<a id='line_11521'></a>
<a id='line_11522'>So he departed from him with Sir Driant, and by the way they met with a</a>
<a id='line_11523'>knight that was sent from Morgan le Fay unto King Arthur; and this</a>
<a id='line_11524'>knight had a fair horn harnessed with gold, and the horn had such a</a>
<a id='line_11525'>virtue that there might no lady nor gentlewoman drink of that horn but</a>
<a id='line_11526'>if she were true to her husband, and if she were false she should spill</a>
<a id='line_11527'>all the drink, and if she were true to her lord she might drink</a>
<a id='line_11528'>peaceable. And because of the Queen Guenever, and in the despite of Sir</a>
<a id='line_11529'>Launcelot, this horn was sent unto King Arthur; and by force Sir</a>
<a id='line_11530'>Lamorak made that knight to tell all the cause why he bare that horn.</a>
<a id='line_11531'>Now shalt thou bear this horn, said Lamorak, unto King Mark, or else</a>
<a id='line_11532'>choose thou to die for it; for I tell thee plainly, in despite and</a>
<a id='line_11533'>reproof of Sir Tristram thou shalt bear that horn unto King Mark, his</a>
<a id='line_11534'>uncle, and say thou to him that I sent it him for to assay his lady,</a>
<a id='line_11535'>and if she be true to him he shall prove her. So the knight went his</a>
<a id='line_11536'>way unto King Mark, and brought him that rich horn, and said that Sir</a>
<a id='line_11537'>Lamorak sent it him, and thereto he told him the virtue of that horn.</a>
<a id='line_11538'>Then the king made Queen Isoud to drink thereof, and an hundred ladies,</a>
<a id='line_11539'>and there were but four ladies of all those that drank clean. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_11540'>said King Mark, this is a great despite, and sware a great oath that</a>
<a id='line_11541'>she should be burnt and the other ladies.</a>
<a id='line_11542'></a>
<a id='line_11543'>Then the barons gathered them together, and said plainly they would not</a>
<a id='line_11544'>have those ladies burnt for an horn made by sorcery, that came from as</a>
<a id='line_11545'>false a sorceress and witch as then was living. For that horn did never</a>
<a id='line_11546'>good, but caused strife and debate, and always in her days she had been</a>
<a id='line_11547'>an enemy to all true lovers. So there were many knights made their</a>
<a id='line_11548'>avow, an ever they met with Morgan le Fay, that they would show her</a>
<a id='line_11549'>short courtesy. Also Sir Tristram was passing wroth that Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_11550'>sent that horn unto King Mark, for well he knew that it was done in the</a>
<a id='line_11551'>despite of him. And therefore he thought to quite Sir Lamorak.</a>
<a id='line_11552'></a>
<a id='line_11553'>Then Sir Tristram used daily and nightly to go to Queen Isoud when he</a>
<a id='line_11554'>might, and ever Sir Andred his cousin watched him night and day for to</a>
<a id='line_11555'>take him with La Beale Isoud. And so upon a night Sir Andred espied the</a>
<a id='line_11556'>hour and the time when Sir Tristram went to his lady. Then Sir Andred</a>
<a id='line_11557'>gat unto him twelve knights, and at midnight he set upon Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_11558'>secretly and suddenly and there Sir Tristram was taken naked abed with</a>
<a id='line_11559'>La Beale Isoud, and then was he bound hand and foot, and so was he kept</a>
<a id='line_11560'>until day. And then by the assent of King Mark, and of Sir Andred, and</a>
<a id='line_11561'>of some of the barons, Sir Tristram was led unto a chapel that stood</a>
<a id='line_11562'>upon the sea rocks, there for to take his judgment: and so he was led</a>
<a id='line_11563'>bounden with forty knights. And when Sir Tristram saw that there was</a>
<a id='line_11564'>none other boot but needs that he must die, then said he: Fair lords,</a>
<a id='line_11565'>remember what I have done for the country of Cornwall, and in what</a>
<a id='line_11566'>jeopardy I have been in for the weal of you all; for when I fought for</a>
<a id='line_11567'>the truage of Cornwall with Sir Marhaus, the good knight, I was</a>
<a id='line_11568'>promised for to be better rewarded, when ye all refused to take the</a>
<a id='line_11569'>battle; therefore, as ye be good gentle knights, see me not thus</a>
<a id='line_11570'>shamefully to die, for it is shame to all knighthood thus to see me</a>
<a id='line_11571'>die; for I dare say, said Sir Tristram, that I never met with no knight</a>
<a id='line_11572'>but I was as good as he, or better. Fie upon thee, said Sir Andred,</a>
<a id='line_11573'>false traitor that thou art, with thine avaunting; for all thy boast</a>
<a id='line_11574'>thou shalt die this day. O Andred, Andred, said Sir Tristram, thou</a>
<a id='line_11575'>shouldst be my kinsman, and now thou art to me full unfriendly, but an</a>
<a id='line_11576'>there were no more but thou and I, thou wouldst not put me to death.</a>
<a id='line_11577'>No! said Sir Andred, and therewith he drew his sword, and would have</a>
<a id='line_11578'>slain him.</a>
<a id='line_11579'></a>
<a id='line_11580'>When Sir Tristram saw him make such countenance he looked upon both his</a>
<a id='line_11581'>hands that were fast bounden unto two knights, and suddenly he pulled</a>
<a id='line_11582'>them both to him, and unwrast his hands, and then he leapt unto his</a>
<a id='line_11583'>cousin, Sir Andred, and wrested his sword out of his hands; then he</a>
<a id='line_11584'>smote Sir Andred that he fell to the earth, and so Sir Tristram fought</a>
<a id='line_11585'>till that he had killed ten knights. So then Sir Tristram gat the</a>
<a id='line_11586'>chapel and kept it mightily. Then the cry was great, and the people</a>
<a id='line_11587'>drew fast unto Sir Andred, mo than an hundred. When Sir Tristram saw</a>
<a id='line_11588'>the people draw unto him, he remembered he was naked, and sperd fast</a>
<a id='line_11589'>the chapel door, and brake the bars of a window, and so he leapt out</a>
<a id='line_11590'>and fell upon the crags in the sea. And so at that time Sir Andred nor</a>
<a id='line_11591'>none of his fellows might get to him, at that time.</a>
<a id='line_11592'></a>
<a id='line_11593'></a>
<a id='line_11594'></a>
<a id='line_11595'>CHAPTER XXXV. How Sir Tristram was holpen by his men, and of Queen</a>
<a id='line_11596'>Isoud which was put in a lazar-cote, and how Tristram was hurt.</a>
<a id='line_11597'></a>
<a id='line_11598'>So when they were departed, Gouvernail, and Sir Lambegus, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_11599'>Sentraille de Lushon, that were Sir Tristram’s men, sought their</a>
<a id='line_11600'>master. When they heard he was escaped then they were passing glad; and</a>
<a id='line_11601'>on the rocks they found him, and with towels they pulled him up. And</a>
<a id='line_11602'>then Sir Tristram asked them where was La Beale Isoud, for he weened</a>
<a id='line_11603'>she had been had away of Andred’s people. Sir, said Gouvernail, she is</a>
<a id='line_11604'>put in a lazar-cote. Alas, said Sir Tristram, this is a full ungoodly</a>
<a id='line_11605'>place for such a fair lady, and if I may she shall not be long there.</a>
<a id='line_11606'>And so he took his men and went thereas was La Beale Isoud, and fetched</a>
<a id='line_11607'>her away, and brought her into a forest to a fair manor, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_11608'>Tristram there abode with her. So the good knight bade his men go from</a>
<a id='line_11609'>him: For at this time I may not help you. So they departed all save</a>
<a id='line_11610'>Gouvernail. And so upon a day Sir Tristram yede into the forest for to</a>
<a id='line_11611'>disport him, and then it happened that there he fell sleep; and there</a>
<a id='line_11612'>came a man that Sir Tristram aforehand had slain his brother, and when</a>
<a id='line_11613'>this man had found him he shot him through the shoulder with an arrow,</a>
<a id='line_11614'>and Sir Tristram leapt up and killed that man. And in the meantime it</a>
<a id='line_11615'>was told King Mark how Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud were in that</a>
<a id='line_11616'>same manor, and as soon as ever he might thither he came with many</a>
<a id='line_11617'>knights to slay Sir Tristram. And when he came there he found him gone;</a>
<a id='line_11618'>and there he took La Beale Isoud home with him, and kept her strait</a>
<a id='line_11619'>that by no means never she might wit nor send unto Tristram, nor he</a>
<a id='line_11620'>unto her. And then when Sir Tristram came toward the old manor he found</a>
<a id='line_11621'>the track of many horses, and thereby he wist his lady was gone. And</a>
<a id='line_11622'>then Sir Tristram took great sorrow, and endured with great pain long</a>
<a id='line_11623'>time, for the arrow that he was hurt withal was envenomed.</a>
<a id='line_11624'></a>
<a id='line_11625'>Then by the mean of La Beale Isoud she told a lady that was cousin unto</a>
<a id='line_11626'>Dame Bragwaine, and she came to Sir Tristram, and told him that he</a>
<a id='line_11627'>might not be whole by no means. For thy lady, La Beale Isoud, may not</a>
<a id='line_11628'>help thee, therefore she biddeth you haste into Brittany to King Howel,</a>
<a id='line_11629'>and there ye shall find his daughter, Isoud la Blanche Mains, and she</a>
<a id='line_11630'>shall help thee. Then Sir Tristram and Gouvernail gat them shipping,</a>
<a id='line_11631'>and so sailed into Brittany. And when King Howel wist that it was Sir</a>
<a id='line_11632'>Tristram he was full glad of him. Sir, he said, I am come into this</a>
<a id='line_11633'>country to have help of your daughter, for it is told me that there is</a>
<a id='line_11634'>none other may heal me but she; and so within a while she healed him.</a>
<a id='line_11635'></a>
<a id='line_11636'></a>
<a id='line_11637'></a>
<a id='line_11638'>CHAPTER XXXVI. How Sir Tristram served in war King Howel of Brittany,</a>
<a id='line_11639'>and slew his adversary in the field.</a>
<a id='line_11640'></a>
<a id='line_11641'>There was an earl that hight Grip, and this earl made great war upon</a>
<a id='line_11642'>the king, and put the king to the worse, and besieged him. And on a</a>
<a id='line_11643'>time Sir Kehydius, that was son to King Howel, as he issued out he was</a>
<a id='line_11644'>sore wounded, nigh to the death. Then Gouvernail went to the king and</a>
<a id='line_11645'>said: Sir, I counsel you to desire my lord, Sir Tristram, as in your</a>
<a id='line_11646'>need to help you. I will do by your counsel, said the king. And so he</a>
<a id='line_11647'>yede unto Sir Tristram, and prayed him in his wars to help him: For my</a>
<a id='line_11648'>son, Sir Kehydius, may not go into the field. Sir, said Sir Tristram, I</a>
<a id='line_11649'>will go to the field and do what I may. Then Sir Tristram issued out of</a>
<a id='line_11650'>the town with such fellowship as he might make, and did such deeds that</a>
<a id='line_11651'>all Brittany spake of him. And then, at the last, by great might and</a>
<a id='line_11652'>force, he slew the Earl Grip with his own hands, and more than an</a>
<a id='line_11653'>hundred knights he slew that day. And then Sir Tristram was received</a>
<a id='line_11654'>worshipfully with procession. Then King Howel embraced him in his arms,</a>
<a id='line_11655'>and said: Sir Tristram, all my kingdom I will resign to thee. God</a>
<a id='line_11656'>defend, said Sir Tristram, for I am beholden unto you for your</a>
<a id='line_11657'>daughter’s sake to do for you.</a>
<a id='line_11658'></a>
<a id='line_11659'>Then by the great means of King Howel and Kehydius his son, by great</a>
<a id='line_11660'>proffers, there grew great love betwixt Isoud and Sir Tristram, for</a>
<a id='line_11661'>that lady was both good and fair, and a woman of noble blood and fame.</a>
<a id='line_11662'>And for because Sir Tristram had such cheer and riches, and all other</a>
<a id='line_11663'>pleasaunce that he had, almost he had forsaken La Beale Isoud. And so</a>
<a id='line_11664'>upon a time Sir Tristram agreed to wed Isoud la Blanche Mains. And at</a>
<a id='line_11665'>the last they were wedded, and solemnly held their marriage. And so</a>
<a id='line_11666'>when they were abed both Sir Tristram remembered him of his old lady La</a>
<a id='line_11667'>Beale Isoud. And then he took such a thought suddenly that he was all</a>
<a id='line_11668'>dismayed, and other cheer made he none but with clipping and kissing;</a>
<a id='line_11669'>as for other fleshly lusts Sir Tristram never thought nor had ado with</a>
<a id='line_11670'>her: such mention maketh the French book; also it maketh mention that</a>
<a id='line_11671'>the lady weened there had been no pleasure but kissing and clipping.</a>
<a id='line_11672'>And in the meantime there was a knight in Brittany, his name was</a>
<a id='line_11673'>Suppinabiles, and he came over the sea into England, and then he came</a>
<a id='line_11674'>into the court of King Arthur, and there he met with Sir Launcelot du</a>
<a id='line_11675'>Lake, and told him of the marriage of Sir Tristram. Then said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11676'>Launcelot: Fie upon him, untrue knight to his lady, that so noble a</a>
<a id='line_11677'>knight as Sir Tristram is should be found to his first lady false, La</a>
<a id='line_11678'>Beale Isoud, Queen of Cornwall; but say ye him this, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11679'>Launcelot, that of all knights in the world I loved him most, and had</a>
<a id='line_11680'>most joy of him, and all was for his noble deeds; and let him wit the</a>
<a id='line_11681'>love between him and me is done for ever, and that I give him warning</a>
<a id='line_11682'>from this day forth as his mortal enemy.</a>

<a id='line_11689'>Then departed Sir Suppinabiles unto Brittany again, and there he found</a>
<a id='line_11690'>Sir Tristram, and told him that he had been in King Arthur’s court.</a>
<a id='line_11691'>Then said Sir Tristram: Heard ye anything of me? So God me help, said</a>

<a id='line_11695'>That me repenteth, said Tristram, for of all knights I loved to be in</a>
<a id='line_11696'>his fellowship. So Sir Tristram made great moan and was ashamed that</a>
<a id='line_11697'>noble knights should defame him for the sake of his lady. And in this</a>
<a id='line_11698'>meanwhile La Beale Isoud made a letter unto Queen Guenever, complaining</a>
<a id='line_11699'>her of the untruth of Sir Tristram, and how he had wedded the king’s</a>
<a id='line_11700'>daughter of Brittany. Queen Guenever sent her another letter, and bade</a>
<a id='line_11701'>her be of good cheer, for she should have joy after sorrow, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_11702'>Tristram was so noble a knight called, that by crafts of sorcery ladies</a>
<a id='line_11703'>would make such noble men to wed them. But in the end, Queen Guenever</a>
<a id='line_11704'>said, it shall be thus, that he shall hate her, and love you better</a>
<a id='line_11705'>than ever he did to-fore.</a>
<a id='line_11706'></a>
<a id='line_11707'>So leave we Sir Tristram in Brittany, and speak we of Sir Lamorak de</a>
<a id='line_11708'>Galis, that as he sailed his ship fell on a rock and perished all, save</a>
<a id='line_11709'>Sir Lamorak and his squire; and there he swam mightily, and fishers of</a>
<a id='line_11710'>the Isle of Servage took him up, and his squire was drowned, and the</a>
<a id='line_11711'>shipmen had great labour to save Sir Lamorak’s life, for all the</a>
<a id='line_11712'>comfort that they could do.</a>
<a id='line_11713'></a>
<a id='line_11714'>And the lord of that isle, hight Sir Nabon le Noire, a great mighty</a>
<a id='line_11715'>giant. And this Sir Nabon hated all the knights of King Arthur’s, and</a>
<a id='line_11716'>in no wise he would do them favour. And these fishers told Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_11717'>all the guise of Sir Nabon; how there came never knight of King</a>
<a id='line_11718'>Arthur’s but he destroyed him. And at the last battle that he did was</a>
<a id='line_11719'>slain Sir Nanowne le Petite, the which he put to a shameful death in</a>
<a id='line_11720'>despite of King Arthur, for he was drawn limb-meal. That forthinketh</a>
<a id='line_11721'>me, said Sir Lamorak, for that knight’s death, for he was my cousin;</a>
<a id='line_11722'>and if I were at mine ease as well as ever I was, I would revenge his</a>
<a id='line_11723'>death. Peace, said the fishers, and make here no words, for or ever ye</a>
<a id='line_11724'>depart from hence Sir Nabon must know that ye have been here, or else</a>
<a id='line_11725'>we should die for your sake. So that I be whole, said Lamorak, of my</a>
<a id='line_11726'>disease that I have taken in the sea, I will that ye tell him that I am</a>
<a id='line_11727'>a knight of King Arthur’s, for I was never afeard to reneye my lord.</a>
<a id='line_11728'></a>
<a id='line_11729'></a>
<a id='line_11730'></a>
<a id='line_11731'>CHAPTER XXXVIII. How Sir Tristram and his wife arrived in Wales, and</a>
<a id='line_11732'>how he met there with Sir Lamorak.</a>
<a id='line_11733'></a>
<a id='line_11734'>Now turn we unto Sir Tristram, that upon a day he took a little barget,</a>
<a id='line_11735'>and his wife Isoud la Blanche Mains, with Sir Kehydius her brother, to</a>
<a id='line_11736'>play them in the coasts. And when they were from the land, there was a</a>
<a id='line_11737'>wind drove them in to the coast of Wales upon this Isle of Servage,</a>
<a id='line_11738'>whereas was Sir Lamorak, and there the barget all to-rove; and there</a>
<a id='line_11739'>Dame Isoud was hurt; and as well as they might they gat into the</a>
<a id='line_11740'>forest, and there by a well he saw Segwarides and a damosel. And then</a>
<a id='line_11741'>either saluted other. Sir, said Segwarides, I know you for Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_11742'>de Liones, the man in the world that I have most cause to hate, because</a>
<a id='line_11743'>ye departed the love between me and my wife; but as for that, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11744'>Segwarides, I will never hate a noble knight for a light lady; and</a>
<a id='line_11745'>therefore, I pray you, be my friend, and I will be yours unto my power;</a>
<a id='line_11746'>for wit ye well ye are hard bestead in this valley, and we shall have</a>
<a id='line_11747'>enough to do either of us to succour other. And then Sir Segwarides</a>
<a id='line_11748'>brought Sir Tristram to a lady thereby that was born in Cornwall, and</a>
<a id='line_11749'>she told him all the perils of that valley, and how there came never</a>
<a id='line_11750'>knight there but he were taken prisoner or slain. Wit you well, fair</a>
<a id='line_11751'>lady, said Sir Tristram, that I slew Sir Marhaus and delivered Cornwall</a>
<a id='line_11752'>from the truage of Ireland, and I am he that delivered the King of</a>
<a id='line_11753'>Ireland from Sir Blamore de Ganis, and I am he that beat Sir Palamides;</a>
<a id='line_11754'>and wit ye well I am Sir Tristram de Liones, that by the grace of God</a>
<a id='line_11755'>shall deliver this woful Isle of Servage. So Sir Tristram was well</a>
<a id='line_11756'>eased.</a>
<a id='line_11757'></a>
<a id='line_11758'>Then one told him there was a knight of King Arthur’s that was wrecked</a>
<a id='line_11759'>on the rocks. What is his name? said Sir Tristram. We wot not, said the</a>
<a id='line_11760'>fishers, but he keepeth it no counsel but that he is a knight of King</a>
<a id='line_11761'>Arthur’s, and by the mighty lord of this isle he setteth nought. I pray</a>
<a id='line_11762'>you, said Sir Tristram, an ye may, bring him hither that I may see him,</a>
<a id='line_11763'>and if he be any of the knights of Arthur’s I shall know him. Then the</a>
<a id='line_11764'>lady prayed the fishers to bring him to her place. So on the morrow</a>
<a id='line_11765'>they brought him thither in a fisher’s raiment; and as soon as Sir</a>
<a id='line_11766'>Tristram saw him he smiled upon him and knew him well, but he knew not</a>
<a id='line_11767'>Sir Tristram. Fair sir, said Sir Tristram, meseemeth by your cheer ye</a>
<a id='line_11768'>have been diseased but late, and also methinketh I should know you</a>
<a id='line_11769'>heretofore. I will well, said Sir Lamorak, that ye have seen me and met</a>
<a id='line_11770'>with me. Fair sir, said Sir Tristram, tell me your name. Upon a</a>
<a id='line_11771'>covenant I will tell you, said Sir Lamorak, that is, that ye will tell</a>
<a id='line_11772'>me whether ye be lord of this island or no, that is called Nabon le</a>
<a id='line_11773'>Noire. Forsooth, said Sir Tristram, I am not he, nor I hold not of him;</a>
<a id='line_11774'>I am his foe as well as ye be, and so shall I be found or I depart out</a>
<a id='line_11775'>of this isle. Well, said Sir Lamorak, since ye have said so largely</a>
<a id='line_11776'>unto me, my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis, son unto King Pellinore.</a>
<a id='line_11777'>Forsooth, I trow well, said Sir Tristram, for an ye said other I know</a>
<a id='line_11778'>the contrary. What are ye, said Sir Lamorak, that knoweth me? I am Sir</a>
<a id='line_11779'>Tristram de Liones. Ah, sir, remember ye not of the fall ye did give me</a>
<a id='line_11780'>once, and after ye refused me to fight on foot. That was not for fear I</a>
<a id='line_11781'>had of you, said Sir Tristram, but me shamed at that time to have more</a>
<a id='line_11782'>ado with you, for meseemed ye had enough; but, Sir Lamorak, for my</a>
<a id='line_11783'>kindness many ladies ye put to a reproof when ye sent the horn from</a>
<a id='line_11784'>Morgan le Fay to King Mark, whereas ye did this in despite of me. Well,</a>
<a id='line_11785'>said he, an it were to do again, so would I do, for I had liefer strife</a>
<a id='line_11786'>and debate fell in King Mark’s court rather than Arthur’s court, for</a>
<a id='line_11787'>the honour of both courts be not alike. As to that, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_11788'>I know well; but that that was done it was for despite of me, but all</a>
<a id='line_11789'>your malice, I thank God, hurt not greatly. Therefore, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11790'>Tristram, ye shall leave all your malice, and so will I, and let us</a>
<a id='line_11791'>assay how we may win worship between you and me upon this giant Sir</a>
<a id='line_11792'>Nabon le Noire that is lord of this island, to destroy him. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_11793'>Sir Lamorak, now I understand your knighthood, it may not be false that</a>
<a id='line_11794'>all men say, for of your bounty, noblesse, and worship, of all knights</a>
<a id='line_11795'>ye are peerless, and for your courtesy and gentleness I showed you</a>
<a id='line_11796'>ungentleness, and that now me repenteth.</a>
<a id='line_11797'></a>
<a id='line_11798'></a>
<a id='line_11799'></a>
<a id='line_11800'>CHAPTER XXXIX. How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Nabon, and overcame</a>
<a id='line_11801'>him, and made Sir Segwarides lord of the isle.</a>
<a id='line_11802'></a>
<a id='line_11803'>In the meantime there came word that Sir Nabon had made a cry that all</a>
<a id='line_11804'>the people of that isle should be at his castle the fifth day after.</a>
<a id='line_11805'>And the same day the son of Nabon should be made knight, and all the</a>
<a id='line_11806'>knights of that valley and thereabout should be there to joust, and all</a>
<a id='line_11807'>those of the realm of Logris should be there to joust with them of</a>
<a id='line_11808'>North Wales: and thither came five hundred knights, and they of the</a>
<a id='line_11809'>country brought thither Sir Lamorak, and Sir Tristram, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_11810'>Kehydius, and Sir Segwarides, for they durst none otherwise do; and</a>
<a id='line_11811'>then Sir Nabon lent Sir Lamorak horse and armour at Sir Lamorak’s</a>
<a id='line_11812'>desire, and Sir Lamorak jousted and did such deeds of arms that Nabon</a>
<a id='line_11813'>and all the people said there was never knight that ever they saw do</a>
<a id='line_11814'>such deeds of arms; for, as the French book saith, he for-jousted all</a>
<a id='line_11815'>that were there, for the most part of five hundred knights, that none</a>
<a id='line_11816'>abode him in his saddle.</a>
<a id='line_11817'></a>
<a id='line_11818'>Then Sir Nabon proffered to play with him his play: For I saw never no</a>
<a id='line_11819'>knight do so much upon a day. I will well, said Sir Lamorak, play as I</a>
<a id='line_11820'>may, but I am weary and sore bruised. And there either gat a spear, but</a>
<a id='line_11821'>Nabon would not encounter with Sir Lamorak, but smote his horse in the</a>
<a id='line_11822'>forehead, and so slew him; and then Sir Lamorak yede on foot, and</a>
<a id='line_11823'>turned his shield and drew his sword, and there began strong battle on</a>
<a id='line_11824'>foot. But Sir Lamorak was so sore bruised and short breathed, that he</a>
<a id='line_11825'>traced and traversed somewhat aback. Fair fellow, said Sir Nabon, hold</a>
<a id='line_11826'>thy hand and I shall show thee more courtesy than ever I showed knight,</a>
<a id='line_11827'>because I have seen this day thy noble knighthood, and therefore stand</a>
<a id='line_11828'>thou by, and I will wit whether any of thy fellows will have ado with</a>
<a id='line_11829'>me. Then when Sir Tristram heard that, he stepped forth and said:</a>
<a id='line_11830'>Nabon, lend me horse and sure armour, and I will have ado with thee.</a>
<a id='line_11831'>Well, fellow, said Sir Nabon, go thou to yonder pavilion, and arm thee</a>
<a id='line_11832'>of the best thou findest there, and I shall play a marvellous play with</a>
<a id='line_11833'>thee. Then said Sir Tristram: Look ye play well, or else peradventure I</a>
<a id='line_11834'>shall learn you a new play. That is well said, fellow, said Sir Nabon.</a>
<a id='line_11835'>So when Sir Tristram was armed as him liked best, and well shielded and</a>
<a id='line_11836'>sworded, he dressed to him on foot; for well he knew that Sir Nabon</a>
<a id='line_11837'>would not abide a stroke with a spear, therefore he would slay all</a>
<a id='line_11838'>knights’ horses. Now, fair fellow, Sir Nabon, let us play. So then they</a>
<a id='line_11839'>fought long on foot, tracing and traversing, smiting and foining long</a>
<a id='line_11840'>without any rest. At the last Sir Nabon prayed him to tell him his</a>
<a id='line_11841'>name. Sir Nabon, I tell thee my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, a</a>
<a id='line_11842'>knight of Cornwall under King Mark. Thou art welcome, said Sir Nabon,</a>
<a id='line_11843'>for of all knights I have most desired to fight with thee or with Sir</a>
<a id='line_11844'>Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_11845'></a>
<a id='line_11846'>So then they went eagerly together, and Sir Tristram slew Sir Nabon,</a>
<a id='line_11847'>and so forthwith he leapt to his son, and struck off his head; and then</a>
<a id='line_11848'>all the country said they would hold of Sir Tristram. Nay, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11849'>Tristram, I will not so; here is a worshipful knight, Sir Lamorak de</a>
<a id='line_11850'>Galis, that for me he shall be lord of this country, for he hath done</a>
<a id='line_11851'>here great deeds of arms. Nay, said Sir Lamorak, I will not be lord of</a>
<a id='line_11852'>this country, for I have not deserved it as well as ye, therefore give</a>
<a id='line_11853'>ye it where ye will, for I will none have. Well, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_11854'>since ye nor I will not have it, let us give it to him that hath not so</a>
<a id='line_11855'>well deserved it. Do as ye list, said Segwarides, for the gift is</a>
<a id='line_11856'>yours, for I will none have an I had deserved it. So was it given to</a>
<a id='line_11857'>Segwarides, whereof he thanked them; and so was he lord, and</a>
<a id='line_11858'>worshipfully he did govern it. And then Sir Segwarides delivered all</a>
<a id='line_11859'>prisoners, and set good governance in that valley; and so he returned</a>
<a id='line_11860'>into Cornwall, and told King Mark and La Beale Isoud how Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_11861'>had advanced him to the Isle of Servage, and there he proclaimed in all</a>
<a id='line_11862'>Cornwall of all the adventures of these two knights, so was it openly</a>
<a id='line_11863'>known. But full woe was La Beale Isoud when she heard tell that Sir</a>
<a id='line_11864'>Tristram was wedded to Isoud la Blanche Mains.</a>
<a id='line_11865'></a>
<a id='line_11866'></a>
<a id='line_11867'></a>
<a id='line_11868'>CHAPTER XL. How Sir Lamorak departed from Sir Tristram, and how he met</a>
<a id='line_11869'>with Sir Frol, and after with Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_11870'></a>
<a id='line_11871'>So turn we unto Sir Lamorak, that rode toward Arthur’s court, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_11872'>Tristram’s wife and Kehydius took a vessel and sailed into Brittany,</a>
<a id='line_11873'>unto King Howel, where he was welcome. And when he heard of these</a>
<a id='line_11874'>adventures they marvelled of his noble deeds. Now turn we unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_11875'>Lamorak, that when he was departed from Sir Tristram he rode out of the</a>
<a id='line_11876'>forest, till he came to an hermitage. When the hermit saw him, he asked</a>
<a id='line_11877'>him from whence he came. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, I come from this</a>
<a id='line_11878'>valley. Sir, said the hermit: thereof I marvel. For this twenty winter</a>
<a id='line_11879'>I saw never no knight pass this country but he was either slain or</a>
<a id='line_11880'>villainously wounded, or pass as a poor prisoner. Those ill customs,</a>
<a id='line_11881'>said Sir Lamorak, are fordone, for Sir Tristram slew your lord, Sir</a>
<a id='line_11882'>Nabon, and his son. Then was the hermit glad, and all his brethren, for</a>
<a id='line_11883'>he said there was never such a tyrant among Christian men. And</a>
<a id='line_11884'>therefore, said the hermit, this valley and franchise we will hold of</a>
<a id='line_11885'>Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_11886'></a>
<a id='line_11887'>So on the morrow Sir Lamorak departed; and as he rode he saw four</a>
<a id='line_11888'>knights fight against one, and that one knight defended him well, but</a>
<a id='line_11889'>at the last the four knights had him down. And then Sir Lamorak went</a>
<a id='line_11890'>betwixt them, and asked them why they would slay that one knight, and</a>
<a id='line_11891'>said it was shame, four against one. Thou shalt well wit, said the four</a>
<a id='line_11892'>knights, that he is false. That is your tale, said Sir Lamorak, and</a>
<a id='line_11893'>when I hear him also speak, I will say as ye say. Then said Lamorak:</a>
<a id='line_11894'>Ah, knight, can ye not excuse you, but that ye are a false knight. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_11895'>said he, yet can I excuse me both with my word and with my hands, that</a>
<a id='line_11896'>I will make good upon one of the best of them, my body to his body.</a>
<a id='line_11897'>Then spake they all at once: We will not jeopardy our bodies as for</a>
<a id='line_11898'>thee. But wit thou well, they said, an King Arthur were here himself,</a>
<a id='line_11899'>it should not lie in his power to save his life. That is too much said,</a>
<a id='line_11900'>said Sir Lamorak, but many speak behind a man more than they will say</a>
<a id='line_11901'>to his face; and because of your words ye shall understand that I am</a>
<a id='line_11902'>one of the simplest of King Arthur’s court; in the worship of my lord</a>
<a id='line_11903'>now do your best, and in despite of you I shall rescue him. And then</a>
<a id='line_11904'>they lashed all at once to Sir Lamorak, but anon at two strokes Sir</a>
<a id='line_11905'>Lamorak had slain two of them, and then the other two fled. So then Sir</a>
<a id='line_11906'>Lamorak turned again to that knight, and asked him his name. Sir, he</a>
<a id='line_11907'>said, my name is Sir Frol of the Out Isles. Then he rode with Sir</a>
<a id='line_11908'>Lamorak and bare him company.</a>
<a id='line_11909'></a>
<a id='line_11910'>And as they rode by the way they saw a seemly knight riding against</a>
<a id='line_11911'>them, and all in white. Ah, said Frol, yonder knight jousted late with</a>
<a id='line_11912'>me and smote me down, therefore I will joust with him. Ye shall not do</a>
<a id='line_11913'>so, said Sir Lamorak, by my counsel, an ye will tell me your quarrel,</a>
<a id='line_11914'>whether ye jousted at his request, or he at yours. Nay, said Sir Frol,</a>
<a id='line_11915'>I jousted with him at my request. Sir, said Lamorak, then will I</a>
<a id='line_11916'>counsel you deal no more with him, for meseemeth by his countenance he</a>
<a id='line_11917'>should be a noble knight, and no japer; for methinketh he should be of</a>
<a id='line_11918'>the Table Round. Therefore I will not spare, said Sir Frol. And then he</a>
<a id='line_11919'>cried and said: Sir knight, make thee ready to joust. That needeth not,</a>
<a id='line_11920'>said the White Knight, for I have no lust to joust with thee; but yet</a>
<a id='line_11921'>they feutred their spears, and the White Knight overthrew Sir Frol, and</a>
<a id='line_11922'>then he rode his way a soft pace. Then Sir Lamorak rode after him, and</a>
<a id='line_11923'>prayed him to tell him his name: For meseemeth ye should be of the</a>
<a id='line_11924'>fellowship of the Round Table. Upon a covenant, said he, I will tell</a>
<a id='line_11925'>you my name, so that ye will not discover my name, and also that ye</a>
<a id='line_11926'>will tell me yours. Then, said he, my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis. And</a>
<a id='line_11927'>my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. Then they put up their swords, and</a>
<a id='line_11928'>kissed heartily together, and either made great joy of other. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_11929'>Sir Lamorak, an it please you I will do you service. God defend, said</a>
<a id='line_11930'>Launcelot, that any of so noble a blood as ye be should do me service.</a>
<a id='line_11931'>Then he said: More, I am in a quest that I must do myself alone. Now</a>
<a id='line_11932'>God speed you, said Sir Lamorak, and so they departed. Then Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_11933'>came to Sir Frol and horsed him again. What knight is that? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11934'>Frol. Sir, he said, it is not for you to know, nor it is no point of my</a>
<a id='line_11935'>charge. Ye are the more uncourteous, said Sir Frol, and therefore I</a>
<a id='line_11936'>will depart from you. Ye may do as ye list, said Sir Lamorak, and yet</a>
<a id='line_11937'>by my company ye have saved the fairest flower of your garland; so they</a>
<a id='line_11938'>departed.</a>
<a id='line_11939'></a>
<a id='line_11940'></a>
<a id='line_11941'></a>
<a id='line_11942'>CHAPTER XLI. How Sir Lamorak slew Sir Frol, and of the courteous</a>
<a id='line_11943'>fighting with Sir Belliance his brother.</a>
<a id='line_11944'></a>
<a id='line_11945'>Then within two or three days Sir Lamorak found a knight at a well</a>
<a id='line_11946'>sleeping, and his lady sat with him and waked. Right so came Sir</a>
<a id='line_11947'>Gawaine and took the knight’s lady, and set her up behind his squire.</a>
<a id='line_11948'>So Sir Lamorak rode after Sir Gawaine, and said: Sir Gawaine, turn</a>
<a id='line_11949'>again. And then said Sir Gawaine: What will ye do with me? for I am</a>
<a id='line_11950'>nephew unto King Arthur. Sir, said he, for that cause I will spare you,</a>
<a id='line_11951'>else that lady should abide with me, or else ye should joust with me.</a>
<a id='line_11952'>Then Sir Gawaine turned him and ran to him that ought the lady, with</a>
<a id='line_11953'>his spear, but the knight with pure might smote down Sir Gawaine, and</a>
<a id='line_11954'>took his lady with him. All this Sir Lamorak saw, and said to himself:</a>
<a id='line_11955'>But I revenge my fellow he will say of me dishonour in King Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_11956'>court. Then Sir Lamorak returned and proffered that knight to joust.</a>
<a id='line_11957'>Sir, said he, I am ready. And there they came together with all their</a>
<a id='line_11958'>might, and there Sir Lamorak smote the knight through both sides that</a>
<a id='line_11959'>he fell to the earth dead.</a>
<a id='line_11960'></a>
<a id='line_11961'>Then that lady rode to that knight’s brother that hight Belliance le</a>
<a id='line_11962'>Orgulus, that dwelt fast thereby, and then she told him how his brother</a>
<a id='line_11963'>was slain. Alas, said he, I will be revenged. And so he horsed him, and</a>
<a id='line_11964'>armed him, and within a while he overtook Sir Lamorak, and bade him:</a>
<a id='line_11965'>Turn and leave that lady, for thou and I must play a new play; for thou</a>
<a id='line_11966'>hast slain my brother Sir Frol, that was a better knight than ever wert</a>
<a id='line_11967'>thou. It might well be, said Sir Lamorak, but this day in the field I</a>
<a id='line_11968'>was found the better. So they rode together, and unhorsed other, and</a>
<a id='line_11969'>turned their shields, and drew their swords, and fought mightily as</a>
<a id='line_11970'>noble knights proved, by the space of two hours. So then Sir Belliance</a>
<a id='line_11971'>prayed him to tell him his name. Sir, said he, my name is Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_11972'>de Galis. Ah, said Sir Belliance, thou art the man in the world that I</a>
<a id='line_11973'>most hate, for I slew my sons for thy sake, where I saved thy life, and</a>
<a id='line_11974'>now thou hast slain my brother Sir Frol. Alas, how should I be accorded</a>
<a id='line_11975'>with thee; therefore defend thee, for thou shalt die, there is none</a>
<a id='line_11976'>other remedy. Alas, said Sir Lamorak, full well me ought to know you,</a>
<a id='line_11977'>for ye are the man that most have done for me. And therewithal Sir</a>
<a id='line_11978'>Lamorak kneeled down, and besought him of grace. Arise, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11979'>Belliance, or else thereas thou kneelest I shall slay thee. That shall</a>
<a id='line_11980'>not need, said Sir Lamorak, for I will yield me unto you, not for fear</a>
<a id='line_11981'>of you, nor for your strength, but your goodness maketh me full loath</a>
<a id='line_11982'>to have ado with you; wherefore I require you for God’s sake, and for</a>
<a id='line_11983'>the honour of knighthood, forgive me all that I have offended unto you.</a>
<a id='line_11984'>Alas, said Belliance, leave thy kneeling, or else I shall slay thee</a>
<a id='line_11985'>without mercy.</a>
<a id='line_11986'></a>
<a id='line_11987'>Then they yede again unto battle, and either wounded other, that all</a>
<a id='line_11988'>the ground was bloody thereas they fought. And at the last Belliance</a>
<a id='line_11989'>withdrew him aback and set him down softly upon a little hill, for he</a>
<a id='line_11990'>was so faint for bleeding that he might not stand. Then Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_11991'>threw his shield upon his back, and asked him what cheer. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_11992'>Sir Belliance. Ah, Sir, yet shall I show you favour in your mal-ease.</a>
<a id='line_11993'>Ah, Knight Sir Belliance, said Sir Lamorak, thou art a fool, for an I</a>
<a id='line_11994'>had had thee at such advantage as thou hast done me, I should slay</a>
<a id='line_11995'>thee; but thy gentleness is so good and so large, that I must needs</a>
<a id='line_11996'>forgive thee mine evil will. And then Sir Lamorak kneeled down, and</a>
<a id='line_11997'>unlaced first his umberere, and then his own, and then either kissed</a>
<a id='line_11998'>other with weeping tears. Then Sir Lamorak led Sir Belliance to an</a>
<a id='line_11999'>abbey fast by, and there Sir Lamorak would not depart from Belliance</a>
<a id='line_12000'>till he was whole. And then they sware together that none of them</a>
<a id='line_12001'>should never fight against other. So Sir Lamorak departed and went to</a>
<a id='line_12002'>the court of King Arthur.</a>

<a id='line_12013'>CHAPTER I. How a young man came into the court of King Arthur, and how</a>
<a id='line_12014'>Sir Kay called him in scorn La Cote Male Taile.</a>
<a id='line_12015'></a>
<a id='line_12016'>At the court of King Arthur there came a young man and bigly made, and</a>
<a id='line_12017'>he was richly beseen: and he desired to be made knight of the king, but</a>
<a id='line_12018'>his over-garment sat over-thwartly, howbeit it was rich cloth of gold.</a>
<a id='line_12019'>What is your name? said King Arthur. Sir, said he, my name is Breunor</a>
<a id='line_12020'>le Noire, and within short space ye shall know that I am of good kin.</a>
<a id='line_12021'>It may well be, said Sir Kay, the Seneschal, but in mockage ye shall be</a>
<a id='line_12022'>called La Cote Male Taile, that is as much to say, the evil-shapen</a>
<a id='line_12023'>coat. It is a great thing that thou askest, said the king; and for what</a>
<a id='line_12024'>cause wearest thou that rich coat? tell me, for I can well think for</a>
<a id='line_12025'>some cause it is. Sir, he answered, I had a father, a noble knight, and</a>
<a id='line_12026'>as he rode a-hunting, upon a day it happed him to lay him down to</a>
<a id='line_12027'>sleep; and there came a knight that had been long his enemy, and when</a>
<a id='line_12028'>he saw he was fast asleep he all to-hew him; and this same coat had my</a>
<a id='line_12029'>father on the same time; and that maketh this coat to sit so evil upon</a>
<a id='line_12030'>me, for the strokes be on it as I found it, and never shall be amended</a>
<a id='line_12031'>for me. Thus to have my father’s death in remembrance I wear this coat</a>
<a id='line_12032'>till I be revenged; and because ye are called the most noblest king of</a>
<a id='line_12033'>the world I come to you that ye should make me knight. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12034'>Lamorak and Sir Gaheris, it were well done to make him knight; for him</a>
<a id='line_12035'>beseemeth well of person and of countenance, that he shall prove a good</a>
<a id='line_12036'>man, and a good knight, and a mighty; for, Sir, an ye be remembered,</a>
<a id='line_12037'>even such one was Sir Launcelot du Lake when he came first into this</a>
<a id='line_12038'>court, and full few of us knew from whence he came; and now is he</a>
<a id='line_12039'>proved the man of most worship in the world; and all your court and all</a>
<a id='line_12040'>your Round Table is by Sir Launcelot worshipped and amended more than</a>
<a id='line_12041'>by any knight now living. That is truth, said the king, and to-morrow</a>
<a id='line_12042'>at your request I shall make him knight.</a>
<a id='line_12043'></a>
<a id='line_12044'>So on the morrow there was an hart found, and thither rode King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_12045'>with a company of his knights to slay the hart. And this young man that</a>
<a id='line_12046'>Sir Kay named La Cote Male Taile was there left behind with Queen</a>
<a id='line_12047'>Guenever; and by sudden adventure there was an horrible lion kept in a</a>
<a id='line_12048'>strong tower of stone, and it happened that he at that time brake</a>
<a id='line_12049'>loose, and came hurling afore the queen and her knights. And when the</a>
<a id='line_12050'>queen saw the lion she cried and fled, and prayed her knights to rescue</a>
<a id='line_12051'>her. And there was none of them all but twelve that abode, and all the</a>
<a id='line_12052'>other fled. Then said La Cote Male Taile: Now I see well that all</a>
<a id='line_12053'>coward knights be not dead; and therewithal he drew his sword and</a>
<a id='line_12054'>dressed him afore the lion. And that lion gaped wide and came upon him</a>
<a id='line_12055'>ramping to have slain him. And he then smote him in the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_12056'>head such a mighty stroke that it clave his head in sunder, and dashed</a>
<a id='line_12057'>to the earth. Then was it told the queen how the young man that Sir Kay</a>
<a id='line_12058'>named by scorn La Cote Male Taile had slain the lion. With that the</a>
<a id='line_12059'>king came home. And when the queen told him of that adventure, he was</a>
<a id='line_12060'>well pleased, and said: Upon pain of mine head he shall prove a noble</a>
<a id='line_12061'>man and a faithful knight, and true of his promise: then the king</a>
<a id='line_12062'>forthwithal made him knight. Now Sir, said this young knight, I require</a>
<a id='line_12063'>you and all the knights of your court, that ye call me by none other</a>
<a id='line_12064'>name but La Cote Male Taile: in so much as Sir Kay hath so named me so</a>
<a id='line_12065'>will I be called. I assent me well thereto, said the king.</a>
<a id='line_12066'></a>
<a id='line_12067'></a>
<a id='line_12068'></a>
<a id='line_12069'>CHAPTER II. How a damosel came into the court and desired a knight to</a>
<a id='line_12070'>take on him an enquest, which La Cote Male Taile emprised.</a>
<a id='line_12071'></a>
<a id='line_12072'>Then that same day there came a damosel into the court, and she brought</a>
<a id='line_12073'>with her a great black shield, with a white hand in the midst holding a</a>
<a id='line_12074'>sword. Other picture was there none in that shield. When King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_12075'>saw her he asked her from whence she came and what she would. Sir, she</a>
<a id='line_12076'>said, I have ridden long and many a day with this shield many ways, and</a>
<a id='line_12077'>for this cause I am come to your court: there was a good knight that</a>
<a id='line_12078'>ought this shield, and this knight had undertaken a great deed of arms</a>
<a id='line_12079'>to enchieve it; and so it misfortuned him another strong knight met</a>
<a id='line_12080'>with him by sudden adventure, and there they fought long, and either</a>
<a id='line_12081'>wounded other passing sore; and they were so weary that they left that</a>
<a id='line_12082'>battle even hand. So this knight that ought this shield saw none other</a>
<a id='line_12083'>way but he must die; and then he commanded me to bear this shield to</a>
<a id='line_12084'>the court of King Arthur, he requiring and praying some good knight to</a>
<a id='line_12085'>take this shield, and that he would fulfil the quest that he was in.</a>
<a id='line_12086'>Now what say ye to this quest? said King Arthur; is there any of you</a>
<a id='line_12087'>here that will take upon him to wield this shield? Then was there not</a>
<a id='line_12088'>one that would speak one word. Then Sir Kay took the shield in his</a>
<a id='line_12089'>hands. Sir knight, said the damosel, what is your name? Wit ye well,</a>
<a id='line_12090'>said he, my name is Sir Kay, the Seneschal, that wide-where is known.</a>
<a id='line_12091'>Sir, said that damosel, lay down that shield, for wit ye well it</a>
<a id='line_12092'>falleth not for you, for he must be a better knight than ye that shall</a>
<a id='line_12093'>wield this shield. Damosel, said Sir Kay, wit ye well I took this</a>
<a id='line_12094'>shield in my hands by your leave for to behold it, not to that intent;</a>
<a id='line_12095'>but go wheresomever thou wilt, for I will not go with you.</a>
<a id='line_12096'></a>
<a id='line_12097'>Then the damosel stood still a great while and beheld many of those</a>
<a id='line_12098'>knights. Then spake the knight, La Cote Male Taile: Fair damosel, I</a>
<a id='line_12099'>will take the shield and that adventure upon me, so I wist I should</a>
<a id='line_12100'>know whitherward my journey might be; for because I was this day made</a>
<a id='line_12101'>knight I would take this adventure upon me. What is your name, fair</a>
<a id='line_12102'>young man? said the damosel. My name is, said he, La Cote Male Taile.</a>
<a id='line_12103'>Well mayest thou be called so, said the damosel, the knight with the</a>
<a id='line_12104'>evil-shapen coat; but an thou be so hardy to take upon thee to bear</a>
<a id='line_12105'>that shield and to follow me, wit thou well thy skin shall be as well</a>
<a id='line_12106'>hewn as thy coat. As for that, said La Cote Male Taile, when I am so</a>
<a id='line_12107'>hewn I will ask you no salve to heal me withal. And forthwithal there</a>
<a id='line_12108'>came into the court two squires and brought him great horses, and his</a>
<a id='line_12109'>armour, and his spears, and anon he was armed and took his leave. I</a>
<a id='line_12110'>would not by my will, said the king, that ye took upon you that hard</a>
<a id='line_12111'>adventure. Sir, said he, this adventure is mine, and the first that</a>
<a id='line_12112'>ever I took upon me, and that will I follow whatsomever come of me.</a>
<a id='line_12113'>Then that damosel departed, and La Cote Male Taile fast followed after.</a>
<a id='line_12114'>And within a while he overtook the damosel, and anon she missaid him in</a>
<a id='line_12115'>the foulest manner.</a>
<a id='line_12116'></a>
<a id='line_12117'></a>
<a id='line_12118'></a>
<a id='line_12119'>CHAPTER III. How La Cote Male Taile overthrew Sir Dagonet the king’s</a>
<a id='line_12120'>fool, and of the rebuke that he had of the damosel.</a>
<a id='line_12121'></a>
<a id='line_12122'>Then Sir Kay ordained Sir Dagonet, King Arthur’s fool, to follow after</a>
<a id='line_12123'>La Cote Male Taile; and there Sir Kay ordained that Sir Dagonet was</a>
<a id='line_12124'>horsed and armed, and bade him follow La Cote Male Taile and proffer</a>
<a id='line_12125'>him to joust, and so he did; and when he saw La Cote Male Taile, he</a>
<a id='line_12126'>cried and bade him make him ready to joust. So Sir La Cote Male Taile</a>
<a id='line_12127'>smote Sir Dagonet over his horse’s croup. Then the damosel mocked La</a>
<a id='line_12128'>Cote Male Taile, and said: Fie for shame! now art thou shamed in</a>
<a id='line_12129'>Arthur’s court, when they send a fool to have ado with thee, and</a>
<a id='line_12130'>specially at thy first jousts; thus she rode long, and chid. And within</a>
<a id='line_12131'>a while there came Sir Bleoberis, the good knight, and there he jousted</a>
<a id='line_12132'>with La Cote Male Taile, and there Sir Bleoberis smote him so sore,</a>
<a id='line_12133'>that horse and all fell to the earth. Then La Cote Male Taile arose up</a>
<a id='line_12134'>lightly, and dressed his shield, and drew his sword, and would have</a>
<a id='line_12135'>done battle to the utterance, for he was wood wroth. Not so, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12136'>Bleoberis de Ganis, as at this time I will not fight upon foot. Then</a>
<a id='line_12137'>the damosel Maledisant rebuked him in the foulest manner, and bade him:</a>
<a id='line_12138'>Turn again, coward. Ah, damosel, he said, I pray you of mercy to missay</a>
<a id='line_12139'>me no more, my grief is enough though ye give me no more; I call myself</a>
<a id='line_12140'>never the worse knight when a mare’s son faileth me, and also I count</a>
<a id='line_12141'>me never the worse knight for a fall of Sir Bleoberis.</a>
<a id='line_12142'></a>
<a id='line_12143'>So thus he rode with her two days; and by fortune there came Sir</a>
<a id='line_12144'>Palomides and encountered with him, and he in the same wise served him</a>
<a id='line_12145'>as did Bleoberis to-forehand. What dost thou here in my fellowship?</a>
<a id='line_12146'>said the damosel Maledisant, thou canst not sit no knight, nor</a>
<a id='line_12147'>withstand him one buffet, but if it were Sir Dagonet. Ah, fair damosel,</a>
<a id='line_12148'>I am not the worse to take a fall of Sir Palomides, and yet great</a>
<a id='line_12149'>disworship have I none, for neither Bleoberis nor yet Palomides would</a>
<a id='line_12150'>not fight with me on foot. As for that, said the damosel, wit thou well</a>
<a id='line_12151'>they have disdain and scorn to light off their horses to fight with</a>
<a id='line_12152'>such a lewd knight as thou art. So in the meanwhile there came Sir</a>
<a id='line_12153'>Mordred, Sir Gawaine’s brother, and so he fell in the fellowship with</a>
<a id='line_12154'>the damosel Maledisant. And then they came afore the Castle Orgulous,</a>
<a id='line_12155'>and there was such a custom that there might no knight come by that</a>
<a id='line_12156'>castle but either he must joust or be prisoner, or at the least to lose</a>
<a id='line_12157'>his horse and his harness. And there came out two knights against them,</a>
<a id='line_12158'>and Sir Mordred jousted with the foremost, and that knight of the</a>
<a id='line_12159'>castle smote Sir Mordred down off his horse. And then La Cote Male</a>
<a id='line_12160'>Taile jousted with that other, and either of them smote other down,</a>
<a id='line_12161'>horse and all, to the earth. And when they avoided their horses, then</a>
<a id='line_12162'>either of them took other’s horses. And then La Cote Male Taile rode</a>
<a id='line_12163'>unto that knight that smote down Sir Mordred, and jousted with him. And</a>
<a id='line_12164'>there Sir La Cote Male Taile hurt and wounded him passing sore, and put</a>
<a id='line_12165'>him from his horse as he had been dead. So he turned unto him that met</a>
<a id='line_12166'>him afore, and he took the flight towards the castle, and Sir La Cote</a>
<a id='line_12167'>Male Taile rode after him into the Castle Orgulous, and there La Cote</a>
<a id='line_12168'>Male Taile slew him.</a>
<a id='line_12169'></a>
<a id='line_12170'></a>
<a id='line_12171'></a>
<a id='line_12172'>CHAPTER IV. How La Cote Male Taile fought against an hundred knights,</a>
<a id='line_12173'>and how he escaped by the mean of a lady.</a>
<a id='line_12174'></a>
<a id='line_12175'>And anon there came an hundred knights about him and assailed him; and</a>
<a id='line_12176'>when he saw his horse should be slain he alighted and voided his horse,</a>
<a id='line_12177'>and put the bridle under his feet, and so put him out of the gate. And</a>
<a id='line_12178'>when he had so done he hurled in among them, and dressed his back unto</a>
<a id='line_12179'>a lady’s chamber-wall, thinking himself that he had liefer die there</a>
<a id='line_12180'>with worship than to abide the rebukes of the damosel Maledisant. And</a>
<a id='line_12181'>in the meantime as he stood and fought, that lady whose was the chamber</a>
<a id='line_12182'>went out slily at her postern, and without the gates she found La Cote</a>
<a id='line_12183'>Male Taile’s horse, and lightly she gat him by the bridle, and tied him</a>
<a id='line_12184'>to the postern. And then she went unto her chamber slily again for to</a>
<a id='line_12185'>behold how that one knight fought against an hundred knights. And when</a>
<a id='line_12186'>she had beheld him long she went to a window behind his back, and said:</a>
<a id='line_12187'>Thou knight, thou fightest wonderly well, but for all that at the last</a>
<a id='line_12188'>thou must needs die, but, an thou canst through thy mighty prowess, win</a>
<a id='line_12189'>unto yonder postern, for there have I fastened thy horse to abide thee:</a>
<a id='line_12190'>but wit thou well thou must think on thy worship, and think not to die,</a>
<a id='line_12191'>for thou mayst not win unto that postern without thou do nobly and</a>
<a id='line_12192'>mightily. When La Cote Male Taile heard her say so he gripped his sword</a>
<a id='line_12193'>in his hands, and put his shield fair afore him, and through the</a>
<a id='line_12194'>thickest press he thrulled through them. And when he came to the</a>
<a id='line_12195'>postern he found there ready four knights, and at two the first strokes</a>
<a id='line_12196'>he slew two of the knights, and the other fled; and so he won his horse</a>
<a id='line_12197'>and rode from them. And all as it was it was rehearsed in King Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_12198'>court, how he slew twelve knights within the Castle Orgulous; and so he</a>
<a id='line_12199'>rode on his way.</a>
<a id='line_12200'></a>
<a id='line_12201'>And in the meanwhile the damosel said to Sir Mordred: I ween my foolish</a>
<a id='line_12202'>knight be either slain or taken prisoner: then were they ware where he</a>
<a id='line_12203'>came riding. And when he was come unto them he told all how he had sped</a>
<a id='line_12204'>and escaped in despite of them all: And some of the best of them will</a>
<a id='line_12205'>tell no tales. Thou liest falsely, said the damosel, that dare I make</a>
<a id='line_12206'>good, but as a fool and a dastard to all knighthood they have let thee</a>
<a id='line_12207'>pass. That may ye prove, said La Cote Male Taile. With that she sent a</a>
<a id='line_12208'>courier of hers, that rode alway with her, for to know the truth of</a>
<a id='line_12209'>this deed; and so he rode thither lightly, and asked how and in what</a>
<a id='line_12210'>manner that La Cote Male Taile was escaped out of the castle. Then all</a>
<a id='line_12211'>the knights cursed him, and said that he was a fiend and no man: For he</a>
<a id='line_12212'>hath slain here twelve of our best knights, and we weened unto this day</a>
<a id='line_12213'>that it had been too much for Sir Launcelot du Lake or for Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_12214'>de Liones. And in despite of us all he is departed from us and maugre</a>
<a id='line_12215'>our heads.</a>
<a id='line_12216'></a>
<a id='line_12217'>With this answer the courier departed and came to Maledisant his lady,</a>
<a id='line_12218'>and told her all how Sir La Cote Male Taile had sped at the Castle</a>
<a id='line_12219'>Orgulous. Then she smote down her head, and said little. By my head,</a>
<a id='line_12220'>said Sir Mordred to the damosel, ye are greatly to blame so to rebuke</a>
<a id='line_12221'>him, for I warn you plainly he is a good knight, and I doubt not but he</a>
<a id='line_12222'>shall prove a noble knight; but as yet he may not yet sit sure on</a>
<a id='line_12223'>horseback, for he that shall be a good horseman it must come of usage</a>
<a id='line_12224'>and exercise. But when he cometh to the strokes of his sword he is then</a>
<a id='line_12225'>noble and mighty, and that saw Sir Bleoberis and Sir Palomides, for wit</a>
<a id='line_12226'>ye well they are wily men of arms, and anon they know when they see a</a>
<a id='line_12227'>young knight by his riding, how they are sure to give him a fall from</a>
<a id='line_12228'>his horse or a great buffet. But for the most part they will not light</a>
<a id='line_12229'>on foot with young knights, for they are wight and strongly armed. For</a>
<a id='line_12230'>in likewise Sir Launcelot du Lake, when he was first made knight, he</a>
<a id='line_12231'>was often put to the worse upon horseback, but ever upon foot he</a>
<a id='line_12232'>recovered his renown, and slew and defoiled many knights of the Round</a>
<a id='line_12233'>Table. And therefore the rebukes that Sir Launcelot did unto many</a>
<a id='line_12234'>knights causeth them that be men of prowess to beware; for often I have</a>
<a id='line_12235'>seen the old proved knights rebuked and slain by them that were but</a>
<a id='line_12236'>young beginners. Thus they rode sure talking by the way together.</a>
<a id='line_12237'></a>
<a id='line_12238'>Here leave we off a while of this tale, and speak we of Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_12239'>du Lake.</a>
<a id='line_12240'></a>
<a id='line_12241'></a>
<a id='line_12242'></a>
<a id='line_12243'>CHAPTER V. How Sir Launcelot came to the court and heard of La Cote</a>
<a id='line_12244'>Male Taile, and how he followed after him, and how La Cote Male Taile</a>
<a id='line_12245'>was prisoner.</a>
<a id='line_12246'></a>
<a id='line_12247'>That when he was come to the court of King Arthur, then heard he tell</a>
<a id='line_12248'>of the young knight La Cote Male Taile, how he slew the lion, and how</a>
<a id='line_12249'>he took upon him the adventure of the black shield, the which was named</a>
<a id='line_12250'>at that time the hardiest adventure of the world. So God me save, said</a>
<a id='line_12251'>Sir Launcelot unto many of his fellows, it was shame to all the noble</a>
<a id='line_12252'>knights to suffer such a young knight to take such adventure upon him</a>
<a id='line_12253'>for his destruction; for I will that ye wit, said Sir Launcelot, that</a>
<a id='line_12254'>that damosel Maledisant hath borne that shield many a day for to seek</a>
<a id='line_12255'>the most proved knights, and that was she that Breuse Saunce Pité took</a>
<a id='line_12256'>that shield from her, and after Tristram de Liones rescued that shield</a>
<a id='line_12257'>from him and gave it to the damosel again, a little afore that time</a>
<a id='line_12258'>that Sir Tristram fought with my nephew Sir Blamore de Ganis, for a</a>
<a id='line_12259'>quarrel that was betwixt the King of Ireland and him. Then many knights</a>
<a id='line_12260'>were sorry that Sir La Cote Male Taile was gone forth to that</a>
<a id='line_12261'>adventure. Truly, said Sir Launcelot, I cast me to ride after him. And</a>
<a id='line_12262'>within seven days Sir Launcelot overtook La Cote Male Taile, and then</a>
<a id='line_12263'>he saluted him and the damosel Maledisant. And when Sir Mordred saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_12264'>Launcelot, then he left their fellowship; and so Sir Launcelot rode</a>
<a id='line_12265'>with them all a day, and ever that damosel rebuked La Cote Male Taile;</a>
<a id='line_12266'>and then Sir Launcelot answered for him, then she left off, and rebuked</a>
<a id='line_12267'>Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_12268'></a>
<a id='line_12269'>So this meantime Sir Tristram sent by a damosel a letter unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_12270'>Launcelot, excusing him of the wedding of Isoud la Blanche Mains; and</a>
<a id='line_12271'>said in the letter, as he was a true knight he had never ado fleshly</a>
<a id='line_12272'>with Isoud la Blanche Mains; and passing courteously and gentily Sir</a>
<a id='line_12273'>Tristram wrote unto Sir Launcelot, ever beseeching him to be his good</a>
<a id='line_12274'>friend and unto La Beale Isoud of Cornwall, and that Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_12275'>would excuse him if that ever he saw her. And within short time by the</a>
<a id='line_12276'>grace of God, said Sir Tristram, that he would speak with La Beale</a>
<a id='line_12277'>Isoud, and with him right hastily. Then Sir Launcelot departed from the</a>
<a id='line_12278'>damosel and from Sir La Cote Male Taile, for to oversee that letter,</a>
<a id='line_12279'>and to write another letter unto Sir Tristram de Liones.</a>
<a id='line_12280'></a>
<a id='line_12281'>And in the meanwhile La Cote Male Taile rode with the damosel until</a>
<a id='line_12282'>they came to a castle that hight Pendragon; and there were six knights</a>
<a id='line_12283'>stood afore him, and one of them proffered to joust with La Cote Male</a>
<a id='line_12284'>Taile. And there La Cote Male Taile smote him over his horse’s croup.</a>
<a id='line_12285'>And then the five knights set upon him all at once with their spears,</a>
<a id='line_12286'>and there they smote La Cote Male Taile down, horse and man. And then</a>
<a id='line_12287'>they alighted suddenly, and set their hands upon him all at once, and</a>
<a id='line_12288'>took him prisoner, and so led him unto the castle and kept him as</a>
<a id='line_12289'>prisoner.</a>
<a id='line_12290'></a>
<a id='line_12291'>And on the morn Sir Launcelot arose, and delivered the damosel with</a>
<a id='line_12292'>letters unto Sir Tristram, and then he took his way after La Cote Male</a>
<a id='line_12293'>Taile; and by the way upon a bridge there was a knight proffered Sir</a>
<a id='line_12294'>Launcelot to joust, and Sir Launcelot smote him down, and then they</a>
<a id='line_12295'>fought upon foot a noble battle together, and a mighty; and at the last</a>
<a id='line_12296'>Sir Launcelot smote him down grovelling upon his hands and his knees.</a>
<a id='line_12297'>And then that knight yielded him, and Sir Launcelot received him fair.</a>
<a id='line_12298'>Sir, said the knight, I require thee tell me your name, for much my</a>
<a id='line_12299'>heart giveth unto you. Nay, said Sir Launcelot, as at this time I will</a>
<a id='line_12300'>not tell you my name, unless then that ye tell me your name. Certainly,</a>
<a id='line_12301'>said the knight, my name is Sir Nerovens, that was made knight of my</a>
<a id='line_12302'>lord Sir Launcelot du Lake. Ah, Nerovens de Lile, said Sir Launcelot, I</a>
<a id='line_12303'>am right glad that ye are proved a good knight, for now wit ye well my</a>
<a id='line_12304'>name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. Alas, said Sir Nerovens de Lile, what</a>
<a id='line_12305'>have I done! And therewithal flatling he fell to his feet, and would</a>
<a id='line_12306'>have kissed them, but Sir Launcelot would not let him; and then either</a>
<a id='line_12307'>made great joy of other. And then Sir Nerovens told Sir Launcelot that</a>
<a id='line_12308'>he should not go by the Castle of Pendragon: For there is a lord, a</a>
<a id='line_12309'>mighty knight, and many knights with him, and this night I heard say</a>
<a id='line_12310'>that they took a knight prisoner yesterday that rode with a damosel,</a>
<a id='line_12311'>and they say he is a Knight of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_12312'></a>
<a id='line_12313'></a>
<a id='line_12314'></a>
<a id='line_12315'>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot fought with six knights, and after with</a>
<a id='line_12316'>Sir Brian, and how he delivered the prisoners.</a>
<a id='line_12317'></a>
<a id='line_12318'>Ah, said Sir Launcelot, that knight is my fellow, and him shall I</a>
<a id='line_12319'>rescue or else I shall lose my life therefore. And therewithal he rode</a>
<a id='line_12320'>fast till he came before the Castle of Pendragon; and anon therewithal</a>
<a id='line_12321'>there came six knights, and all made them ready to set upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_12322'>Launcelot at once; then Sir Launcelot feutred his spear, and smote the</a>
<a id='line_12323'>foremost that he brake his back in-sunder, and three of them hit and</a>
<a id='line_12324'>three failed. And then Sir Launcelot passed through them, and lightly</a>
<a id='line_12325'>he turned in again, and smote another knight through the breast and</a>
<a id='line_12326'>throughout the back more than an ell, and therewithal his spear brake.</a>
<a id='line_12327'>So then all the remnant of the four knights drew their swords and</a>
<a id='line_12328'>lashed at Sir Launcelot. And at every stroke Sir Launcelot bestowed so</a>
<a id='line_12329'>his strokes that at four strokes sundry they avoided their saddles,</a>
<a id='line_12330'>passing sore wounded; and forthwithal he rode hurling into that castle.</a>
<a id='line_12331'></a>
<a id='line_12332'>And anon the lord of the castle, that was that time cleped Sir Brian de</a>
<a id='line_12333'>les Isles, the which was a noble man and a great enemy unto King</a>
<a id='line_12334'>Arthur, within a while he was armed and upon horseback. And then they</a>
<a id='line_12335'>feutred their spears and hurled together so strongly that both their</a>
<a id='line_12336'>horses rashed to the earth. And then they avoided their saddles, and</a>
<a id='line_12337'>dressed their shields, and drew their swords, and flang together as</a>
<a id='line_12338'>wood men, and there were many strokes given in a while. At the last Sir</a>
<a id='line_12339'>Launcelot gave to Sir Brian such a buffet that he kneeled upon his</a>
<a id='line_12340'>knees, and then Sir Launcelot rashed upon him, and with great force he</a>
<a id='line_12341'>pulled off his helm; and when Sir Brian saw that he should be slain he</a>
<a id='line_12342'>yielded him, and put him in his mercy and in his grace. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_12343'>Launcelot made him to deliver all his prisoners that he had within his</a>
<a id='line_12344'>castle, and therein Sir Launcelot found of Arthur’s knights thirty, and</a>
<a id='line_12345'>forty ladies, and so he delivered them; and then he rode his way. And</a>
<a id='line_12346'>anon as La Cote Male Taile was delivered he gat his horse, and his</a>
<a id='line_12347'>harness, and his damosel Maledisant.</a>
<a id='line_12348'></a>
<a id='line_12349'>The meanwhile Sir Nerovens, that Sir Launcelot had foughten withal</a>
<a id='line_12350'>afore at the bridge, he sent a damosel after Sir Launcelot to wit how</a>
<a id='line_12351'>he sped at the Castle of Pendragon. And then they within the castle</a>
<a id='line_12352'>marvelled what knight he was, when Sir Brian and his knights delivered</a>
<a id='line_12353'>all those prisoners. Have ye no marvel, said the damosel, for the best</a>
<a id='line_12354'>knight in this world was here, and did this journey, and wit ye well,</a>
<a id='line_12355'>she said, it was Sir Launcelot. Then was Sir Brian full glad, and so</a>
<a id='line_12356'>was his lady, and all his knights, that such a man should win them. And</a>
<a id='line_12357'>when the damosel and La Cote Male Taile understood that it was Sir</a>
<a id='line_12358'>Launcelot du Lake that had ridden with them in fellowship, and that she</a>
<a id='line_12359'>remembered her how she had rebuked him and called him coward, then was</a>
<a id='line_12360'>she passing heavy.</a>
<a id='line_12361'></a>
<a id='line_12362'></a>
<a id='line_12363'></a>
<a id='line_12364'>CHAPTER VII. How Sir Launcelot met with the damosel named Male disant,</a>
<a id='line_12365'>and named her the Damosel Bienpensant.</a>
<a id='line_12366'></a>
<a id='line_12367'>So then they took their horses and rode forth a pace after Sir</a>
<a id='line_12368'>Launcelot. And within two mile they overtook him, and saluted him, and</a>
<a id='line_12369'>thanked him, and the damosel cried Sir Launcelot mercy of her evil deed</a>
<a id='line_12370'>and saying: For now I know the flower of all knighthood is departed</a>
<a id='line_12371'>even between Sir Tristram and you. For God knoweth, said the damosel,</a>
<a id='line_12372'>that I have sought you my lord, Sir Launcelot, and Sir Tristram long,</a>
<a id='line_12373'>and now I thank God I have met with you; and once at Camelot I met with</a>
<a id='line_12374'>Sir Tristram, and there he rescued this black shield with the white</a>
<a id='line_12375'>hand holding a naked sword that Sir Breuse Saunce Pité had taken from</a>
<a id='line_12376'>me. Now, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, who told you my name? Sir,</a>
<a id='line_12377'>said she, there came a damosel from a knight that ye fought withal at</a>
<a id='line_12378'>the bridge, and she told me your name was Sir Launcelot du Lake. Blame</a>
<a id='line_12379'>have she then, said Sir Launcelot, but her lord, Sir Nerovens, hath</a>
<a id='line_12380'>told her. But, damosel, said Sir Launcelot, upon this covenant I will</a>
<a id='line_12381'>ride with you, so that ye will not rebuke this knight Sir La Cote Male</a>
<a id='line_12382'>Taile no more; for he is a good knight, and I doubt not he shall prove</a>
<a id='line_12383'>a noble knight, and for his sake and pity that he should not be</a>
<a id='line_12384'>destroyed I followed him to succour him in this great need. Ah, Jesu</a>
<a id='line_12385'>thank you, said the damosel, for now I will say unto you and to him</a>
<a id='line_12386'>both, I rebuked him never for no hate that I hated him, but for great</a>
<a id='line_12387'>love that I had to him. For ever I supposed that he had been too young</a>
<a id='line_12388'>and too tender to take upon him these adventures. And therefore by my</a>
<a id='line_12389'>will I would have driven him away for jealousy that I had of his life,</a>
<a id='line_12390'>for it may be no young knight’s deed that shall enchieve this adventure</a>
<a id='line_12391'>to the end. Pardieu, said Sir Launcelot, it is well said, and where ye</a>
<a id='line_12392'>are called the Damosel Maledisant I will call you the Damosel</a>
<a id='line_12393'>Bienpensant.</a>
<a id='line_12394'></a>
<a id='line_12395'>And so they rode forth a great while unto they came to the border of</a>
<a id='line_12396'>the country of Surluse, and there they found a fair village with a</a>
<a id='line_12397'>strong bridge like a fortress. And when Sir Launcelot and they were at</a>
<a id='line_12398'>the bridge there stert forth afore them of gentlemen and yeomen many,</a>
<a id='line_12399'>that said: Fair lords, ye may not pass this bridge and this fortress</a>
<a id='line_12400'>because of that black shield that I see one of you bear, and therefore</a>
<a id='line_12401'>there shall not pass but one of you at once; therefore choose you which</a>
<a id='line_12402'>of you shall enter within this bridge first. Then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_12403'>proffered himself first to enter within this bridge. Sir, said La Cote</a>
<a id='line_12404'>Male Taile, I beseech you let me enter within this fortress, and if I</a>
<a id='line_12405'>may speed well I will send for you, and if it happened that I be slain,</a>
<a id='line_12406'>there it goeth. And if so be that I am a prisoner taken, then may ye</a>
<a id='line_12407'>rescue me. I am loath, said Sir Launcelot, to let you pass this</a>
<a id='line_12408'>passage. Sir, said La Cote Male Taile, I pray you let me put my body in</a>
<a id='line_12409'>this adventure. Now go your way, said Sir Launcelot, and Jesu be your</a>
<a id='line_12410'>speed.</a>
<a id='line_12411'></a>
<a id='line_12412'>So he entered, and anon there met with him two brethren, the one hight</a>
<a id='line_12413'>Sir Plaine de Force, and the other hight Sir Plaine de Amours. And anon</a>
<a id='line_12414'>they met with Sir La Cote Male Taile; and first La Cote Male Taile</a>
<a id='line_12415'>smote down Plaine de Force, and after he smote down Plaine de Amours;</a>
<a id='line_12416'>and then they dressed them to their shields and swords, and bade La</a>
<a id='line_12417'>Cote Male Taile alight, and so he did; and there was dashing and</a>
<a id='line_12418'>foining with swords, and so they began to assail full hard La Cote Male</a>
<a id='line_12419'>Taile, and many great wounds they gave him upon his head, and upon his</a>
<a id='line_12420'>breast, and upon his shoulders. And as he might ever among he gave sad</a>
<a id='line_12421'>strokes again. And then the two brethren traced and traversed for to be</a>
<a id='line_12422'>of both hands of Sir La Cote Male Taile, but he by fine force and</a>
<a id='line_12423'>knightly prowess gat them afore him. And then when he felt himself so</a>
<a id='line_12424'>wounded, then he doubled his strokes, and gave them so many wounds that</a>
<a id='line_12425'>he felled them to the earth, and would have slain them had they not</a>
<a id='line_12426'>yielded them. And right so Sir La Cote Male Taile took the best horse</a>
<a id='line_12427'>that there was of them three, and so rode forth his way to the other</a>
<a id='line_12428'>fortress and bridge; and there he met with the third brother whose name</a>
<a id='line_12429'>was Sir Plenorius, a full noble knight, and there they jousted</a>
<a id='line_12430'>together, and either smote other down, horse and man, to the earth. And</a>
<a id='line_12431'>then they avoided their horses, and dressed their shields, and drew</a>
<a id='line_12432'>their swords, and gave many sad strokes, and one while the one knight</a>
<a id='line_12433'>was afore on the bridge, and another while the other. And thus they</a>
<a id='line_12434'>fought two hours and more, and never rested. And ever Sir Launcelot and</a>
<a id='line_12435'>the damosel beheld them. Alas, said the damosel, my knight fighteth</a>
<a id='line_12436'>passing sore and over long. Now may ye see, said Sir Launcelot, that he</a>
<a id='line_12437'>is a noble knight, for to consider his first battle, and his grievous</a>
<a id='line_12438'>wounds; and even forthwithal so wounded as he is, it is marvel that he</a>
<a id='line_12439'>may endure this long battle with that good knight.</a>
<a id='line_12440'></a>
<a id='line_12441'></a>
<a id='line_12442'></a>
<a id='line_12443'>CHAPTER VIII. How La Cote Male Taile was taken prisoner, and after</a>
<a id='line_12444'>rescued by Sir Launcelot, and how Sir Launcelot overcame four brethren.</a>
<a id='line_12445'></a>
<a id='line_12446'>This meanwhile Sir La Cote Male Taile sank right down upon the earth,</a>
<a id='line_12447'>what for-wounded and what for-bled he might not stand. Then the other</a>
<a id='line_12448'>knight had pity of him, and said: Fair young knight, dismay you not,</a>
<a id='line_12449'>for had ye been fresh when ye met with me, as I was, I wot well that I</a>
<a id='line_12450'>should not have endured so long as ye have done; and therefore for your</a>
<a id='line_12451'>noble deeds of arms I shall show to you kindness and gentleness in all</a>
<a id='line_12452'>that I may. And forthwithal this noble knight, Sir Plenorius, took him</a>
<a id='line_12453'>up in his arms, and led him into his tower. And then he commanded him</a>
<a id='line_12454'>the wine, and made to search him and to stop his bleeding wounds. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_12455'>said La Cote Male Taile, withdraw you from me, and hie you to yonder</a>
<a id='line_12456'>bridge again, for there will meet with you another manner knight than</a>
<a id='line_12457'>ever was I. Why, said Plenorius, is there another manner knight behind</a>
<a id='line_12458'>of your fellowship? Yea, said La Cote Male Taile, there is a much</a>
<a id='line_12459'>better knight than I am. What is his name? said Plenorius. Ye shall not</a>
<a id='line_12460'>know for me, said La Cote Male Taile. Well, said the knight, he shall</a>
<a id='line_12461'>be encountered withal whatsomever he be.</a>
<a id='line_12462'></a>
<a id='line_12463'>Then Sir Plenorius heard a knight call that said: Sir Plenorius, where</a>
<a id='line_12464'>art thou? either thou must deliver me the prisoner that thou hast led</a>
<a id='line_12465'>unto thy tower, or else come and do battle with me. Then Plenorius gat</a>
<a id='line_12466'>his horse, and came with a spear in his hand walloping toward Sir</a>
<a id='line_12467'>Launcelot; and then they began to feutre their spears, and came</a>
<a id='line_12468'>together as thunder, and smote either other so mightily that their</a>
<a id='line_12469'>horses fell down under them. And then they avoided their horses, and</a>
<a id='line_12470'>pulled out their swords, and like two bulls they lashed together with</a>
<a id='line_12471'>great strokes and foins; but ever Sir Launcelot recovered ground upon</a>
<a id='line_12472'>him, and Sir Plenorius traced to have gone about him. But Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_12473'>would not suffer that, but bare him backer and backer, till he came</a>
<a id='line_12474'>nigh his tower gate. And then said Sir Launcelot: I know thee well for</a>
<a id='line_12475'>a good knight, but wit thou well thy life and death is in my hand, and</a>
<a id='line_12476'>therefore yield thee to me, and thy prisoner. The other answered no</a>
<a id='line_12477'>word, but struck mightily upon Sir Launcelot’s helm, that the fire</a>
<a id='line_12478'>sprang out of his eyes. Then Sir Launcelot doubled his strokes so</a>
<a id='line_12479'>thick, and smote at him so mightily, that he made him kneel upon his</a>
<a id='line_12480'>knees. And therewith Sir Launcelot leapt upon him, and pulled him</a>
<a id='line_12481'>grovelling down. Then Sir Plenorius yielded him, and his tower, and all</a>
<a id='line_12482'>his prisoners at his will.</a>
<a id='line_12483'></a>
<a id='line_12484'>Then Sir Launcelot received him and took his troth; and then he rode to</a>
<a id='line_12485'>the other bridge, and there Sir Launcelot jousted with other three of</a>
<a id='line_12486'>his brethren, the one hight Pillounes, and the other hight Pellogris,</a>
<a id='line_12487'>and the third Sir Pellandris. And first upon horseback Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_12488'>smote them down, and afterward he beat them on foot, and made them to</a>
<a id='line_12489'>yield them unto him; and then he returned unto Sir Plenorius, and there</a>
<a id='line_12490'>he found in his prison King Carados of Scotland, and many other</a>
<a id='line_12491'>knights, and all they were delivered. And then Sir La Cote Male Taile</a>
<a id='line_12492'>came to Sir Launcelot, and then Sir Launcelot would have given him all</a>
<a id='line_12493'>these fortresses and these bridges. Nay, said La Cote Male Taile, I</a>
<a id='line_12494'>will not have Sir Plenorius’ livelihood; with that he will grant you,</a>
<a id='line_12495'>my lord Sir Launcelot, to come unto King Arthur’s court, and to be his</a>
<a id='line_12496'>knight, and all his brethren, I will pray you, my lord, to let him have</a>
<a id='line_12497'>his livelihood. I will well, said Sir Launcelot, with this that he will</a>
<a id='line_12498'>come to the court of King Arthur and become his man, and his brethren</a>
<a id='line_12499'>five. And as for you, Sir Plenorius, I will undertake, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12500'>Launcelot, at the next feast, so there be a place voided, that ye shall</a>
<a id='line_12501'>be Knight of the Round Table. Sir, said Plenorius, at the next feast of</a>
<a id='line_12502'>Pentecost I will be at Arthur’s court, and at that time I will be</a>
<a id='line_12503'>guided and ruled as King Arthur and ye will have me. Then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_12504'>and Sir La Cote Male Taile reposed them there, unto the time that Sir</a>
<a id='line_12505'>La Cote Male Taile was whole of his wounds, and there they had merry</a>
<a id='line_12506'>cheer, and good rest, and many good games, and there were many fair</a>
<a id='line_12507'>ladies.</a>

<a id='line_12511'>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Launcelot made La Cote Male Taile lord of the</a>
<a id='line_12512'>Castle of Pendragon, and after was made knight of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_12513'></a>
<a id='line_12514'>And in the meanwhile came Sir Kay, the Seneschal, and Sir Brandiles,</a>
<a id='line_12515'>and anon they fellowshipped with them. And then within ten days, then</a>
<a id='line_12516'>departed those knights of Arthur’s court from these fortresses. And as</a>
<a id='line_12517'>Sir Launcelot came by the Castle of Pendragon there he put Sir Brian de</a>
<a id='line_12518'>les Isles from his lands, for cause he would never be withhold with</a>
<a id='line_12519'>King Arthur; and all that Castle of Pendragon and all the lands thereof</a>
<a id='line_12520'>he gave to Sir La Cote Male Taile. And then Sir Launcelot sent for</a>
<a id='line_12521'>Nerovens that he made once knight, and he made him to have all the rule</a>
<a id='line_12522'>of that castle and of that country, under La Cote Male Taile; and so</a>
<a id='line_12523'>they rode to Arthur’s court all wholly together. And at Pentecost next</a>
<a id='line_12524'>following there was Sir Plenorius and Sir La Cote Male Taile, called</a>
<a id='line_12525'>otherwise by right Sir Breunor le Noire, both made Knights of the Table</a>
<a id='line_12526'>Round; and great lands King Arthur gave them, and there Breunor le</a>
<a id='line_12527'>Noire wedded that damosel Maledisant. And after she was called</a>
<a id='line_12528'>Beauvivante, but ever after for the more part he was called La Cote</a>
<a id='line_12529'>Male Taile; and he proved a passing noble knight, and mighty; and many</a>
<a id='line_12530'>worshipful deeds he did after in his life; and Sir Plenorius proved a</a>
<a id='line_12531'>noble knight and full of prowess, and all the days of their life for</a>
<a id='line_12532'>the most part they awaited upon Sir Launcelot; and Sir Plenorius’</a>
<a id='line_12533'>brethren were ever knights of King Arthur. And also, as the French book</a>
<a id='line_12534'>maketh mention, Sir La Cote Male Taile avenged his father’s death.</a>

<a id='line_12538'>CHAPTER X. How La Beale Isoud sent letters to Sir Tristram by her maid</a>
<a id='line_12539'>Bragwaine, and of divers adventures of Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_12540'></a>
<a id='line_12541'>Now leave we here Sir La Cote Male Taile, and turn we unto Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_12542'>de Liones that was in Brittany. When La Beale Isoud understood that he</a>
<a id='line_12543'>was wedded she sent to him by her maiden Bragwaine as piteous letters</a>
<a id='line_12544'>as could be thought and made, and her conclusion was that, an it</a>
<a id='line_12545'>pleased Sir Tristram, that he would come to her court, and bring with</a>
<a id='line_12546'>him Isoud la Blanche Mains, and they should be kept as well as she</a>
<a id='line_12547'>herself. Then Sir Tristram called unto him Sir Kehydius, and asked him</a>
<a id='line_12548'>whether he would go with him into Cornwall secretly. He answered him</a>
<a id='line_12549'>that he was ready at all times. And then he let ordain privily a little</a>
<a id='line_12550'>vessel, and therein they went, Sir Tristram, Kehydius, Dame Bragwaine,</a>
<a id='line_12551'>and Gouvernail, Sir Tristram’s squire. So when they were in the sea a</a>
<a id='line_12552'>contrarious wind blew them on the coasts of North Wales, nigh the</a>
<a id='line_12553'>Castle Perilous. Then said Sir Tristram: Here shall ye abide me these</a>
<a id='line_12554'>ten days, and Gouvernail, my squire, with you. And if so be I come not</a>
<a id='line_12555'>again by that day take the next way into Cornwall; for in this forest</a>
<a id='line_12556'>are many strange adventures, as I have heard say, and some of them I</a>
<a id='line_12557'>cast me to prove or I depart. And when I may I shall hie me after you.</a>
<a id='line_12558'></a>
<a id='line_12559'>Then Sir Tristram and Kehydius took their horses and departed from</a>
<a id='line_12560'>their fellowship. And so they rode within that forest a mile and more;</a>
<a id='line_12561'>and at the last Sir Tristram saw afore him a likely knight, armed,</a>
<a id='line_12562'>sitting by a well, and a strong mighty horse passing nigh him tied to</a>
<a id='line_12563'>an oak, and a man hoving and riding by him leading an horse laden with</a>
<a id='line_12564'>spears. And this knight that sat at the well seemed by his countenance</a>
<a id='line_12565'>to be passing heavy. Then Sir Tristram rode near him and said: Fair</a>
<a id='line_12566'>knight, why sit ye so drooping? ye seem to be a knight-errant by your</a>
<a id='line_12567'>arms and harness, and therefore dress you to joust with one of us, or</a>
<a id='line_12568'>with both. Therewithal that knight made no words, but took his shield</a>
<a id='line_12569'>and buckled it about his neck, and lightly he took his horse and leapt</a>
<a id='line_12570'>upon him. And then he took a great spear of his squire, and departed</a>
<a id='line_12571'>his way a furlong. Sir Kehydius asked leave of Sir Tristram to joust</a>
<a id='line_12572'>first. Do your best, said Sir Tristram. So they met together, and there</a>
<a id='line_12573'>Sir Kehydius had a fall, and was sore wounded on high above the paps.</a>
<a id='line_12574'>Then Sir Tristram said: Knight, that is well jousted, now make you</a>
<a id='line_12575'>ready unto me. I am ready, said the knight. And then that knight took a</a>
<a id='line_12576'>greater spear in his hand, and encountered with Sir Tristram, and there</a>
<a id='line_12577'>by great force that knight smote down Sir Tristram from his horse and</a>
<a id='line_12578'>had a great fall. Then Sir Tristram was sore ashamed, and lightly he</a>
<a id='line_12579'>avoided his horse, and put his shield afore his shoulder, and drew his</a>
<a id='line_12580'>sword. And then Sir Tristram required that knight of his knighthood to</a>
<a id='line_12581'>alight upon foot and fight with him. I will well, said the knight; and</a>
<a id='line_12582'>so he alighted upon foot, and avoided his horse, and cast his shield</a>
<a id='line_12583'>upon his shoulder, and drew his sword, and there they fought a long</a>
<a id='line_12584'>battle together full nigh two hours. Then Sir Tristram said: Fair</a>
<a id='line_12585'>knight, hold thine hand, and tell me of whence thou art, and what is</a>
<a id='line_12586'>thy name. As for that, said the knight, I will be avised; but an thou</a>
<a id='line_12587'>wilt tell me thy name peradventure I will tell thee mine.</a>

<a id='line_12592'>they fought, and after accorded never to fight together.</a>
<a id='line_12593'></a>
<a id='line_12594'>Now fair knight, he said, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_12595'>the other knight, and my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis. Ah, Sir Lamorak,</a>
<a id='line_12596'>said Sir Tristram, well be we met, and bethink thee now of the despite</a>
<a id='line_12597'>thou didst me of the sending of the horn unto King Mark’s court, to the</a>
<a id='line_12598'>intent to have slain or dishonoured my lady the queen, La Beale Isoud;</a>
<a id='line_12599'>and therefore wit thou well, said Sir Tristram, the one of us shall die</a>
<a id='line_12600'>or we depart. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, remember that we were together in</a>
<a id='line_12601'>the Isle of Servage, and at that time ye promised me great friendship.</a>
<a id='line_12602'>Then Sir Tristram would make no longer delays, but lashed at Sir</a>
<a id='line_12603'>Lamorak; and thus they fought long till either were weary of other.</a>
<a id='line_12604'>Then Sir Tristram said to Sir Lamorak: In all my life met I never with</a>
<a id='line_12605'>such a knight that was so big and well breathed as ye be, therefore,</a>
<a id='line_12606'>said Sir Tristram, it were pity that any of us both should here be</a>
<a id='line_12607'>mischieved. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, for your renown and name I will that</a>
<a id='line_12608'>ye have the worship of this battle, and therefore I will yield me unto</a>
<a id='line_12609'>you. And therewith he took the point of his sword to yield him. Nay,</a>
<a id='line_12610'>said Sir Tristram, ye shall not do so, for well I know your proffers,</a>
<a id='line_12611'>and more of your gentleness than for any fear or dread ye have of me.</a>
<a id='line_12612'>And therewithal Sir Tristram proffered him his sword and said: Sir</a>
<a id='line_12613'>Lamorak, as an overcome knight I yield me unto you as to a man of the</a>
<a id='line_12614'>most noble prowess that ever I met withal. Nay, said Sir Lamorak, I</a>
<a id='line_12615'>will do you gentleness; I require you let us be sworn together that</a>
<a id='line_12616'>never none of us shall after this day have ado with other. And</a>
<a id='line_12617'>therewithal Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak sware that never none of them</a>
<a id='line_12618'>should fight against other, nor for weal nor for woe.</a>

<a id='line_12622'>CHAPTER XII. How Sir Palomides followed the Questing Beast, and smote</a>
<a id='line_12623'>down Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak with one spear.</a>
<a id='line_12624'></a>
<a id='line_12625'>And this meanwhile there came Sir Palomides, the good knight, following</a>
<a id='line_12626'>the Questing Beast that had in shape a head like a serpent’s head, and</a>
<a id='line_12627'>a body like a leopard, buttocks like a lion, and footed like an hart;</a>
<a id='line_12628'>and in his body there was such a noise as it had been the noise of</a>
<a id='line_12629'>thirty couple of hounds questing, and such a noise that beast made</a>
<a id='line_12630'>wheresomever he went; and this beast ever more Sir Palomides followed,</a>
<a id='line_12631'>for it was called his quest. And right so as he followed this beast it</a>
<a id='line_12632'>came by Sir Tristram, and soon after came Palomides. And to brief this</a>
<a id='line_12633'>matter he smote down Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak both with one spear;</a>
<a id='line_12634'>and so he departed after the beast Galtisant, that was called the</a>
<a id='line_12635'>Questing Beast; wherefore these two knights were passing wroth that Sir</a>
<a id='line_12636'>Palomides would not fight on foot with them. Here men may understand</a>
<a id='line_12637'>that be of worship, that he was never formed that all times might</a>
<a id='line_12638'>stand, but sometime he was put to the worse by mal-fortune; and at</a>
<a id='line_12639'>sometime the worse knight put the better knight to a rebuke.</a>
<a id='line_12640'></a>
<a id='line_12641'>Then Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak gat Sir Kehydius upon a shield</a>
<a id='line_12642'>betwixt them both, and led him to a forester’s lodge, and there they</a>
<a id='line_12643'>gave him in charge to keep him well, and with him they abode three</a>
<a id='line_12644'>days. Then the two knights took their horses and at the cross they</a>
<a id='line_12645'>departed. And then said Sir Tristram to Sir Lamorak: I require you if</a>
<a id='line_12646'>ye hap to meet with Sir Palomides, say him that he shall find me at the</a>
<a id='line_12647'>same well where I met him, and there I, Sir Tristram, shall prove</a>
<a id='line_12648'>whether he be better knight than I. And so either departed from other a</a>
<a id='line_12649'>sundry way, and Sir Tristram rode nigh thereas was Sir Kehydius; and</a>
<a id='line_12650'>Sir Lamorak rode until he came to a chapel, and there he put his horse</a>
<a id='line_12651'>unto pasture. And anon there came Sir Meliagaunce, that was King</a>
<a id='line_12652'>Bagdemagus’ son, and he there put his horse to pasture, and was not</a>
<a id='line_12653'>ware of Sir Lamorak; and then this knight Sir Meliagaunce made his moan</a>
<a id='line_12654'>of the love that he had to Queen Guenever, and there he made a woful</a>
<a id='line_12655'>complaint. All this heard Sir Lamorak, and on the morn Sir Lamorak took</a>
<a id='line_12656'>his horse and rode unto the forest, and there he met with two knights</a>
<a id='line_12657'>hoving under the wood-shaw. Fair knights, said Sir Lamorak, what do ye</a>
<a id='line_12658'>hoving here and watching? and if ye be knights-errant that will joust,</a>
<a id='line_12659'>lo I am ready. Nay, sir knight, they said, not so, we abide not here to</a>
<a id='line_12660'>joust with you, but we lie here in await of a knight that slew our</a>
<a id='line_12661'>brother. What knight was that, said Sir Lamorak, that you would fain</a>
<a id='line_12662'>meet withal? Sir, they said, it is Sir Launcelot that slew our brother,</a>
<a id='line_12663'>and if ever we may meet with him he shall not escape, but we shall slay</a>
<a id='line_12664'>him. Ye take upon you a great charge, said Sir Lamorak, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_12665'>Launcelot is a noble proved knight. As for that we doubt not, for there</a>
<a id='line_12666'>nis none of us but we are good enough for him. I will not believe that,</a>
<a id='line_12667'>said Sir Lamorak, for I heard never yet of no knight the days of my</a>
<a id='line_12668'>life but Sir Launcelot was too big for him.</a>
<a id='line_12669'></a>
<a id='line_12670'></a>
<a id='line_12671'></a>
<a id='line_12672'>CHAPTER XIII. How Sir Lamorak met with Sir Meliagaunce, and fought</a>
<a id='line_12673'>together for the beauty of Dame Guenever.</a>
<a id='line_12674'></a>
<a id='line_12675'>Right so as they stood talking thus Sir Lamorak was ware how Sir</a>
<a id='line_12676'>Launcelot came riding straight toward them; then Sir Lamorak saluted</a>
<a id='line_12677'>him, and he him again. And then Sir Lamorak asked Sir Launcelot if</a>
<a id='line_12678'>there were anything that he might do for him in these marches. Nay,</a>
<a id='line_12679'>said Sir Launcelot, not at this time I thank you. Then either departed</a>
<a id='line_12680'>from other, and Sir Lamorak rode again thereas he left the two knights,</a>
<a id='line_12681'>and then he found them hid in the leaved wood. Fie on you, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12682'>Lamorak, false cowards, pity and shame it is that any of you should</a>
<a id='line_12683'>take the high order of knighthood. So Sir Lamorak departed from them,</a>
<a id='line_12684'>and within a while he met with Sir Meliagaunce. And then Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_12685'>asked him why he loved Queen Guenever as he did: For I was not far from</a>
<a id='line_12686'>you when ye made your complaint by the chapel. Did ye so? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12687'>Meliagaunce, then will I abide by it: I love Queen Guenever, what will</a>
<a id='line_12688'>ye with it? I will prove and make good that she is the fairest lady and</a>
<a id='line_12689'>most of beauty in the world. As to that, said Sir Lamorak, I say nay</a>
<a id='line_12690'>thereto, for Queen Morgawse of Orkney, mother to Sir Gawaine, and his</a>
<a id='line_12691'>mother is the fairest queen and lady that beareth the life. That is not</a>
<a id='line_12692'>so, said Sir Meliagaunce, and that will I prove with my hands upon thy</a>
<a id='line_12693'>body. Will ye so? said Sir Lamorak, and in a better quarrel keep I not</a>
<a id='line_12694'>to fight. Then they departed either from other in great wrath. And then</a>
<a id='line_12695'>they came riding together as it had been thunder, and either smote</a>
<a id='line_12696'>other so sore that their horses fell backward to the earth. And then</a>
<a id='line_12697'>they avoided their horses, and dressed their shields, and drew their</a>
<a id='line_12698'>swords. And then they hurtled together as wild boars, and thus they</a>
<a id='line_12699'>fought a great while. For Meliagaunce was a good man and of great</a>
<a id='line_12700'>might, but Sir Lamorak was hard big for him, and put him always aback,</a>
<a id='line_12701'>but either had wounded other sore.</a>
<a id='line_12702'></a>
<a id='line_12703'>And as they stood thus fighting, by fortune came Sir Launcelot and Sir</a>
<a id='line_12704'>Bleoberis riding. And then Sir Launcelot rode betwixt them, and asked</a>
<a id='line_12705'>them for what cause they fought so together: And ye are both knights of</a>
<a id='line_12706'>King Arthur!</a>
<a id='line_12707'></a>
<a id='line_12708'>Sir, said Meliagaunce, I shall tell you for what cause we do this</a>
<a id='line_12709'>battle. I praised my lady, Queen Guenever, and said she was the fairest</a>
<a id='line_12710'>lady of the world, and Sir Lamorak said nay thereto, for he said Queen</a>
<a id='line_12711'>Morgawse of Orkney was fairer than she and more of beauty. Ah, Sir</a>
<a id='line_12712'>Lamorak, why sayest thou so? it is not thy part to dispraise thy</a>
<a id='line_12713'>princess that thou art under her obeissance, and we all. And therewith</a>
<a id='line_12714'>he alighted on foot, and said: For this quarrel, make thee ready, for I</a>
<a id='line_12715'>will prove upon thee that Queen Guenever is the fairest lady and most</a>
<a id='line_12716'>of bounty in the world. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, I am loath to have ado</a>
<a id='line_12717'>with you in this quarrel, for every man thinketh his own lady fairest;</a>
<a id='line_12718'>and though I praise the lady that I love most ye should not be wroth;</a>
<a id='line_12719'>for though my lady, Queen Guenever, be fairest in your eye, wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_12720'>Queen Morgawse of Orkney is fairest in mine eye, and so every knight</a>
<a id='line_12721'>thinketh his own lady fairest; and wit ye well, sir, ye are the man in</a>
<a id='line_12722'>the world except Sir Tristram that I am most loathest to have ado</a>
<a id='line_12723'>withal, but, an ye will needs fight with me I shall endure you as long</a>
<a id='line_12724'>as I may. Then spake Sir Bleoberis and said: My lord Sir Launcelot, I</a>
<a id='line_12725'>wist you never so misadvised as ye are now, for Sir Lamorak sayeth you</a>
<a id='line_12726'>but reason and knightly; for I warn you I have a lady, and methinketh</a>
<a id='line_12727'>that she is the fairest lady of the world. Were this a great reason</a>
<a id='line_12728'>that ye should be wroth with me for such language? And well ye wot,</a>
<a id='line_12729'>that Sir Lamorak is as noble a knight as I know, and he hath ought you</a>
<a id='line_12730'>and us ever good will, and therefore I pray you be good friends. Then</a>
<a id='line_12731'>Sir Launcelot said unto Sir Lamorak. I pray you forgive me mine evil</a>
<a id='line_12732'>will, and if I was misadvised I will amend it. Sir, said Sir Lamorak,</a>
<a id='line_12733'>the amends is soon made betwixt you and me. And so Sir Launcelot and</a>
<a id='line_12734'>Sir Bleoberis departed, and Sir Meliagaunce and Sir Lamorak took their</a>
<a id='line_12735'>horses, and either departed from other.</a>
<a id='line_12736'></a>
<a id='line_12737'>And within a while came King Arthur, and met with Sir Lamorak, and</a>
<a id='line_12738'>jousted with him; and there he smote down Sir Lamorak, and wounded him</a>
<a id='line_12739'>sore with a spear, and so he rode from him; wherefore Sir Lamorak was</a>
<a id='line_12740'>wroth that he would not fight with him on foot, howbeit that Sir</a>
<a id='line_12741'>Lamorak knew not King Arthur.</a>

<a id='line_12745'>CHAPTER XIV. How Sir Kay met with Sir Tristram, and after of the shame</a>
<a id='line_12746'>spoken of the knights of Cornwall, and how they jousted.</a>
<a id='line_12747'></a>
<a id='line_12748'>Now leave we of this tale, and speak we of Sir Tristram, that as he</a>
<a id='line_12749'>rode he met with Sir Kay, the Seneschal; and there Sir Kay asked Sir</a>
<a id='line_12750'>Tristram of what country he was. He answered that he was of the country</a>
<a id='line_12751'>of Cornwall. It may well be, said Sir Kay, for yet heard I never that</a>
<a id='line_12752'>ever good knight came out of Cornwall. That is evil spoken, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12753'>Tristram, but an it please you to tell me your name I require you. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_12754'>wit ye well, said Sir Kay, that my name is Sir Kay, the Seneschal. Is</a>
<a id='line_12755'>that your name? said Sir Tristram, now wit ye well that ye are named</a>
<a id='line_12756'>the shamefullest knight of your tongue that now is living; howbeit ye</a>
<a id='line_12757'>are called a good knight, but ye are called unfortunate, and passing</a>
<a id='line_12758'>overthwart of your tongue. And thus they rode together till they came</a>
<a id='line_12759'>to a bridge. And there was a knight would not let them pass till one of</a>
<a id='line_12760'>them jousted with him; and so that knight jousted with Sir Kay, and</a>
<a id='line_12761'>there that knight gave Sir Kay a fall: his name was Sir Tor, Sir</a>
<a id='line_12762'>Lamorak’s half-brother. And then they two rode to their lodging, and</a>
<a id='line_12763'>there they found Sir Brandiles, and Sir Tor came thither anon after.</a>
<a id='line_12764'>And as they sat at supper these four knights, three of them spake all</a>
<a id='line_12765'>shame by Cornish knights. Sir Tristram heard all that they said and he</a>
<a id='line_12766'>said but little, but he thought the more, but at that time he</a>
<a id='line_12767'>discovered not his name.</a>
<a id='line_12768'></a>
<a id='line_12769'>Upon the morn Sir Tristram took his horse and abode them upon their</a>
<a id='line_12770'>way. And there Sir Brandiles proffered to joust with Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_12771'>Sir Tristram smote him down, horse and all, to the earth. Then Sir Tor</a>
<a id='line_12772'>le Fise de Vayshoure encountered with Sir Tristram and there Sir</a>
<a id='line_12773'>Tristram smote him down, and then he rode his way, and Sir Kay followed</a>
<a id='line_12774'>him, but he would not of his fellowship. Then Sir Brandiles came to Sir</a>
<a id='line_12775'>Kay and said: I would wit fain what is that knight’s name. Come on with</a>
<a id='line_12776'>me, said Sir Kay, and we shall pray him to tell us his name. So they</a>
<a id='line_12777'>rode together till they came nigh him, and then they were ware where he</a>
<a id='line_12778'>sat by a well, and had put off his helm to drink at the well. And when</a>
<a id='line_12779'>he saw them come he laced on his helm lightly, and took his horse, and</a>
<a id='line_12780'>proffered them to joust. Nay, said Sir Brandiles, we jousted late</a>
<a id='line_12781'>enough with you, we come not in that intent. But for this we come to</a>
<a id='line_12782'>require you of knighthood to tell us your name. My fair knights, sithen</a>
<a id='line_12783'>that is your desire, and to please you, ye shall wit that my name is</a>
<a id='line_12784'>Sir Tristram de Liones, nephew unto King Mark of Cornwall. In good</a>
<a id='line_12785'>time, said Sir Brandiles, and well be ye found, and wit ye well that we</a>
<a id='line_12786'>be right glad that we have found you, and we be of a fellowship that</a>
<a id='line_12787'>would be right glad of your company. For ye are the knight in the world</a>
<a id='line_12788'>that the noble fellowship of the Round Table most desireth to have the</a>
<a id='line_12789'>company of. God thank them, said Sir Tristram, of their great goodness,</a>
<a id='line_12790'>but as yet I feel well that I am unable to be of their fellowship, for</a>
<a id='line_12791'>I was never yet of such deeds of worthiness to be in the company of</a>
<a id='line_12792'>such a fellowship. Ah, said Sir Kay, an ye be Sir Tristram de Liones,</a>
<a id='line_12793'>ye are the man called now most of prowess except Sir Launcelot du Lake;</a>
<a id='line_12794'>for he beareth not the life, Christian nor heathen, that can find such</a>
<a id='line_12795'>another knight, to speak of his prowess, and of his hands, and his</a>
<a id='line_12796'>truth withal. For yet could there never creature say of him dishonour</a>
<a id='line_12797'>and make it good. Thus they talked a great while, and then they</a>
<a id='line_12798'>departed either from other such ways as them seemed best.</a>

<a id='line_12802'>CHAPTER XV. How King Arthur was brought into the Forest Perilous, and</a>
<a id='line_12803'>how Sir Tristram saved his life.</a>
<a id='line_12804'></a>
<a id='line_12805'>Now shall ye hear what was the cause that King Arthur came into the</a>
<a id='line_12806'>Forest Perilous, that was in North Wales, by the means of a lady. Her</a>
<a id='line_12807'>name was Annowre, and this lady came to King Arthur at Cardiff; and she</a>
<a id='line_12808'>by fair promise and fair behests made King Arthur to ride with her into</a>
<a id='line_12809'>that Forest Perilous; and she was a great sorceress; and many days she</a>
<a id='line_12810'>had loved King Arthur, and because she would have him to lie by her she</a>
<a id='line_12811'>came into that country. So when the king was gone with her many of his</a>
<a id='line_12812'>knights followed after King Arthur when they missed him, as Sir</a>
<a id='line_12813'>Launcelot, Brandiles, and many other; and when she had brought him to</a>
<a id='line_12814'>her tower she desired him to lie by her; and then the king remembered</a>
<a id='line_12815'>him of his lady, and would not lie by her for no craft that she could</a>
<a id='line_12816'>do. Then every day she would make him ride into that forest with his</a>
<a id='line_12817'>own knights, to the intent to have had King Arthur slain. For when this</a>
<a id='line_12818'>Lady Annowre saw that she might not have him at her will, then she</a>
<a id='line_12819'>laboured by false means to have destroyed King Arthur, and slain.</a>
<a id='line_12820'></a>
<a id='line_12821'>Then the Lady of the Lake that was alway friendly to King Arthur, she</a>
<a id='line_12822'>understood by her subtle crafts that King Arthur was like to be</a>
<a id='line_12823'>destroyed. And therefore this Lady of the Lake, that hight Nimue, came</a>
<a id='line_12824'>into that forest to seek after Sir Launcelot du Lake or Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_12825'>for to help King Arthur; foras that same day this Lady of the Lake knew</a>
<a id='line_12826'>well that King Arthur should be slain, unless that he had help of one</a>
<a id='line_12827'>of these two knights. And thus she rode up and down till she met with</a>
<a id='line_12828'>Sir Tristram, and anon as she saw him she knew him. O my lord Sir</a>
<a id='line_12829'>Tristram, she said, well be ye met, and blessed be the time that I have</a>
<a id='line_12830'>met with you; for this same day, and within these two hours, shall be</a>
<a id='line_12831'>done the foulest deed that ever was done in this land. O fair damosel,</a>
<a id='line_12832'>said Sir Tristram, may I amend it. Come on with me, she said, and that</a>
<a id='line_12833'>in all the haste ye may, for ye shall see the most worshipfullest</a>
<a id='line_12834'>knight of the world hard bestead. Then said Sir Tristram: I am ready to</a>
<a id='line_12835'>help such a noble man. He is neither better nor worse, said the Lady of</a>
<a id='line_12836'>the Lake, but the noble King Arthur himself. God defend, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12837'>Tristram, that ever he should be in such distress. Then they rode</a>
<a id='line_12838'>together a great pace, until they came to a little turret or castle;</a>
<a id='line_12839'>and underneath that castle they saw a knight standing upon foot</a>
<a id='line_12840'>fighting with two knights; and so Sir Tristram beheld them, and at the</a>
<a id='line_12841'>last the two knights smote down the one knight, and that one of them</a>
<a id='line_12842'>unlaced his helm to have slain him. And the Lady Annowre gat King</a>
<a id='line_12843'>Arthur’s sword in her hand to have stricken off his head. And</a>
<a id='line_12844'>therewithal came Sir Tristram with all his might, crying: Traitress,</a>
<a id='line_12845'>traitress, leave that. And anon there Sir Tristram smote the one of the</a>
<a id='line_12846'>knights through the body that he fell dead; and then he rashed to the</a>
<a id='line_12847'>other and smote his back asunder; and in the meanwhile the Lady of the</a>
<a id='line_12848'>Lake cried to King Arthur: Let not that false lady escape. Then King</a>
<a id='line_12849'>Arthur overtook her, and with the same sword he smote off her head, and</a>
<a id='line_12850'>the Lady of the Lake took up her head and hung it up by the hair of her</a>
<a id='line_12851'>saddle-bow. And then Sir Tristram horsed King Arthur and rode forth</a>
<a id='line_12852'>with him, but he charged the Lady of the Lake not to discover his name</a>
<a id='line_12853'>as at that time.</a>
<a id='line_12854'></a>
<a id='line_12855'>When the king was horsed he thanked heartily Sir Tristram, and desired</a>
<a id='line_12856'>to wit his name; but he would not tell him, but that he was a poor</a>
<a id='line_12857'>knight adventurous; and so he bare King Arthur fellowship till he met</a>
<a id='line_12858'>with some of his knights. And within a while he met with Sir Ector de</a>
<a id='line_12859'>Maris, and he knew not King Arthur nor Sir Tristram, and he desired to</a>
<a id='line_12860'>joust with one of them. Then Sir Tristram rode unto Sir Ector, and</a>
<a id='line_12861'>smote him from his horse. And when he had done so he came again to the</a>
<a id='line_12862'>king and said: My lord, yonder is one of your knights, he may bare you</a>
<a id='line_12863'>fellowship, and another day that deed that I have done for you I trust</a>
<a id='line_12864'>to God ye shall understand that I would do you service. Alas, said King</a>
<a id='line_12865'>Arthur, let me wit what ye are? Not at this time, said Sir Tristram. So</a>
<a id='line_12866'>he departed and left King Arthur and Sir Ector together.</a>

<a id='line_12871'>began to love Beale Isoud, and of a letter that Tristram found.</a>
<a id='line_12872'></a>
<a id='line_12873'>And then at a day set Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak met at the well; and</a>
<a id='line_12874'>then they took Kehydius at the forester’s house, and so they rode with</a>
<a id='line_12875'>him to the ship where they left Dame Bragwaine and Gouvernail, and so</a>
<a id='line_12876'>they sailed into Cornwall all wholly together. And by assent and</a>
<a id='line_12877'>information of Dame Bragwaine when they were landed they rode unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_12878'>Dinas, the Seneschal, a trusty friend of Sir Tristram’s. And so Dame</a>
<a id='line_12879'>Bragwaine and Sir Dinas rode to the court of King Mark, and told the</a>
<a id='line_12880'>queen, La Beale Isoud, that Sir Tristram was nigh her in that country.</a>
<a id='line_12881'>Then for very pure joy La Beale Isoud swooned; and when she might speak</a>
<a id='line_12882'>she said: Gentle knight Seneschal, help that I might speak with him,</a>
<a id='line_12883'>outher my heart will brast. Then Sir Dinas and Dame Bragwaine brought</a>
<a id='line_12884'>Sir Tristram and Kehydius privily unto the court, unto a chamber</a>
<a id='line_12885'>whereas La Beale Isoud had assigned it; and to tell the joys that were</a>
<a id='line_12886'>betwixt La Beale Isoud and Sir Tristram, there is no tongue can tell</a>
<a id='line_12887'>it, nor heart think it, nor pen write it. And as the French book maketh</a>
<a id='line_12888'>mention, at the first time that ever Sir Kehydius saw La Beale Isoud he</a>
<a id='line_12889'>was so enamoured upon her that for very pure love he might never</a>
<a id='line_12890'>withdraw it. And at the last, as ye shall hear or the book be ended,</a>
<a id='line_12891'>Sir Kehydius died for the love of La Beale Isoud. And then privily he</a>
<a id='line_12892'>wrote unto her letters and ballads of the most goodliest that were used</a>
<a id='line_12893'>in those days. And when La Beale Isoud understood his letters she had</a>
<a id='line_12894'>pity of his complaint, and unavised she wrote another letter to comfort</a>
<a id='line_12895'>him withal.</a>
<a id='line_12896'></a>
<a id='line_12897'>And Sir Tristram was all this while in a turret at the commandment of</a>
<a id='line_12898'>La Beale Isoud, and when she might she came unto Sir Tristram. So on a</a>
<a id='line_12899'>day King Mark played at the chess under a chamber window; and at that</a>
<a id='line_12900'>time Sir Tristram and Sir Kehydius were within the chamber over King</a>
<a id='line_12901'>Mark, and as it mishapped Sir Tristram found the letter that Kehydius</a>
<a id='line_12902'>sent unto La Beale Isoud, also he had found the letter that she wrote</a>
<a id='line_12903'>unto Kehydius, and at that same time La Beale Isoud was in the same</a>
<a id='line_12904'>chamber. Then Sir Tristram came unto La Beale Isoud and said: Madam,</a>
<a id='line_12905'>here is a letter that was sent unto you, and here is the letter that ye</a>
<a id='line_12906'>sent unto him that sent you that letter. Alas, Madam, the good love</a>
<a id='line_12907'>that I have loved you; and many lands and riches have I forsaken for</a>
<a id='line_12908'>your love, and now ye are a traitress to me, the which doth me great</a>
<a id='line_12909'>pain. But as for thee, Sir Kehydius, I brought thee out of Brittany</a>
<a id='line_12910'>into this country, and thy father, King Howel, I won his lands, howbeit</a>
<a id='line_12911'>I wedded thy sister Isoud la Blanche Mains for the goodness she did</a>
<a id='line_12912'>unto me. And yet, as I am true knight, she is a clean maiden for me;</a>
<a id='line_12913'>but wit thou well, Sir Kehydius, for this falsehood and treason thou</a>
<a id='line_12914'>hast done me, I will revenge it upon thee. And therewithal Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_12915'>drew out his sword and said: Sir Kehydius, keep thee, and then La Beale</a>
<a id='line_12916'>Isoud swooned to the earth. And when Sir Kehydius saw Sir Tristram come</a>
<a id='line_12917'>upon him he saw none other boot, but leapt out at a bay-window even</a>
<a id='line_12918'>over the head where sat King Mark playing at the chess. And when the</a>
<a id='line_12919'>king saw one come hurling over his head he said: Fellow, what art thou,</a>
<a id='line_12920'>and what is the cause thou leapest out at that window? My lord the</a>
<a id='line_12921'>king, said Kehydius, it fortuned me that I was asleep in the window</a>
<a id='line_12922'>above your head, and as I slept I slumbered, and so I fell down. And</a>
<a id='line_12923'>thus Sir Kehydius excused him.</a>

<a id='line_12926'></a>
<a id='line_12927'>CHAPTER XVII. How Sir Tristram departed from Tintagil, and how he</a>
<a id='line_12928'>sorrowed and was so long in a forest till he was out of his mind.</a>
<a id='line_12929'></a>
<a id='line_12930'>Then Sir Tristram dread sore lest he were discovered unto the king that</a>
<a id='line_12931'>he was there; wherefore he drew him to the strength of the Tower, and</a>
<a id='line_12932'>armed him in such armour as he had for to fight with them that would</a>
<a id='line_12933'>withstand him. And so when Sir Tristram saw there was no resistance</a>
<a id='line_12934'>against him he sent Gouvernail for his horse and his spear, and</a>
<a id='line_12935'>knightly he rode forth out of the castle openly, that was called the</a>
<a id='line_12936'>Castle of Tintagil. And even at gate he met with Gingalin, Sir</a>
<a id='line_12937'>Gawaine’s son. And anon Sir Gingalin put his spear in his rest, and ran</a>
<a id='line_12938'>upon Sir Tristram and brake his spear; and Sir Tristram at that time</a>
<a id='line_12939'>had but a sword, and gave him such a buffet upon the helm that he fell</a>
<a id='line_12940'>down from his saddle, and his sword slid adown, and carved asunder his</a>
<a id='line_12941'>horse’s neck. And so Sir Tristram rode his way into the forest, and all</a>
<a id='line_12942'>this doing saw King Mark. And then he sent a squire unto the hurt</a>
<a id='line_12943'>knight, and commanded him to come to him, and so he did. And when King</a>
<a id='line_12944'>Mark wist that it was Sir Gingalin he welcomed him and gave him an</a>
<a id='line_12945'>horse, and asked him what knight it was that had encountered with him.</a>
<a id='line_12946'>Sir, said Gingalin, I wot not what knight he was, but well I wot that</a>
<a id='line_12947'>he sigheth and maketh great dole.</a>
<a id='line_12948'></a>
<a id='line_12949'>Then Sir Tristram within a while met with a knight of his own, that</a>
<a id='line_12950'>hight Sir Fergus. And when he had met with him he made great sorrow,</a>
<a id='line_12951'>insomuch that he fell down off his horse in a swoon, and in such sorrow</a>
<a id='line_12952'>he was in three days and three nights. Then at the last Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_12953'>sent unto the court by Sir Fergus, for to spere what tidings. And so as</a>
<a id='line_12954'>he rode by the way he met with a damosel that came from Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_12955'>to know and seek how Sir Tristram did. Then Sir Fergus told her how he</a>
<a id='line_12956'>was almost out of his mind. Alas, said the damosel, where shall I find</a>
<a id='line_12957'>him? In such a place, said Sir Fergus. Then Sir Fergus found Queen</a>
<a id='line_12958'>Isoud sick in her bed, making the greatest dole that ever any earthly</a>
<a id='line_12959'>woman made. And when the damosel found Sir Tristram she made great dole</a>
<a id='line_12960'>because she might not amend him, for the more she made of him the more</a>
<a id='line_12961'>was his pain. And at the last Sir Tristram took his horse and rode away</a>
<a id='line_12962'>from her. And then was it three days or that she could find him, and</a>
<a id='line_12963'>then she brought him meat and drink, but he would none; and then</a>
<a id='line_12964'>another time Sir Tristram escaped away from the damosel, and it happed</a>
<a id='line_12965'>him to ride by the same castle where Sir Palomides and Sir Tristram did</a>
<a id='line_12966'>battle when La Beale Isoud departed them. And there by fortune the</a>
<a id='line_12967'>damosel met with Sir Tristram again, making the greatest dole that ever</a>
<a id='line_12968'>earthly creature made; and she yede to the lady of that castle and told</a>
<a id='line_12969'>her of the misadventure of Sir Tristram. Alas, said the lady of that</a>
<a id='line_12970'>castle, where is my lord, Sir Tristram? Right here by your castle, said</a>
<a id='line_12971'>the damosel. In good time, said the lady, is he so nigh me; he shall</a>
<a id='line_12972'>have meat and drink of the best; and an harp I have of his whereupon he</a>
<a id='line_12973'>taught me, for of goodly harping he beareth the prize in the world. So</a>
<a id='line_12974'>this lady and damosel brought him meat and drink, but he ate little</a>
<a id='line_12975'>thereof. Then upon a night he put his horse from him, and then he</a>
<a id='line_12976'>unlaced his armour, and then Sir Tristram would go into the wilderness,</a>
<a id='line_12977'>and brast down the trees and boughs; and otherwhile when he found the</a>
<a id='line_12978'>harp that the lady sent him, then would he harp, and play thereupon and</a>
<a id='line_12979'>weep together. And sometime when Sir Tristram was in the wood that the</a>
<a id='line_12980'>lady wist not where he was, then would she sit her down and play upon</a>
<a id='line_12981'>that harp: then would Sir Tristram come to that harp, and hearken</a>
<a id='line_12982'>thereto, and sometime he would harp himself. Thus he there endured a</a>
<a id='line_12983'>quarter of a year. Then at the last he ran his way, and she wist not</a>
<a id='line_12984'>where he was become. And then was he naked and waxed lean and poor of</a>
<a id='line_12985'>flesh; and so he fell in the fellowship of herdmen and shepherds, and</a>
<a id='line_12986'>daily they would give him some of their meat and drink. And when he did</a>
<a id='line_12987'>any shrewd deed they would beat him with rods, and so they clipped him</a>
<a id='line_12988'>with shears and made him like a fool.</a>

<a id='line_12990'></a>
<a id='line_12991'></a>
<a id='line_12992'>CHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Tristram soused Dagonet in a well, and how</a>
<a id='line_12993'>Palomides sent a damosel to seek Tristram, and how Palomides met with</a>
<a id='line_12994'>King Mark.</a>
<a id='line_12995'></a>
<a id='line_12996'>And upon a day Dagonet, King Arthur’s fool, came into Cornwall with two</a>
<a id='line_12997'>squires with him; and as they rode through that forest they came by a</a>
<a id='line_12998'>fair well where Sir Tristram was wont to be; and the weather was hot,</a>
<a id='line_12999'>and they alighted to drink of that well, and in the meanwhile their</a>
<a id='line_13000'>horses brake loose. Right so Sir Tristram came unto them, and first he</a>
<a id='line_13001'>soused Sir Dagonet in that well, and after his squires, and thereat</a>
<a id='line_13002'>laughed the shepherds; and forthwithal he ran after their horses and</a>
<a id='line_13003'>brought them again one by one, and right so, wet as they were, he made</a>
<a id='line_13004'>them leap up and ride their ways. Thus Sir Tristram endured there an</a>
<a id='line_13005'>half year naked, and would never come in town nor village. The</a>
<a id='line_13006'>meanwhile the damosel that Sir Palomides sent to seek Sir Tristram, she</a>
<a id='line_13007'>yede unto Sir Palomides and told him all the mischief that Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13008'>endured. Alas, said Sir Palomides, it is great pity that ever so noble</a>
<a id='line_13009'>a knight should be so mischieved for the love of a lady; but</a>
<a id='line_13010'>nevertheless, I will go and seek him, and comfort him an I may. Then a</a>
<a id='line_13011'>little before that time La Beale Isoud had commanded Sir Kehydius out</a>
<a id='line_13012'>of the country of Cornwall. So Sir Kehydius departed with a dolorous</a>
<a id='line_13013'>heart, and by adventure he met with Sir Palomides, and they</a>
<a id='line_13014'>enfellowshipped together; and either complained to other of their hot</a>
<a id='line_13015'>love that they loved La Beale Isoud. Now let us, said Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_13016'>seek Sir Tristram, that loved her as well as we, and let us prove</a>
<a id='line_13017'>whether we may recover him. So they rode into that forest, and three</a>
<a id='line_13018'>days and three nights they would never take their lodging, but ever</a>
<a id='line_13019'>sought Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_13020'></a>
<a id='line_13021'>And upon a time, by adventure, they met with King Mark that was ridden</a>
<a id='line_13022'>from his men all alone. When they saw him Sir Palomides knew him, but</a>
<a id='line_13023'>Sir Kehydius knew him not. Ah, false king, said Sir Palomides, it is</a>
<a id='line_13024'>pity thou hast thy life, for thou art a destroyer of all worshipful</a>
<a id='line_13025'>knights, and by thy mischief and thy vengeance thou hast destroyed that</a>
<a id='line_13026'>most noble knight, Sir Tristram de Liones. And therefore defend thee,</a>
<a id='line_13027'>said Sir Palomides, for thou shalt die this day. That were shame, said</a>
<a id='line_13028'>King Mark, for ye two are armed and I am unarmed. As for that, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13029'>Palomides, I shall find a remedy therefore; here is a knight with me,</a>
<a id='line_13030'>and thou shalt have his harness. Nay, said King Mark, I will not have</a>
<a id='line_13031'>ado with you, for cause have ye none to me; for all the misease that</a>
<a id='line_13032'>Sir Tristram hath was for a letter that he found; for as to me I did to</a>
<a id='line_13033'>him no displeasure, and God knoweth I am full sorry for his disease and</a>
<a id='line_13034'>malady. So when the king had thus excused him they were friends, and</a>
<a id='line_13035'>King Mark would have had them unto Tintagil; but Sir Palomides would</a>
<a id='line_13036'>not, but turned unto the realm of Logris, and Sir Kehydius said that he</a>
<a id='line_13037'>would go into Brittany.</a>
<a id='line_13038'></a>
<a id='line_13039'>Now turn we unto Sir Dagonet again, that when he and his squires were</a>
<a id='line_13040'>upon horseback he deemed that the shepherds had sent that fool to array</a>
<a id='line_13041'>them so, because that they laughed at them, and so they rode unto the</a>
<a id='line_13042'>keepers of beasts and all to-beat them. Sir Tristram saw them beat that</a>
<a id='line_13043'>were wont to give him meat and drink, then he ran thither and gat Sir</a>
<a id='line_13044'>Dagonet by the head, and gave him such a fall to the earth that he</a>
<a id='line_13045'>bruised him sore so that he lay still. And then he wrast his sword out</a>
<a id='line_13046'>of his hand, and therewith he ran to one of his squires and smote off</a>
<a id='line_13047'>his head, and the other fled. And so Sir Tristram took his way with</a>
<a id='line_13048'>that sword in his hand, running as he had been wild wood. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13049'>Dagonet rode to King Mark and told him how he had sped in that forest.</a>
<a id='line_13050'>And therefore, said Sir Dagonet, beware, King Mark, that thou come not</a>
<a id='line_13051'>about that well in the forest, for there is a fool naked, and that fool</a>
<a id='line_13052'>and I fool met together, and he had almost slain me. Ah, said King</a>
<a id='line_13053'>Mark, that is Sir Matto le Breune, that fell out of his wit because he</a>
<a id='line_13054'>lost his lady; for when Sir Gaheris smote down Sir Matto and won his</a>
<a id='line_13055'>lady of him, never since was he in his mind, and that was pity, for he</a>
<a id='line_13056'>was a good knight.</a>
<a id='line_13057'></a>
<a id='line_13058'></a>
<a id='line_13059'></a>
<a id='line_13060'>CHAPTER XIX. How it was noised how Sir Tristram was dead, and how La</a>
<a id='line_13061'>Beale Isoud would have slain herself.</a>
<a id='line_13062'></a>
<a id='line_13063'>Then Sir Andred, that was cousin unto Sir Tristram, made a lady that</a>
<a id='line_13064'>was his paramour to say and to noise it that she was with Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13065'>or ever he died. And this tale she brought unto King Mark’s court, that</a>
<a id='line_13066'>she buried him by a well, and that or he died he besought King Mark to</a>
<a id='line_13067'>make his cousin, Sir Andred, king of the country of Liones, of the</a>
<a id='line_13068'>which Sir Tristram was lord of. All this did Sir Andred because he</a>
<a id='line_13069'>would have had Sir Tristram’s lands. And when King Mark heard tell that</a>
<a id='line_13070'>Sir Tristram was dead he wept and made great dole. But when Queen Isoud</a>
<a id='line_13071'>heard of these tidings she made such sorrow that she was nigh out of</a>
<a id='line_13072'>her mind; and so upon a day she thought to slay herself and never to</a>
<a id='line_13073'>live after Sir Tristram’s death. And so upon a day La Beale Isoud gat a</a>
<a id='line_13074'>sword privily and bare it to her garden, and there she pight the sword</a>
<a id='line_13075'>through a plum tree up to the hilt, so that it stuck fast, and it stood</a>
<a id='line_13076'>breast high. And as she would have run upon the sword and to have slain</a>
<a id='line_13077'>herself all this espied King Mark, how she kneeled down and said: Sweet</a>
<a id='line_13078'>Lord Jesu, have mercy upon me, for I may not live after the death of</a>
<a id='line_13079'>Sir Tristram de Liones, for he was my first love and he shall be the</a>
<a id='line_13080'>last. And with these words came King Mark and took her in his arms, and</a>
<a id='line_13081'>then he took up the sword, and bare her away with him into a tower; and</a>
<a id='line_13082'>there he made her to be kept, and watched her surely, and after that</a>
<a id='line_13083'>she lay long sick, nigh at the point of death.</a>
<a id='line_13084'></a>
<a id='line_13085'>This meanwhile ran Sir Tristram naked in the forest with the sword in</a>
<a id='line_13086'>his hand, and so he came to an hermitage, and there he laid him down</a>
<a id='line_13087'>and slept; and in the meanwhile the hermit stole away his sword, and</a>
<a id='line_13088'>laid meat down by him. Thus was he kept there ten days; and at the last</a>
<a id='line_13089'>he departed and came to the herdmen again. And there was a giant in</a>
<a id='line_13090'>that country that hight Tauleas, and for fear of Sir Tristram more than</a>
<a id='line_13091'>seven year he durst never much go at large, but for the most part he</a>
<a id='line_13092'>kept him in a sure castle of his own; and so this Tauleas heard tell</a>
<a id='line_13093'>that Sir Tristram was dead, by the noise of the court of King Mark.</a>
<a id='line_13094'>Then this Tauleas went daily at large. And so he happed upon a day he</a>
<a id='line_13095'>came to the herdmen wandering and langering, and there he set him down</a>
<a id='line_13096'>to rest among them. The meanwhile there came a knight of Cornwall that</a>
<a id='line_13097'>led a lady with him, and his name was Sir Dinant; and when the giant</a>
<a id='line_13098'>saw him he went from the herdmen and hid him under a tree, and so the</a>
<a id='line_13099'>knight came to that well, and there he alighted to repose him. And as</a>
<a id='line_13100'>soon as he was from his horse this giant Tauleas came betwixt this</a>
<a id='line_13101'>knight and his horse, and took the horse and leapt upon him. So</a>
<a id='line_13102'>forthwith he rode unto Sir Dinant and took him by the collar, and</a>
<a id='line_13103'>pulled him afore him upon his horse, and there would have stricken off</a>
<a id='line_13104'>his head. Then the herdmen said unto Sir Tristram: Help yonder knight.</a>
<a id='line_13105'>Help ye him, said Sir Tristram. We dare not, said the herdmen. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13106'>Tristram was ware of the sword of the knight thereas it lay; and so</a>
<a id='line_13107'>thither he ran and took up the sword and struck off Sir Tauleas’ head,</a>
<a id='line_13108'>and so he yede his way to the herdmen.</a>

<a id='line_13112'>CHAPTER XX. How King Mark found Sir Tristram naked, and made him to be</a>
<a id='line_13113'>borne home to Tintagil, and how he was there known by a brachet.</a>
<a id='line_13114'></a>
<a id='line_13115'>Then the knight took up the giant’s head and bare it with him unto King</a>
<a id='line_13116'>Mark, and told him what adventure betid him in the forest, and how a</a>
<a id='line_13117'>naked man rescued him from the grimly giant, Tauleas. Where had ye this</a>
<a id='line_13118'>adventure? said King Mark. Forsooth, said Sir Dinant, at the fair</a>
<a id='line_13119'>fountain in your forest where many adventurous knights meet, and there</a>
<a id='line_13120'>is the mad man. Well, said King Mark, I will see that wild man. So</a>
<a id='line_13121'>within a day or two King Mark commanded his knights and his hunters</a>
<a id='line_13122'>that they should be ready on the morn for to hunt, and so upon the morn</a>
<a id='line_13123'>he went unto that forest. And when the king came to that well he found</a>
<a id='line_13124'>there lying by that well a fair naked man, and a sword by him. Then</a>
<a id='line_13125'>King Mark blew and straked, and therewith his knights came to him; and</a>
<a id='line_13126'>then the king commanded his knights to: Take that naked man with</a>
<a id='line_13127'>fairness, and bring him to my castle. So they did softly and fair, and</a>
<a id='line_13128'>cast mantles upon Sir Tristram, and so led him unto Tintagil; and there</a>
<a id='line_13129'>they bathed him, and washed him, and gave him hot suppings till they</a>
<a id='line_13130'>had brought him well to his remembrance; but all this while there was</a>
<a id='line_13131'>no creature that knew Sir Tristram, nor what man he was.</a>
<a id='line_13132'></a>
<a id='line_13133'>So it fell upon a day that the queen, La Beale Isoud, heard of such a</a>
<a id='line_13134'>man, that ran naked in the forest, and how the king had brought him</a>
<a id='line_13135'>home to the court. Then La Beale Isoud called unto her Dame Bragwaine</a>
<a id='line_13136'>and said: Come on with me, for we will go see this man that my lord</a>
<a id='line_13137'>brought from the forest the last day. So they passed forth, and spered</a>
<a id='line_13138'>where was the sick man. And then a squire told the queen that he was in</a>
<a id='line_13139'>the garden taking his rest, and reposing him against the sun. So when</a>
<a id='line_13140'>the queen looked upon Sir Tristram she was not remembered of him. But</a>
<a id='line_13141'>ever she said unto Dame Bragwaine: Meseemeth I should have seen him</a>
<a id='line_13142'>heretofore in many places. But as soon as Sir Tristram saw her he knew</a>
<a id='line_13143'>her well enough. And then he turned away his visage and wept.</a>
<a id='line_13144'></a>
<a id='line_13145'>Then the queen had always a little brachet with her that Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13146'>gave her the first time that ever she came into Cornwall, and never</a>
<a id='line_13147'>would that brachet depart from her but if Sir Tristram was nigh thereas</a>
<a id='line_13148'>was La Beale Isoud; and this brachet was sent from the king’s daughter</a>
<a id='line_13149'>of France unto Sir Tristram for great love. And anon as this little</a>
<a id='line_13150'>brachet felt a savour of Sir Tristram, she leapt upon him and licked</a>
<a id='line_13151'>his lears and his ears, and then she whined and quested, and she</a>
<a id='line_13152'>smelled at his feet and at his hands, and on all parts of his body that</a>
<a id='line_13153'>she might come to. Ah, my lady, said Dame Bragwaine unto La Beale</a>
<a id='line_13154'>Isoud, alas, alas, said she, I see it is mine own lord, Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_13155'>And thereupon Isoud fell down in a swoon, and so lay a great while. And</a>
<a id='line_13156'>when she might speak she said: My lord Sir Tristram, blessed be God ye</a>
<a id='line_13157'>have your life, and now I am sure ye shall be discovered by this little</a>
<a id='line_13158'>brachet, for she will never leave you. And also I am sure as soon as my</a>
<a id='line_13159'>lord, King Mark, do know you he will banish you out of the country of</a>
<a id='line_13160'>Cornwall, or else he will destroy you; for God’s sake, mine own lord,</a>
<a id='line_13161'>grant King Mark his will, and then draw you unto the court of King</a>
<a id='line_13162'>Arthur, for there are ye beloved, and ever when I may I shall send unto</a>
<a id='line_13163'>you; and when ye list ye may come to me, and at all times early and</a>
<a id='line_13164'>late I will be at your commandment, to live as poor a life as ever did</a>
<a id='line_13165'>queen or lady. O Madam, said Sir Tristram, go from me, for mickle anger</a>
<a id='line_13166'>and danger have I escaped for your love.</a>

<a id='line_13170'>CHAPTER XXI. How King Mark, by the advice of his council, banished Sir</a>
<a id='line_13171'>Tristram out of Cornwall the term of ten years.</a>
<a id='line_13172'></a>
<a id='line_13173'>Then the queen departed, but the brachet would not from him; and</a>
<a id='line_13174'>therewithal came King Mark, and the brachet set upon him, and bayed at</a>
<a id='line_13175'>them all. There withal Sir Andred spake and said: Sir, this is Sir</a>
<a id='line_13176'>Tristram, I see by the brachet. Nay, said the king, I cannot suppose</a>
<a id='line_13177'>that. Then the king asked him upon his faith what he was, and what was</a>
<a id='line_13178'>his name. So God me help, said he, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones;</a>
<a id='line_13179'>now do by me what ye list. Ah, said King Mark, me repenteth of your</a>
<a id='line_13180'>recovery. And then he let call his barons to judge Sir Tristram to the</a>
<a id='line_13181'>death. Then many of his barons would not assent thereto, and in</a>
<a id='line_13182'>especial Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, and Sir Fergus. And so by the advice</a>
<a id='line_13183'>of them all Sir Tristram was banished out of the country for ten year,</a>
<a id='line_13184'>and thereupon he took his oath upon a book before the king and his</a>
<a id='line_13185'>barons. And so he was made to depart out of the country of Cornwall;</a>
<a id='line_13186'>and there were many barons brought him unto his ship, of the which some</a>
<a id='line_13187'>were his friends and some his foes. And in the meanwhile there came a</a>
<a id='line_13188'>knight of King Arthur’s, his name was Dinadan, and his coming was for</a>
<a id='line_13189'>to seek after Sir Tristram; then they showed him where he was armed at</a>
<a id='line_13190'>all points going to the ship. Now fair knight, said Sir Dinadan, or ye</a>
<a id='line_13191'>pass this court that ye will joust with me I require thee. With a good</a>
<a id='line_13192'>will, said Sir Tristram, an these lords will give me leave. Then the</a>
<a id='line_13193'>barons granted thereto, and so they ran together, and there Sir</a>
<a id='line_13194'>Tristram gave Sir Dinadan a fall. And then he prayed Sir Tristram to</a>
<a id='line_13195'>give him leave to go in his fellowship. Ye shall be right welcome, said</a>
<a id='line_13196'>then Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_13197'></a>
<a id='line_13198'>And so they took their horses and rode to their ships together, and</a>
<a id='line_13199'>when Sir Tristram was in the sea he said: Greet well King Mark and all</a>
<a id='line_13200'>mine enemies, and say them I will come again when I may; and well am I</a>
<a id='line_13201'>rewarded for the fighting with Sir Marhaus, and delivered all this</a>
<a id='line_13202'>country from servage; and well am I rewarded for the fetching and costs</a>
<a id='line_13203'>of Queen Isoud out of Ireland, and the danger that I was in first and</a>
<a id='line_13204'>last, and by the way coming home what danger I had to bring again Queen</a>
<a id='line_13205'>Isoud from the Castle Pluere; and well am I rewarded when I fought with</a>
<a id='line_13206'>Sir Bleoberis for Sir Segwarides’ wife; and well am I rewarded when I</a>
<a id='line_13207'>fought with Sir Blamore de Ganis for King Anguish, father unto La Beale</a>

<a id='line_13209'>Lamorak de Galis, at King Mark’s request; and well am I rewarded when I</a>
<a id='line_13210'>fought with the King with the Hundred Knights, and the King of</a>
<a id='line_13211'>Northgalis, and both these would have put his land in servage, and by</a>
<a id='line_13212'>me they were put to a rebuke; and well am I rewarded for the slaying of</a>
<a id='line_13213'>Tauleas, the mighty giant, and many other deeds have I done for him,</a>
<a id='line_13214'>and now have I my warison. And tell King Mark that many noble knights</a>

<a id='line_13216'>Also am I not well rewarded when I fought with the good knight Sir</a>

<a id='line_13236'>trappings embroidered with crowns. And then Sir Tristram and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13237'>Dinadan departed from them into a forest, and there met them a damosel</a>
<a id='line_13238'>that came for the love of Sir Launcelot to seek after some noble</a>
<a id='line_13239'>knights of King Arthur’s court for to rescue Sir Launcelot. And so Sir</a>
<a id='line_13240'>Launcelot was ordained, for-by the treason of Queen Morgan le Fay to</a>
<a id='line_13241'>have slain Sir Launcelot, and for that cause she ordained thirty</a>
<a id='line_13242'>knights to lie in await for Sir Launcelot, and this damosel knew this</a>
<a id='line_13243'>treason. And for this cause the damosel came for to seek noble knights</a>
<a id='line_13244'>to help Sir Launcelot. For that night, or the day after, Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_13245'>should come where these thirty knights were. And so this damosel met</a>
<a id='line_13246'>with Sir Bors and Sir Ector and with Sir Driant, and there she told</a>
<a id='line_13247'>them all four of the treason of Morgan le Fay; and then they promised</a>
<a id='line_13248'>her that they would be nigh where Sir Launcelot should meet with the</a>
<a id='line_13249'>thirty knights. And if so be they set upon him we will do rescues as we</a>
<a id='line_13250'>can.</a>
<a id='line_13251'></a>
<a id='line_13252'>So the damosel departed, and by adventure the damosel met with Sir</a>
<a id='line_13253'>Tristram and with Sir Dinadan, and there the damosel told them all the</a>
<a id='line_13254'>treason that was ordained for Sir Launcelot. Fair damosel, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13255'>Tristram, bring me to that same place where they should meet with Sir</a>
<a id='line_13256'>Launcelot. Then said Sir Dinadan: What will ye do? it is not for us to</a>
<a id='line_13257'>fight with thirty knights, and wit you well I will not thereof; as to</a>
<a id='line_13258'>match one knight two or three is enough an they be men, but for to</a>
<a id='line_13259'>match fifteen knights that will I never undertake. Fie for shame, said</a>
<a id='line_13260'>Sir Tristram, do but your part. Nay, said Sir Dinadan, I will not</a>
<a id='line_13261'>thereof but if ye will lend me your shield, for ye bear a shield of</a>
<a id='line_13262'>Cornwall; and for the cowardice that is named to the knights of</a>
<a id='line_13263'>Cornwall, by your shields ye be ever forborne. Nay, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_13264'>I will not depart from my shield for her sake that gave it me. But one</a>
<a id='line_13265'>thing, said Sir Tristram, I promise thee, Sir Dinadan, but if thou wilt</a>
<a id='line_13266'>promise me to abide with me, here I shall slay thee, for I desire no</a>
<a id='line_13267'>more of thee but answer one knight. And if thy heart will not serve</a>
<a id='line_13268'>thee, stand by and look upon me and them. Sir, said Sir Dinadan, I</a>
<a id='line_13269'>promise you to look upon and to do what I may to save myself, but I</a>
<a id='line_13270'>would I had not met with you.</a>
<a id='line_13271'></a>
<a id='line_13272'>So then anon these thirty knights came fast by these four knights, and</a>
<a id='line_13273'>they were ware of them, and either of other. And so these thirty</a>
<a id='line_13274'>knights let them pass, for this cause, that they would not wrath them,</a>
<a id='line_13275'>if case be that they had ado with Sir Launcelot; and the four knights</a>
<a id='line_13276'>let them pass to this intent, that they would see and behold what they</a>
<a id='line_13277'>would do with Sir Launcelot. And so the thirty knights passed on and</a>
<a id='line_13278'>came by Sir Tristram and by Sir Dinadan, and then Sir Tristram cried on</a>
<a id='line_13279'>high: Lo, here is a knight against you for the love of Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_13280'>And there he slew two with one spear and ten with his sword. And then</a>
<a id='line_13281'>came in Sir Dinadan and he did passing well, and so of the thirty</a>
<a id='line_13282'>knights there went but ten away, and they fled. All this battle saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_13283'>Bors de Ganis and his three fellows, and then they saw well it was the</a>
<a id='line_13284'>same knight that jousted with them at the bridge; then they took their</a>
<a id='line_13285'>horses and rode unto Sir Tristram, and praised him and thanked him of</a>
<a id='line_13286'>his good deeds, and they all desired Sir Tristram to go with them to</a>
<a id='line_13287'>their lodging; and he said: Nay, he would not go to no lodging. Then</a>
<a id='line_13288'>they all four knights prayed him to tell them his name. Fair lords,</a>
<a id='line_13289'>said Sir Tristram, as at this time I will not tell you my name.</a>
<a id='line_13290'></a>
<a id='line_13291'></a>
<a id='line_13292'></a>
<a id='line_13293'>CHAPTER XXIII. How Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan came to a lodging where</a>
<a id='line_13294'>they must joust with two knights.</a>
<a id='line_13295'></a>
<a id='line_13296'>Then Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan rode forth their way till they came</a>
<a id='line_13297'>to the shepherds and to the herdmen, and there they asked them if they</a>
<a id='line_13298'>knew any lodging or harbour there nigh hand. Forsooth, sirs, said the</a>
<a id='line_13299'>herdmen, hereby is good lodging in a castle; but there is such a custom</a>
<a id='line_13300'>that there shall no knight be harboured but if he joust with two</a>
<a id='line_13301'>knights, and if he be but one knight he must joust with two. And as ye</a>
<a id='line_13302'>be therein soon shall ye be matched. There is shrewd harbour, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13303'>Dinadan; lodge where ye will, for I will not lodge there. Fie for</a>
<a id='line_13304'>shame, said Sir Tristram, are ye not a knight of the Table Round?</a>
<a id='line_13305'>wherefore ye may not with your worship refuse your lodging. Not so,</a>
<a id='line_13306'>said the herdmen, for an ye be beaten and have the worse ye shall not</a>
<a id='line_13307'>be lodged there, and if ye beat them ye shall be well harboured. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_13308'>said Sir Dinadan, they are two sure knights. Then Sir Dinadan would not</a>
<a id='line_13309'>lodge there in no manner but as Sir Tristram required him of his</a>
<a id='line_13310'>knighthood; and so they rode thither. And to make short tale, Sir</a>
<a id='line_13311'>Tristram and Sir Dinadan smote them down both, and so they entered into</a>
<a id='line_13312'>the castle and had good cheer as they could think or devise.</a>
<a id='line_13313'></a>
<a id='line_13314'>And when they were unarmed, and thought to be merry and in good rest,</a>
<a id='line_13315'>there came in at the gates Sir Palomides and Sir Gaheris, requiring to</a>
<a id='line_13316'>have the custom of the castle. What array is this? said Sir Dinadan, I</a>
<a id='line_13317'>would have my rest. That may not be, said Sir Tristram; now must we</a>
<a id='line_13318'>needs defend the custom of this castle, insomuch as we have the better</a>
<a id='line_13319'>of the lords of this castle, and therefore, said Sir Tristram, needs</a>
<a id='line_13320'>must ye make you ready. In the devil’s name, said Sir Dinadan, came I</a>
<a id='line_13321'>into your company. And so they made them ready; and Sir Gaheris</a>
<a id='line_13322'>encountered with Sir Tristram, and Sir Gaheris had a fall; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13323'>Palomides encountered with Sir Dinadan, and Sir Dinadan had a fall:</a>
<a id='line_13324'>then was it fall for fall. So then must they fight on foot. That would</a>
<a id='line_13325'>not Sir Dinadan, for he was so sore bruised of the fall that Sir</a>
<a id='line_13326'>Palomides gave him. Then Sir Tristram unlaced Sir Dinadan’s helm, and</a>
<a id='line_13327'>prayed him to help him. I will not, said Sir Dinadan, for I am sore</a>
<a id='line_13328'>wounded of the thirty knights that we had but late ago to do withal.</a>
<a id='line_13329'>But ye fare, said Sir Dinadan unto Sir Tristram, as a madman and as a</a>
<a id='line_13330'>man that is out of his mind that would cast himself away, and I may</a>
<a id='line_13331'>curse the time that ever I saw you, for in all the world are not two</a>
<a id='line_13332'>such knights that be so wood as is Sir Launcelot and ye Sir Tristram;</a>
<a id='line_13333'>for once I fell in the fellowship of Sir Launcelot as I have done now</a>
<a id='line_13334'>with you, and he set me a work that a quarter of a year I kept my bed.</a>
<a id='line_13335'>Jesu defend me, said Sir Dinadan, from such two knights, and specially</a>
<a id='line_13336'>from your fellowship. Then, said Sir Tristram, I will fight with them</a>
<a id='line_13337'>both. Then Sir Tristram bade them come forth both, for I will fight</a>
<a id='line_13338'>with you. Then Sir Palomides and Sir Gaheris dressed them, and smote at</a>
<a id='line_13339'>them both. Then Dinadan smote at Sir Gaheris a stroke or two, and</a>
<a id='line_13340'>turned from him. Nay, said Sir Palomides, it is too much shame for us</a>
<a id='line_13341'>two knights to fight with one. And then he did bid Sir Gaheris stand</a>
<a id='line_13342'>aside with that knight that hath no list to fight. Then they rode</a>
<a id='line_13343'>together and fought long, and at the last Sir Tristram doubled his</a>
<a id='line_13344'>strokes, and drove Sir Palomides aback more than three strides. And</a>
<a id='line_13345'>then by one assent Sir Gaheris and Sir Dinadan went betwixt them, and</a>
<a id='line_13346'>departed them in-sunder. And then by assent of Sir Tristram they would</a>
<a id='line_13347'>have lodged together. But Sir Dinadan would not lodge in that castle.</a>
<a id='line_13348'>And then he cursed the time that ever he came in their fellowship, and</a>
<a id='line_13349'>so he took his horse, and his harness, and departed.</a>
<a id='line_13350'></a>
<a id='line_13351'>Then Sir Tristram prayed the lords of that castle to lend him a man to</a>
<a id='line_13352'>bring him to a lodging, and so they did, and overtook Sir Dinadan, and</a>
<a id='line_13353'>rode to their lodging two mile thence with a good man in a priory, and</a>
<a id='line_13354'>there they were well at ease. And that same night Sir Bors and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13355'>Bleoberis, and Sir Ector and Sir Driant, abode still in the same place</a>
<a id='line_13356'>thereas Sir Tristram fought with the thirty knights; and there they met</a>
<a id='line_13357'>with Sir Launcelot the same night, and had made promise to lodge with</a>
<a id='line_13358'>Sir Colgrevance the same night.</a>
<a id='line_13359'></a>
<a id='line_13360'></a>
<a id='line_13361'></a>
<a id='line_13362'>CHAPTER XXIV. How Sir Tristram jousted with Sir Kay and Sir Sagramore</a>
<a id='line_13363'>le Desirous, and how Sir Gawaine turned Sir Tristram from Morgan le</a>
<a id='line_13364'>Fay.</a>
<a id='line_13365'></a>
<a id='line_13366'>But anon as the noble knight, Sir Launcelot, heard of the shield of</a>
<a id='line_13367'>Cornwall, then wist he well that it was Sir Tristram that fought with</a>
<a id='line_13368'>his enemies. And then Sir Launcelot praised Sir Tristram, and called</a>
<a id='line_13369'>him the man of most worship in the world. So there was a knight in that</a>
<a id='line_13370'>priory that hight Pellinore, and he desired to wit the name of Sir</a>
<a id='line_13371'>Tristram, but in no wise he could not; and so Sir Tristram departed and</a>
<a id='line_13372'>left Sir Dinadan in the priory, for he was so weary and so sore bruised</a>
<a id='line_13373'>that he might not ride. Then this knight, Sir Pellinore, said to Sir</a>
<a id='line_13374'>Dinadan: Sithen that ye will not tell me that knight’s name I will ride</a>
<a id='line_13375'>after him and make him to tell me his name, or he shall die therefore.</a>
<a id='line_13376'>Beware, sir knight, said Sir Dinadan, for an ye follow him ye shall</a>
<a id='line_13377'>repent it. So that knight, Sir Pellinore, rode after Sir Tristram and</a>
<a id='line_13378'>required him of jousts. Then Sir Tristram smote him down and wounded</a>
<a id='line_13379'>him through the shoulder, and so he passed on his way. And on the next</a>
<a id='line_13380'>day following Sir Tristram met with pursuivants, and they told him that</a>
<a id='line_13381'>there was made a great cry of tournament between King Carados of</a>
<a id='line_13382'>Scotland and the King of North Wales, and either should joust against</a>
<a id='line_13383'>other at the Castle of Maidens; and these pursuivants sought all the</a>
<a id='line_13384'>country after the good knights, and in especial King Carados let make</a>
<a id='line_13385'>seeking for Sir Launcelot du Lake, and the King of Northgalis let seek</a>
<a id='line_13386'>after Sir Tristram de Liones. And at that time Sir Tristram thought to</a>
<a id='line_13387'>be at that jousts; and so by adventure they met with Sir Kay, the</a>
<a id='line_13388'>Seneschal, and Sir Sagramore le Desirous; and Sir Kay required Sir</a>
<a id='line_13389'>Tristram to joust, and Sir Tristram in a manner refused him, because he</a>
<a id='line_13390'>would not be hurt nor bruised against the great jousts that should be</a>
<a id='line_13391'>before the Castle of Maidens, and therefore thought to repose him and</a>
<a id='line_13392'>to rest him. And alway Sir Kay cried: Sir knight of Cornwall, joust</a>
<a id='line_13393'>with me, or else yield thee to me as recreant. When Sir Tristram heard</a>
<a id='line_13394'>him say so he turned to him, and then Sir Kay refused him and turned</a>
<a id='line_13395'>his back. Then Sir Tristram said: As I find thee I shall take thee.</a>
<a id='line_13396'>Then Sir Kay turned with evil will, and Sir Tristram smote Sir Kay</a>
<a id='line_13397'>down, and so he rode forth.</a>
<a id='line_13398'></a>
<a id='line_13399'>Then Sir Sagramore le Desirous rode after Sir Tristram, and made him to</a>
<a id='line_13400'>joust with him, and there Sir Tristram smote down Sir Sagramore le</a>
<a id='line_13401'>Desirous from his horse, and rode his way; and the same day he met with</a>
<a id='line_13402'>a damosel that told him that he should win great worship of a knight</a>
<a id='line_13403'>adventurous that did much harm in all that country. When Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13404'>heard her say so, he was glad to go with her to win worship. So Sir</a>
<a id='line_13405'>Tristram rode with that damosel a six mile, and then met him Sir</a>
<a id='line_13406'>Gawaine, and therewithal Sir Gawaine knew the damosel, that she was a</a>
<a id='line_13407'>damosel of Queen Morgan le Fay. Then Sir Gawaine understood that she</a>
<a id='line_13408'>led that knight to some mischief. Fair knight, said Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_13409'>whither ride you now with that damosel? Sir, said Sir Tristram, I wot</a>
<a id='line_13410'>not whither I shall ride but as the damosel will lead me. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13411'>Gawaine, ye shall not ride with her, for she and her lady did never</a>
<a id='line_13412'>good, but ill. And then Sir Gawaine pulled out his sword and said:</a>
<a id='line_13413'>Damosel, but if thou tell me anon for what cause thou leadest this</a>
<a id='line_13414'>knight with thee thou shalt die for it right anon: I know all your</a>
<a id='line_13415'>lady’s treason, and yours. Mercy, Sir Gawaine, she said, and if ye will</a>
<a id='line_13416'>save my life I will tell you. Say on, said Sir Gawaine, and thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_13417'>have thy life. Sir, she said, Queen Morgan le Fay, my lady, hath</a>
<a id='line_13418'>ordained a thirty ladies to seek and espy after Sir Launcelot or Sir</a>
<a id='line_13419'>Tristram, and by the trains of these ladies, who that may first meet</a>
<a id='line_13420'>any of these two knights they should turn them unto Morgan le Fay’s</a>
<a id='line_13421'>castle, saying that they should do deeds of worship; and if any of the</a>
<a id='line_13422'>two knights came there, there be thirty knights lying and watching in a</a>
<a id='line_13423'>tower to wait upon Sir Launcelot or upon Sir Tristram. Fie for shame,</a>
<a id='line_13424'>said Sir Gawaine, that ever such false treason should be wrought or</a>
<a id='line_13425'>used in a queen, and a king’s sister, and a king and queen’s daughter.</a>

<a id='line_13429'>CHAPTER XXV. How Sir Tristram and Sir Gawaine rode to have foughten</a>
<a id='line_13430'>with the thirty knights, but they durst not come out.</a>
<a id='line_13431'></a>
<a id='line_13432'>Sir, said Sir Gawaine, will ye stand with me, and we will see the</a>
<a id='line_13433'>malice of these thirty knights. Sir, said Sir Tristram, go ye to them,</a>
<a id='line_13434'>an it please you, and ye shall see I will not fail you, for it is not</a>
<a id='line_13435'>long ago since I and a fellow met with thirty knights of that queen’s</a>
<a id='line_13436'>fellowship; and God speed us so that we may win worship. So then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13437'>Gawaine and Sir Tristram rode toward the castle where Morgan le Fay</a>
<a id='line_13438'>was, and ever Sir Gawaine deemed well that he was Sir Tristram de</a>
<a id='line_13439'>Liones, because he heard that two knights had slain and beaten thirty</a>
<a id='line_13440'>knights. And when they came afore the castle Sir Gawaine spake on high</a>
<a id='line_13441'>and said: Queen Morgan le Fay, send out your knights that ye have laid</a>
<a id='line_13442'>in a watch for Sir Launcelot and for Sir Tristram. Now, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13443'>Gawaine, I know your false treason, and through all places where that I</a>
<a id='line_13444'>ride men shall know of your false treason; and now let see, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13445'>Gawaine, whether ye dare come out of your castle, ye thirty knights.</a>
<a id='line_13446'>Then the queen spake and all the thirty knights at once, and said: Sir</a>
<a id='line_13447'>Gawaine, full well wottest thou what thou dost and sayest; for by God</a>
<a id='line_13448'>we know thee passing well, but all that thou speakest and dost, thou</a>
<a id='line_13449'>sayest it upon pride of that good knight that is there with thee. For</a>
<a id='line_13450'>there be some of us that know full well the hands of that knight over</a>
<a id='line_13451'>all well. And wit thou well, Sir Gawaine, it is more for his sake than</a>
<a id='line_13452'>for thine that we will not come out of this castle. For wit ye well,</a>
<a id='line_13453'>Sir Gawaine, the knight that beareth the arms of Cornwall, we know him</a>
<a id='line_13454'>and what he is.</a>
<a id='line_13455'></a>
<a id='line_13456'>Then Sir Gawaine and Sir Tristram departed and rode on their ways a day</a>
<a id='line_13457'>or two together; and there by adventure, they met with Sir Kay and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13458'>Sagramore le Desirous. And then they were glad of Sir Gawaine, and he</a>
<a id='line_13459'>of them, but they wist not what he was with the shield of Cornwall, but</a>
<a id='line_13460'>by deeming. And thus they rode together a day or two. And then they</a>
<a id='line_13461'>were ware of Sir Breuse Saunce Pité chasing a lady for to have slain</a>
<a id='line_13462'>her, for he had slain her paramour afore. Hold you all still, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13463'>Gawaine, and show none of you forth, and ye shall see me reward yonder</a>
<a id='line_13464'>false knight; for an he espy you he is so well horsed that he will</a>
<a id='line_13465'>escape away. And then Sir Gawaine rode betwixt Sir Breuse and the lady,</a>
<a id='line_13466'>and said: False knight, leave her, and have ado with me. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_13467'>Breuse saw no more but Sir Gawaine he feutred his spear, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13468'>Gawaine against him; and there Sir Breuse overthrew Sir Gawaine, and</a>
<a id='line_13469'>then he rode over him, and overthwart him twenty times to have</a>
<a id='line_13470'>destroyed him; and when Sir Tristram saw him do so villainous a deed,</a>
<a id='line_13471'>he hurled out against him. And when Sir Breuse saw him with the shield</a>
<a id='line_13472'>of Cornwall he knew him well that it was Sir Tristram, and then he</a>
<a id='line_13473'>fled, and Sir Tristram followed after him; and Sir Breuse Saunce Pité</a>
<a id='line_13474'>was so horsed that he went his way quite, and Sir Tristram followed him</a>
<a id='line_13475'>long, for he would fain have been avenged upon him. And so when he had</a>
<a id='line_13476'>long chased him, he saw a fair well, and thither he rode to repose him,</a>
<a id='line_13477'>and tied his horse till a tree.</a>

<a id='line_13484'>And then he pulled off his helm and washed his visage and his hands,</a>
<a id='line_13485'>and so he fell asleep. In the meanwhile came a damosel that had sought</a>

<a id='line_13487'>the well she looked upon him, and had forgotten him as in remembrance</a>

<a id='line_13491'>still till he was awake. So when she saw him wake she saluted him, and</a>
<a id='line_13492'>he her again, for either knew other of old acquaintance; then she told</a>
<a id='line_13493'>him how she had sought him long and broad, and there she told him how</a>
<a id='line_13494'>she had letters from Queen La Beale Isoud. Then anon Sir Tristram read</a>
<a id='line_13495'>them, and wit ye well he was glad, for therein was many a piteous</a>
<a id='line_13496'>complaint. Then Sir Tristram said: Lady Bragwaine, ye shall ride with</a>
<a id='line_13497'>me till that tournament be done at the Castle of Maidens, and then</a>
<a id='line_13498'>shall bear letters and tidings with you. And then Sir Tristram took his</a>
<a id='line_13499'>horse and sought lodging, and there he met with a good ancient knight</a>
<a id='line_13500'>and prayed him to lodge with him. Right so came Gouvernail unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_13501'>Tristram, that was glad of that lady. So this old knight’s name was Sir</a>
<a id='line_13502'>Pellounes, and he told of the great tournament that should be at the</a>
<a id='line_13503'>Castle of Maidens. And there Sir Launcelot and thirty-two knights of</a>
<a id='line_13504'>his blood had ordained shields of Cornwall. And right so there came one</a>
<a id='line_13505'>unto Sir Pellounes, and told him that Sir Persides de Bloise was come</a>
<a id='line_13506'>home; then that knight held up his hands and thanked God of his coming</a>
<a id='line_13507'>home. And there Sir Pellounes told Sir Tristram that in two years he</a>
<a id='line_13508'>had not seen his son, Sir Persides. Sir, said Sir Tristram, I know your</a>
<a id='line_13509'>son well enough for a good knight.</a>
<a id='line_13510'></a>
<a id='line_13511'>So on a time Sir Tristram and Sir Persides came to their lodging both</a>
<a id='line_13512'>at once, and so they unarmed them, and put upon them their clothing.</a>
<a id='line_13513'>And then these two knights each welcomed other. And when Sir Persides</a>
<a id='line_13514'>understood that Sir Tristram was of Cornwall, he said he was once in</a>
<a id='line_13515'>Cornwall: And there I jousted afore King Mark; and so it happed me at</a>
<a id='line_13516'>that time to overthrow ten knights, and then came to me Sir Tristram de</a>
<a id='line_13517'>Liones and overthrew me, and took my lady away from me, and that shall</a>
<a id='line_13518'>I never forget, but I shall remember me an ever I see my time. Ah, said</a>
<a id='line_13519'>Sir Tristram, now I understand that ye hate Sir Tristram. What deem ye,</a>
<a id='line_13520'>ween ye that Sir Tristram is not able to withstand your malice? Yes,</a>
<a id='line_13521'>said Sir Persides, I know well that Sir Tristram is a noble knight and</a>
<a id='line_13522'>a much better knight than I, yet shall I not owe him my good will.</a>
<a id='line_13523'>Right as they stood thus talking at a bay-window of that castle, they</a>
<a id='line_13524'>saw many knights riding to and fro toward the tournament. And then was</a>
<a id='line_13525'>Sir Tristram ware of a likely knight riding upon a great black horse,</a>
<a id='line_13526'>and a black-covered shield. What knight is that, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_13527'>with the black horse and the black shield? he seemeth a good knight. I</a>
<a id='line_13528'>know him well, said Sir Persides, he is one of the best knights of the</a>
<a id='line_13529'>world. Then is it Sir Launcelot, said Tristram. Nay, said Sir Persides,</a>
<a id='line_13530'>it is Sir Palomides, that is yet unchristened.</a>
<a id='line_13531'></a>
<a id='line_13532'></a>
<a id='line_13533'></a>
<a id='line_13534'>CHAPTER XXVII. How Sir Tristram had a fall with Sir Palomides, and how</a>
<a id='line_13535'>Launcelot overthrew two knights.</a>
<a id='line_13536'></a>
<a id='line_13537'>Then they saw much people of the country salute Sir Palomides. And</a>
<a id='line_13538'>within a while after there came a squire of the castle, that told Sir</a>
<a id='line_13539'>Pellounes that was lord of that castle, that a knight with a black</a>
<a id='line_13540'>shield had smitten down thirteen knights. Fair brother, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13541'>Tristram unto Sir Persides, let us cast upon us cloaks, and let us go</a>
<a id='line_13542'>see the play. Not so, said Sir Persides, we will not go like knaves</a>
<a id='line_13543'>thither, but we will ride like men and good knights to withstand our</a>
<a id='line_13544'>enemies. So they armed them, and took their horses and great spears,</a>
<a id='line_13545'>and thither they went thereas many knights assayed themself before the</a>
<a id='line_13546'>tournament. And anon Sir Palomides saw Sir Persides, and then he sent a</a>
<a id='line_13547'>squire unto him and said: Go thou to the yonder knight with the green</a>
<a id='line_13548'>shield and therein a lion of gold, and say him I require him to joust</a>
<a id='line_13549'>with me, and tell him that my name is Sir Palomides. When Sir Persides</a>
<a id='line_13550'>understood that request of Sir Palomides, he made him ready, and there</a>
<a id='line_13551'>anon they met together, but Sir Persides had a fall. Then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13552'>dressed him to be revenged upon Sir Palomides, and that saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_13553'>Palomides that was ready and so was not Sir Tristram, and took him at</a>
<a id='line_13554'>an advantage and smote him over his horse’s tail when he had no spear</a>
<a id='line_13555'>in his rest. Then stert up Sir Tristram and took his horse lightly, and</a>
<a id='line_13556'>was wroth out of measure, and sore ashamed of that fall. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13557'>Tristram sent unto Sir Palomides by Gouvernail, and prayed him to joust</a>
<a id='line_13558'>with him at his request. Nay, said Sir Palomides, as at this time I</a>
<a id='line_13559'>will not joust with that knight, for I know him better than he weeneth.</a>
<a id='line_13560'>And if he be wroth he may right it to-morn at the Castle of Maidens,</a>
<a id='line_13561'>where he may see me and many other knights.</a>
<a id='line_13562'></a>
<a id='line_13563'>With that came Sir Dinadan, and when he saw Sir Tristram wroth he list</a>
<a id='line_13564'>not to jape. Lo, said Sir Dinadan, here may a man prove, be a man never</a>
<a id='line_13565'>so good yet may he have a fall, and he was never so wise but he might</a>
<a id='line_13566'>be overseen, and he rideth well that never fell. So Sir Tristram was</a>
<a id='line_13567'>passing wroth, and said to Sir Persides and to Sir Dinadan: I will</a>
<a id='line_13568'>revenge me. Right so as they stood talking there, there came by Sir</a>
<a id='line_13569'>Tristram a likely knight riding passing soberly and heavily with a</a>
<a id='line_13570'>black shield. What knight is that? said Sir Tristram unto Sir Persides.</a>
<a id='line_13571'>I know him well, said Sir Persides, for his name is Sir Briant of North</a>
<a id='line_13572'>Wales; so he passed on among other knights of North Wales. And there</a>
<a id='line_13573'>came in Sir Launcelot du Lake with a shield of the arms of Cornwall,</a>
<a id='line_13574'>and he sent a squire unto Sir Briant, and required him to joust with</a>
<a id='line_13575'>him. Well, said Sir Briant, sithen I am required to joust I will do</a>
<a id='line_13576'>what I may; and there Sir Launcelot smote down Sir Briant from his</a>
<a id='line_13577'>horse a great fall. And then Sir Tristram marvelled what knight he was</a>
<a id='line_13578'>that bare the shield of Cornwall. Whatsoever he be, said Sir Dinadan, I</a>
<a id='line_13579'>warrant you he is of King Ban’s blood, the which be knights of the most</a>
<a id='line_13580'>noble prowess in the world, for to account so many for so many. Then</a>
<a id='line_13581'>there came two knights of Northgalis, that one hight Hew de la</a>
<a id='line_13582'>Montaine, and the other Sir Madok de la Montaine, and they challenged</a>
<a id='line_13583'>Sir Launcelot foot-hot. Sir Launcelot not refusing them but made him</a>
<a id='line_13584'>ready, with one spear he smote them down both over their horses’</a>
<a id='line_13585'>croups; and so Sir Launcelot rode his way. By the good lord, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13586'>Tristram, he is a good knight that beareth the shield of Cornwall, and</a>
<a id='line_13587'>meseemeth he rideth in the best manner that ever I saw knight ride.</a>
<a id='line_13588'></a>
<a id='line_13589'>Then the King of Northgalis rode unto Sir Palomides and prayed him</a>
<a id='line_13590'>heartily for his sake to joust with that knight that hath done us of</a>
<a id='line_13591'>Northgalis despite. Sir, said Sir Palomides, I am full loath to have</a>
<a id='line_13592'>ado with that knight, and cause why is, for as to-morn the great</a>
<a id='line_13593'>tournament shall be; and therefore I will keep myself fresh by my will.</a>
<a id='line_13594'>Nay, said the King of Northgalis, I pray you require him of jousts.</a>
<a id='line_13595'>Sir, said Sir Palomides, I will joust at your request, and require that</a>
<a id='line_13596'>knight to joust with me, and often I have seen a man have a fall at his</a>
<a id='line_13597'>own request.</a>
<a id='line_13598'></a>
<a id='line_13599'></a>
<a id='line_13600'></a>
<a id='line_13601'>CHAPTER XXVIII. How Sir Launcelot jousted with Palomides and overthrew</a>
<a id='line_13602'>him, and after he was assailed with twelve knights.</a>
<a id='line_13603'></a>
<a id='line_13604'>Then Sir Palomides sent unto Sir Launcelot a squire, and required him</a>
<a id='line_13605'>of jousts. Fair fellow, said Sir Launcelot, tell me thy lord’s name.</a>
<a id='line_13606'>Sir, said the squire, my lord’s name is Sir Palomides, the good knight.</a>
<a id='line_13607'>In good hour, said Sir Launcelot, for there is no knight that I saw</a>
<a id='line_13608'>this seven years that I had liefer ado withal than with him. And so</a>
<a id='line_13609'>either knights made them ready with two great spears. Nay, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13610'>Dinadan, ye shall see that Sir Palomides will quit him right well. It</a>
<a id='line_13611'>may be so, said Sir Tristram, but I undertake that knight with the</a>
<a id='line_13612'>shield of Cornwall shall give him a fall. I believe it not, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13613'>Dinadan. Right so they spurred their horses and feutred their spears,</a>
<a id='line_13614'>and either hit other, and Sir Palomides brake a spear upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_13615'>Launcelot, and he sat and moved not; but Sir Launcelot smote him so</a>
<a id='line_13616'>lightly that he made his horse to avoid the saddle, and the stroke</a>
<a id='line_13617'>brake his shield and the hauberk, and had he not fallen he had been</a>
<a id='line_13618'>slain. How now, said Sir Tristram, I wist well by the manner of their</a>
<a id='line_13619'>riding both that Sir Palomides should have a fall.</a>
<a id='line_13620'></a>
<a id='line_13621'>Right so Sir Launcelot rode his way, and rode to a well to drink and to</a>
<a id='line_13622'>repose him, and they of Northgalis espied him whither he rode; and then</a>
<a id='line_13623'>there followed him twelve knights for to have mischieved him, for this</a>
<a id='line_13624'>cause that upon the morn at the tournament of the Castle of Maidens</a>
<a id='line_13625'>that he should not win the victory. So they came upon Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_13626'>suddenly, and unnethe he might put upon him his helm and take his</a>
<a id='line_13627'>horse, but they were in hands with him; and then Sir Launcelot gat his</a>
<a id='line_13628'>spear, and rode through them, and there he slew a knight and brake a</a>
<a id='line_13629'>spear in his body. Then he drew his sword and smote upon the right hand</a>
<a id='line_13630'>and upon the left hand, so that within a few strokes he had slain other</a>
<a id='line_13631'>three knights, and the remnant that abode he wounded them sore all that</a>
<a id='line_13632'>did abide. Thus Sir Launcelot escaped from his enemies of North Wales,</a>
<a id='line_13633'>and then Sir Launcelot rode his way till a friend, and lodged him till</a>
<a id='line_13634'>on the morn; for he would not the first day have ado in the tournament</a>
<a id='line_13635'>because of his great labour. And on the first day he was with King</a>
<a id='line_13636'>Arthur thereas he was set on high upon a scaffold to discern who was</a>
<a id='line_13637'>best worthy of his deeds. So Sir Launcelot was with King Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_13638'>jousted not the first day.</a>
<a id='line_13639'></a>
<a id='line_13640'></a>
<a id='line_13641'></a>
<a id='line_13642'>CHAPTER XXIX. How Sir Tristram behaved him the first day of the</a>
<a id='line_13643'>tournament, and there he had the prize.</a>
<a id='line_13644'></a>
<a id='line_13645'>Now turn we unto Sir Tristram de Liones, that commanded Gouvernail, his</a>
<a id='line_13646'>servant, to ordain him a black shield with none other remembrance</a>
<a id='line_13647'>therein. And so Sir Persides and Sir Tristram departed from their host</a>
<a id='line_13648'>Sir Pellounes, and they rode early toward the tournament, and then they</a>
<a id='line_13649'>drew them to King Carados’ side, of Scotland; and anon knights began</a>
<a id='line_13650'>the field what of King Northgalis’ part, and what of King Carados’</a>
<a id='line_13651'>part, and there began great party. Then there was hurling and rashing.</a>
<a id='line_13652'>Right so came in Sir Persides and Sir Tristram and so they did fare</a>
<a id='line_13653'>that they put the King of Northgalis aback. Then came in Sir Bleoberis</a>
<a id='line_13654'>de Ganis and Sir Gaheris with them of Northgalis, and then was Sir</a>
<a id='line_13655'>Persides smitten down and almost slain, for more than forty horse men</a>
<a id='line_13656'>went over him. For Sir Bleoberis did great deeds of arms, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13657'>Gaheris failed him not. When Sir Tristram beheld them, and saw them do</a>
<a id='line_13658'>such deeds of arms, he marvelled what they were. Also Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13659'>thought shame that Sir Persides was so done to; and then he gat a great</a>
<a id='line_13660'>spear in his hand, and then he rode to Sir Gaheris and smote him down</a>
<a id='line_13661'>from his horse. And then was Sir Bleoberis wroth, and gat a spear and</a>
<a id='line_13662'>rode against Sir Tristram in great ire; and there Sir Tristram met with</a>
<a id='line_13663'>him, and smote Sir Bleoberis from his horse. So then the King with the</a>
<a id='line_13664'>Hundred Knights was wroth, and he horsed Sir Bleoberis and Sir Gaheris</a>
<a id='line_13665'>again, and there began a great medley; and ever Sir Tristram held them</a>
<a id='line_13666'>passing short, and ever Sir Bleoberis was passing busy upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_13667'>Tristram; and there came Sir Dinadan against Sir Tristram, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13668'>Tristram gave him such a buffet that he swooned in his saddle. Then</a>
<a id='line_13669'>anon Sir Dinadan came to Sir Tristram and said: Sir, I know thee better</a>
<a id='line_13670'>than thou weenest; but here I promise thee my troth I will never come</a>
<a id='line_13671'>against thee more, for I promise thee that sword of thine shall never</a>
<a id='line_13672'>come on mine helm.</a>
<a id='line_13673'></a>
<a id='line_13674'>With that came Sir Bleoberis, and Sir Tristram gave him such a buffet</a>
<a id='line_13675'>that down he laid his head; and then he caught him so sore by the helm</a>
<a id='line_13676'>that he pulled him under his horse’s feet. And then King Arthur blew to</a>
<a id='line_13677'>lodging. Then Sir Tristram departed to his pavilion, and Sir Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_13678'>rode with him; and Sir Persides and King Arthur then, and the kings</a>
<a id='line_13679'>upon both parties, marvelled what knight that was with the black</a>
<a id='line_13680'>shield. Many said their advice, and some knew him for Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_13681'>held their peace and would nought say. So that first day King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_13682'>and all the kings and lords that were judges, gave Sir Tristram the</a>
<a id='line_13683'>prize; howbeit they knew him not, but named him the Knight with the</a>
<a id='line_13684'>Black Shield.</a>
<a id='line_13685'></a>
<a id='line_13686'></a>
<a id='line_13687'></a>
<a id='line_13688'>CHAPTER XXX. How Sir Tristram returned against King Arthur’s party</a>
<a id='line_13689'>because he saw Sir Palomides on that party.</a>
<a id='line_13690'></a>
<a id='line_13691'>Then upon the morn Sir Palomides returned from the King of Northgalis,</a>
<a id='line_13692'>and rode to King Arthur’s side, where was King Carados, and the King of</a>
<a id='line_13693'>Ireland, and Sir Launcelot’s kin, and Sir Gawaine’s kin. So Sir</a>
<a id='line_13694'>Palomides sent the damosel unto Sir Tristram that he sent to seek him</a>
<a id='line_13695'>when he was out of his mind in the forest, and this damosel asked Sir</a>
<a id='line_13696'>Tristram what he was and what was his name?</a>
<a id='line_13697'></a>
<a id='line_13698'>As for that, said Sir Tristram, tell Sir Palomides ye shall not wit as</a>
<a id='line_13699'>at this time unto the time I have broken two spears upon him. But let</a>
<a id='line_13700'>him wit thus much, said Sir Tristram, that I am the same knight that he</a>
<a id='line_13701'>smote down in over evening at the tournament; and tell him plainly on</a>
<a id='line_13702'>what party that Sir Palomides be I will be of the contrary party.</a>
<a id='line_13703'></a>
<a id='line_13704'>Sir, said the damosel, ye shall understand that Sir Palomides will be</a>
<a id='line_13705'>on King Arthur’s side, where the most noble knights of the world be. In</a>
<a id='line_13706'>the name of God, said Sir Tristram, then will I be with the King of</a>
<a id='line_13707'>Northgalis, because Sir Palomides will be on King Arthur’s side, and</a>
<a id='line_13708'>else I would not but for his sake. So when King Arthur was come they</a>
<a id='line_13709'>blew unto the field; and then there began a great party, and so King</a>
<a id='line_13710'>Carados jousted with the King of the Hundred Knights, and there King</a>
<a id='line_13711'>Carados had a fall: then was there hurling and rushing, and right so</a>
<a id='line_13712'>came in knights of King Arthur’s, and they bare aback the King of</a>
<a id='line_13713'>Northgalis’ knights.</a>
<a id='line_13714'></a>
<a id='line_13715'>Then Sir Tristram came in, and began so roughly and so bigly that there</a>
<a id='line_13716'>was none might withstand him, and thus Sir Tristram dured long. And at</a>
<a id='line_13717'>the last Sir Tristram fell among the fellowship of King Ban, and there</a>
<a id='line_13718'>fell upon him Sir Bors de Ganis, and Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13719'>Blamore de Ganis, and many other knights. And then Sir Tristram smote</a>
<a id='line_13720'>on the right hand and on the left hand, that all lords and ladies spake</a>
<a id='line_13721'>of his noble deeds. But at the last Sir Tristram should have had the</a>
<a id='line_13722'>worse had not the King with the Hundred Knights been. And then he came</a>
<a id='line_13723'>with his fellowship and rescued Sir Tristram, and brought him away from</a>
<a id='line_13724'>those knights that bare the shields of Cornwall. And then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13725'>saw another fellowship by themself, and there were a forty knights</a>
<a id='line_13726'>together, and Sir Kay, the Seneschal, was their governor. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13727'>Tristram rode in amongst them, and there he smote down Sir Kay from his</a>
<a id='line_13728'>horse; and there he fared among those knights like a greyhound among</a>
<a id='line_13729'>conies.</a>
<a id='line_13730'></a>
<a id='line_13731'>Then Sir Launcelot found a knight that was sore wounded upon the head.</a>
<a id='line_13732'>Sir, said Sir Launcelot, who wounded you so sore? Sir, he said, a</a>
<a id='line_13733'>knight that beareth a black shield, and I may curse the time that ever</a>
<a id='line_13734'>I met with him, for he is a devil and no man. So Sir Launcelot departed</a>
<a id='line_13735'>from him and thought to meet with Sir Tristram, and so he rode with his</a>
<a id='line_13736'>sword drawn in his hand to seek Sir Tristram; and then he espied him</a>
<a id='line_13737'>how he hurled here and there, and at every stroke Sir Tristram wellnigh</a>
<a id='line_13738'>smote down a knight. O mercy Jesu! said the king, sith the times I bare</a>
<a id='line_13739'>arms saw I never no knight do so marvellous deeds of arms. And if I</a>
<a id='line_13740'>should set upon this knight, said Sir Launcelot to himself, I did shame</a>
<a id='line_13741'>to myself, and therewithal Sir Launcelot put up his sword. And then the</a>
<a id='line_13742'>King with the Hundred Knights and an hundred more of North Wales set</a>
<a id='line_13743'>upon the twenty of Sir Launcelot’s kin: and they twenty knights held</a>
<a id='line_13744'>them ever together as wild swine, and none would fail other. And so</a>
<a id='line_13745'>when Sir Tristram beheld the noblesse of these twenty knights he</a>
<a id='line_13746'>marvelled of their good deeds, for he saw by their fare and by their</a>
<a id='line_13747'>rule that they had liefer die than avoid the field. Now Jesu, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13748'>Tristram, well may he be valiant and full of prowess that hath such a</a>
<a id='line_13749'>sort of noble knights unto his kin, and full like is he to be a noble</a>
<a id='line_13750'>man that is their leader and governor. He meant it by Sir Launcelot du</a>
<a id='line_13751'>Lake. So when Sir Tristram had beholden them long he thought shame to</a>
<a id='line_13752'>see two hundred knights battering upon twenty knights. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13753'>Tristram rode unto the King with the Hundred Knights and said: Sir,</a>
<a id='line_13754'>leave your fighting with those twenty knights, for ye win no worship of</a>
<a id='line_13755'>them, ye be so many and they so few; and wit ye well they will not out</a>
<a id='line_13756'>of the field I see by their cheer and countenance; and worship get ye</a>
<a id='line_13757'>none an ye slay them. Therefore leave your fighting with them, for I to</a>
<a id='line_13758'>increase my worship I will ride to the twenty knights and help them</a>
<a id='line_13759'>with all my might and power. Nay, said the King with the Hundred</a>
<a id='line_13760'>Knights, ye shall not do so; now I see your courage and courtesy I will</a>
<a id='line_13761'>withdraw my knights for your pleasure, for evermore a good knight will</a>
<a id='line_13762'>favour another, and like will draw to like.</a>
<a id='line_13763'></a>
<a id='line_13764'></a>
<a id='line_13765'></a>
<a id='line_13766'>CHAPTER XXXI. How Sir Tristram found Palomides by a well, and brought</a>
<a id='line_13767'>him with him to his lodging.</a>
<a id='line_13768'></a>
<a id='line_13769'>Then the King with the Hundred Knights withdrew his knights. And all</a>
<a id='line_13770'>this while, and long to-fore, Sir Launcelot had watched upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_13771'>Tristram with a very purpose to have fellowshipped with him. And then</a>
<a id='line_13772'>suddenly Sir Tristram, Sir Dinadan, and Gouvernail, his man, rode their</a>
<a id='line_13773'>way into the forest, that no man perceived where they went. So then</a>
<a id='line_13774'>King Arthur blew unto lodging, and gave the King of Northgalis the</a>
<a id='line_13775'>prize because Sir Tristram was upon his side. Then Sir Launcelot rode</a>
<a id='line_13776'>here and there, so wood as lion that fauted his fill, because he had</a>
<a id='line_13777'>lost Sir Tristram, and so he returned unto King Arthur. And then in all</a>
<a id='line_13778'>the field was a noise that with the wind it might be heard two mile</a>
<a id='line_13779'>thence, how the lords and ladies cried: The Knight with the Black</a>
<a id='line_13780'>Shield hath won the field. Alas, said King Arthur, where is that knight</a>
<a id='line_13781'>become? It is shame to all those in the field so to let him escape away</a>
<a id='line_13782'>from you; but with gentleness and courtesy ye might have brought him</a>
<a id='line_13783'>unto me to the Castle of Maidens. Then the noble King Arthur went unto</a>
<a id='line_13784'>his knights and comforted them in the best wise that he could, and</a>
<a id='line_13785'>said: My fair fellows, be not dismayed, howbeit ye have lost the field</a>
<a id='line_13786'>this day. And many were hurt and sore wounded, and many were whole. My</a>
<a id='line_13787'>fellows, said King Arthur, look that ye be of good cheer, for to-morn I</a>
<a id='line_13788'>will be in the field with you and revenge you of your enemies. So that</a>
<a id='line_13789'>night King Arthur and his knights reposed themself.</a>
<a id='line_13790'></a>
<a id='line_13791'>The damosel that came from La Beale Isoud unto Sir Tristram, all the</a>
<a id='line_13792'>while the tournament was a-doing she was with Queen Guenever, and ever</a>
<a id='line_13793'>the queen asked her for what cause she came into that country. Madam,</a>
<a id='line_13794'>she answered, I come for none other cause but from my lady La Beale</a>
<a id='line_13795'>Isoud to wit of your welfare. For in no wise she would not tell the</a>
<a id='line_13796'>queen that she came for Sir Tristram’s sake. So this lady, Dame</a>
<a id='line_13797'>Bragwaine, took her leave of Queen Guenever, and she rode after Sir</a>
<a id='line_13798'>Tristram. And as she rode through the forest she heard a great cry;</a>
<a id='line_13799'>then she commanded her squire to go into the forest to wit what was</a>
<a id='line_13800'>that noise. And so he came to a well, and there he found a knight</a>
<a id='line_13801'>bounden till a tree crying as he had been wood, and his horse and his</a>
<a id='line_13802'>harness standing by him. And when he espied that squire, therewith he</a>
<a id='line_13803'>abraid and brake himself loose, and took his sword in his hand, and ran</a>
<a id='line_13804'>to have slain the squire. Then he took his horse and fled all that ever</a>
<a id='line_13805'>he might unto Dame Bragwaine, and told her of his adventure. Then she</a>
<a id='line_13806'>rode unto Sir Tristram’s pavilion, and told Sir Tristram what adventure</a>
<a id='line_13807'>she had found in the forest. Alas, said Sir Tristram, upon my head</a>
<a id='line_13808'>there is some good knight at mischief.</a>
<a id='line_13809'></a>
<a id='line_13810'>Then Sir Tristram took his horse and his sword and rode thither, and</a>
<a id='line_13811'>there he heard how the knight complained unto himself and said: I,</a>
<a id='line_13812'>woful knight Sir Palomides, what misadventure befalleth me, that thus</a>
<a id='line_13813'>am defoiled with falsehood and treason, through Sir Bors and Sir Ector.</a>
<a id='line_13814'>Alas, he said, why live I so long! And then he gat his sword in his</a>
<a id='line_13815'>hands, and made many strange signs and tokens; and so through his</a>
<a id='line_13816'>raging he threw his sword into that fountain. Then Sir Palomides wailed</a>
<a id='line_13817'>and wrang his hands. And at the last for pure sorrow he ran into that</a>
<a id='line_13818'>fountain, over his belly, and sought after his sword. Then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13819'>saw that, and ran upon Sir Palomides, and held him in his arms fast.</a>
<a id='line_13820'>What art thou, said Palomides, that holdeth me so? I am a man of this</a>
<a id='line_13821'>forest that would thee none harm. Alas, said Sir Palomides, I may never</a>
<a id='line_13822'>win worship where Sir Tristram is; for ever where he is an I be there,</a>
<a id='line_13823'>then get I no worship; and if he be away for the most part I have the</a>
<a id='line_13824'>gree, unless that Sir Launcelot be there or Sir Lamorak. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13825'>Palomides said: Once in Ireland Sir Tristram put me to the worse, and</a>
<a id='line_13826'>another time in Cornwall, and in other places in this land. What would</a>
<a id='line_13827'>ye do, said Sir Tristram, an ye had Sir Tristram? I would fight with</a>
<a id='line_13828'>him, said Sir Palomides, and ease my heart upon him; and yet, to say</a>
<a id='line_13829'>thee sooth, Sir Tristram is the gentlest knight in this world living.</a>
<a id='line_13830'>What will ye do, said Sir Tristram, will ye go with me to your lodging?</a>
<a id='line_13831'>Nay, said he, I will go to the King with the Hundred Knights, for he</a>
<a id='line_13832'>rescued me from Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir Ector and else had I been</a>
<a id='line_13833'>slain traitorly. Sir Tristram said him such kind words that Sir</a>
<a id='line_13834'>Palomides went with him to his lodging. Then Gouvernail went to-fore,</a>
<a id='line_13835'>and charged Dame Bragwaine to go out of the way to her lodging. And bid</a>
<a id='line_13836'>ye Sir Persides that he make him no quarrels. And so they rode together</a>
<a id='line_13837'>till they came to Sir Tristram’s pavilion, and there Sir Palomides had</a>
<a id='line_13838'>all the cheer that might be had all that night. But in no wise Sir</a>
<a id='line_13839'>Palomides might not know what was Sir Tristram; and so after supper</a>
<a id='line_13840'>they yede to rest, and Sir Tristram for great travail slept till it was</a>
<a id='line_13841'>day. And Sir Palomides might not sleep for anguish; and in the dawning</a>
<a id='line_13842'>of the day he took his horse privily, and rode his way unto Sir Gaheris</a>
<a id='line_13843'>and unto Sir Sagramore le Desirous, where they were in their pavilions;</a>
<a id='line_13844'>for they three were fellows at the beginning of the tournament. And</a>
<a id='line_13845'>then upon the morn the king blew unto the tournament upon the third</a>
<a id='line_13846'>day.</a>
<a id='line_13847'></a>
<a id='line_13848'></a>
<a id='line_13849'></a>
<a id='line_13850'>CHAPTER XXXII. How Sir Tristram smote down Sir Palomides, and how he</a>
<a id='line_13851'>jousted with King Arthur, and other feats.</a>
<a id='line_13852'></a>
<a id='line_13853'>So the King of Northgalis and the King with the Hundred Knights, they</a>
<a id='line_13854'>two encountered with King Carados and with the King of Ireland; and</a>
<a id='line_13855'>there the King with the Hundred Knights smote down King Carados, and</a>
<a id='line_13856'>the King of Northgalis smote down the King of Ireland. With that came</a>
<a id='line_13857'>in Sir Palomides, and when he came he made great work, for by his</a>
<a id='line_13858'>indented shield he was well known. So came in King Arthur, and did</a>
<a id='line_13859'>great deeds of arms together, and put the King of Northgalis and the</a>
<a id='line_13860'>King with the Hundred Knights to the worse. With this came in Sir</a>
<a id='line_13861'>Tristram with his black shield, and anon he jousted with Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_13862'>and there by fine force Sir Tristram smote Sir Palomides over his</a>
<a id='line_13863'>horse’s croup. Then King Arthur cried: Knight with the Black Shield,</a>
<a id='line_13864'>make thee ready to me, and in the same wise Sir Tristram smote King</a>
<a id='line_13865'>Arthur. And then by force of King Arthur’s knights the King and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13866'>Palomides were horsed again. Then King Arthur with a great eager heart</a>
<a id='line_13867'>he gat a spear in his hand, and there upon the one side he smote Sir</a>
<a id='line_13868'>Tristram over his horse. Then foot-hot Sir Palomides came upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_13869'>Tristram, as he was upon foot, to have overridden him. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13870'>Tristram was ware of him, and there he stooped aside, and with great</a>
<a id='line_13871'>ire he gat him by the arm, and pulled him down from his horse. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13872'>Palomides lightly arose, and then they dashed together mightily with</a>
<a id='line_13873'>their swords; and many kings, queens, and lords, stood and beheld them.</a>
<a id='line_13874'>And at the last Sir Tristram smote Sir Palomides upon the helm three</a>
<a id='line_13875'>mighty strokes, and at every stroke that he gave him he said: This for</a>
<a id='line_13876'>Sir Tristram’s sake. With that Sir Palomides fell to the earth</a>
<a id='line_13877'>grovelling.</a>
<a id='line_13878'></a>
<a id='line_13879'>Then came the King with the Hundred Knights, and brought Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13880'>an horse, and so was he horsed again. By then was Sir Palomides horsed,</a>
<a id='line_13881'>and with great ire he jousted upon Sir Tristram with his spear as it</a>
<a id='line_13882'>was in the rest, and gave him a great dash with his sword. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13883'>Tristram avoided his spear, and gat him by the neck with his both</a>
<a id='line_13884'>hands, and pulled him clean out of his saddle, and so he bare him afore</a>
<a id='line_13885'>him the length of ten spears, and then in the presence of them all he</a>
<a id='line_13886'>let him fall at his adventure. Then Sir Tristram was ware of King</a>
<a id='line_13887'>Arthur with a naked sword in his hand, and with his spear Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13888'>ran upon King Arthur; and then King Arthur boldly abode him and with</a>
<a id='line_13889'>his sword he smote a-two his spear, and therewithal Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13890'>stonied; and so King Arthur gave him three or four strokes or he might</a>
<a id='line_13891'>get out his sword, and at the last Sir Tristram drew his sword and</a>
<a id='line_13892'>[either] assailed other passing hard. With that the great press</a>
<a id='line_13893'>departed [them]. Then Sir Tristram rode here and there and did his</a>
<a id='line_13894'>great pain, that eleven of the good knights of the blood of King Ban,</a>
<a id='line_13895'>that was of Sir Launcelot’s kin, that day Sir Tristram smote down; that</a>
<a id='line_13896'>all the estates marvelled of his great deeds and all cried upon the</a>
<a id='line_13897'>Knight with the Black Shield.</a>
<a id='line_13898'></a>
<a id='line_13899'></a>
<a id='line_13900'></a>
<a id='line_13901'>CHAPTER XXXIII. How Sir Launcelot hurt Sir Tristram, and how after Sir</a>
<a id='line_13902'>Tristram smote down Sir Palomides.</a>
<a id='line_13903'></a>
<a id='line_13904'>Then this cry was so large that Sir Launcelot heard it. And then he gat</a>
<a id='line_13905'>a great spear in his hand and came towards the cry. Then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_13906'>cried: The Knight with the Black Shield, make thee ready to joust with</a>
<a id='line_13907'>me. When Sir Tristram heard him say so he gat his spear in his hand,</a>
<a id='line_13908'>and either abashed down their heads, and came together as thunder; and</a>
<a id='line_13909'>Sir Tristram’s spear brake in pieces, and Sir Launcelot by malfortune</a>
<a id='line_13910'>struck Sir Tristram on the side a deep wound nigh to the death; but yet</a>
<a id='line_13911'>Sir Tristram avoided not his saddle, and so the spear brake.</a>
<a id='line_13912'>Therewithal Sir Tristram that was wounded gat out his sword, and he</a>
<a id='line_13913'>rushed to Sir Launcelot, and gave him three great strokes upon the helm</a>
<a id='line_13914'>that the fire sprang thereout, and Sir Launcelot abashed his head lowly</a>
<a id='line_13915'>toward his saddle-bow. And therewithal Sir Tristram departed from the</a>
<a id='line_13916'>field, for he felt him so wounded that he weened he should have died;</a>
<a id='line_13917'>and Sir Dinadan espied him and followed him into the forest. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13918'>Launcelot abode and did many marvellous deeds.</a>
<a id='line_13919'></a>
<a id='line_13920'>So when Sir Tristram was departed by the forest’s side he alighted, and</a>
<a id='line_13921'>unlaced his harness and freshed his wound; then weened Sir Dinadan that</a>
<a id='line_13922'>he should have died. Nay, nay, said Sir Tristram, Dinadan never dread</a>
<a id='line_13923'>thee, for I am heart-whole, and of this wound I shall soon be whole, by</a>
<a id='line_13924'>the mercy of God. By that Sir Dinadan was ware where came Palomides</a>
<a id='line_13925'>riding straight upon them. And then Sir Tristram was ware that Sir</a>
<a id='line_13926'>Palomides came to have destroyed him. And so Sir Dinadan gave him</a>
<a id='line_13927'>warning, and said: Sir Tristram, my lord, ye are so sore wounded that</a>
<a id='line_13928'>ye may not have ado with him, therefore I will ride against him and do</a>
<a id='line_13929'>to him what I may, and if I be slain ye may pray for my soul; and in</a>
<a id='line_13930'>the meanwhile ye may withdraw you and go into the castle, or in the</a>
<a id='line_13931'>forest, that he shall not meet with you. Sir Tristram smiled and said:</a>
<a id='line_13932'>I thank you, Sir Dinadan, of your good will, but ye shall wit that I am</a>
<a id='line_13933'>able to handle him. And then anon hastily he armed him, and took his</a>
<a id='line_13934'>horse, and a great spear in his hand, and said to Sir Dinadan: Adieu;</a>
<a id='line_13935'>and rode toward Sir Palomides a soft pace. Then when Sir Palomides saw</a>
<a id='line_13936'>that, he made countenance to amend his horse, but he did it for this</a>
<a id='line_13937'>cause, for he abode Sir Gaheris that came after him. And when he was</a>
<a id='line_13938'>come he rode toward Sir Tristram. Then Sir Tristram sent unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_13939'>Palomides, and required him to joust with him; and if he smote down Sir</a>
<a id='line_13940'>Palomides he would do no more to him; and if it so happened that Sir</a>
<a id='line_13941'>Palomides smote down Sir Tristram, he bade him do his utterance. So</a>
<a id='line_13942'>they were accorded. Then they met together, and Sir Tristram smote down</a>
<a id='line_13943'>Sir Palomides that he had a grievous fall, so that he lay still as he</a>
<a id='line_13944'>had been dead. And then Sir Tristram ran upon Sir Gaheris, and he would</a>
<a id='line_13945'>not have jousted; but whether he would or not Sir Tristram smote him</a>
<a id='line_13946'>over his horse’s croup, that he lay still as though he had been dead.</a>
<a id='line_13947'>And then Sir Tristram rode his way and left Sir Persides’ squire within</a>
<a id='line_13948'>the pavilions, and Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan rode to an old knight’s</a>
<a id='line_13949'>place to lodge them. And that old knight had five sons at the</a>
<a id='line_13950'>tournament, for whom he prayed God heartily for their coming home. And</a>
<a id='line_13951'>so, as the French book saith, they came home all five well beaten.</a>
<a id='line_13952'></a>
<a id='line_13953'>And when Sir Tristram departed into the forest Sir Launcelot held alway</a>
<a id='line_13954'>the stour like hard, as a man araged that took no heed to himself, and</a>
<a id='line_13955'>wit ye well there was many a noble knight against him. And when King</a>
<a id='line_13956'>Arthur saw Sir Launcelot do so marvellous deeds of arms he then armed</a>
<a id='line_13957'>him, and took his horse and his armour, and rode into the field to help</a>
<a id='line_13958'>Sir Launcelot; and so many knights came in with King Arthur. And to</a>
<a id='line_13959'>make short tale in conclusion, the King of Northgalis and the King of</a>
<a id='line_13960'>the Hundred Knights were put to the worse; and because Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_13961'>abode and was the last in the field the prize was given him. But Sir</a>
<a id='line_13962'>Launcelot would neither for king, queen, nor knight, have the prize,</a>
<a id='line_13963'>but where the cry was cried through the field: Sir Launcelot, Sir</a>
<a id='line_13964'>Launcelot hath won the field this day, Sir Launcelot let make another</a>
<a id='line_13965'>cry contrary: Sir Tristram hath won the field, for he began first, and</a>
<a id='line_13966'>last he hath endured, and so hath he done the first day, the second,</a>
<a id='line_13967'>and the third day.</a>

<a id='line_13969'></a>
<a id='line_13970'></a>
<a id='line_13971'>CHAPTER XXXIV. How the prize of the third day was given to Sir</a>
<a id='line_13972'>Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot gave it to Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_13973'></a>
<a id='line_13974'>Then all the estates and degrees high and low said of Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_13975'>great worship, for the honour that he did unto Sir Tristram; and for</a>
<a id='line_13976'>that honour doing to Sir Tristram he was at that time more praised and</a>
<a id='line_13977'>renowned than an he had overthrown five hundred knights; and all the</a>
<a id='line_13978'>people wholly for this gentleness, first the estates both high and low,</a>
<a id='line_13979'>and after the commonalty cried at once: Sir Launcelot hath won the</a>
<a id='line_13980'>field whosoever say nay. Then was Sir Launcelot wroth and ashamed, and</a>
<a id='line_13981'>so therewithal he rode to King Arthur. Alas, said the king, we are all</a>
<a id='line_13982'>dismayed that Sir Tristram is thus departed from us. By God, said King</a>
<a id='line_13983'>Arthur, he is one of the noblest knights that ever I saw hold spear or</a>
<a id='line_13984'>sword in hand, and the most courteoust knight in his fighting; for full</a>
<a id='line_13985'>hard I saw him, said King Arthur, when he smote Sir Palomides upon the</a>
<a id='line_13986'>helm thrice, that he abashed his helm with his strokes, and also he</a>
<a id='line_13987'>said: Here is a stroke for Sir Tristram, and thus thrice he said. Then</a>
<a id='line_13988'>King Arthur, Sir Launcelot, and Sir Dodinas le Savage took their horses</a>
<a id='line_13989'>to seek Sir Tristram, and by the means of Sir Persides he had told King</a>
<a id='line_13990'>Arthur where Sir Tristram was in his pavilion. But when they came</a>
<a id='line_13991'>there, Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan were gone.</a>
<a id='line_13992'></a>
<a id='line_13993'>Then King Arthur and Sir Launcelot were heavy, and returned again to</a>
<a id='line_13994'>the Castle of Maidens making great dole for the hurt of Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_13995'>and his sudden departing. So God me help, said King Arthur, I am more</a>
<a id='line_13996'>heavy that I cannot meet with him than for all the hurts that all my</a>
<a id='line_13997'>knights have had at the tournament. Right so came Sir Gaheris and told</a>
<a id='line_13998'>King Arthur how Sir Tristram had smitten down Sir Palomides, and it was</a>
<a id='line_13999'>at Sir Palomides’ own request. Alas, said King Arthur, that was great</a>
<a id='line_14000'>dishonour to Sir Palomides, inasmuch as Sir Tristram was sore wounded,</a>
<a id='line_14001'>and now may we all, kings, and knights, and men of worship, say that</a>
<a id='line_14002'>Sir Tristram may be called a noble knight, and one of the best knights</a>
<a id='line_14003'>that ever I saw the days of my life. For I will that ye all, kings and</a>
<a id='line_14004'>knights, know, said King Arthur, that I never saw knight do so</a>
<a id='line_14005'>marvellously as he hath done these three days; for he was the first</a>
<a id='line_14006'>that began and that longest held on, save this last day. And though he</a>
<a id='line_14007'>was hurt, it was a manly adventure of two noble knights, and when two</a>
<a id='line_14008'>noble men encounter needs must the one have the worse, like as God will</a>
<a id='line_14009'>suffer at that time. As for me, said Sir Launcelot, for all the lands</a>
<a id='line_14010'>that ever my father left me I would not have hurt Sir Tristram an I had</a>
<a id='line_14011'>known him at that time; that I hurt him was for I saw not his shield.</a>
<a id='line_14012'>For an I had seen his black shield, I would not have meddled with him</a>
<a id='line_14013'>for many causes; for late he did as much for me as ever did knight, and</a>
<a id='line_14014'>that is well known that he had ado with thirty knights, and no help</a>
<a id='line_14015'>save Sir Dinadan. And one thing shall I promise, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_14016'>Sir Palomides shall repent it as in his unkindly dealing for to follow</a>
<a id='line_14017'>that noble knight that I by mishap hurted thus. Sir Launcelot said all</a>
<a id='line_14018'>the worship that might be said by Sir Tristram. Then King Arthur made a</a>
<a id='line_14019'>great feast to all that would come. And thus we let pass King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_14020'>and a little we will turn unto Sir Palomides, that after he had a fall</a>
<a id='line_14021'>of Sir Tristram, he was nigh-hand araged out of his wit for despite of</a>
<a id='line_14022'>Sir Tristram. And so he followed him by adventure. And as he came by a</a>
<a id='line_14023'>river, in his woodness he would have made his horse to have leapt over;</a>
<a id='line_14024'>and the horse failed footing and fell in the river, wherefore Sir</a>
<a id='line_14025'>Palomides was adread lest he should have been drowned; and then he</a>
<a id='line_14026'>avoided his horse, and swam to the land, and let his horse go down by</a>
<a id='line_14027'>adventure.</a>
<a id='line_14028'></a>
<a id='line_14029'></a>
<a id='line_14030'></a>
<a id='line_14031'>CHAPTER XXXV. How Palomides came to the castle where Sir Tristram was,</a>
<a id='line_14032'>and of the quest that Sir Launcelot and ten knights made for Sir</a>
<a id='line_14033'>Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_14034'></a>
<a id='line_14035'>And when he came to the land he took off his harness, and sat roaring</a>
<a id='line_14036'>and crying as a man out of his mind. Right so came a damosel even by</a>
<a id='line_14037'>Sir Palomides, that was sent from Sir Gawaine and his brother unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_14038'>Mordred, that lay sick in the same place with that old knight where Sir</a>
<a id='line_14039'>Tristram was. For, as the French book saith, Sir Persides hurt so Sir</a>
<a id='line_14040'>Mordred a ten days afore; and had it not been for the love of Sir</a>
<a id='line_14041'>Gawaine and his brother, Sir Persides had slain Sir Mordred. And so</a>
<a id='line_14042'>this damosel came by Sir Palomides, and she and he had language</a>
<a id='line_14043'>together, the which pleased neither of them; and so the damosel rode</a>
<a id='line_14044'>her ways till she came to the old knight’s place, and there she told</a>
<a id='line_14045'>that old knight how she met with the woodest knight by adventure that</a>
<a id='line_14046'>ever she met withal. What bare he in his shield? said Sir Tristram. It</a>
<a id='line_14047'>was indented with white and black, said the damosel. Ah, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14048'>Tristram, that was Sir Palomides, the good knight. For well I know him,</a>
<a id='line_14049'>said Sir Tristram, for one of the best knights living in this realm.</a>
<a id='line_14050'>Then that old knight took a little hackney, and rode for Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_14051'>and brought him unto his own manor; and full well knew Sir Tristram Sir</a>
<a id='line_14052'>Palomides, but he said but little, for at that time Sir Tristram was</a>
<a id='line_14053'>walking upon his feet, and well amended of his hurts; and always when</a>
<a id='line_14054'>Sir Palomides saw Sir Tristram he would behold him full marvellously,</a>
<a id='line_14055'>and ever him seemed that he had seen him. Then would he say unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_14056'>Dinadan: An ever I may meet with Sir Tristram he shall not escape mine</a>
<a id='line_14057'>hands. I marvel, said Sir Dinadan, that ye boast behind Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_14058'>for it is but late that he was in your hands, and ye in his hands; why</a>
<a id='line_14059'>would ye not hold him when ye had him? for I saw myself twice or thrice</a>
<a id='line_14060'>that ye gat but little worship of Sir Tristram. Then was Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_14061'>ashamed. So leave we them a little while in the old castle with the old</a>
<a id='line_14062'>knight Sir Darras.</a>
<a id='line_14063'></a>
<a id='line_14064'>Now shall we speak of King Arthur, that said to Sir Launcelot: Had not</a>
<a id='line_14065'>ye been we had not lost Sir Tristram, for he was here daily unto the</a>
<a id='line_14066'>time ye met with him, and in an evil time, said Arthur, ye encountered</a>
<a id='line_14067'>with him. My lord Arthur, said Launcelot, ye put upon me that I should</a>
<a id='line_14068'>be cause of his departition; God knoweth it was against my will. But</a>
<a id='line_14069'>when men be hot in deeds of arms oft they hurt their friends as well as</a>
<a id='line_14070'>their foes. And my lord, said Sir Launcelot, ye shall understand that</a>
<a id='line_14071'>Sir Tristram is a man that I am loath to offend, for he hath done for</a>
<a id='line_14072'>me more than ever I did for him as yet. But then Sir Launcelot made</a>
<a id='line_14073'>bring forth a book: and then Sir Launcelot said: Here we are ten</a>
<a id='line_14074'>knights that will swear upon a book never to rest one night where we</a>
<a id='line_14075'>rest another this twelvemonth until that we find Sir Tristram. And as</a>
<a id='line_14076'>for me, said Sir Launcelot, I promise you upon this book that an I may</a>
<a id='line_14077'>meet with him, either with fairness or foulness I shall bring him to</a>
<a id='line_14078'>this court, or else I shall die therefore. And the names of these ten</a>
<a id='line_14079'>knights that had undertaken this quest were these following: First was</a>
<a id='line_14080'>Sir Launcelot, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Bors de Ganis, and Bleoberis,</a>
<a id='line_14081'>and Sir Blamore de Ganis, and Lucan the Butler, Sir Uwaine, Sir Galihud</a>
<a id='line_14082'>Lionel, and Galiodin. So these ten noble knights departed from the</a>
<a id='line_14083'>court of King Arthur, and so they rode upon their quest together until</a>
<a id='line_14084'>they came to a cross where departed four ways, and there departed the</a>
<a id='line_14085'>fellowship in four to seek Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_14086'></a>
<a id='line_14087'>And as Sir Launcelot rode by adventure he met with Dame Bragwaine that</a>
<a id='line_14088'>was sent into that country to seek Sir Tristram, and she fled as fast</a>
<a id='line_14089'>as her palfrey might go. So Sir Launcelot met with her and asked her</a>
<a id='line_14090'>why she fled. Ah, fair knight, said Dame Bragwaine, I flee for dread of</a>
<a id='line_14091'>my life, for here followeth me Sir Breuse Saunce Pité to slay me. Hold</a>
<a id='line_14092'>you nigh me, said Sir Launcelot. Then when Sir Launcelot saw Sir Breuse</a>
<a id='line_14093'>Saunce Pité, Sir Launcelot cried unto him, and said: False knight,</a>
<a id='line_14094'>destroyer of ladies and damosels, now thy last days be come. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_14095'>Breuse Saunce Pité saw Sir Launcelot’s shield he knew it well, for at</a>
<a id='line_14096'>that time he bare not the arms of Cornwall, but he bare his own shield.</a>
<a id='line_14097'>And then Sir Breuse fled, and Sir Launcelot followed after him. But Sir</a>
<a id='line_14098'>Breuse was so well horsed that when him list to flee he might well</a>
<a id='line_14099'>flee, and also abide when him list. And then Sir Launcelot returned</a>
<a id='line_14100'>unto Dame Bragwaine, and she thanked him of his great labour.</a>
<a id='line_14101'></a>
<a id='line_14102'></a>
<a id='line_14103'></a>
<a id='line_14104'>CHAPTER XXXVI. How Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir Dinadan were</a>
<a id='line_14105'>taken and put in prison.</a>
<a id='line_14106'></a>
<a id='line_14107'>Now will we speak of Sir Lucan the butler, that by fortune he came</a>
<a id='line_14108'>riding to the same place thereas was Sir Tristram, and in he came in</a>
<a id='line_14109'>none other intent but to ask harbour. Then the porter asked what was</a>
<a id='line_14110'>his name. Tell your lord that my name is Sir Lucan, the butler, a</a>
<a id='line_14111'>Knight of the Round Table. So the porter went unto Sir Darras, lord of</a>
<a id='line_14112'>the place, and told him who was there to ask harbour. Nay, nay, said</a>
<a id='line_14113'>Sir Daname, that was nephew to Sir Darras, say him that he shall not be</a>
<a id='line_14114'>lodged here, but let him wit that I, Sir Daname, will meet with him</a>
<a id='line_14115'>anon, and bid him make him ready. So Sir Daname came forth on</a>
<a id='line_14116'>horseback, and there they met together with spears, and Sir Lucan smote</a>
<a id='line_14117'>down Sir Daname over his horse’s croup, and then he fled into that</a>
<a id='line_14118'>place, and Sir Lucan rode after him, and asked after him many times.</a>
<a id='line_14119'></a>
<a id='line_14120'>Then Sir Dinadan said to Sir Tristram: It is shame to see the lord’s</a>
<a id='line_14121'>cousin of this place defoiled. Abide, said Sir Tristram, and I shall</a>
<a id='line_14122'>redress it. And in the meanwhile Sir Dinadan was on horseback, and he</a>
<a id='line_14123'>jousted with Lucan the butler, and there Sir Lucan smote Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_14124'>through the thick of the thigh, and so he rode his way; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_14125'>Tristram was wroth that Sir Dinadan was hurt, and followed after, and</a>
<a id='line_14126'>thought to avenge him; and within a while he overtook Sir Lucan, and</a>
<a id='line_14127'>bade him turn; and so they met together so that Sir Tristram hurt Sir</a>
<a id='line_14128'>Lucan passing sore and gave him a fall. With that came Sir Uwaine, a</a>
<a id='line_14129'>gentle knight, and when he saw Sir Lucan so hurt he called Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_14130'>to joust with him. Fair knight, said Sir Tristram, tell me your name I</a>
<a id='line_14131'>require you. Sir knight, wit ye well my name is Sir Uwaine le Fise de</a>
<a id='line_14132'>Roy Ureine. Ah, said Sir Tristram, by my will I would not have ado with</a>
<a id='line_14133'>you at no time. Ye shall not so, said Sir Uwaine, but ye shall have ado</a>
<a id='line_14134'>with me. And then Sir Tristram saw none other bote, but rode against</a>
<a id='line_14135'>him, and overthrew Sir Uwaine and hurt him in the side, and so he</a>
<a id='line_14136'>departed unto his lodging again. And when Sir Dinadan understood that</a>
<a id='line_14137'>Sir Tristram had hurt Sir Lucan he would have ridden after Sir Lucan</a>
<a id='line_14138'>for to have slain him, but Sir Tristram would not suffer him. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_14139'>Uwaine let ordain an horse litter, and brought Sir Lucan to the abbey</a>
<a id='line_14140'>of Ganis, and the castle thereby hight the Castle of Ganis, of the</a>
<a id='line_14141'>which Sir Bleoberis was lord. And at that castle Sir Launcelot promised</a>
<a id='line_14142'>all his fellows to meet in the quest of Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_14143'></a>
<a id='line_14144'>So when Sir Tristram was come to his lodging there came a damosel that</a>
<a id='line_14145'>told Sir Darras that three of his sons were slain at that tournament,</a>
<a id='line_14146'>and two grievously wounded that they were never like to help themself.</a>
<a id='line_14147'>And all this was done by a noble knight that bare the black shield, and</a>
<a id='line_14148'>that was he that bare the prize. Then came there one and told Sir</a>
<a id='line_14149'>Darras that the same knight was within, him that bare the black shield.</a>
<a id='line_14150'>Then Sir Darras yede unto Sir Tristram’s chamber, and there he found</a>
<a id='line_14151'>his shield and showed it to the damosel. Ah sir, said the damosel, that</a>
<a id='line_14152'>same is he that slew your three sons. Then without any tarrying Sir</a>
<a id='line_14153'>Darras put Sir Tristram, and Sir Palomides, and Sir Dinadan, within a</a>
<a id='line_14154'>strong prison, and there Sir Tristram was like to have died of great</a>
<a id='line_14155'>sickness; and every day Sir Palomides would reprove Sir Tristram of old</a>
<a id='line_14156'>hate betwixt them. And ever Sir Tristram spake fair and said little.</a>
<a id='line_14157'>But when Sir Palomides saw the falling of sickness of Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_14158'>then was he heavy for him, and comforted him in all the best wise he</a>
<a id='line_14159'>could. And as the French book saith, there came forty knights to Sir</a>
<a id='line_14160'>Darras that were of his own kin, and they would have slain Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_14161'>and his two fellows, but Sir Darras would not suffer that, but kept</a>
<a id='line_14162'>them in prison, and meat and drink they had. So Sir Tristram endured</a>
<a id='line_14163'>there great pain, for sickness had undertaken him, and that is the</a>
<a id='line_14164'>greatest pain a prisoner may have. For all the while a prisoner may</a>
<a id='line_14165'>have his health of body he may endure under the mercy of God and in</a>
<a id='line_14166'>hope of good deliverance; but when sickness toucheth a prisoner’s body,</a>
<a id='line_14167'>then may a prisoner say all wealth is him bereft, and then he hath</a>
<a id='line_14168'>cause to wail and to weep. Right so did Sir Tristram when sickness had</a>
<a id='line_14169'>undertaken him, for then he took such sorrow that he had almost slain</a>
<a id='line_14170'>himself.</a>
<a id='line_14171'></a>
<a id='line_14172'></a>
<a id='line_14173'></a>
<a id='line_14174'>CHAPTER XXXVII. How King Mark was sorry for the good renown of Sir</a>
<a id='line_14175'>Tristram. Some of King Arthur’s knights jousted with knights of</a>
<a id='line_14176'>Cornwall.</a>
<a id='line_14177'></a>
<a id='line_14178'>Now will we speak, and leave Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_14179'>Dinadan in prison, and speak we of other knights that sought after Sir</a>
<a id='line_14180'>Tristram many divers parts of this land. And some yede into Cornwall;</a>
<a id='line_14181'>and by adventure Sir Gaheris, nephew unto King Arthur, came unto King</a>
<a id='line_14182'>Mark, and there he was well received and sat at King Mark’s own table</a>
<a id='line_14183'>and ate of his own mess. Then King Mark asked Sir Gaheris what tidings</a>
<a id='line_14184'>there were in the realm of Logris. Sir, said Sir Gaheris, the king</a>
<a id='line_14185'>reigneth as a noble knight; and now but late there was a great jousts</a>
<a id='line_14186'>and tournament as ever I saw any in the realm of Logris, and the most</a>
<a id='line_14187'>noble knights were at that jousts. But there was one knight that did</a>
<a id='line_14188'>marvellously three days, and he bare a black shield, and of all knights</a>
<a id='line_14189'>that ever I saw he proved the best knight. Then, said King Mark, that</a>
<a id='line_14190'>was Sir Launcelot, or Sir Palomides the paynim. Not so, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14191'>Gheris, for both Sir Launcelot and Sir Palomides were on the contrary</a>
<a id='line_14192'>party against the Knight with the Black Shield. Then was it Sir</a>
<a id='line_14193'>Tristram, said the king. Yea, said Sir Gaheris. And therewithal the</a>
<a id='line_14194'>king smote down his head, and in his heart he feared sore that Sir</a>
<a id='line_14195'>Tristram should get him such worship in the realm of Logris</a>
<a id='line_14196'>wherethrough that he himself should not be able to withstand him. Thus</a>
<a id='line_14197'>Sir Gaheris had great cheer with King Mark, and with Queen La Beale</a>
<a id='line_14198'>Isoud, the which was glad of Sir Gaheris’ words; for well she wist by</a>
<a id='line_14199'>his deeds and manners that it was Sir Tristram. And then the king made</a>
<a id='line_14200'>a feast royal, and to that feast came Sir Uwaine le Fise de Roy Ureine,</a>
<a id='line_14201'>and some called him Uwaine le Blanchemains. And this Sir Uwaine</a>
<a id='line_14202'>challenged all the knights of Cornwall. Then was the king wood wroth</a>
<a id='line_14203'>that he had no knights to answer him. Then Sir Andred, nephew unto King</a>
<a id='line_14204'>Mark, leapt up and said: I will encounter with Sir Uwaine. Then he yede</a>
<a id='line_14205'>and armed him and horsed him in the best manner. And there Sir Uwaine</a>
<a id='line_14206'>met with Sir Andred, and smote him down that he swooned on the earth.</a>
<a id='line_14207'>Then was King Mark sorry and wroth out of measure that he had no knight</a>
<a id='line_14208'>to revenge his nephew, Sir Andred.</a>
<a id='line_14209'></a>
<a id='line_14210'>So the king called unto him Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, and prayed him</a>
<a id='line_14211'>for his sake to take upon him to joust with Sir Uwaine. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14212'>Dinas, I am full loath to have ado with any knight of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_14213'>Yet, said the king, for my love take upon thee to joust. So Sir Dinas</a>
<a id='line_14214'>made him ready, and anon they encountered together with great spears,</a>
<a id='line_14215'>but Sir Dinas was overthrown, horse and man, a great fall. Who was</a>
<a id='line_14216'>wroth but King Mark! Alas, he said, have I no knight that will</a>
<a id='line_14217'>encounter with yonder knight? Sir, said Sir Gaheris, for your sake I</a>
<a id='line_14218'>will joust. So Sir Gaheris made him ready, and when he was armed he</a>
<a id='line_14219'>rode into the field. And when Sir Uwaine saw Sir Gaheris’ shield he</a>
<a id='line_14220'>rode to him and said: Sir, ye do not your part. For, sir, the first</a>
<a id='line_14221'>time ye were made Knight of the Round Table ye sware that ye should not</a>
<a id='line_14222'>have ado with your fellowship wittingly. And pardie, Sir Gaheris, ye</a>
<a id='line_14223'>knew me well enough by my shield, and so do I know you by your shield,</a>
<a id='line_14224'>and though ye would break your oath I would not break mine; for there</a>
<a id='line_14225'>is not one here, nor ye, that shall think I am afeard of you, but I</a>
<a id='line_14226'>durst right well have ado with you, and yet we be sisters’ sons. Then</a>
<a id='line_14227'>was Sir Gaheris ashamed, and so therewithal every knight went their</a>
<a id='line_14228'>way, and Sir Uwaine rode into the country.</a>
<a id='line_14229'></a>
<a id='line_14230'>Then King Mark armed him, and took his horse and his spear, with a</a>
<a id='line_14231'>squire with him. And then he rode afore Sir Uwaine, and suddenly at a</a>
<a id='line_14232'>gap he ran upon him as he that was not ware of him, and there he smote</a>
<a id='line_14233'>him almost through the body, and there left him. So within a while</a>
<a id='line_14234'>there came Sir Kay and found Sir Uwaine, and asked him how he was hurt.</a>
<a id='line_14235'>I wot not, said Sir Uwaine, why nor wherefore, but by treason I am sure</a>
<a id='line_14236'>I gat this hurt; for here came a knight suddenly upon me or that I was</a>
<a id='line_14237'>ware, and suddenly hurt me. Then there was come Sir Andred to seek King</a>
<a id='line_14238'>Mark. Thou traitor knight, said Sir Kay, an I wist it were thou that</a>
<a id='line_14239'>thus traitorly hast hurt this noble knight thou shouldst never pass my</a>
<a id='line_14240'>hands. Sir, said Sir Andred, I did never hurt him, and that I will</a>
<a id='line_14241'>report me to himself. Fie on you false knight, said Sir Kay, for ye of</a>
<a id='line_14242'>Cornwall are nought worth. So Sir Kay made carry Sir Uwaine to the</a>
<a id='line_14243'>Abbey of the Black Cross, and there he was healed. And then Sir Gaheris</a>
<a id='line_14244'>took his leave of King Mark, but or he departed he said: Sir king, ye</a>
<a id='line_14245'>did a foul shame unto you and your court, when ye banished Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_14246'>out of this country, for ye needed not to have doubted no knight an he</a>
<a id='line_14247'>had been here. And so he departed.</a>

<a id='line_14249'></a>
<a id='line_14250'></a>
<a id='line_14251'>CHAPTER XXVIII. Of the treason of King Mark, and how Sir Gaheris smote</a>
<a id='line_14252'>him down and Andred his cousin.</a>
<a id='line_14253'></a>
<a id='line_14254'>Then there came Sir Kay, the Seneschal, unto King Mark, and there he</a>
<a id='line_14255'>had good cheer showing outward. Now, fair lords, said he, will ye prove</a>
<a id='line_14256'>any adventure in the forest of Morris, in the which I know well is as</a>
<a id='line_14257'>hard an adventure as I know any. Sir, said Sir Kay, I will prove it.</a>
<a id='line_14258'>And Sir Gaheris said he would be avised for King Mark was ever full of</a>
<a id='line_14259'>treason: and therewithal Sir Gaheris departed and rode his way. And by</a>
<a id='line_14260'>the same way that Sir Kay should ride he laid him down to rest,</a>
<a id='line_14261'>charging his squire to wait upon Sir Kay; And warn me when he cometh.</a>
<a id='line_14262'>So within a while Sir Kay came riding that way, and then Sir Gaheris</a>
<a id='line_14263'>took his horse and met him, and said: Sir Kay, ye are not wise to ride</a>
<a id='line_14264'>at the request of King Mark, for he dealeth all with treason. Then said</a>
<a id='line_14265'>Sir Kay: I require you let us prove this adventure. I shall not fail</a>
<a id='line_14266'>you, said Sir Gaheris. And so they rode that time till a lake that was</a>
<a id='line_14267'>that time called the Perilous Lake, and there they abode under the shaw</a>
<a id='line_14268'>of the wood.</a>
<a id='line_14269'></a>
<a id='line_14270'>The meanwhile King Mark within the castle of Tintagil avoided all his</a>
<a id='line_14271'>barons, and all other save such as were privy with him were avoided out</a>
<a id='line_14272'>of his chamber. And then he let call his nephew Sir Andred, and bade</a>
<a id='line_14273'>arm him and horse him lightly; and by that time it was midnight. And so</a>
<a id='line_14274'>King Mark was armed in black, horse and all; and so at a privy postern</a>
<a id='line_14275'>they two issued out with their varlets with them, and rode till they</a>
<a id='line_14276'>came to that lake. Then Sir Kay espied them first, and gat his spear,</a>
<a id='line_14277'>and proffered to joust. And King Mark rode against him, and smote each</a>
<a id='line_14278'>other full hard, for the moon shone as the bright day. And there at</a>
<a id='line_14279'>that jousts Sir Kay’s horse fell down, for his horse was not so big as</a>
<a id='line_14280'>the king’s horse, and Sir Kay’s horse bruised him full sore. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_14281'>Gaheris was wroth that Sir Kay had a fall. Then he cried: Knight, sit</a>
<a id='line_14282'>thou fast in thy saddle, for I will revenge my fellow. Then King Mark</a>
<a id='line_14283'>was afeard of Sir Gaheris, and so with evil will King Mark rode against</a>
<a id='line_14284'>him, and Sir Gaheris gave him such a stroke that he fell down. So then</a>
<a id='line_14285'>forthwithal Sir Gaheris ran unto Sir Andred and smote him from his</a>
<a id='line_14286'>horse quite, that his helm smote in the earth, and nigh had broken his</a>
<a id='line_14287'>neck. And therewithal Sir Gaheris alighted, and gat up Sir Kay. And</a>
<a id='line_14288'>then they yode both on foot to them, and bade them yield them, and tell</a>
<a id='line_14289'>their names outher they should die. Then with great pain Sir Andred</a>
<a id='line_14290'>spake first, and said: It is King Mark of Cornwall, therefore be ye</a>
<a id='line_14291'>ware what ye do, and I am Sir Andred, his cousin. Fie on you both, said</a>
<a id='line_14292'>Sir Gaheris, for a false traitor, and false treason hast thou wrought</a>
<a id='line_14293'>and he both, under the feigned cheer that ye made us! it were pity,</a>
<a id='line_14294'>said Sir Gaheris, that thou shouldst live any longer. Save my life,</a>
<a id='line_14295'>said King Mark, and I will make amends; and consider that I am a king</a>
<a id='line_14296'>anointed. It were the more shame, said Sir Gaheris, to save thy life;</a>
<a id='line_14297'>thou art a king anointed with cream, and therefore thou shouldst hold</a>
<a id='line_14298'>with all men of worship; and therefore thou art worthy to die. With</a>
<a id='line_14299'>that he lashed at King Mark without saying any more, and covered him</a>
<a id='line_14300'>with his shield and defended him as he might. And then Sir Kay lashed</a>
<a id='line_14301'>at Sir Andred, and therewithal King Mark yielded him unto Sir Gaheris.</a>
<a id='line_14302'>And then he kneeled adown, and made his oath upon the cross of the</a>
<a id='line_14303'>sword, that never while he lived he would be against errant-knights.</a>
<a id='line_14304'>And also he sware to be good friend unto Sir Tristram if ever he came</a>
<a id='line_14305'>into Cornwall.</a>
<a id='line_14306'></a>
<a id='line_14307'>By then Sir Andred was on the earth, and Sir Kay would have slain him.</a>
<a id='line_14308'>Let be, said Sir Gaheris, slay him not I pray you. It were pity, said</a>
<a id='line_14309'>Sir Kay, that he should live any longer, for this is nigh cousin unto</a>
<a id='line_14310'>Sir Tristram, and ever he hath been a traitor unto him, and by him he</a>
<a id='line_14311'>was exiled out of Cornwall, and therefore I will slay him, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14312'>Kay. Ye shall not, said Sir Gaheris; sithen I have given the king his</a>
<a id='line_14313'>life, I pray you give him his life. And therewithal Sir Kay let him go.</a>
<a id='line_14314'>And so Sir Kay and Sir Gaheris rode their way unto Dinas, the</a>
<a id='line_14315'>Seneschal, for because they heard say that he loved well Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_14316'>So they reposed them there, and soon after they rode unto the realm of</a>
<a id='line_14317'>Logris. And so within a little while they met with Sir Launcelot that</a>
<a id='line_14318'>always had Dame Bragwaine with him, to that intent he weened to have</a>
<a id='line_14319'>met the sooner with Sir Tristram; and Sir Launcelot asked what tidings</a>
<a id='line_14320'>in Cornwall, and whether they heard of Sir Tristram or not. Sir Kay and</a>
<a id='line_14321'>Sir Gaheris answered and said, that they heard not of him. Then they</a>
<a id='line_14322'>told Sir Launcelot word by word of their adventure. Then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_14323'>smiled and said: Hard it is to take out of the flesh that is bred in</a>
<a id='line_14324'>the bone; and so made them merry together.</a>
<a id='line_14325'></a>
<a id='line_14326'></a>
<a id='line_14327'></a>
<a id='line_14328'>CHAPTER XIX. How after that Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_14329'>Dinadan had been long in prison they were delivered.</a>
<a id='line_14330'></a>
<a id='line_14331'>Now leave we off this tale, and speak we of Sir Dinas that had within</a>
<a id='line_14332'>the castle a paramour, and she loved another knight better than him.</a>
<a id='line_14333'>And so when Sir Dinas went out a-hunting she slipped down by a towel,</a>
<a id='line_14334'>and took with her two brachets, and so she yede to the knight that she</a>
<a id='line_14335'>loved, and he her again. And when Sir Dinas came home and missed his</a>
<a id='line_14336'>paramour and his brachets, then was he the more wrother for his</a>
<a id='line_14337'>brachets than for the lady. So then he rode after the knight that had</a>
<a id='line_14338'>his paramour, and bade him turn and joust. So Sir Dinas smote him down,</a>
<a id='line_14339'>that with the fall he brake his leg and his arm. And then his lady and</a>
<a id='line_14340'>paramour cried Sir Dinas mercy, and said she would love him better than</a>
<a id='line_14341'>ever she did. Nay, said Sir Dinas, I shall never trust them that once</a>
<a id='line_14342'>betrayed me, and therefore, as ye have begun, so end, for I will never</a>
<a id='line_14343'>meddle with you. And so Sir Dinas departed, and took his brachets with</a>
<a id='line_14344'>him, and so rode to his castle.</a>
<a id='line_14345'></a>
<a id='line_14346'>Now will we turn unto Sir Launcelot, that was right heavy that he could</a>
<a id='line_14347'>never hear no tidings of Sir Tristram, for all this while he was in</a>
<a id='line_14348'>prison with Sir Darras, Palomides, and Dinadan. Then Dame Bragwaine</a>
<a id='line_14349'>took her leave to go into Cornwall, and Sir Launcelot, Sir Kay, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_14350'>Gaheris rode to seek Sir Tristram in the country of Surluse.</a>
<a id='line_14351'></a>
<a id='line_14352'>Now speaketh this tale of Sir Tristram and of his two fellows, for</a>
<a id='line_14353'>every day Sir Palomides brawled and said language against Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_14354'>I marvel, said Sir Dinadan, of thee, Sir Palomides, an thou haddest Sir</a>
<a id='line_14355'>Tristram here thou wouldst do him no harm; for an a wolf and a sheep</a>
<a id='line_14356'>were together in a prison the wolf would suffer the sheep to be in</a>
<a id='line_14357'>peace. And wit thou well, said Sir Dinadan, this same is Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_14358'>at a word, and now must thou do thy best with him, and let see now if</a>
<a id='line_14359'>ye can skift it with your hands. Then was Sir Palomides abashed and</a>
<a id='line_14360'>said little. Sir Palomides, then said Sir Tristram, I have heard much</a>
<a id='line_14361'>of your maugre against me, but I will not meddle with you as at this</a>
<a id='line_14362'>time by my will, because I dread the lord of this place that hath us in</a>
<a id='line_14363'>governance; for an I dread him not more than I do thee, soon it should</a>
<a id='line_14364'>be skift: so they peaced themself. Right so came in a damosel and said:</a>
<a id='line_14365'>Knights, be of good cheer, for ye are sure of your lives, and that I</a>
<a id='line_14366'>heard say my lord, Sir Darras. Then were they glad all three, for daily</a>
<a id='line_14367'>they weened they should have died.</a>
<a id='line_14368'></a>
<a id='line_14369'>Then soon after this Sir Tristram fell sick that he weened to have</a>
<a id='line_14370'>died; then Sir Dinadan wept, and so did Sir Palomides under them both</a>
<a id='line_14371'>making great sorrow. So a damosel came in to them and found them</a>
<a id='line_14372'>mourning. Then she went unto Sir Darras, and told him how that mighty</a>
<a id='line_14373'>knight that bare the black shield was likely to die. That shall not be,</a>
<a id='line_14374'>said Sir Darras, for God defend when knights come to me for succour</a>
<a id='line_14375'>that I should suffer them to die within my prison. Therefore, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14376'>Darras to the damosel, fetch that knight and his fellows afore me. And</a>
<a id='line_14377'>then anon Sir Darras saw Sir Tristram brought afore him. He said: Sir</a>
<a id='line_14378'>knight, me repenteth of thy sickness for thou art called a full noble</a>
<a id='line_14379'>knight, and so it seemeth by thee; and wit ye well it shall never be</a>
<a id='line_14380'>said that Sir Darras shall destroy such a noble knight as thou art in</a>
<a id='line_14381'>prison, howbeit that thou hast slain three of my sons whereby I was</a>
<a id='line_14382'>greatly aggrieved. But now shalt thou go and thy fellows, and your</a>
<a id='line_14383'>harness and horses have been fair and clean kept, and ye shall go where</a>
<a id='line_14384'>it liketh you, upon this covenant, that thou, knight, wilt promise me</a>
<a id='line_14385'>to be good friend to my sons two that be now alive, and also that thou</a>
<a id='line_14386'>tell me thy name. Sir, said he, as for me my name is Sir Tristram de</a>
<a id='line_14387'>Liones, and in Cornwall was I born, and nephew I am unto King Mark. And</a>
<a id='line_14388'>as for the death of your sons I might not do withal, for an they had</a>
<a id='line_14389'>been the next kin that I have I might have done none otherwise. And if</a>
<a id='line_14390'>I had slain them by treason or treachery I had been worthy to have</a>
<a id='line_14391'>died. All this I consider, said Sir Darras, that all that ye did was by</a>
<a id='line_14392'>force of knighthood, and that was the cause I would not put you to</a>
<a id='line_14393'>death. But sith ye be Sir Tristram, the good knight, I pray you</a>
<a id='line_14394'>heartily to be my good friend and to my sons. Sir, said Sir Tristram, I</a>
<a id='line_14395'>promise you by the faith of my body, ever while I live I will do you</a>
<a id='line_14396'>service, for ye have done to us but as a natural knight ought to do.</a>
<a id='line_14397'>Then Sir Tristram reposed him there till that he was amended of his</a>
<a id='line_14398'>sickness; and when he was big and strong they took their leave, and</a>
<a id='line_14399'>every knight took their horses, and so departed and rode together till</a>
<a id='line_14400'>they came to a cross way. Now fellows, said Sir Tristram, here will we</a>
<a id='line_14401'>depart in sundry ways. And because Sir Dinadan had the first adventure</a>
<a id='line_14402'>of him I will begin.</a>
<a id='line_14403'></a>
<a id='line_14404'></a>
<a id='line_14405'></a>
<a id='line_14406'>CHAPTER XL. How Sir Dinadan rescued a lady from Sir Breuse Saunce Pité,</a>
<a id='line_14407'>and how Sir Tristram received a shield of Morgan le Fay.</a>
<a id='line_14408'></a>
<a id='line_14409'>So as Sir Dinadan rode by a well he found a lady making great dole.</a>
<a id='line_14410'>What aileth you? said Sir Dinadan. Sir knight, said the lady, I am the</a>
<a id='line_14411'>wofullest lady of the world, for within these five days here came a</a>
<a id='line_14412'>knight called Sir Breuse Saunce Pité, and he slew mine own brother, and</a>
<a id='line_14413'>ever since he hath kept me at his own will, and of all men in the world</a>
<a id='line_14414'>I hate him most; and therefore I require you of knighthood to avenge</a>
<a id='line_14415'>me, for he will not tarry, but be here anon. Let him come, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14416'>Dinadan, and because of honour of all women I will do my part. With</a>
<a id='line_14417'>this came Sir Breuse, and when he saw a knight with his lady he was</a>
<a id='line_14418'>wood wroth. And then he said: Sir knight, keep thee from me. So they</a>
<a id='line_14419'>hurtled together as thunder, and either smote other passing sore, but</a>
<a id='line_14420'>Sir Dinadan put him through the shoulder a grievous wound, and or ever</a>
<a id='line_14421'>Sir Dinadan might turn him Sir Breuse was gone and fled. Then the lady</a>
<a id='line_14422'>prayed him to bring her to a castle there beside but four mile thence;</a>
<a id='line_14423'>and so Sir Dinadan brought her there, and she was welcome, for the lord</a>
<a id='line_14424'>of that castle was her uncle; and so Sir Dinadan rode his way upon his</a>
<a id='line_14425'>adventure.</a>
<a id='line_14426'></a>
<a id='line_14427'>Now turn we this tale unto Sir Tristram, that by adventure he came to a</a>
<a id='line_14428'>castle to ask lodging, wherein was Queen Morgan le Fay; and so when Sir</a>
<a id='line_14429'>Tristram was let into that castle he had good cheer all that night. And</a>
<a id='line_14430'>upon the morn when he would have departed the queen said: Wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_14431'>ye shall not depart lightly, for ye are here as a prisoner. Jesu</a>
<a id='line_14432'>defend! said Sir Tristram, for I was but late a prisoner. Fair knight,</a>
<a id='line_14433'>said the queen, ye shall abide with me till that I wit what ye are and</a>
<a id='line_14434'>from whence ye come. And ever the queen would set Sir Tristram on her</a>
<a id='line_14435'>own side, and her paramour on the other side. And ever Queen Morgan</a>
<a id='line_14436'>would behold Sir Tristram, and thereat the knight was jealous, and was</a>
<a id='line_14437'>in will suddenly to have run upon Sir Tristram with a sword, but he</a>
<a id='line_14438'>left it for shame. Then the queen said to Sir Tristram: Tell me thy</a>
<a id='line_14439'>name, and I shall suffer you to depart when ye will. Upon that covenant</a>
<a id='line_14440'>I tell you my name is Sir Tristram de Liones. Ah, said Morgan le Fay,</a>
<a id='line_14441'>an I had wist that, thou shouldst not have departed so soon as thou</a>
<a id='line_14442'>shalt. But sithen I have made a promise I will hold it, with that thou</a>
<a id='line_14443'>wilt promise me to bear upon thee a shield that I shall deliver thee,</a>
<a id='line_14444'>unto the castle of the Hard Rock, where King Arthur had cried a great</a>
<a id='line_14445'>tournament, and there I pray you that ye will be, and to do for me as</a>
<a id='line_14446'>much deeds of arms as ye may do. For at the Castle of Maidens, Sir</a>
<a id='line_14447'>Tristram, ye did marvellous deeds of arms as ever I heard knight do.</a>
<a id='line_14448'>Madam, said Sir Tristram, let me see the shield that I shall bear. Then</a>
<a id='line_14449'>the shield was brought forth, and the field was goldish, with a king</a>
<a id='line_14450'>and a queen therein painted, and a knight standing above them, [one</a>
<a id='line_14451'>foot] upon the king’s head, and the other upon the queen’s. Madam, said</a>
<a id='line_14452'>Sir Tristram, this is a fair shield and a mighty; but what signifieth</a>
<a id='line_14453'>this king and this queen, and the knight standing upon both their</a>
<a id='line_14454'>heads? I shall tell you, said Morgan le Fay, it signifieth King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_14455'>and Queen Guenever, and a knight who holdeth them both in bondage and</a>
<a id='line_14456'>in servage. Who is that knight? said Sir Tristram. That shall ye not</a>
<a id='line_14457'>wit as at this time, said the queen. But as the French book saith,</a>
<a id='line_14458'>Queen Morgan loved Sir Launcelot best, and ever she desired him, and he</a>
<a id='line_14459'>would never love her nor do nothing at her request, and therefore she</a>
<a id='line_14460'>held many knights together for to have taken him by strength. And</a>
<a id='line_14461'>because she deemed that Sir Launcelot loved Queen Guenever paramour,</a>
<a id='line_14462'>and she him again, therefore Queen Morgan le Fay ordained that shield</a>
<a id='line_14463'>to put Sir Launcelot to a rebuke, to that intent that King Arthur might</a>
<a id='line_14464'>understand the love between them. Then Sir Tristram took that shield</a>
<a id='line_14465'>and promised her to bear it at the tournament at the Castle of the Hard</a>
<a id='line_14466'>Rock. But Sir Tristram knew not that that shield was ordained against</a>
<a id='line_14467'>Sir Launcelot, but afterward he knew it.</a>
<a id='line_14468'></a>
<a id='line_14469'></a>

<a id='line_14471'>CHAPTER XLI. How Sir Tristram took with him the shield, and also how he</a>
<a id='line_14472'>slew the paramour of Morgan le Fay.</a>
<a id='line_14473'></a>
<a id='line_14474'>So then Sir Tristram took his leave of the queen, and took the shield</a>
<a id='line_14475'>with him. Then came the knight that held Queen Morgan le Fay, his name</a>
<a id='line_14476'>was Sir Hemison, and he made him ready to follow Sir Tristram. Fair</a>
<a id='line_14477'>friend, said Morgan, ride not after that knight, for ye shall not win</a>
<a id='line_14478'>no worship of him. Fie on him, coward, said Sir Hemison, for I wist</a>
<a id='line_14479'>never good knight come out of Cornwall but if it were Sir Tristram de</a>
<a id='line_14480'>Liones. What an that be he? said she. Nay, nay, said he, he is with La</a>
<a id='line_14481'>Beale Isoud, and this is but a daffish knight. Alas, my fair friend, ye</a>
<a id='line_14482'>shall find him the best knight that ever ye met withal, for I know him</a>
<a id='line_14483'>better than ye do. For your sake, said Sir Hemison, I shall slay him.</a>
<a id='line_14484'>Ah, fair friend, said the queen, me repenteth that ye will follow that</a>
<a id='line_14485'>knight, for I fear me sore of your again coming. With this this knight</a>
<a id='line_14486'>rode his way wood wroth, and he rode after Sir Tristram as fast as he</a>
<a id='line_14487'>had been chased with knights. When Sir Tristram heard a knight come</a>
<a id='line_14488'>after him so fast he returned about, and saw a knight coming against</a>
<a id='line_14489'>him. And when he came nigh to Sir Tristram he cried on high: Sir</a>
<a id='line_14490'>knight, keep thee from me. Then they rushed together as it had been</a>
<a id='line_14491'>thunder, and Sir Hemison brised his spear upon Sir Tristram, but his</a>
<a id='line_14492'>harness was so good that he might not hurt him. And Sir Tristram smote</a>
<a id='line_14493'>him harder, and bare him through the body, and he fell over his horse’s</a>
<a id='line_14494'>croup. Then Sir Tristram turned to have done more with his sword, but</a>
<a id='line_14495'>he saw so much blood go from him that him seemed he was likely to die,</a>
<a id='line_14496'>and so he departed from him and came to a fair manor to an old knight,</a>
<a id='line_14497'>and there Sir Tristram lodged.</a>

<a id='line_14502'>Tristram praised Sir Launcelot and his kin.</a>
<a id='line_14503'></a>
<a id='line_14504'>Now leave to speak of Sir Tristram, and speak we of the knight that was</a>
<a id='line_14505'>wounded to the death. Then his varlet alighted, and took off his helm,</a>
<a id='line_14506'>and then he asked his lord whether there were any life in him. There is</a>
<a id='line_14507'>in me life, said the knight, but it is but little; and therefore leap</a>
<a id='line_14508'>thou up behind me when thou hast holpen me up, and hold me fast that I</a>
<a id='line_14509'>fall not, and bring me to Queen Morgan le Fay; for deep draughts of</a>
<a id='line_14510'>death draw to my heart that I may not live, for I would fain speak with</a>
<a id='line_14511'>her or I died: for else my soul will be in great peril an I die.</a>
<a id='line_14512'>For[thwith] with great pain his varlet brought him to the castle, and</a>
<a id='line_14513'>there Sir Hemison fell down dead. When Morgan le Fay saw him dead she</a>
<a id='line_14514'>made great sorrow out of reason; and then she let despoil him unto his</a>
<a id='line_14515'>shirt, and so she let him put into a tomb. And about the tomb she let</a>
<a id='line_14516'>write: Here lieth Sir Hemison, slain by the hands of Sir Tristram de</a>
<a id='line_14517'>Liones.</a>
<a id='line_14518'></a>
<a id='line_14519'>Now turn we unto Sir Tristram, that asked the knight his host if he saw</a>
<a id='line_14520'>late any knights adventurous. Sir, he said, the last night here lodged</a>
<a id='line_14521'>with me Ector de Maris and a damosel with him, and that damosel told me</a>
<a id='line_14522'>that he was one of the best knights of the world. That is not so, said</a>
<a id='line_14523'>Sir Tristram, for I know four better knights of his own blood, and the</a>
<a id='line_14524'>first is Sir Launcelot du Lake, call him the best knight, and Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_14525'>de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis, Sir Blamore de Ganis, and Sir Gaheris. Nay,</a>
<a id='line_14526'>said his host, Sir Gawaine is a better knight than he. That is not so,</a>
<a id='line_14527'>said Sir Tristram, for I have met with them both, and I felt Sir</a>
<a id='line_14528'>Gaheris for the better knight, and Sir Lamorak I call him as good as</a>
<a id='line_14529'>any of them except Sir Launcelot. Why name ye not Sir Tristram? said</a>
<a id='line_14530'>his host, for I account him as good as any of them. I know not Sir</a>
<a id='line_14531'>Tristram, said Tristram. Thus they talked and bourded as long as them</a>
<a id='line_14532'>list, and then went to rest. And on the morn Sir Tristram departed, and</a>
<a id='line_14533'>took his leave of his host, and rode toward the Roche Dure, and none</a>
<a id='line_14534'>adventure had Sir Tristram but that; and so he rested not till he came</a>
<a id='line_14535'>to the castle, where he saw five hundred tents.</a>
<a id='line_14536'></a>
<a id='line_14537'></a>
<a id='line_14538'></a>
<a id='line_14539'>CHAPTER XLIII. How Sir Tristram at a tournament bare the shield that</a>
<a id='line_14540'>Morgan le Fay delivered to him.</a>
<a id='line_14541'></a>
<a id='line_14542'>Then the King of Scots and the King of Ireland held against King</a>
<a id='line_14543'>Arthur’s knights, and there began a great medley. So came in Sir</a>
<a id='line_14544'>Tristram and did marvellous deeds of arms, for there he smote down many</a>
<a id='line_14545'>knights. And ever he was afore King Arthur with that shield. And when</a>
<a id='line_14546'>King Arthur saw that shield he marvelled greatly in what intent it was</a>
<a id='line_14547'>made; but Queen Guenever deemed as it was, wherefore she was heavy.</a>
<a id='line_14548'>Then was there a damosel of Queen Morgan in a chamber by King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_14549'>and when she heard King Arthur speak of that shield, then she spake</a>
<a id='line_14550'>openly unto King Arthur. Sir King, wit ye well this shield was ordained</a>
<a id='line_14551'>for you, to warn you of your shame and dishonour, and that longeth to</a>
<a id='line_14552'>you and your queen. And then anon that damosel picked her away privily,</a>
<a id='line_14553'>that no man wist where she was become. Then was King Arthur sad and</a>
<a id='line_14554'>wroth, and asked from whence came that damosel. There was not one that</a>
<a id='line_14555'>knew her nor wist where she was become. Then Queen Guenever called to</a>
<a id='line_14556'>her Sir Ector de Maris, and there she made her complaint to him, and</a>
<a id='line_14557'>said: I wot well this shield was made by Morgan le Fay in despite of me</a>
<a id='line_14558'>and of Sir Launcelot, wherefore I dread me sore lest I should be</a>
<a id='line_14559'>destroyed. And ever the king beheld Sir Tristram, that did so</a>
<a id='line_14560'>marvellous deeds of arms that he wondered sore what knight he might be,</a>
<a id='line_14561'>and well he wist it was not Sir Launcelot. And it was told him that Sir</a>
<a id='line_14562'>Tristram was in Petit Britain with Isoud la Blanche Mains, for he</a>
<a id='line_14563'>deemed, an he had been in the realm of Logris, Sir Launcelot or some of</a>
<a id='line_14564'>his fellows that were in the quest of Sir Tristram that they should</a>
<a id='line_14565'>have found him or that time. So King Arthur had marvel what knight he</a>
<a id='line_14566'>might be. And ever Sir Arthur’s eye was on that shield. All that espied</a>
<a id='line_14567'>the queen, and that made her sore afeard.</a>
<a id='line_14568'></a>
<a id='line_14569'>Then ever Sir Tristram smote down knights wonderly to behold, what upon</a>
<a id='line_14570'>the right hand and upon the left hand, that unnethe no knight might</a>
<a id='line_14571'>withstand him. And the King of Scots and the King of Ireland began to</a>
<a id='line_14572'>withdraw them. When Arthur espied that, he thought that that knight</a>
<a id='line_14573'>with the strange shield should not escape him. Then he called unto him</a>
<a id='line_14574'>Sir Uwaine le Blanche Mains, and bade him arm him and make him ready.</a>
<a id='line_14575'>So anon King Arthur and Sir Uwaine dressed them before Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_14576'>and required him to tell them where he had that shield. Sir, he said, I</a>
<a id='line_14577'>had it of Queen Morgan le Fay, sister unto King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_14578'></a>
<a id='line_14579'> So here endeth this history of this book, for it is the first book of</a>
<a id='line_14580'> Sir Tristram de Liones and the second book of Sir Tristram followeth.</a>
