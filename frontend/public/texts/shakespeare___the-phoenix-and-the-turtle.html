                    <a id='line_0'>THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'></a>
<a id='line_4'>Let the bird of loudest lay,</a>
<a id='line_5'>On the sole Arabian tree,</a>
<a id='line_6'>Herald sad and trumpet be,</a>
<a id='line_7'>To whose sound chaste wings obey.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>But thou shrieking harbinger,</a>
<a id='line_10'>Foul precurrer of the fiend,</a>
<a id='line_11'>Augur of the fever’s end,</a>
<a id='line_12'>To this troop come thou not near.</a>
<a id='line_13'></a>
<a id='line_14'>From this session interdict</a>
<a id='line_15'>Every fowl of tyrant wing,</a>
<a id='line_16'>Save the eagle, feather’d king;</a>
<a id='line_17'>Keep the obsequy so strict.</a>
<a id='line_18'></a>
<a id='line_19'>Let the priest in surplice white,</a>
<a id='line_20'>That defunctive music can,</a>
<a id='line_21'>Be the death-divining swan,</a>
<a id='line_22'>Lest the requiem lack his right.</a>
<a id='line_23'></a>
<a id='line_24'>And thou treble-dated crow,</a>
<a id='line_25'>That thy sable gender mak’st</a>
<a id='line_26'>With the breath thou giv’st and tak’st,</a>
<a id='line_27'>’Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.</a>
<a id='line_28'></a>
<a id='line_29'>Here the anthem doth commence:</a>
<a id='line_30'>Love and constancy is dead;</a>
<a id='line_31'>Phoenix and the turtle fled</a>
<a id='line_32'>In a mutual flame from hence.</a>
<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'>So they lov’d, as love in twain</a>
<a id='line_35'>Had the essence but in one;</a>
<a id='line_36'>Two distincts, division none:</a>
<a id='line_37'>Number there in love was slain.</a>
<a id='line_38'></a>
<a id='line_39'>Hearts remote, yet not asunder;</a>
<a id='line_40'>Distance and no space was seen</a>
<a id='line_41'>’Twixt this turtle and his queen;</a>
<a id='line_42'>But in them it were a wonder.</a>
<a id='line_43'></a>
<a id='line_44'>So between them love did shine,</a>
<a id='line_45'>That the turtle saw his right</a>
<a id='line_46'>Flaming in the phoenix’ sight;</a>
<a id='line_47'>Either was the other’s mine.</a>
<a id='line_48'></a>
<a id='line_49'>Property was thus appalled,</a>
<a id='line_50'>That the self was not the same;</a>
<a id='line_51'>Single nature’s double name</a>
<a id='line_52'>Neither two nor one was called.</a>
<a id='line_53'></a>
<a id='line_54'>Reason, in itself confounded,</a>
<a id='line_55'>Saw division grow together;</a>
<a id='line_56'>To themselves yet either neither,</a>
<a id='line_57'>Simple were so well compounded.</a>
<a id='line_58'></a>
<a id='line_59'>That it cried, How true a twain</a>
<a id='line_60'>Seemeth this concordant one!</a>
<a id='line_61'>Love hath reason, reason none,</a>
<a id='line_62'>If what parts can so remain.</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>Whereupon it made this threne</a>
<a id='line_65'>To the phoenix and the dove,</a>
<a id='line_66'>Co-supremes and stars of love,</a>
<a id='line_67'>As chorus to their tragic scene.</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'></a>
<a id='line_70'>       THRENOS</a>
<a id='line_71'></a>
<a id='line_72'>Beauty, truth, and rarity.</a>
<a id='line_73'>Grace in all simplicity,</a>
<a id='line_74'>Here enclos’d in cinders lie.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>Death is now the phoenix’ nest;</a>
<a id='line_77'>And the turtle’s loyal breast</a>
<a id='line_78'>To eternity doth rest.</a>
<a id='line_79'></a>
<a id='line_80'>Leaving no posterity:—</a>
<a id='line_81'>’Twas not their infirmity,</a>
<a id='line_82'>It was married chastity.</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>Truth may seem, but cannot be;</a>
<a id='line_85'>Beauty brag, but ’tis not she;</a>
<a id='line_86'>Truth and beauty buried be.</a>
<a id='line_87'></a>
<a id='line_88'>To this urn let those repair</a>
<a id='line_89'>That are either true or fair;</a>
<a id='line_90'>For these dead birds sigh a prayer.</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
